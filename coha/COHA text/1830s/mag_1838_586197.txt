txt We proceed to offer , in continuation of this subject , some facts and views in relation to the manufacture of cotton in the United States ,  --  which , next to the growth and exportation of this great staple , of which we treated in our March number , bears the most important relation to the prosperity of the country . Without exerting the immense and immediate influence upon our commerce and currency , which we have shown to be derived from the trade in the raw material , its manufacture , both from its extent , and the circumstances under which it has grown to its present importance , has exercised a powerful agency upon the habits and pursuits of large classes of the community , as well as upon the employment of a great amount of capital . Before the cultivation of cotton began within our territory , large quantities of this commodity were imported from Cayenne , Demarara , the West Indies , and Brazil , for the supply of our household manufactures . The general condition of poverty and pecuniary embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country subsequently to the Revolution , compelled our citizens to furnish themselves through the industry and ingenuity of their families , with many of the most necessary materials for clothing . Hand cards , spinning wheels , and looms , were regarded as ordinary and necessary articles of housekeeping , especially in agricultural districts . One after another , these implements have fallen into general disuse , as modern machines have been brought into operation in different sections of the country , and rendered it impossible for manual labor to compete with them in the several processes they perform . The carding engine first expelled hand cards-spinning jennies , frames  --  and mules then banished by degrees the old fashioned one-threaded wheel . Finally the introduction of the power loom completed the overthrow of the household manufacture of cotton , and placed the community in a state of dependence upon manufacturing establishments , either domestic or foreign . The increase of national wealth and resources by means of these labor-saving inventions has undoubtedly been very great -- though it has been questioned in other countries whether the social and moral influence produced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where these manufactures are generally carried // on , but upon the community at large , has not become so deleterious , as almost to outweigh their immense advantages as instruments of production . The discouragement to domestic industry which they have occasioned , and the contagious effects to which masses of individuals , in constant association , are peculiarly exposed , have been regarded by some philanthropists as insuperable objections to the factory system . Several of the ablest writers and best moralists in Great Britain have deeply lamented its introduction into that country , on account of the wretched and demoralized condition which it has occasioned among the operatives . Such may have been its consequences where the system has been so long and so extensively adopted ; though , of course , whatever of evil may attend its operation is to be ascribed to the operation of other causes , in the social system of the country , than to the introduction of labor-saving machinery , and the vast developement of industry and production of wealth consequent upon all such improvements . It is certain that the atrocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers of Glasgow , brought to light by judicial investigation at Edinburgh at the commencement of the present year , and which have recently been the subject of Parliamentary discussion , would indeed seem to show , that the moral restraints for which the bulk of the people of Scotland have been heretofore distinguished have become in a great degree obliterated in the manufacturing districts of that country . That portion of the population of the United States who are employed in manufactures furnish at this time , we have the strongest reason to believe , a general exception , as to many of the evils which have been ascribed to the operation of the system in Europe . Whether they shall continue to hold their present honorable position in this respect , which there appears no reason to doubt , must depend of course wholly upon themselves . We have certainly no hesitation in saying , that , if the object of being enabled to compete with our mother country in manufactures , whether for the markets of the world or for our own consumption , had to be purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of population , on which the manufacturing greatness of England has been built , we had far rather that every factory should be rased to the ground , and their operatives dispersed over the rich public domains of our West , though even at the expense of an entire ( lependence on the cheap but degraded and demoralized labor of the old world . Anxious as undoubtedly were the patriots of the early days of the Republic , to make our country independent of foreigners for the actual necessaries of life , they were deeply impressed with the great axiom of economical science , that no manufactures , uncongenial to the taste and interests of any people , can be created by legislative envol .

They were fully apprized that hot-bed cultivation w s only suited to the production of luxuries . The example of England , in the relative national importance of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation . The former had been continually fostered , from its original establishment in that country , by prohibitive duties , hut under every possible encouragement had continually involved most of those engaged in it in embarrassment and ruin , requiring new measures of relief and assistance ,  --  while on the other hand the manufacture of cotton , of which the raw material was equally a foreign production , had risen to the highest national importance , not only without factitious protection , but-in one of its most important branches-in defiance of laws made expressly for the purpose of repressing it . In 1720 an act of Parliament was passed for the encouragement of the other manufactures of the kingdom , especially those of silk , which imposed a penalty on using or wearing any printed or dyed calicoes , whether printed at home or abroad , or even any printed goods of which cotton formed any part . This law entirely destroyed the printing of cottons in England during its existence . In 1736 , by strenuous exertions , it was so far modified as to permit the using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; accordingly all English calicoes were manufactured of a mixture of linen and cotton , until 1774-when the vast importance to which the manufacture of cotton cloths had risen , in spite of the strongest legislative discouragements , compelled Parliament to repeal the prohibition . A heavy excise duty was , however , imposed upon the printing of cottons , in order to promote the consumption of the favored manufactures of silk and linen . A fuller explanation on this subject , more appropriately belongs to our future account of the growth and manufacture of cotton in foreign countries . Strenuous exertions were made by several enterprising individuals , as well as under the authority and encouragement of some of the States , before the adoption of the Constitution , to introduce into this country the machines invented in England for the manufacture of cotton , of which the importance was constantly exhibited through the abundance and cheapness with which their fabrics were afforded . These efforts , from the strictness with which the English prohibitory laws against the exportation of machinery were enfoyced , were attended with little success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be obtained . By such assistance , carding engines , spinning jennies , and spinning frames , were attempted to be constructed in Massachusetts , Rhode Island , New York , and Pennsylvania , as early as 1787 or 1788 . As an illustration of the untiring // 35 zeal with which the men of that day were actuated , in endeavouring to avert the drain of specie from the country which formed the principal remittance in payment for many kinds of foreign goods , a brief explanation of the circumstances under which the production of silk was introduced into New England about this period , may be interesting to our readers . Before the Revolution , a royal filature had been maintained in Georgia for the purpose of supplying the manufacturers of England ; but it was broken up by the war , and the production nearly destroyed in that State . Dr. Stiles , who died in 1795 , President of Yale College , turned his attention to this subject about ten years before his death . Besides being one of the most distinguished scholars and divines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound practical views , and ardent public , spirit . Having become satisfied that our ladies could gratify their taste for silks by their own care and attention , without exhausting the circulating medium of the country , he procured from time to time quantities of the seeds of the mulberry , and of the silk worm , which he distributed among the clergymen of his acquaintance , with instructions for their culture and management . In many instances little attention was probably bestowed upon the matter ; in others it appears to have been undertaken with congenial feelings . The silk which is now produced principally by the care of the women and children of a few towns in Connecticut , of the annual value of hundreds of thousands of dollars , wholly owes its origin to these praiseworthy measures of President Stiles . The present extent of this culture in that region , from so small a beginning , by the agency of such feeble appliances , may serve to furnish an additional indicationif so plain a principle of common sense could require support-that legislative encouragement can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . But to return to the manufacture of cotton . The machines constructed in this country , under the circumstances we have mentioned , in imitation of the English inventions , proved-with the exception of the spinning-jenny , the most simple of the series  --  to be almost entirely useless for any beneficial purpose . It was not until Samuel Slater , who had been bred in the mills erected in Derbyshire by Arkwright and Strutt , arrived in this country , and undertook the business , that the manufacture of cotton yarn of good quality by machinery can be fairly said to have commenced in the United St*ttes . The new machine , built under the superintendence of Mr. Slater , at Pawtucket , began to work in the course of 1791 . A brief description of the origin and operation of these remarkable inventions , may gratify the curiosity of some of our readers . The carding engine was originally invented and patented by Lewis Paul , of Birmingham , in 1748 . It was not however brought // into a practical and useful form , until various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Arkwright , who possessed extraordinary talents and judgment in combining and applying the inventive genius of others . He produced , in 1774 , a complete machine so admirably adapted for the preparation of cotton for the use of the spinner , that it has not been improved in the slightest degree to the present day . The spinning jenny was invented by James llargraves , of Blackburn , in Lancashire , in 1764 , but was not patented , nor generally known , until 1770 . This machine operates upon the same principle with the common wheel , but , instead of making a single thread , it may be constructed to spin a hundred at once . Yarn spun upon this machine can not be made of sufficient firmness and hardness for warp , but only answers for weft , and accordingly the warps used both in this country and England , while yarn was principally spun upon the jenny , were usually of linen . The spinning frame , or , as it is now called , with some recent modifications , the tbrostle , operates upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either two or three pairs of small horizontal rollers , the previously prepared sliver is extended to the required degree of tenuity by means of the increased velocity with which each successive pair revolves , when , on passing through the last pair , it is attached to a spindle and fly , revolving with great rapidity , which twist it at once into a thread of the desired hardness , and at the same time wind it upon a bobbin , in the same manner precisely as is done in spinning linen yarn upon the common footwheel used in household manufacture . This ingenious adaptation of principles previously well known , but comparatively unavailable , was patented , and brought into use , by Arkwright , in 1769 . It is , however , well established , that a patent for spinning cotton yarn by means of rollers was granted as early as 1738 , to Lewis Paul before named* upon the invention of John Wyatt ; but the invention had never been made practicable for general use , until the process had undergone material improvements from the peculiar talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture of cotton , as yarn could be spun upon it , possessing the essential qualities of evenness and firmness* in so high a degree as to entirely supersede the necessity of linen warps . The mule was introduced into this country at a subsequent period . It is a most important and c&amp;mplicated machine , combining the leading principles of the jenny and spinning frame-drawing out the prepared cotton hy means of rollers , revolving at different degrees of velocity , hike the latter , and at the same time drawing out and twisting the thread , like the former . It derives its name from this combination . The finest yarn is spun upon this machine . It was // originally invented by Samuel Crompton , of Bolton , in Lancashire , in 1779 , but has since been greatly improved by Messrs . Strutt , Roberts , and others . The self-acting mule now in use must be regarded as one of the most perfect specimens of mechanical ingenuity to be found in the circle of the arts . From the commencement of Mr. Slater 's career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was gradually and profitably extended in various sections of the United States . Free from the disturbing influence of the speculations , which inevitably excite and depress by turns all pursuits which are exposed to the vicissitudes of political measures , the general security and prosperity of the cotton manufacture , during this period of twenty years , was unquestionably greater than those of commercial business in general . The individuals engaged in this manufacture , found themselves pursuing a safe , profitable , and increasing business . Its increase was firmly based upon the actual demand for consumption , which we have shown , in our former article , to afford the only healthy stimulus to production . The seductive , but dangerous , excitement , which invariably accompanies legislative interference in the employment of individual enterprise , did not materially influence this important branch of business throughout this long interval . Duties were of course levied upon the imported fabrics , which came into competition with our cotton manufactures , but they were obviously , from their amount , imposed with the single view of raising the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general public protection . The original impost law , of fourth of July , 1789 , subjected foreign manuflictures of cotton , in common with most other articles , to a duty of only five per cent . The necessity for further revenue , led to its increase in 1790 , to seven and a half per cent . The Indian war and other public exigencies , induced an additional rate of five per cent . in 1794 . This duty of twelve and a half per cent . upon manufactures of cotton , was the sole legislative protection , under which the cotton manufacture was extended in this country , to the amount of between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand spindles . On the breaking out of the war of 1812 , the golden age of manufacturing stability and prosperity at once gave place to the capricious and ruinous fluctuations , to which this pursuit has been since subjected , even to a more destructive extent , than those to which the growth and exportation of the raw material have been exposed . The difficulties attending importation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal supply of manufactured cotton had been derived , gave to the manufacturers of this country the entire command of the market , excepting the limited amounts smuggled through Canada , and by way of Haiifax , or furnished by means of captures . This increased demand gave rise to a great // number of new establishments , in most parts of the Union , which generally afforded fair examples of the results produced every where , whenever a monopoly is enjoyed . Controlling the supply , the manufacturers were able to fix their own prices . While their nominal profits were enormous , the prodigality of their outlay , in many instances , from want of sufficient care and skill , would have totally ruined any pursuit exposed to moderate competition . Thousands of individuals engaged in the manufacture , upon borrowed capital , without adequate knowledge of the business , under the full anticipation of realizing speedy fortunes . In many cases , these sanguine hopes were blighted by their own mismanagement ; and they were at once overthrown by the news of peace , which was received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various processes of manufacture had been devised in England , which had not been introduced into this country , and which placed even those manufacturers who had conducted their business with competent judgement , in a very unfavorable position for maintaining themselves against foreign competition . rrhe power loom which had been originally invented by Dr. Cartwright , in 1785 , was in the meantime brought to great perfection , and had been rendered exceedingly important by the invention of the dressing machine-previously to which each loom required the attentioi* of a person to dress or size the warp asit was unrolled from the beam . By the skilfully adapted processes now introduced , the warps were prepared , before they were put into the loom , in such a manner as to require nothiug but general superintendence in the weaving , which enabled one female , or even child , to manage two , three , or in some cases four looms at the same time-producing with a small amount of human labor an almost incredible quantity of clotL In addition to these , great improvements had been made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonderful progress of science both in France and England . The public necessities , occasioned by the war expenditures , led to the continuation of the double duties , amounting , on manufactures of cotton , to t*venty-five per cent. , which were imposed by the Act of first July , 1812 ; until the first of July , 1816-with a provision for their prospective reduction . Before that period arrived , the Act of twentyfifth April , 1816 , subjected such manufactures to a duty of twenty-five per cent. , with a minimum , until the first of July , 1819 , when it waste be reduced to twenty per cent .  --  but which , as will be seen in the sequel , never took effect . The minimum principles as it is called , was now first introduced into our tariff legislation . By a provision of this law , all fabrics of cotton invoiced at less than*yenty-five cents per square y rd , were to be taken , in the computation of the duty imposed , to have cost that price at the place whence they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of duties was doubled and even trebled upon the cheaper and more necessary descriptions of goods . It of course amounted to an absolute prohibition upon low priced cloths , and gave the entire monopoly to the manufacturers of this country , in the production of a great portion of the cottons worn by the industrious classes . This arrangement was adopted by Congress with two distinct objects , both of which undoubtedly influenced the different parties according to their respective peculiar views ,  --  the prevention of the importation of the cheap cotton cloths of India , whither none of the raw material produced by this country was exported , and in payment for which remittances in specie had to be made to a large amount  --  and the immediate benefit of our own manufacturing establishments ,  --  the latter consid eration being naturally decisive with the North and East , while the former was doubtless mainly influential upon the South , whose Banks were in a state of suspension , which made the exportation of specie to India , and no cotton , especially odious . Under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , skill and discretion , such as the establishments at Pawtucket , Wathani , and some other places , enjoyed very large profits ; while most of those which had sprung into existence in the manner we have described , received little permanent benefit from this legislative protection , as the course of events abundantly proved . The enormous amount of currency put into circulation by the banks which were in operation soon after the war , added to the vast increase occasioned by the prodigal issues of the new Bank of the United States , gave rise , as we have mentioned in our article upon the growth of cotton , to the most extravagant speculations in every part of the Union . All classes of society seemed ready to abandon the sober pursuits of industry , for the purpose of participating in the sudden wealth apparently realized by so many fortunate individuals from the continual appreciation in the prices of commodities , occasioned by the real depreciation of the practical measure of value . As a necessary consequence , the country was flooded with imported merchandise . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of speculative enterprise . In the emphatic language of Mr. Dallas , who was Secretary of the Treasury during a considerable portion of this period of deceptive prosperity , the American market presented a general scene of gambling and ex* tortion . But the enchantments of l ) rOspective wealth were suddenly dispelled when the Bank of the United States , in the autumn of 1818 , found itself obliged to bring its operations down to the basis of sad reality . The measures adopted by the Bank , for its own preservation , were intended to produce , and actually brought about , in the course of a // few months , such a scarcity of currency that thousands of individuals holding large surplus amounts of property , estimated at the nominal valuation it had previously borne , found it impossible to comply with their engagements . Thc manufacturers of cotton , in common with all others who had adapted their business and liabilities to the precedent state of things , were at once overwhelmed with embarrassment , and many of them with destruction . The individuals whose present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisitions , was wrested from them at once by this terrible revulsion , ( lid not in those days attribute their misfortunes to the measures of the Government . A Bank of the United States , clothed with ample practical control over the currency of the country , was in full operation . In his masterly report upon banks and the currency , made to Congress in February , 1820 , Mr. Crawford shows the effect of the measu*res of the Bank of the United States , in his assertion that the active currency of the country had been reduced in a short space of time from one hundred and ten millions to forty-five millions . Yet the advocates and supporters of the Bank , who then , as now , exercised the most extensive influence over the organs of public opinion , attributed the wide spread desolation which had carried ruin into every section of the country-solely to the determination of foreigners to destroy our manufacturing industry , at whatever cost ! The source of the evils under which commerce and agriculture equally labored , in common with manufactures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of the currency , and its sudden and continued contraction , but the want of a sufficient tariff of protective duties We have examined some of the evidences of the extent of the revulsion occasioned by the management of the banks previously to and during 1819 . It will be impossible , consistently with due regard to the patience of our readers , as well as the space we can conveniently afford , to give the details which we have derived from the most authentic sources . We can not , however , suppress some brief extracts from these melancholy records . A convention of the friends of national industry was held , at New York* at the close of that year , composed of delegates from Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland and Ohio , of which , Col. Feer was chosen president , and Matthew Carey secretary ,  --  who declare in their memorial to Congress , presented on the twentieth of December , 1819 , that " our commerce is greatly pros " trated-shipping sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most parts of the country in an equal de " gree-numbers of our merchants , manufacturers , and farmers , re " duced to bankruptcy , and the circumstances of many of those who " have escaped this calamitous situation , daily impairing  --  a great // " portion of our mechanics and artists unemployed , and all the fruits " of their labours , which might have been daily adding to the pros " perity of the nation , are wholly lost . " The fountain from which these manifold evils flowed , according to this Convention , was " the " importation of foreign goods , which had destroyed order and safety " in business , discouraged enterprise , suspended labour , and excited " serious apprehensions for the peace and welfare of the country . " Such a catalogue of the destructive consequences of foreign commerce , furnished upon the solemn responsibility of indididuals some of whom were among the most respectable and influential citizens of New York and Philadelphia , will not fail to strike many of our readers with astonishment . A memorial was also presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a numerous meeting of the citizens of Pennsylvania , of which the venerable Peter S. Duponceau , of Philadelphia , was Chairman , which states that " a capitalist could then purchase in that city , with half a million of dollars , property which one year before would have readily sold for a million and an half . " The Chamber of Commerce of Philadelphia , likexvise , presented a memorial , at a subsequent period of the same year , to which they affixed a scale of the prices of flour for a series of years-from which it appears , upon their high authority , that the average price of flour in that great market was , in 1817 , twelve dollars per barrel , while in April , 1820 , its current price was four dollars seventy five cents ! These respectable citizens of Pennsylvania , who must have been fully apprized of the operations of the banks , and consequent changes in the plentifulness and relative value of currency , do not appear to have dreamed that the difficulties into which every branch of business had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alteration which had taken place in the measure of commercial value . It was wholly attributed by them , to use their own words , " to the buying of cheap goods abroad ! " It would be an easy task to fill volumes with similar evidence of the distress , prevailing in every part of the United States , during the years 1819 , 1820 , 1821 , 1822 , and 1823 . We shall content ourselves with the following extract , from the Report of the Committee of Manufactures , of the House of Representatives , made in January , 1821 . This official document states , that " it is not a common occurrence , in the history of nations , that in time of peacethe people should call upon the government to relieve their distresses . Five years of peace , on the continent of Europe , have repaired the ravages of twenty-five years of war . Five years of peace in this country have authorized the official declaration , that but few examp1cs have occurred of distress so general and severe , as that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their report , this committee quote the fact , stated by Mr. Crawford , in his report of the year pre // ceding , that the actual currency of the country had been contracted from one hundred and ten to forty-five millions , for the purpose apparently of moralizing upon it , as a severe visitation of Providencebut do not appear to have entertained the most remote idea , that the general destruction of confidence , and the ruin of thousands upon thousands of unsuspecting individuals , had been wholly caused by human agency , in effecting this vast revolution in the quantity and consequent value of the circulating medium . They sagely ascribed the universal gloom and stagnation , which overspread all the pursuits of life , to the absence of sufficient protection for our manufactures , and earnestly recommended an increase of the Tariff , as a sovereign remedy for the evils they so eloquently recapitulated . There appears to have been , during the whole of this long continued crisis , a gener* 1 concurrence of opinion , among those whose authority was most regarded at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which prevailed abroad , were the original source of the universal depression and distress which overshadowed the land . But it seems to have never occurred to any , that the relative high prices here were wholly occasioned by the inflation of our paper currency , and its consequent depreciation in actual value , compared with that of countries where this evil did not exist . That so plain and obvious a solution of the difficulties under which the industry of the country labored , should have escaped the public attention , would now be apt to excite surprise , had we not experienced during* the revulsion , produced by similar causes , through which this country is now passing , not only a similar disregard to its origin , but its attributi*n to measures which , so far from producing it , have exercised a most important and salutary tendency in assuaging its violence , and in protecting the great interests of the country from detriment . The state of things which existed at the period referred to , afforded a brilliant occasion for several individuals endowed with talents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language the outra eons wrongs inflicted upon our citizens by foreigners , in seducing them to purchase cheap manufactures . Appeals of that description were peculiarly captivating to national vanity . It is not in human nature , willingly to attribute any of our misfortunes to our own folly and imprudence . By shifting the responsibility of the deplorable condition under which the whole country then suffered , from ou . own citizens to foreigners , the general feeling of patriotism was flattered , while the compunctious visitings of conscience , which should have wrung the hearts of those who had mismanaged the powerful corporations , which had in fact produced the existing calamities , were no doubt greatly assuaged by such bland appliances . At any rate , public indignation was diverted away from the actual authors of the public misery . Immense efforts // were made in every part of the United States , to satisfy the people that foreign commerce had been the great cause of their adverse circumstances . It was sedulously inculcated , in Congress , at public meetings , and in the public prints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign commodities would entirely retrieve the affairs of most of those , who had actually suffered from the alternate expansion and contraction of the currency . This warfare against common sense was carried on with the greatest zeal and perseverance . The common artifice of unprincipled politicians , of appealing to sectional jealousies , as well as national prejudices , was resorted to with great eloquence and effect , by individuals , from whose character and talents a more elevated and patriotic mode of discussing important questions of national policy might have been expected . In short , the principal agency in the measures adopted by Congress , under the pretext of protecting the manufactures of this country , but which have visited upon them , from time to time , such appalling consequences , must he attributed , in fairness , not to the manufacturers generally , but to the politicians by profession , who expected to acquire an accession of influence and importance , by agitating the nation upon a subject'of so much general interest , and on which so many specious and superficial representations , of immediate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty upon the cotton manufactures was fixed , as we have seen , by the Act of 1816 , at twenty-five per cent. , with a minimum , with a provision that on the first July 1819 , it should be reduced to twenty per cent . Under the influence of the disasters , attending the earlier stages of the revulsion , Congress , by the Act of the t*ventieth April , 1819 , continued the duties prescribed by the Act of 1816 , at the highest rate , until the first July 1826 . For several sessions it refused to sanction any further interference with the tariff . But finally , after earnest and prolonged discussions throughout the country , as well as in Congress , an increased tariff was imposed by the Act of twenty-second May , 1824 . By this law , the nominal duty on cotton manufactures remained at twenty-five per cent. , but the minimum was increased to thirty cents per square yard . This further protection , by inviting new adventurers into the business , resulted , as must have been foreseen by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great degree the evils under which it had previously laboured . As we have seen in the growth of cotton , undue encouragement inevitably leads to over-production . Mr. Woodbury estimates the number of spindles that were put into operation between 1819 and 1825 , to be three times greater than the whole number at work the former year . The cotton manufacture , during the greater part of this period of general distress and sufferin* , was , no doubt , exceedingly profitable , when managed with // ordinary prudence and economy . A short time , however , after the new manufactories , called into existence hy the act of 1824 , went into operation , the business fell into greater depression than ever . Many large capitalists who had been engaged in foreign commerce , of which the profits had become greatly diminished , as well as exceedingly precarious , were induced to embark in manufactures . A supply being created beyond the demand , prices fell , and many of the small establishments were compelled to sacrifice their products . Instances repeatedly occurred where cloth was sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was manufactured had cost . These disasters gave rise to new clamors for an increase of the tariff , and resulted in the Act of nineteenth May , 1828 , by which the minimum was raised to t hirty-five cents per square yard . A true friend of the manufacturing interests of the country , who considers the course of the protective policy , which then prevailed , in connexion with the real and permanent prosperity of those interests , can not fail to be deeply impressed with the suicidal error under which some of the manufacturers were continually calling for new artificial stimulants , to be furnished by politicians , for their encouragement . Sanguine speculators were constantly induced , by the temporary buoyancy thus occasioned , to avail themselves of the facilities afforded by the vicious banking system which prevailed in most of the States , for embarking in new undertakings . Loans were extensively obtained by such persons , upon the security of their friends , for the purpose of embarking in Thirsuits which promised such large returns , under the expectation of repaying them at stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutability of the market from the fluctuations of demand and supply , which were greatly increased by the speculations-as well as the continual expansions and contractions of the currency from the operations of the banks-disappointed most of these expectations , and involved all parties in embarrassment . This state of things was most vividly realized through all the manufacturing districts of the country in 1828-1829 . Not only those who had recently engaged in the busi ness without sufficient actual capital , but individuals possessing the greatest experience and ample property , were involved in the deepest difficulties . Even the patriarch of American manufactures , the worthy Mr. Slater , whose prudence , industry , and talent , sedulously employed in the cotton manufacture during a long series of years , had been rewarded by the accumulation of an estate which was estimated , by competent judges , to be worth nearly a million of dollars , found it impossible to meet his engagements . The ownership of manufacturing property to any amount , was insufficient to inspire confidence among those who witnessed the wide-spread ruin which pervailed among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things more affecting than two or three brief business letters , written by Mr. Slater at this juncture , which may be found in his life , published by Mr. White . That such a man should become a victim to the unwise legislation which had given rise to so many improvident speculations , after having passed through a long life of useful and successful enterprise , was indeed a hard fate . Many instances might be given which would illustrate this subject more powerfully than volumes of abstract disquisition . Among the extraordinary cases which have come to our knowledge , we will mention another , which *v*s a matter of much interest in the State where it occurred , and where the facts remain upon its legislative and judicial records . The Dover Manufacturing Company was chartered by the State of New Hampshire , with an aggregate capital of a million and a half of dollas . A considerable portion of the stock was taken by capitalists in Boston , though the great rise in the value of property , which the prospect of its enormous outlay occasioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighbourhood , in a period of general confidence and prosperity , to take part in an enterprise which promised such an ample remuneration for the capital invested . The extensive purchases of real estate made by this corporation ,  --  its large and costly erections of buildings ,  --  the expensive machinery of the most improved kind , not only for the making of cloth , but for bleaching and printing , on a large scale , and the stock and wages necessary to put this vast establishment into operation , not only absorbed the whole capital , but left a floating debt unprovided for . The prices of the manufactures were then greatly depressed , and a further advance of money became necessary . This could not be raised by the creation of new shares , as the price of all manufacturing stock had become merely nominal . The few large capitalists among the proprietors devised a plan for raising the necessary funds , by procuring a charter for a new corporation , authorized to invest a capital of half a million of dollars , in manufactories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This new corporation was composed of such of the holders of the stock of the Dover Company , as were able and willing to advance their proportionate amount of its liabilities , which most of the small proprietors in the neighbourhood , having already gone to the extent of their means , found it impossible to do , in the existing state of credit among those engaged in manufactures . the shares in the new corporation to which they would have been entitled , were taken by the other proprietors . The whole property , both real and personal , of the old corporation , was then mortgaged to the new , as security for the advances required to carry on the busine3s . After the lapse of a short period , a foreclosure took place , and the new corporation came into possession of the whole property , and the old stockholders who // had not participated in the stock of the Cochecho Manufacturing Company , as the new corporation was styled , were at once deprived of all interest in either-by acts of the two corporations , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is needless to add that the few proprietors who thus came into the enjoyment of the whole property , by depriving a great proportion of their original associates of their shares , realized the most ample profits or to intimate that in other instances , where large manufacturing corporations had become equally embarrassed by the evils of overproduction , artificially stimulated through expansions of the currency by the banks , and by preposterous legislation , the leading capitalists , taking advantage of the depression which invariably succeeds such a state of factitious excitement , endeavoured to follow an example so ingeniously devised , and so successful in its operation . We have given , we trust , a sufficient number of facts to show that the protective policy , connected with the banking system , has operated most cruelly upon the interests of those whose welfare it professed to advance . But it unhappily appears that men , and even those who profess to be statesmen , are prone to regard immediate advantages , and to act from temporary impulses , instead of looking with a single eye to future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this preposterous mode of encouraging industry , by thus habitually administering artificial stimulants , was its deplorable influence upon the financial legislation of Congress . It inevitably induced an habitual extravagance of appropriation of the public money , which was calculated to impair the purity and simplicity of our republican form of government . Those members of Congress , who usually voted for levying taxes upon the people , not exclusively for the support of the Government , but for the purpose of fostering individual pursuits-which , by a gross perversion of language , was miscalled THE AMERICAN SysTEM , though it was wholly imitated from the barbarous and exploded notions of the corrupt monarchies of the eastern continent-almost invariably supported every ingenious pretext which could be devised for the most lavish expenditure . We feel confident of being within bounds when we state , that the aggregate of appropriations , not asked , for the various branches of the public service , by the estimates of the responsible executive officers , but which have been made by Congress during the prevalence of this system , have exceeded a hundred millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or questioning the right of the Representatives of the people , to apply the money raised from them , by taxation , to such objects as are within their constitutional scope of duty . But we can not repress our opinion , that many of the modes of absorbing the public revenue introduced and supported by some of these Representatives , // would never have been tolerated among their constituents , but from the miserable feeling-unworthy of every just and honorable mind-that others would be compelled to bear a greater relative portion of the burden occasioned by such measures , than themselves . Such liberality with the money belonging to others is destructive of all true public morality . Another great source of the inevitable evils of this system deserves to be noticed , as it formed the principal subject of the deliberations of the great Harrisburg Convention of 1827 , composed of delegates from all the States north of the Potomac , as well as from Kentucky and Ohio : this is , the evasion of duties by smuggling and false invoices . These are certainly great public evils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is absolutely necessary that those who derive security and protection from the Government should contribute to its support . Any fraud or evasion of the taxes imposed for this purpose , by any person , is an actual wrong committed upon all other individuals in the community , which justice requires should be severely punished . But the experience of every nation , which has ever supported government by indirect taxation , amply establishes the fact , that it is impossible to prohibit , by laws , the importatio*n of articles of taste and luxury ,  --  and equally impossible to levy rates of duty upon importation , of an inordinate amount in proportion to the value of the article taxed . The tobacco and spirit duties in England may be referred to , which have not only demoralized so large a portion of the population on her coasts , but have subjected her treasury to its vast expenditure for the preventive service , established for the detection and punishment of smuggling . In point of fact , such is the constitution of man , that any thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laws enacted with that view create a distinction so flattering to human vanity , that no attainable expense will be spared in its gratification . It is not necessary to go abroad for instances . During the late war , a state of actual hostilities with Canada could not prevent extensive importations of goods from that quarter . The only effectual remedy for smuggling , and impositions in the collection of the revenue , is to avoid fixing the rates of duty in a manner that will shock the sense of justice in the community , and take away the desire which every individual would otherwise entertain , of making his neighbour contribute his fair proportion for the support of the public establishments . The cotton-growing States have invariably opposed with great zeal and earnestness every measure which has been introduced into Congress since 1816 , for the purpose of increasing the duties upon manufactures of that article . It is by no means the lightest objection to the system , that it has created and fostered feelings which // 4S Cotton . ought not to exist between the different sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reat scale of mutual necessities are so intimately interwoven . The citizens of the South have contended with great force of argument , that , as their prosperity mainly depended upon the demand for the raw material in foreign markets , the policy which proposed to grant the monopoly of the home supply to the manufacturers of this country not only subjected them to an unjust tax to the extent of their consumption , but must inevitably result in creating countervailing embarrassments abroad . Whatever injurious effects the southern States may have either experienced or fancied from the operation of this cruel system , it is certain , that its consequences upon them have been greatly more disastrous upon the manufacturing States . During its operation the manufacturers of cotton have no doubt greatly increased  --  but the other industrial interests of the country have not been stationary . The importance of the cotton manufacture has been so constantly placed before the public , from the continual agitation of the tariff question by speculators and politicians , that the value of other branches of manufacture , which have been carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be fairly estimated , that about one-third of the manufactories of cotton , in the United States , are within the State of Massachusetts  --  the whole amount in the country being now con*idered to be about two millions of spindles . A most creditable and satisfactory statistical document has been lately placed before the Legislature of that State by the Secretary of the Commonwealth , and has just fallen into our hands , which shows , from official returns furnished by the proper authorities of each town , the actual value of all manufactured articles produced within its territory during the year ending on the first of April , 1837 . It appears from this authentic statement , that the aggregate value of the cotton goods manufactured in the State during that period , was about thirteen millions of dollars , while the value of the boots and shoes manufactured within the same space of time was upwards of fourteen millions and a half . The cotton manufacture employed not quite twenty thousand persons-while the manufacture of boots and shoes employed near forty thousand . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former to the State of Massachusettsand how little has been said or known , to the public at large , with regard to the latter ! The value of the products of the bleaching and printing of cotton cloths is separately stated , and amounts to upwards of four millions . And how many are there of the most extensive and profitable branches of industry essentially important to the comfort , and even existence , of vast numbers of our population , of which little is known // to the public , in consequence of their not being carried on at great establishments which attract general attention . We furnish this comparison between the value of these articles produced in the most manufacturing section of the United States , in proportion to its population , for the purpose of showing , that the increase in the cotton manufactures can not with any fairness be attributed to the plausible but cruel protection they have received from the monopoly legislation of Congress . Had this unfortunate interference not periodically intervened , they would probably have reached a far higher degree of prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of duties provided by the Act of 2d March , 1833 , to have been a measure of great and substantial benefit to them . It is not necessary for us to express any opinion upon the question whether the reduction might not have taken effect with more rapidity , to equal or greater advantage . The simple fact , that our manufactures for the last dozen or fifteen years have been able to compete successfully with the English in many foreign markets , shows conclusively the mockery of imposing high duties for the purpose of protecting their products . They obtain the raw material cheaper-are free from burdensome excise duties  --  and use principally a moving power of much less cost than those of England . Any slight difference in the price of wages is of comparatively little importance , in operations carried on in such great proportion , and to such great extent , without human aid . Capitalists in England are indeed contented with a much smaller rate of profit than those of our own country . But when the business is placed upon a footing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act of 1833 , this disparity xnust gradually lessen . We are ardently anxious to advance the permanent interests of the cotton manufacturers in common with those of all other pursuits of industry . But we are solemnly convinced that they can only be effectually promoted by abstaining from all legislative disturbances , which have heretofore so often been the occasion , as we have seen , of the most melancholy results . We have avoided by design all remarks upon the constitutionality of imposing duties upon the importation of foreign manufactures for the purpose of affording protection to our own citizens in the production of similar articles-not from unwillingness to enter upon the subject , but because we consider it as now a settled question , beyond any serious danger of revival ; as it would also be a waste of time to discuss an abstract doctrine , while we possess so many conclusive proofs within our own experience , that all monopoliesor any tendency towards them-are not less injurious , in the irresistible course of events , to those in favor of whom they may be grant .. ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
