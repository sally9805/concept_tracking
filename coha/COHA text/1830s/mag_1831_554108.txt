txt The general object of the Prison Discipline Society ,  --  the improvement in the state of prisons in reference to the comfort , and particularly the moral character of their inmates ,  --  is of a nature to command the respect and sympathy of every friend of humanity . The assiduity and success with // which the Society have labored in this good cause , are apparent from several previous Reports , as well as from the one before us ; and we trust that they will be sustained in future , as they have been thus far , by that large and liberal patronage , which alone can enable them to give full scope and effect to their benevolent intentions . Our present purpose , however , is not so much to enlarge upon this branch of the operations of the Society , as to advert to that portion of the Report before us , which is occupied by a statement of facts and opinions on the subject of Ii*prisonment for Debt . This feature in our civil institutions has for some years past been attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be now almost universally admitted , that the present system imperi-. ously demands a reform , although there is still much difference of sentiment as to th' extent of the evil , and the nature of the remedy . We have not the presumption to suppose , that the hasty suggestions which we may offer will have any tendency to settle this difference ; but by bringing to the view of our readers some of the lucid statements and weighty considerations contained in the Report , we may hope to contribute something towards the formation of that enlightened public opinion , which must ultimately decide upon this as upon every other question of general interest . We shall first extract a passage of the Report , which gives some idea of the number of persons who are annually imprisoned for debt , and of the efficacy of this process in enforcing payment . Returns have been received from nearly one hundred Prisons in the United States , showing how many persons were imprisoned for debt during the year ending December 30 , 1829 ; for what sums they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many were discharged by the creditor or his attorney ; how many paid the debt ; how many took the poor debtor 's oath ; what was the whole amount of debt ; what was the whole amount of costs ; and who supported the debtor in Prison . The letters received from the sheriffs of different counties , and different and distant States , containing this information , merit the particular and grateful acknowledgements of the Society , for the labor bestowed in examining the records of the Prisons , to collect it . Many of the letters also are valuable , inasmuch as they contain an expression of the opinion of practical men , who have had the best opportunities of observation , in regard to the operation of the present laws on the subject of imprisonment for debt . // We have also received letters from judges , lawgivers , and philanthropists , expressing their opinion on this subject . The following general remarks are supported by the first class of letters , to which we have referred ; 1 . The number of persons imprisoned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the year ending December 30 , 1829 , there were imprisoned for debt in Concord , N. H. , 31 ; in Taunton , Mass. , 126 ; in Worcester , 271 ; in Boston , 1211 ; in East Greenwich , R. I. , 80 ; in Newport , R. 1. , 78 ; in Pennyan , N. Y. , 103 ; at Courtland Village , 112 ; in Buffalo , 338 ; in the city of New York , in 1828 , 3,000 ; in Philadelphia , during 8 months , ending February 25 , 1830 , 817 ; in Baltimore , in 1829 , 944 . As nearly as we can ascertain from the returns which we have received , the number imprisoned for debt annually is , in Massachusetts , 3,000 ; in New York , 10,000 ; in Pennsylvania , 7,000 ; in Maryland , 3,000 ; and in the other Northern and Middle States , nearly as above in proportion to the population . 2 . The number of persons imprisoned for debt , compared with the number imprisoned for crime , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to the criminals as 3 to 1 ; in Rhode Island , as 4 to 1 ; in Pennyan , N. Y. , nearly as 5 to 1 ; at Courtland Village more than 8 to 1 ; at Belvidere , N. J. , as 5 to 1 ; at Flemington , N. J. , as 6 to 1 ; in 17 Prisons in the Northern and Middle States , nearly as 5 to 1 . 3 . The number of persons imprisoned for small debts is very great . In Philadelphia alone , the number of persons imprisoned in eight months , ending February 25 , 1830 , for less than one dollar each , was thirty . In eleven other Prisons , from which we have heard , there were imprisoned , during the year ending December 30 , 1829 , for less than one dollar each , thirty-two . 4 . The number of persons imprisoned for more than one , and less than five dollars each , is still greater . In thirty Prisons , from which we have heard , there were imprisoned , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred and ninety-five. 5 . The number of persons imprisoned for more than five , and less than twenty dollars , is very great . In thirty-two Prisons , from which we have heard , there were imprisoned for more than five and less than twenty dollars , two thousand one hundred and eighty-four . 6 . The number of persons imprisoned for more than twenty , and less than one hundred dollars , is not one third as great as the number imprisoned for less than twenty dollars . In thirty-two Prisons , from which we have heard , the num // her imprisoned for less than twenty dollars each , was 2841 ; for more than twenty , and less than $100 ,  --  902. 7 . The number of persons imprisoned for more than one hundred dollars each is very small , in comparison with the num6cr imprisoned for less than twenty dollars . In fifty-three Prisons , from which we have heard , the whole number imprisoned for more than one hundred dollars each , was four hundred and sixteen , or only as one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty dollars . S. The time lost in Prison is very considerable by those who are poorly able to lose it . In fifteen Prisons , from which we have heard , in the Northern and Middle States , the persons imprisoned for debt , For less than one day , were - . . . . . 269 For more than one , and less than five days , 323 For more than five , and less than ten days , . 203 For more than ten , and less than twenty days , . 154 For more than twenty , and less than thirty days , . . 83 For more than thirty days , . . . . . 431 Total amount of time lost in fifteen Prisons , nineteen thousand , nine hundred and eighty-seven days . 9 . While so much time is lost in Prison , it is a very fruitless business as a means of compelling payment . In seventeen Prisons , from which we have heard , out of two thousand and fifty-seven persons imprisoned , the records show only two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons discharged by the creditor or his attorncy , according to the records , is more than three times as large as the number of those who pay the debt . In seventeen Prisons , from which we have heard , as already stated , two hundred and ninety-four paid the debt , and one thousand and nineteen were discharged by the creditor or his attorney . 11 . The number of persons discharged by taking the poor debtor 's oath , is more than twice as great as the number of those who pay the debt . In the seventeen Prisons above mentioned , two hundred and ninety-four paid the debt , and seven hundred and forty-four took the poor debtor 's oath . 12 . The amount paid , according to the Records , in consequence of imprisonment , is not one haW the value of time lost at *1 per day . In seventeen Prisons , from which we have heard , the amount paid , in the year ending December 30 , 1829 , as nearly as can be ascertained , was seven thousand nine hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fifteen Prisons , during the same time , at $1 per day , was nineteen thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven dollars . 13 . This is not only very fruitless , but very expensive business to the creditor . We have reason to believe , that , in most cases , in which persons are discharged from Prison by the creditor or his attorney , or by the poor debtor 's oath , the costs are paid by the creditor ; and we have already seen , that in seventeen Prisons there were discharged by the creditor or his attorney , . . 1019 By the poor debtor 's oath , . . . . . 744 By paying the debt , . . . . . . 294 We have made the inquiry of a number of the respectable men of our acquaintance , whether they ever imprisoned a man for debt . The general answer has been , Yes ; once or twice , and we lost the debt , and paid the costs . 14 . The operation of the laws , in regard to imprisonment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . In seventeen Prisons heard from in the Northern States , the number of persons imprisoned during the year ending December 30 , 1829 , was two thousand seven hundred and forty-two . In the same number of Prisons in the Southern States , only thirty-five . 15 . There are examples of amelioration and abolition . In Massachusetts , there is a law which forbids the imprisonment of any debtor for less than five dollars . A similar law , in the other Northern and Middle States , would have saved from imprisonment , during the last year , in eighteen Prisons , from which we have heard , four hundred and thirty-one persons . The great opposition to this law is said to have come from groceries and grog shops . There is a law in New-Hampshire , which forbids the imprisonment of any debtor for less than $ 13,33 . A similar law , in the other Northern and Middle States , would have saved from imprisonment , during the last year , in eighteen Prisons , from which we have heard , one thousand four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which requires the creditor to pay the hoard of the debtor . This law is said , by several of the jailers , to have diminished the duration of imprisonment for debt about one third . A very shrewd and observing jailer , in a Prison where more than one thousand persons are imprisoned annually , remarked , that many cases of imprisonment for small debts would be prevented , if the creditors were obliged to make oath , that the debts were true debts ; as in South Carolina . // In Kentucky and Ohio , imprisonment for debt is abolished . A similar law in the Northern arid Middle States , would have saved from imprisonment , during the last year , as nearly as we can ascertain , about fifty thousand persons . - 16 . The laws and public opinion appear to be at variance on the subject of imprisonment for debt . We have already seen , to some extent , what is the operation of the laws . We now give an abstract of the laws of several States , where the evils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the abstract , we shall give what we consider an expression of public opinion . ' The following letter to the Secretary of the Society , from the benevolent individual so generally and so honorably known by the assumed name of Hamilton , whose indefatigable exertions for the promotion of every good work have so justly endeared him to his countrymen , gives some further very interesting details on the same subject . E*rtract from a Letter sig'ned Hamilton , dated Philadelphia , March 5 , 1830 . The cruel effects , and the suffering resulting from imprisonment for debt , and its almost universal inefficacy in producing satisfaction of the claims of the creditor , have for a long time attracted public attention , and been depicted in vivid colors by different writers , in the hope of removing the evil . But improvements of every kind , however plain and palpable , travel at a snail 's pace , when they have to encounter inveterate prejudice . It has often happened that it required half a century to remove a crying evil , about which no two enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases are by no means rare , in which half a century has been found inadequate for the purpose . The abuses of the court of Chancery in Great Britain , and its ruinous delays of justice , almost equivalent to a denial , are strongly in point . The evil of imprisonment for debt has been somewhat mitigated in some of the States ; but in others it remains in all its frightful enormity . In this State , no man , who can give adequate security for his appearance at the insolvent court , need go to jail . Nevertheless , hundreds are sent to jail for want of security . In Massachusetts , a law is in force , how long I can not tell , which prohibits imprisonment for debts under five dollars . A most astounding and revolting fact has been just presented to the public by the Boston Prison Discipline Society , ( one of the most philanthropic and beneficent societies in the country , ) // respecting the state of imprisonment for debt in the city of NewYork . It appears , On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment in that city , that the number of cases of imprisonment for debt during the year 1828 , was 1085 ! The debts together amounted to $25,409 ; the damages to $362,076 ! the amount paid in jail , $295 ! which bears to the amount of actual debt , the proportion of 1 to 86 ! and to the amount of debts and damages , of 1 to 1313 ! - Fourth Report , page 17 . Probably , among the variety of abuses attendant on , and inseparable from , civil society , a more monstrous or shocking fact can not be produced , or one more at variance with our boasted civilization . The facts in this connexion in our city are not quite so revolting ; but they are sufficiently so to call for a radical remedy . But a short law of twenty lines , abolishing imprisonment for debts under five dollars , which might be passed in three days , would remove some of the most crying enormities of our present system . The number of persons imprisoned in the debtor 's apartment in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , 1830 , was 817 , of*vhom there were 30 whose debts were below 1 dollar . 233 above 1 and below 5 dollars . 174 above 5 and below 10 dollars . 140 above 10 and below 20 dollars . 142 above 20 and below 100 dollars . 98 above 100 dollars . 817 Of 252 of these unfortunate people , the debts were $663 and the costs $448 . Of 64 , the debts were $58 and the costs $120 ! That this state of things calls for a remedy , will nor be questioned . The Massachusetts law is a remedy , plain , simple , and effectual , as to the most grievous portion of the evil ; and it is to be hoped it will be applied without delay . It is highly probable that such a law would considerably diminish the poor rates . The 263 persons above referred to , whose debts are below , five dollars , are of the class who depend wholly for their own support , and that of their families , on their labor . Their extreme poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for their families during their imprisonment ; and the consequence is , that that support , in the interim , devolves on the overseers of the poor . ' // the remedy that ought to be applied , we are presented in the Report with a number of opinions of great authority . The Secretary of the Society addressed a circular letter to several gentlemen of distinction , requesting a communication of their views on important points connected with this subject , and received from some of them answers of a very interesting character , which are here presented . The most important of these have been reprinted in other quarters , but we nevertheless deem it expedient to quote them , in order that while the feelings of the community are agitated by the discussion of the question , the views that are entertained of it by the ablest men , and the most competent judges , may be kept as much as possible before the public , as a guard against extravagance and error . The opinion of Mr. Webster on any subject connected with his professional pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much weight as that of any person of his age in the country . His letter is as follows ; Letter from Hon. Daniel Webster , dated Waskington , May 2 , 1830 . SIR-I have received your letter of the 19th of April , asking my opinion upon several questions , all relative to the subject of imprisonment for debt . I am quite willing to express my general opinions on that interesting subject , although they are not so matured as to be entitled to influence other men 's judgments . The existing laws , I think , call loudly for revision and amendment . Your first four questions seek to know what I think of imprisonment for small sums . I am decidedly against it ; I would carry the exemption to debts of thirty or forty dollars , at least . Individual instances of evil or hardship might , I am aware , follow from such a change ; but I am*i persuaded the general result would be favorable , in a high degree , to industry , sobriety , and good morals , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , what I think of imprisonment for debt in any case where there is no evidence of fraud . Certainly I am of opinion that there should be no imprisonment for debt , where it appears that no fraud has been practised , or intended , either in contracting the debt , or in omitting to pay it . But , then , it seen-is to me , that , when a man does not fulfil a lawful promise , he ought to show his inability , and to show also that his own conduct has been fair and honest . He ought not to be allowed merely to say he can not pay , and then to call on the creditor to prove that his inability is pretended or fraudulent . He ought to show why he does not and can not fulfil his contract , and to give reasonable evidence that he has not acted fraudulently : and , this // being done , his person ought to be held no longer . In the first place , the creditor is entitled to the oath of his debtor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of any suspicious circumstances . There are two sorts of fraud , either of which , when proved , ought to prevent a liberation of the person , viz : fraud in contracting the debt , and fraud in concealing , or making way with , the means of payment . And the usual provisions of the bankrupt act ought to be added , that no one should be discharged , who is proved to have lost money in any species of gaming ; and I should include , in this class , all adventurers in lotteries . Having tendered his own oath , and made just explanation of any circumstances of suspicion , if there be such , and not having lost money by gaming , the debtor ought to be discharged at once ; which answers another of your questions ; for the detention of thirty days , before the oath can be taken , appears to me wholly useless . ' You are pleased to ask , whether , in my judgment , Christians can , with a good conscience , imprison , either other Christians or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , who should make a difference , in such a case , and be willing to use a degree of severity towards Jew or Greek , which he would not use towards one of his own faith . Whether conscientious men can imprison any body for debt , whom they do not believe dishonest or fraudulent , is a question which every man , while the law allows such imprisonment , must decide for himself . In answer to your inquiry , whether I have found it necessary to use such coercion , in regard to debts of my own , I have to say , that I never imprisoned any man for my own debt , under any circumstances ; nor have I , in five and twenty years ' professional practice , ever recommended it to others , except in cases where there was manifest proof , or violent and unexplained suspicion , of intentional fraud . Imprisonment for debt , my dear sir , as it is now practised , is , in my judgment , a great evil ; and , it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil is obvious . Nineteen twentieths of the whole of it would be relieved , in my opinion , if imprisonment for small debts were to be abolished . That object I believe to be attainable ; and to its attainment , I think , the main attention of those who take an interest in the subject should be directed . Small credits are often given , on the confidence of being able to collect the debt by the terrors of the jail ; great ones seldom or never . Three simple provisions would accomplish all , in my opinion , that may be considered as absolutely required to a just state of the law , respecting imprisonment for debt in Massachusetts . // 1 . That no imprisonment should be allowed , when the debts , exclusive of costs , did not amount to thirty dollars . 2 . That there should be no necessity of imprisonment for thirty days , as preliminary to taking the poor debtor 's oath ; nor any longer detention than such as is necessary to give parties notice and time to prepare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every county , should , for the purpose of administering the oaths , be appointed by the government ; and that such magistrates should be clothed with such further powers as might be thought expedient , in order to enable them to make a thorough investigation of the fairness or fraud of the debtor 's conduct . 3 . That in cases where the debtor had been discharged , if the creditor would make oath to newly discovered evidence , proving original fraud , or , to his belieg that the debtor had subsequently received property , and concealed or withheld the same from his creditors , it should be competent to such creditor to have investigation of such charge , and , if made out , to have execution against the person , and if not made out , that the creditor should pay the cost of the proceeding . Other provisions might doubtless be useful ; but if these three alone could be obtained , they would , in a great measure , clear the jails of debtors , and give general satisfaction , I have no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imprisonment of females in the common jails , for mere debt , is a barbarism which ought not to be tolerated . Instances of such imprisonment , though rare , do yet sometimes occur , under circumstances that shock every humane mind . In this respect , the law ought , in my judgment , to be altogether reformed . ' The opinion of Dr. Channing-an authority in no way inferior to the one just cited-is given more briefly , but with equal or greater point , in a passage of his late Election Sermon . Extract from Dr. channing 's Election Sermon . I am shocked at the imprisonment of the honest debtor , and the legislation , which allows the creditor to play the tyrant over an innocent man , would disgrace , I think , a barbarous age . I am not less shocked by the impunity with which criminal insolvents continually escape , and by the lenity of the community towards those transgressors of its most essential laws . ' The following letter is from the Hon. Charles Jackson , whose early eminence at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement from the bench , was the // severest loss , which the judiciary department of ' this Commonwealth has sustained since the death of Parsons . Extract of a Letter from Hon. Charles Jackson , dated Boston , May 18 , 1830 . DEAR SIR-The only just or reasonable motive for imprisoning a debtor seems to be to compel him to apply his property to the payment of his debts . If , therefore , he is about to abscond , and to remove his effects beyond the reach of his creditors , or if he fraudulently secretes or withdraws them , so that they can not be taken by legal process , the creditor , I think , ought to have the power to arrest him , and to prevent him , if possible , from enjoying at ease , or spending in luxury , what he has thus unjustly acquired . But when he is unable to pay the debt , and has no property to be surrendered to his creditor , it is wholly useless as well as oppressive , to prolong his imprisonment . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is very unequal and unjust , as it is inflicted without any regard to the magnitude of the debt , and without any distinction between a fraudulent debtor and one who is only unfortunate . I think , therefore , that imprisonment for debt ought never to be allowed , except in cases which I consider fraudulent ; that is , when the debtor fraudulently or obstinately secretes or withholds his property . But as it is not easy to ascertain beforehand what cases fall within this description , it may be necessary to authorize the arrest of the debtor , making provision , at the same time , for an immediate discharge of his person , upon his surrendering all his property that is liable to attachment . If a proper and convenient provision of this kind could be made , it would perhaps remove the principal objections to the existing laws ; but so long as imprisonment for debt on mesne process , and on execution , is conducted as it now is , I am strongly of opinion , that it ought never to be allowed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debtors . It would require more practical knowledge than I possess on this subject , to fix the amount of debt for which it ought to be allowed ; but I should be glad to find , that it could be limited to fifty dollars . When a man whose living depends on his manual labor , is imprisoned for a debt which he is unable to pay , there is a loss to the community , as well as to the debtor himself , of the produce of the labor which he might have performed ; and the creditor 's chance of receiving payment is of course diminished . If a debtor is unable to pay ten dollars , it seems to be the height of absurdity , as well as cruelty , to take him from his business , and to condemn him to idleness for a time long enough to have earned twenty dollars . There is , perhaps , one advantage in allowing imprisonment for // small debts ; which is , that it tends to deter the poor from contracting debts ; and so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is highly useful . But we daily see , that this is not an effectual remedy , and that many of that class will get credit where they can , though upon terms most oppressive to themselves . If these persons were wholly exempted from arrest and imprisonment , they would find it much more difficult to get credit than they now do . This would be beneficial , not only to themselves , but also to the class of creditors in general ; as these latter , by giving less credit , would probably , on the whole , lose less than they do under the existing laws . As to the duration of imprisonment , if allowed at all , I should suppose thirty days much more than would be commonly necessary . All that must be required is time enough for the debtor to make out a statement of his property , and to surrender or convey it to the person designated in the law , and to undergo an examination , on oath , as to the truth of that statement . I see no objection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on mesne process , as well as on execution . lit would further tend to prevent abuses in this respect , if arrest on mesne process were allowed for debt only , or for injuries to property , that are susceptible , in some degree , of a precise estimation ; to the exclusion of all cases of mere personal wrongs , and of claims for unliquidated and uncertain debts . If imprisonment for debt is , as I think it is , useless , when used merely to compel the surrender of property , which ought to be applied to discharge the debt , it follows , that , in other cases , a Christian can not , with a good conscience , make use of this process either against a fellow Christian or an infidel . ' We add the letter of Mr. Edward Everett , upon the character of which we are precluded by obvious considerations , from expressing an opinion . Extract of a Letter from Hon. Edward Everett , dated Charlestown , Mass. , 4th . Sept. , 1830 . DEAR Sin-I have duly received your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment for debt . I must leave it to those better acquainted with the practical effect of the existing laws , to make a discrimination between the operation of these laws , in reference to the different sums you have named . My view of the subject requires no such discrimination . But were I obliged to give a specific answer to your first question , " What do you think of imprisonment for debt for sums less than one dollar ? " I should say , I think it a disgrace to the community where it is tolerated ; and that a person , who would // deprive a fellow creature of his liberty for inability to pay that sum , ought himself to be sent to the State 's Prison , till he had learned humanity , or rather to the Insane Hospital , till he was restored to reason . But I ought to recollect that even such imprisonment has been authorized by the laws of our ancient Commonwealth , and is now authorized by the laws and daily practice of some of the sister States ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system established by the law of the land , and sanctioned by custom . It is one of the worst effects of bad laws , that they corrupt public sentiment . It is said to have been remarked , by the venerable AttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth , on occasion of the late trial at Salem , that it was to be regretted that the common law had not , by the statute of 1 Ann , been brought a little nearer to common sense , in reference to the trial of accessaries , before the conviction of a principal . I fear there is too great reason to say , that we live under a system of laws , touching the relations of debtor and creditor , utterly at war , not only with common sense , but common humanity . Although crime may be connected with insolvency , yet insolvency is not of itself a crime . Where fraud has been committed , let that fraud be proceeded against under known laws , and punished , I care not how severely , so the bounds of reason and humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts is itself no proof of crime . It may , and often does , arise from the act of God , and misfortune in all its forms . A man may become insolvent in consequence of sickness , shipwreck , a fire , a bad season , political changes affecting trade at home and abroad ; or , being wholly prosperous in his own business , he may be involved in the ruin of his debtor . In the eye of the law of Massachusetts , a man 's inability to meet his obligations , produced in any of these ways , is a crime punishable by imprisonment . Suppose a Legislature were to pass a law , that whoever should have a ship cast away , or a ware-house burnt down , should be imprisoned thirty days . What would be thought of their humanity ? what of their sanity ? Such , however , in substance , is the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . The absurdity of such a system is as glaring as its cruelty . It is objectionable on another ground . To deprive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of penal justice . Next to capital punishment , it is the most infamous punishment known to our law . The power of wielding this formidable weapon ought to be lodged exclusively in the hands of the magistrate . Grave public reasons should alone decide when it should be employed . // The present law submits to the discretion , the caprice , and the passions of the creditor , whether he will or will not subject a citizen to this odious infliction of penal justice . There are men in the community who make a livelihood from buying up bad debts . The State puts its sheriffs , and constables , and the keys of its Prisons , under their control , and they daily wield their dreadful power , from motives of interest ; sometimes without the possibility of deriving benefit ; but more frequently with a studied and tantalizing choice of time and circumstances , such as to give to personal duress the character and effects of torture . Torture , in fact , it is ; and many persons , no doubt , would rather lose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns of a thumb-screw in private , than be shut up in the wards of a jail . Fortunately for the credit of the country at large , though to the discredit of Massachusetts , our law on this subject is behind the legislation of the majority of the States . Very few States in the Union deem so lightly of the value of the blessings which they secure to their citizens , as to allow an individual to deprive his neighbor of his liberty , for thirty days , for a debt of five dollars . When the enormity and scandal of such legislation are considered , we can only wonder that it can subsist for a day in a community where the people make the laws , especially when we inquire what class of society is benefited by them . Creditors are not greatly benefited , as is notorious from the facts stated in the last Report of the Prison Discipline Society . In a Report made to a meeting of gentlemen assembled in Boston , a year or two since , to consider this subject , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COSTS that have accrued in suits against insolvents , have amounted to more than one million of dollars . " It surely can not be the interest or the wish of the mass of the people to lay such a tax for the purpose of filling the pockets of those benefited by the prosecution of petty debts . Considered in connexion with the public good , and the cause of civil liberty , the facts disclosed in the last Annual Report of the Prison Discipline Society present matter of reflection painfully important . Seventy-five thousand freemen , in these United States , it is estimated , are annually subjected , under the existing laws , to the infamous punishment of a Prison ! And the costs and damages exceed , in many cases , the amount of the debts for which they are imprisoned ! There are several governments called despotic , where no such outrage on reason and humanity is tolerated . That it is submitted to in this community , is a proof how much practical oppression a people will endure , who enjoy , in theory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British governn*1ent , which // 504 April , drove our fathers to arms , were infinitely less grievous than the laws in question . Nor is there any question of national or party politics , that now excites the sensibility of the people of the United States , which so much concerns them as this subject , in regard to which so great an apathy prevails . Harsh , however , as the expression may sound , if the people , possessing the means of a perfect and instant remedy in their hands , will not apply it , they ought to suffer . Were it not that the unfortunate class who suffer most  --  the poor and friendlessare unable effectually to make their wishes felt , and their rights respected , nothing would need to be said . A fortnight 's time , devoted to the subject by the General Court , would be amply sufficient to enact a statute , which would bring the law nearer to humanity and reason ; and , if the people wish for such a statute , it is very easy to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious exertions to effect this end , I remain , &amp;c . ' In the suggestions made in these letters , of the nature of the remedy to be applied to this great and acknowledged evil , the prevailing idea seems to be that of drawing a line of distinction between debts of different classes , and *bolishing imprisonment for those of small amount . This plan has already been acted upon to a certain extent in several of the States . In this Commonwealth , and in Maine , imprisonment is not allowed for a debt under five dollars . Mr. Webster proposes , that the limit should be enlarged to thirty , and provision is made to this effect in a bill reported in the Senate of this State during the late session of the General Court , but which had not been acted upon when this article was written . In Maryland , imprisonment was abolished for debts under thirty dollars , by an act passed at the late session of the Legislature of that State . In New Hampshire , the limit is fixed at thirteen dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States in which the practice has been abolished entirely . The adoption of this measure in those States , is probably to be attributed , in a great degree , to the unwearied exertions of Colonel R. M. Johnson , who has done more to awaken the public attention to this crying evil , than any other person in the country . Wp feel the more pleasure in doing justice to his benevolent intentions in this respect , inasmuch as we have had occasion , in a preceding number , to question the correctness of his , no doubt , equally honest views , upon another subject of considerable importance . The distinction between large and small debts , to which we // have alluded , as the basis of the new regulations , which have been adopted in this and some other States , is obviously untenable in principle . Whether imprisonment for debt be regarded as a privilege belonging to the creditor , or as an inconvenience to be suffered by the debtor , there is plainly in theory no good reason to be given , why it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may go farther , and say with safety , that a distinction of this kind is not only not founded in any correct principle , but is actually contrary to natural justice . The only motive for allowing imprisonment for debt at all , must be the supposed advantage resulting to the creditor , from this mode of enforcing payment of his debt . But the distinction in question gives this advantage to a person who has lent a large sum of money , and takes it away from one who has lent a small one . In other words , it confers upon the wealthy , who want it least , a privilege which is refused to the poor . The distinction is therefore in theory untenable , and even unjust , but it is nevertheless true , that the adoption of it may produce a great deal of practical good ; and if , as appears to be generally supposed , a reform predicated on this principle is the only one which the public feeling would admit in this part of the country , we should cheerfuliy give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of course much greater than that of large ones , and of the cases of actual imprisonment , a very great proportion are for debts of trifling amount . This point is satisfactorily established in the above extract from the Report before us , where it is stated on authority , that the number of persons imprisoned for more than twenty and less than one hundred dollars , is not one third as great as the number imprisoned for less than twenty dollars ; ' and that the number of persons imprisoned for more than one hundred dollars each , is very small in comparison with the number imprisoned for less than twenty dollars . ' This being the case , the abolition of imprisonment for small debts , is , in other words , an abolition of imprisonment for debt in by far the greater number of cases , that actually occur in practice . It is obvious , therefore , that however untenable , or even unjust , may be the distinction in theory , the practical relief afforded by its adoption may be very considerable . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cheerfully concur in recommending it to the public , if it be in fact // impracticable to obtain a reform on a more consistent plan . But we are free to confess , that we can see no reason why the abolition of imprisonment for debt in all cases , where there is no fraud , should be a less popular measure than the abolition of imprisonment for small debts . We conceive on the contrary , that it ought to be in principle , and of course must he in fact ,  --  whenever the subject shall be well understood ,  --  a more popular one . The distinction , as we have shown already , is in favor of the rich and against the poor . It is therefore essentially unpopular . On the other hand , the rich , in whose favor the line is professedly drawn , can derive no practical benefit from the privilege , at least where the poor debtor 's oath operates as a complete discharge of the debt . No person would attempt to enforce a large debt by a process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal comfort , the opportunity of getting rid of it entirely . We are at a loss to imagine in what portion of the community this distinction between large and small debts is to find the great favor , which it is supposed to possess . rube rich , who are ostensibly benefited by it , have really no motive for wishing to retain it , and the poor , against whom it operates , can not be supposed to desire its establishment . It is advantageous to no one , and if not practically oppressive , is at least entirely nugatory . We are , therefore , of opinion , that a proposal to abolish imprisonment for debt in all cases , would be more likely to gain favor in our legislative bodies and with the people at large , than the half-way measures , to which we have alluded . There are , doubtless , many persons who would object to any measure of this description , although the number is , we believe , already very small , and rapidly diminishing from day to day ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , must object equally to a partial and a total abolition ; while all who wish for any reform in this respect , ought , as far as any motive of principle or interest is concerned , to desire that it may be complete . Even the collecting lawyers , the only persons who have any real interest in sustaining the practice of imprisonment for debt , have no motive for preferring a partial to a total abolition , for if , as we have already remarked , the power of imprisoning for large debts is and must be in its nature merely nominal , the retaining of it would of course give the lawyers no additional business . On the view which we take of the subject , no distinction // should be made , excepting between the cases which are , and are not , tainted with fraud . Imprisonment for debt should be wholly abolished . The laws already in force against the obtaining and retaining of property under false pretences , should be revised in such a way as to accommodate them better to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure . The great defect in this part of our jurisprudence now , is , that although the fraudulent debtor , or , to use a more appropriate term , the swindler , may be punished , the person whom he has defrauded has no means of recovering his money . After suffering the penalties which the law attaches to his offence , the offender may find himself at large with the fruits of his iniquity still in his possession . As a remedy for this evil , it would be necessary , in cases where fraud could U* proved , to provide , that the body should be taken and held as a pledge for the forthcoming property . Under these circumstances many offenders would doubtless escape , because there are many cases where it may be next to impossible to prove a fraud , whatever certainty there may be of its existence ; but this result is unavoidable under any system of legislation , and would not occur more frequently , if imprisonment for debt were entirely abolished , than it does now . It is often objected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolition of imprisonment for debt , whether partial or total , would operate unfavorably by increasing the difficulty of obtaining credit . This might be to a certain extent a temporary inconvenience , but would prove in the end a real benefit . The universal prevalence of the credit system in this country is undoubtedly one of the worst features in the state of our society , and any change , whether of laws or manners , which would tend to counteract this system , would cut off a very fruitful source of poverty and wretchedness . It is not , however , our present intention to treat this subject in great detail ; but rather to submit for the consideration of our readers , the facts and opinions , which we have already quoted from this Report . As a practical evil affecting the personal comfort of the mass of the people , imprisonment for debt is probably more oppressive , than any of the positive inflictions of the worst administered governments . Where , for example , the system of lettres de cachet in France interfered with the happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an equal extent , with that of ten , we might perhaps say with // safety , a hundred . It appears to us impossible , that it can ultimately be maintained under the growing intelligence and liberality of the times , and we confidently trust , that the present generation will not readily yield to their successors the honor of erasing this remnant of barbarism from the civil code of the country.
