txt Since we last called the attention of our readers to the popular romances of our countryman , Mr. Cooper , they have been presented to the world with a rapidity , which scarcely allows us to examine one , before we receive intelligence of the arrival of its successor . So far as success can be received as an evidence of merit , their superiority must be considered as beyond question ; the seal of public approbation having been set by acclamation upon some of them , and a liberal : share of praise accorded to all . They have been translated into various languages , and read with as much avidity on the banks of the Danube , as by the dwellers amid the forests , and by the rivers of our western world ; nor is it improbable , that future travellers will find them , as Mr. Walsh did those of Sir Walter Scott , beyond the farthest boundaries of the vast German empire . This , as Goldsmith remarked of a somewhat different testimonial , this is fame ; and it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companions of the aged , and the delight of the young , in regions wider and more remote than the ambition of the most relentless conqueror ever aspired to subdue , may console himself for all the censure or reluctant praise of critics ; as the great philosopher of Athens was compensated by the veneration of his fellow-citizens , for the strictness of the conjugal discipline which he endured at home . Still , though we are far from denying that success is in many cases , a fair test of excellence , it would not be safe to consider it as a conclusive proof of merit of the very highest order . It would probably be found on inquiry , that there are few romances of which a larger number of copies have been , and continue to be sold , than the Scottish Chiefs ; // which , after the strange enthusiasm which attended its first appearance had subsided , was not estimated very highly by those who wish to see faithful representations of character and manners , together with a tolerable adherence to correct taste . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different description ; his success has also been undiminished and uniform , and even greater , if we are correctly informed , abroad , than in his own country . We wish to avail ourselves of the Opportunity presented by the publication of his last work , to offer a few general remarks upon the #causes of his success , and upon the rank to which he is entitled among the masters of romantic narrative ; and we are the more inclined to do this , because some have appeared to believe , that there is a prevailing disposition to withhold the commendation , which is justly due to him . There is no doubt , that very various opinions are entertained by different persons in regard to the precise degree of his merit ; while the vast circulation and liberal reception of his writings forbid us to believe in the existence of any thing like prejudice , or a disposition to undervalue them . These differences of opinion , in regard to works of imagination , are very natural , and imply no reproach upon the writers ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different qualities . Some delight in brilliant delineations of natural scenery , while others are to be satisfied only by a series of rapid and bustling incidents ; and there are many more , who consider no merit equal to that of a discriminating and powerful description of character . The union of these qualities , each in its highest degree , might constitute what in a novelist would he entitled to the name of perfection ; but such a combination is too rare , to render it a just subject of complaint against a writer , that he fails to unite them all . Yet nothing is more certain , than that the want of equal excellence in all , will induce some readers to consider him as wanting in every thing that constitutes real merit , while others will pronounce him perfect , b*cause he excels in the display of the particular one , which they look upon as most essential . It is but fair to notice one circumstance , which has probably affected in some degree the judgments which many have formed in regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period at which he first presented himself to the public view . It was at the time , when the whole sphere was light with the brilliancy of an orb of unequalled splendor , that he voL. xxxll. - No. 71. // first rose above the horizon ; and who could wonder that his lustre , however unborrowed and independent it might be , should be overpowered by the excessive brightness of the great central luminary ? We have called this a misfortune ; and to a wri-* ter , even of very superior merit , it certainly is so ; because the unusual excellence of him , who engrosses most of the public attention , has established an unusual standard , which those who follow in his footsteps are required to equal . The same lot has fallen to others in other times . The surpassing power of Shakspeare has thrown the other great dramatists of his day so effectually into shade , that many look with a sort of wonder upon the labors of those commentators , who have lately dragged them from their obscurity ; as if the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elevate the bodle ' which he purchased of the travelling packman , into the unmerited dignity of a Roman coin . Many other examples might be found in that most remarkable and least understood of all history , the history of literature . They who would in one age have been leaders , are in another brought in subjection to the influence of some more powerful mind ; as the military talent of modern times , vast as it was , has been lost and forgotten in the superiority of that of Napoleon . There is commonly a strong disposition among men of inferior talent , to imitate what they do not hope to equal . They do this , not because they admire the object of their imitation ; but because the public voice is loud in its praise , and seems to give assurance of success to those , who follow in the same approved and beaten track ; and they are content to believe , that a tolerable degree of external resemblance will atone for the want of intellectual equality . It has been sometimes asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cooper ought to be enrolled among the servile herd , as the initator of Scott . It is not improbable , that , had Waverley never appeared , he might not have devoted himself to this department of literature . He might have been conscious , that the preparation of such romances as were fashionable before that period , was a task wholly unsuited to his powers ; he might have submitted to a necessity , against which he could hardly hope to struggle with success ; he might have been prevented from attempting to excel , by the persuasion , that no individual talent could give a new direction to the public taste . Indeed , to effect this change , required a power like that which the ancients ascribed // to the monarch of the winds . It is an enterprise in which success is rarely , and in general , very slowly obtained ; and in which the want of it is as fatal , as the unsuccessful attempt to guide the chariot of the sun . The writers of the present day are not so ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to encounter this hazard ; the principle which leads to an attempt to reform the prevailing taste , is very different from that , which animates reformers of religious sentiment . It was only after long deliberation , that Scott , a man in the full maturity of his powers , and crowned with all the honors which popular admiration could possibly bestow , ventured to ofli*r his own romances to the public view . He looked upon the experiment as doubtful , and upon the chances of failure as much the more numerous ; the advice of a single friend induced him to abandon the undertaking for years ; and when his resolution was at last taken , it was so executed , that the reproach of failure should not rest upon a name , which men had hitherto known only to honor . Here was no want of confidence in his own powers ; but simply a persuasion , that the task of guiding the popular taste might he beyond the ability of any single mind . It is no injustice to Mr. Cooper to doubt , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous and untrodden path ; or that , finding that others had gone before with glory and success , he was content to follow . But it would be unjust to believe , that he followed for the purpose of imitation merely . It would be as fair to imagine , that the voyager who doubles the Cape of Good Hope by a course , which he might not have had enterprise enough to discover , must of necessity pursue precisely the same track , or the same commercial objects with the adventurous mariner , whose sail was first spread upon that unknown ocean . So far from regarding Mr. Co operas an imitator , we believe , that he imitates Scott only , in his adhcrence to truth and nature ; and we wish that such imitation were more common than it is . We must look elsewhere for the secret of his success ; and with the purpose of explaining our own impressions as to its cause , we will offer a few remarks upon the qualifications of the novelist in general . Power of description is as essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the painter ; both may be exhibited to a certain extent by inferior minds , but excellence in either is the sure indication of genius . A Chinese artist might draw the mere outlines of the human face with as much precision as // one of our best portrait painters ; but the effect of his representation would be wholly lost , because he would consider this correctness of outline as the highest effort of art . All that al- N ternation of light and shade , which make the image appear as if starting from the canvass ,  --  all the rich and beautiful coloring , which invests it with truth and reality ,  --  all that expression , which is the informing soul of the picture , as it is of the living countenance ; - would be neglected or forgotten . It is the neglect or observance of these requisites , or rather the degree , in which they are neglected or observed , which constitutes the dif .. ference between artists of a high , and those of an inferior order . In like manner , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful scene in nature ; he might give , with geometrical exactness , the relative magnitude and distance of every object which attracts the eye , and thus produce a plan , which would do honor to a topographical engineer ; while another , by a bold and comprehensive survey of some of the prominent features of the landscape , will set it at once before us in all its rich and varied beauty , as it bursts upon the view , when illuminated with the clear brilliancy of our own autumnal sky . All that the mathematician in the Persian Letters remembered of the picturesque beauty of a country-seat which he had visited , was the length and breadth of the mansion . This , however , is but a limited view of what is comprehended in the term description . It includes action as well as repose ; and in addition to this , it extends to the effect of human agency , in every mode of its exhibition ; now converting the forest into the abode of civilization and domestic happiness , or directing the movements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braves the elements in its ocean-path , and now pursuing the humble toils , that make up the business of daily life . In this power of description , we consider Mr. Cooper 's excellence as of the very highest order . There are many instances , which crowd upon the recollection ; but they are probably familiar to most of our readers ; and we shall have occasion presently to refer to some , when we allude to other qualities , for which he is distinguished . There is another qualification of the novelist , which is vet more rarely found . The talent , which invests the landscape with life and beauty , may be inadequate to the more arduous task of penetrating the dark mysteries of the heart , of understanding those changes of repose and passion , which roll over // it as the winds and calm succeed each other on the sea , whose causes the philosopher may perhaps discover , hut whose coming no one can foretell . Study alone can not give this power ; though it may be improved and perfected by study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , which may exist without it ; hut it can not itself exist without genius . Every man knows , how proverbially ignorant are solitary students of human nature ; while men of the world , without an4y superior pretensions to talent , often possess this knowledge in a remarkable degree ; and the study and habit of observation to which we have alluded , must have for their object what Pope has called the proper study of mankind , ' and must be acquired in society and the world . In the physical world , similar causes are followed by similar effects , and the operation of disturbing forces may , in general , be calculated ; but in the moral world , the case is widely different . The effects there produced by similar causes , vary with every variety of tem-* perament and character . In some , the exhibition of passion is as furious as the mountain-torrent ; while in others , its approaches are as calm and as still as those of the tropical hurricane . Inferior writers of tragedy are apt to suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent and loud ; but the great master of the English drama has connected this expression of it with the helpless imbecility of poor Lear . No outward sign bet rays the deep , unrelenting , and almost unearthly revenge of lago . We know of nothing in Lord Byron 's works that displays more forcibly his acquaintance with the heart , than the passage in Don Juan , in which he represents the return of the old pirate to his home ; - not with reproaches , not with the flush of anger on his brow ,  --  but with the cold tranquillity , which would befit the avenger of another 's wrongs . These , however , are the fiercest and most overwhelming passions ; but even these are not more difficult to portray , than the less eventful ones , which so often ruffle the smooth surface of ordinary life , or the numberless motives which influence man 's wayward actions . It is the power of illustrating the operation of these passions upon the conduct , and of divining these motives , not as the world is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposing them to be the real ones , which is the chief glory of the novel-writer and the dramatist . Man 's nature in our day is the same as it has been in ages past ; the revolutions of opinion have little influence // upon the heart . Some writers appear to have intuitively possessed this power ; while many others , conscious of their deficiency in this respect , have substituted for it the faculty of describing external manners , and peculiarities of thought and feeling . These are undoubtedly modified , and sometimes wholly changed by the alterations which are made by time in the character of society ; and the faculty of perceiving and delineating them is by no means an unimportant one ; but it is the result of observation , rather than of genius ; and though sometimes substituted and mistaken for the other , is in its nature inferior . It is the province of comedy to describe the peculiarities of certain classes of individuals , and the varieties of manner among the people of different countries , which compose what we call national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term character , when applied to communities , has not precisely the same meaning that it bears in its application to individuals . The French have few translations of English comedy , and it would be impossible to introduce one of Moliere 's comedies , literally translated , with effect upon the English stage . The last experiment has been frequently tried , first by Dryden , and subsequently by Foote ; but we do not hear of the representation of any of them at the present day ; nor do we find , that the English comic writers are held in any great respect abroad . As to the higher order of English tragedies , the case is different . The representation of them might perhaps fail to please a French audience , because they are written in defiance of certain rules , which such an audience have been in the habit of regarding as essential ; but the superiority of Shakspeare is as freely admitted on the Continent now , as it has always been in his own country . We may perhaps best illustrate our idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to Richardson and Smollett , as exhibiting favorable examples of each . One aims at the delineation of manners ; the other of the heart . Both attract the reader ; because both these qualities aid in constituting the truth of the resemblance , as we determine that of a portrait partly by the costume , and partly by the expression of the features . Miss Edgeworth 's descriptions of certain peculiarities of Irish character , and of particular modes of society , are universally attractive , because they are evidently the result of her own keen and delicate observation ; but when she shoots beyond the limits of her own peculiar sphere , and endeavors , // by the light of imagination , to find her way through the labyrinths of diplomacy , or the catacombs of the law , or when she aims at giving truth and reality to her fictions by her knowledge of human nature only , her success is not so obvious . The great defect of the throng of novelists , who flourished at the beginning of this century , was their want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleeting shades of manners . instead of attempting to portray either , they substituted sentiment for the one , and an odd sort of masquerade for the other ; and after peopling an imaginary world with beings of their own creation , exhibited the panorania to the public , who gazed upon it with the same feeling , with which Miranda in the Tempest first looked upon the shipwrecked prince . It was of no consequence , that their heroes resembled in external qualities the Coriolanus and C*sar of the English stage , a century ago , who trod the boards in gold-laced coats and periwigs ; or that in every other respect , they were as shadoxvy and unsubstantial as the ghosts of Celtic tradition , through whose forms the stars dim-twinkled ; ' the kangaroo was not seen with more delight by Blumenbach , the giraffe by all Paris , nor the white Indian by the fashionables of London , than these hitherto unknown beings were welcomed by the confirmed admirers of romance . But the pleasure which arises from the neglect of truth and nature , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their day . The characters of romance , like those of real life , must in future be invested with the common attributes of humanity . We have already intimated , that we consider Mr. Cooper as possessing , in a very 4*iigh degree , the first qualification to which we have adverted ; that of power in description . His delineations of natural scenery possess all the vividness and distinctness , which constitute the principal charm of all such representations ; and they are graphic also ; they bear about them an air of truth , which satisfies us that they are real . They are not magnified by being seen through a mist ; but each object has its proportionate magnitude and distinctness of outline , and every scene is like a beautiful prospect at the hour of a clear sun-rise . The writer tells us what he has himself seen , and not what others have described to him . His style has not the elaborate and finished beauty of that of Mr. Irving ; but if his coloring be less beautiful , his pencil is equally bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the love of nature // can confer ; for , unlike the veiled prophet , it is to her devoted worshippers , and to them alone , that the Mighty 1*'Lother condescends to unveil her awful face . This power is not to he gained from books . If we would he satisfied of this , we have only to read the oriental poetry of Moore and Southey , 1 ) 0th of whom have pillaged with pious sacrilege all the treasures of the East , which mere hooks could give ; and have endeavored to dazzle our eyes by a display of magnificence , that we may not perceive the indistinctness of their own conceptions . There are lands , ' says Cleaveland in the Pirate , where the eye may look bright upon groves of the palm and the cocoa , and where the foot may move light as a galley under sail over fields carpeted with flowers , and savannas surrounded by aromatic thickets , and where subjection is unknown , except that of the brave to the bravest , and of all to the most beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly ; but it wants the clearness and distinctness of reality . Nor is the knowledge of the scene which is descrihed , enough , without the faculty of poetical association . While one is admiring the bold and variegated scenery around the Highland lakes , another may he counting the cost of converting them into feeders of a canal for the passage of coal-boats . We do not , as we have already said , deem it necessary to multiply examples of Mr. Cooper 's superiority in this power of description , as the finest of them will readily recur to the recollection of most of his readers . It is , however , most strikingly displayed in one department , in which no one can accuse him of imitation ; in which nobody has preceded him , or has yet attempted to become his rival . Whatever opinions may be entertained of his success in other respects , all will agree , that his boldest and most triumphant march is on the mountain wave , lie treads the deck with the same conscious pride , with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of ocean , winds and sky ,  --  the wild excitement and hurry of the combat ,  --  the terrors of the storm ,  --  the still deeper terrors of the desperate passage through the narrow channel , which despair only would attempt , and nothing hut perfect skill could accomplish ,  --  all that a sailor sees , dares , and suffers , are as familiar to him , as the scenery of the haunts of childhood is to us . He has made the ship emphatically a thing of life ; we are interested in its fortunes , as we sympathize in those of a living heing ; and when the graceful Arid is dashed upon the rock , we hardly wonder at the feeling which // tempts the rough old mariner to share its fate . In fact , if we were called upon to select passages of vivid and powerful description , we know not where we could find many more striking , than those which Mr. Cooper has given us of the wonders of the sea ; they are the more sure evidences of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are peculiarly his own ; and the effect which they produce is as different from that which is produced by the nautical descriptions of others , those of Miss Porter in the Scottish Chiefs , for example , as the movements of an opera-dancer are superior to those of Maelzel 's automata . We are aware , that they have been occasionally denounced by individuals who profess to be well versed in these mysteries , as untrue to nature ; but the testimony of other equally competent judges is no less decisive in their favor ; and , in fact , the objections appear to be in general confined to the account which he has given of the dialect and manners of his sailors . Without pretending to decide between these conflicting authorities , on the point in regard to which they are at issue , we need only remark , that these objections have scarcely any application to other particulars , in which we consider Mr. Cooper 's merits as beyond question . We can not , however , award him the same measure of praise for his skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his ordinary failing ; but he seems to be afflicted with a want of knowledge of human nature , which prevents him from giving a proper degree of distinctness and individuality , and , above all , variety to the persons of the drama . They seem to have been selected on the same enlightened principle which guided Falstaff in filling the ranks of his gallant company ; mortal men ,  --  mortal men ; they 11 fill a pit as well as better . ' In his creations of the softer sex , Mr. Cooper appears determined , that they shall not be exposed to the imputation of bringing a snare , by dint of vain and unprofitable attractions ; and they are accordingly so painted , as to leave the delinquent without apology , who suffers them to beguile him . When he wishes them to assume the air of unusual liveliness and grace , he artfully invests them with the habiliments of the other sex . The most striking character which he has yet drawn , with the exception , perhaps , of the Spy , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decline , and absolute decrepitude , until the reader is prepared to receive with composure the intelligence of his dissolution . // This may be well enough ; but there is not the same justifiable cause for introducing us anew to Betty Flanagan , notwithstanding the unexpected change in her condition , or for causing Sergeant Hollister to dawn upon the reader a second time , in the lull-blown glories of a militia captain . His blacks , also , may be very meritorious personages in their way ; but it wearies the spirit to see a detachment of them grinning upon us at every turn , like the pyramid of shining faces that watched the dance through a window in the Legend of Sleepy Hollow . This is a sort of demonology , which is very apt to pall upon the sense ; and we are not unfrequently tempted to wish , that the author were more inclined to imitate the philanthropic views of the Colonization Society , and to export them , at least , from the dominions of romance . We may possibly subject ourselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New England character impels us to declare , that it has never been our fortune to encounter any Yankee , in any novel , who has the slightest claim to be considered as a fair specimen of the genus . To speak plainly , we look upon all these pretended representatives of that character , as not a whit better than wooden nutmegs . We venture to assert , that no such ogre was ever permitted to roam at large among us , as Mr. Galt has recently created , under the denomination of Zerobabel Hoskins ; nor are we prepared to admit , that our villages are infested by Hiram Doolittles . These walking notes of interrogation are also represente4 as disburthening themselves in a dialect , which has long since forfeited its claims to be considered as a living language , if , indeed , it were ever spoken by any of our tribes . With all our respect for Mr. Irving , we feel under no greater obligations to him in this particular . His Ichabod Crane belongs to the same class of non-descripts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit of being representatives of New England , as was ancient Pistol to that of being the hero of King Henry 's army . Mr. Cooper does not appear to attempt the description of a character of a high order , with half the satisfaction with which he enters upon that of one of a less dignified cast . His views are sarcastic or ludicrous ; his inclination is evidently to the comic ; and he appears to put some restraint upon himself , like one who is performing an allotted and unwelcome task , when he leaves the domain of broad farce . Such characters as Washington // seem forced upon him by a sort of necessity ; they are a very unmanageable burden , and one of which he very gladly rids himself at the first convenient season ; and for this no reasonable person could blame him , if Washington had been the person he describes him . In making them dignified , he is rather apt to make them dull . He communicates no definite idea of them to others , because he does not appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though a source of occasional amusement , is an unfortunate one for the novelist ; for besides inducing him to dwell upon a certain class of character to the exclusion of others , it renders even that class exaggerated , and leads in both ways to limited and erroneous views of human nature . Mr. Cooper 's lawyers are all knaves , and his physicians either bores or quacks . One might almost be led to suspect , that he finds more pleasure in Ben Pump and Dick Fid , to say nothing of other personages of a similar character , than in those of higher intellectual pretensions . These remarks , however , are not to be taken without some qualification . The character of the Spy is bold and striking ; and , as the true Harvey Birch has come forward to claim it as his own , it seems to be too late to question its reality ; though the voluntary descent to a degrading occupation would hardly seem perfectly consistent with the lofty tone of moral feeling , which disinterested patriotism supposes or inspires . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more distinctly conceived , and supported with greater vigor and effect . The honest , untaught simplicity of the old hunter ,  --  the almost devotional feeling , which his solitary communion with nature has inspired , and the sorrow with which he witnesses the progress of civiiization ,  --  all of which are traits which one might naturally expect to find in him , are well portrayed , and have the additional merit of entire originality . The Pilot excites strong interest at first , because we expect him to throw aside his mysterious disguise , and reveal himself as the man-of.xvar emerges from the mist ; but he dwindles at the close into a dim and shadowy sketch . Nor do the Red Rover and Tiller leave any very deep impression on the mind of the reader . We havebeen sometimes inclined to suspect , that the whole machinery of these novels has been set in motion , in order to give the writer an opportunity to display his descriptive power . His representations of the Indians have been often censured , on the ground , that he // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pretensions , and that his view of their manners is much too favorable . It may be so ; but there can be little doubt , that his portraits accord very well with the ideas which are commonly entertained in regard to the Indian ; nor would it be altogether just to condemn them , when the impressions of different observers differ so essentially . We do not see that the savage state is at all inconsistent with the possession of many imposing and noble qualities ; nor would it be unnatural , that independence and loftiness of feeling should sometimes produce the effects , which many suppose to be peculiar to a different state of society . Rob Roy is fierce and vindictive , and his wife has rather the advantage over our savages in point of ferocity ; but notwithstanding Mr. Jarvie 's distrust of the latter , the poet has ascribed noble sentiments , and occasional refinement of manners and *feeling to both . These are , in our judgment , the prominent merits and defects of Mr. Cooper . So far as his knowledge of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its range is too limited . It is this defect , which makes his historical ro* mances , or rather the historical part of his romances , any thing but engaging ; their characters pass by us , like the busy population in the crowded street ; and after having been for some time in their company , we feel the chill of their icy dignity , and take our leave of them with the same frigid tranquillity , with which Johnson dismissed his folio dictionary ; inwardly resolving , that it shall not be our fault , if we encounter them again . It is not the business of romance , as it appears to be of history , to paint kings with their crowns and sceptres , and inferior dignitaries in their court-dresses , when , for all the purposes of amusement or instruction , they might as well be lying in state ; we wish to look behind the curtain , and to see them by the fireside , in the capacity of men ; to hear their familiar conversation , to watch the play of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we may , if we will , know those around us . Conversation reveals those sentiments , which indicate , if they do not constitute character ; in the drama , it is the only means of disclosing character at all ; if we would understand the effect , which acquaintance with the heart is capable of producing , we have only to turn from Irene to king Lear . The field of the novelist is greater , and his colors more varied ; but it is not well to attempt to dispense with this dramatic power ; for // if he possess it not , and his personages make their appearance with solemn majesty , as if put upon their good behavior , and utter their responses with the wariness of a diplomatist , who is afraid of being circumvented , their strict propriety will not be an effectual antidote for their dullness . These pattern characters are afflicting enough in real life ; but in a novel , where there is no escaping from them , they are like the east-wind in spring . The author seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fert* directed her proteg6e ; Give us a little religion , my dear , in the first place , and then you may talk of something else . ' Cowper 's idea of a tea-party is but a type of this . Such is the fault of a certain portion of Mr. Cooper 's characters ; his comic personages , who , as we have already observed , are evidently his favorites , contrive to make themselves heard with a vigor and effect , which migl*mt be very advantageously imitated by their betters . So long as he draws from the life , he draws well ; but the field of his observation should be more extended , in order to give perfection to his plan . One of the most prominent attractions of Mr. Cooper 's works , is his description of American scenery , and of a variety of incidents and circumstances , which could be found in no other country . This is naturally a merit in our eyes , and , as we have reason to believe , in the eyes of foreigners also . These descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bestow . Poets have a large license accorded to them in this respect ; and they occasionally create a world of their own , with climate and scenery of their own making . But it is better for the novelist , to take the world as he finds it ; or the result of his labors will be lost . It would have been quite absurd in Johnson , to have transported his Greenland Ajut to the happy valley ; and the writer of romance should feel in this respect , like the Highland outlaw . The world has not a prospect which could console me for the loss of the rocks and cairns , wild as they are , which you see around us . ' The world has not , in fact , a nobler prospect to give , than that which our own country presents to the eye of genius . It may fly , almost with the rapidity of thought , from the abodes of luxury and splendor , beyond the farthest limits of civilization , and the change will be like ascending to some remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may contemplate the creations , which are springing up , as if by enchantment , beneath // the hand of enterprise ; or it may watch the infinite variety of character arising from the thousand modes of existence and diversities of condition , which abound where nothing is stationary , and every thing is new and progressive ; and our equally varied scenery will make the ample and magnificent hack-ground of the picture . It may thus invest itself with a crown of glory , like that which Mr. Irving tells us , is seen at sunset to encircle the mountains that tower above the Hudson ; and it may do more than this ; it may associate the name of its possessor with the recollection of the headlands and rivers and mountains of his native land , and thus impart to his name an existence as permanent as theirs . Such is the field , on which Mr. Cooper has entered with encouraging success ; but he has not accomplished all , which his powers seem capable of effecting ; it abounds in richer treasures than any , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glen 's Fallsthe terrific conflagration in the forest ,  --  the sweep of the flame over the vast level of the western prairie ,  --  the distant view of the majestic Hudson , and the Highlands that lift themselves upward from its banks , are examples of his talent in describing the appearances , which his own country presents to his view , that will not soon fade from the recollection of the reader . The remarks which we have already made , render it unnecessary to enter into a critical examination of Mr. Cooper 's style . It partakes of the merits and defects to which we have already alluded . In description , it is copious and animated , and often rises to a high degree of poetical beauty ; but when character is his theme , it is very apt to become inaccurate and cold . In consequence of this , his conversations , instead of being , as they should be , the portion of his works on which we most delight to dwell , are the very parts , which we are most willing to hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The construction of his story , too , we regard as a matter of inferior importance . There is no standard of interest or probability , by which its excellence can be tested ; and the combinations of possible events have been so far exhausted , that it is hard to complain of want of originality . It is enough , that it satisfies the reader . With these impressions in regard to Mr. Cooper , we need hardly say , that it was with the enthusiasm of Byron , that we welcomed him once more upon the waters , yet once more . ' But we do not propose to compress the contents of his work // into a few of our pages , or to present a barren outline of its story ; for it is more just to the reader , and certainly far more so to the author to suppose , what is doubtless the fact , that the Water-Witch is by this time familiar to all the admirers of romance , and that each has formed his own estimate of its merits . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correctness of the remarks which we have made , than for any other purpose . Its family-likeness is rather too strong to some of the preceding productions of its author ; and we find in it the same want of distinctness and power in the delineation of character , of which we have already complained . Tiller , the Skimmer of the Seas , ' is a bold , adventurous and skilful seaman , and nothing mole ; and Alderman Van Beverout and Ludlow , who stand next to him in point of prominence , have no personal qualities which attract and command the attention .
