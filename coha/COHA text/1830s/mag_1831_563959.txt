txt ON the presumption that the readers of this article possess the feelings common to our race , they will scarcely be altogether incurious to know , why two works so different in their titles are made the subject of the same review ? The information explanatory of this may be communicated in a few words . The works are from the pen of the same individual , and constitute different portions of his means for carrying into effect the same purpose . Their author is a counsellor at law , to whom nature has been bounteous in intellectual endowments , and who is not more distinguished by his talents , than by his attainments in literature and general knowledge , and his accomplishments as a writer . His object in composing these works and submitting them to the public , was to bring to light a mass of interesting historical truth , which had hitherto lain concealed , at least from all but curious inquirers , and thus to vindicate his country from certain unfounded and injurious charges , preferred against her by foreigners , sometimes perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spirit of mischief And should this paper do justice to the productions which form its subject , it will show the effort of our author to be as able and successful , as it is patriotic and praiseworthy . This ought to be sufficient to fill , for the present , the measure of his ambition . We doubt not that the further prosecution of his purpose , in which we are pleased to understand he is engaged , will give him fresh claims toi distinction in letters . To the volumes before us more ambitious titles might have been affixed , without a violation of justice or modesty . Those bestowed on them are not indicative of the multifarious and important matter they contain . They are rather veils to obscure the amount of truth and beauty that lies beneath them , than mirrors to reflect its image . Distinguished individuals , as well as their deeds , belong to their country , and constitute its principal strength and glory . All high and successful efforts to reward such individuals for their labors and services , by holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them merited honors , belong also to the country , as the fruits of genius , and are entitled to the applause and patronage of the community . It is not easy to decide which most essentially benefits mankind ,  --  the hero who bleeds for his country in a righteous cause , the sage who ministers to her in the character of a wise and virtuous legislator , the orator and diplomatist who prochiim her rights and defend her interests , or the scholar who fitly records such achievements . If , in examining the question , the durability of the performances of each , and the permanency of the renown conferred by them , be taken into the account , and justly estimated , the superiority will be necessarily awarded to the latter . Of all that is earthly , the pen only can immortalize . But for the historians , poets , and other writers of Greece and Rome , the glory of those countries would be now but a name ; or * Lectures on American Literature , with remarks on some passages of American History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , drawn from the living and the dead , with notices of other matters , by Ignatius Loyola Robertson , LL . D. a resident of the United States . // rather , less , because it would be unknown . Without scholars to give it substance and duration , modern glory would be equally a shadow . If this be true ,  --  and we do not believe that the enlightened and the virtuous will be inclined to question it ,  --  our author must himself rank with the worthies whose portraits he has so faithfully drawn , and whose stories he has so ably and eloquently told . In both works his object is strictly national , and might be aptly enough defined , an exposition of the literary and intellectual statistics of the United States . As already intimated , he as clearly contends for , and as strenuously maintains , what is the right , and interest , and glory of the country , as the warrior does in the field , the diplomatist in the cabinet , or the statesman and orator in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is as high and sacred a concern of th' nation , and ought to be as vigilantly and resolutely protected , as the liberty , property , and lfift*s of the citizens . If either individuals or communities neglect reputation , or supinely trust it to the keeping of others , they will lose it ; and not it alone , but the influence also which they exercised by means of it , whether for good or evil . He , therefore , who , in any way , suc'cessfully vindicates his country 's good name , is a public benefactor , and should be not only greeted but rewarded as such . - No one is ignorant of the discourteous and offensive practice ,  --  not to affix to it harsher epithets ,  --  of British writers , especially in their Reviews , Journals , and Books of Travels , in representing the American people as a degenerate race . Nor has their perseverance in it been less stubborn , than their purpose was unfriendly . In the face of the most conclusive evidence of its falsehood , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of profligate tongues , until letters were polluted by it , ignorance believed it , and intelligence and virtue turned from it , in all its varying shapes , with indignation and loathing . But although the calumny is still repeated by too many , its organs and advocates are comparatively so reduced in number , as to indicate that its final overthrow is near , and that truth and justice will flourish on its ruins . And to the consummation of those events , our author has ably contributed in the works we are considering . Shall we be told , that the evil of British calumny , being so near its end , will now expire of an incurable decay , and should be therefore forgotten , or at least no further resisted by us ? We think otherwise . The " snake " is indeed " scotched , " hut not killed ; and the sooner its writhings and misery are terminated , the better . Passing over various other grounds , our opinion to the effect here stated might rest on a recent manifestation of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review , we find the following extraordinary paragraph " With due deference and all tenderncss to our transatlantic brcthrcn , as they are miscalted , we beg leave to remark , that the rest of the world are pretty well agreed that , in almost every thing material , they have been progressing stern foremost , ever since they took the helm into their own hands , and their velocity in this wrong direction is likely to increase just in proportion as their exclusively democratic system shall be brought into snore intense operation . " * * * * " The United States have advanced in nothing but population and the cultivation of the soil . " * * * * " From the hour that in an excess of passion , they chose to fling away from their king , and to relinquish the immense benefits arising from a government checked by a powerful aristocracy , and allied with a church estabtishment , and trusted exclusively to the democratical branch of the community , // they have done nothing but prop agat itw the species , and chopping down forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of any branch of human knowledge , science , or art , one jot . " Such is the language in which we are spoken of* by a people who boast of their taste and refinement . To be sure , from the consummate folly and impudence of the passage , to say nothing of its premeditated violation of truth , and the vulgar sea and land patois which forms its diction , we believe it to be from the pen of Capt . Basil Hall ; and , in his individual capacity , he is as notorious for his trashiness and mendacity as a writer , as he is for his discourtesy and ingratitude as a man  --  a standard of comparison which his productions and behavior prove to be lofty . But no matter from whose pen it comes . It holds a place in the London Quarterly , which is a national work . We are authorized , therefore , to consider it a national sentiment ; and we conscientiously believe that it is so . Legitimately considered , a majority of the people , in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes the nation . But that a great majority of the British people have been so deceived by gazetteers , journalists , pamphleteers , tourists and others , as to credit the sentiment expressed in the Review , we are forbidden to doubt . In fact , the case can not be otherwise . For every single publication , telling truth of our country , that the people of England , as a body , have ever looked into , they have read fifty , intentionally defamatory of it . From the well-known principles of human nature , therefore , they must consider us in a state of ignorance and degeneracy . From some acquaintance , moreover , with different parts of England , we have reason to know that they do so . We speak of the , great mass of the population ; not of the few who are better informed . Yet , as relates also to the latter , we have often had occasion to be greatly surprised at their profound ignorance of America and its concerns . Even they have no correct knowledge of our character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . To these views respecting the people of Great-Britain , we know that there are many very honorable exceptions . Nor ought they to be all passed by , without the notice and acknowledgement they merit . It is gratifying to us , therefore , to record the following , in justice to the enlightened Editor of the " Scotsman , " one of the ablest papers in the kingdom . From that excellent Journal , Vol . XIII . No. 1014 , dated September 26th , 1829 , we extract a brief editorial paragraph , expressive of the writer 's views of our country . " A friend who has lately been making an extensive tour in the United States , has put into our hands a number of books and pamphlets which he brought home with him . Such publications are always acceptable to us . The United States are alive with the spirit of improvement , beyond every other country in the world , our own not excepted , and we find more pleasure in chronicling the march of society , and the triumphs of the useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troubles and convulsions which spring from vice and misery in old and crowded communities . From the prodigious strides which industry and enterprise are now taking in the United States , that new country already offers useful lessons in many points to the most ancient and improved States of Europe . " Could this paragraph , correct and liberal as it is , be permitted to circulate through the same channels with that we have extracted from the London Quarterly , the antidote might , in some measure , counteract the poison . But it is not to be expected , that a work , which , for the 63 // attainment of an end resolved on , gives currency to premeditated slander , will intentionally do any thing to frustrate its purposes . We have deemed it our duty , therefore , to aid in making the liberality of the " Scotsman " better known in the United States . But to return to our more immediate subject . The points of inferiority which our calumniators have charged on us are numerous . Nor , in relation to several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ignorance they exhibited was rio less striking than their open hostility and disregard of truth . A faithful representation of these slanders , and of the changes they underwent , to suit the policy , and gratify the evil passions of their propagators , were it not for its odiousness , would he an amusing picture . At one time we were pronounced inferior to our European ancestors in size , strength , symmetry , and activity of person , although observation has long since proved , that , in these respects , the descendants of British emigrants are almost universally superior to their parents . Even Captain Hall , who , in mind and body , is himself no bad specimen of cockneyisin , had the effrontery to repeat a portion of this falsehood ; and the slander here uttered is in correct keeping with his whole pasquinade on a people , who treated him with distinguished courtesy and kindness , and , if his manners " speak the man , " received him into the first well-bred society he ever entered . As respects the charge of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of our country . In equal violation of gallantry and truth , it has been extended to our females , who are among the most beautiful women of the world . For proof of this , we have only to refer to the testimony of all enlightened travelers , an*j to the productions of the pencil and the chisel , wherever they have appeared . Scarcely if at all does the beau ideal of foreign beauty , not excepting that of ancient Greece , surpass the reality we find at home . Who does not know that the beauty of American women has been the admiration of courts , and has received the homage of nobles , princes , and sovereigns ? The empress Josephine , the most fascinating woman of the age , was in truth an American ; for the West-India islands belong as really to the American continent , as Great-Britain and Ireland do to the European . Besides , their natives have lain , in common with ourselves , under the charge of degeneracy . Although we believe the fact is not gerteral*y known , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present the Ottoman throne , is the son of an American lady . His mother , like Josephine , was a West-Indian creole . Bound for Italy , to complete her education in a nunnery , she was captured in the Mediterranean , by a Turkish cruiser , and carried to Constantinople . When conveyed to the harem , her beauty so attracted the reigning chief , that he made her his second Sultana , and she became the mother of the present Sultan . It is believed that the superior liberality and kindness the latter has shown to Christians are owing to early impressions received from his mother ; a beginning , which may lead , if not to the conversion of the Turkish people , at least to an incalculable amelioration of their condition . Such has been already the influence , and such may be yet the glorious fruit of the beauty and virtue of an American woman ! As to the intellect of the females of our country , it needs no commendation from us . Its productions are its eulogy. // In relation to the stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to our hill-country in general , but more especially to that of Virginia and Vermont , and challenge the whole eastern hemisphere to match the population of those regions . But on this , as on every other subject , facts are preferable to general assertions* We trust , therefore , that a few of them will not be unacceptable . When Dr. Franklin was minister in Paris , he dined , with his diplomatic family and several other Americans , all fine looking men , at a public table where the Abbe Raynal was also a guest . Each of these distinguished individuals was seated in the midst of his own countrymen , on the opposite sides of the table . The Abbe , who was a firm believer in American degeneracy , addressed himself on that subject , with his usual eloquence , to our great compatriot . The latter , somewhat to the disappointment and chagrin of his friends around him , waited in silent patience , until the harangue was closed . He then replied to the following purport . " You , M. Abbe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise from your seat , with the six friends who are nearest to you , and I will do the same with an equal number of my countrymen who are nearest to me . " The invitation Was accepted , to the merriment of the table and the utter overthrow of the Abbe 's hypothesis . The Americans were , on an average , six feet high , and built in proportion ; while the Frenchmen were not more than five feet seven or eight inches , and correspondingly slender . The Abbe , joining in the laugh , acknowledged his defeat ; but pronounced it accidental . For this anecdote , we are indebted to Mr. Jefferson . A few years ago , we ourselves met , by accident , near the door of a hotel , in the state of Kentucky , seven persons , all known to each other , and engaged in conversation , whose aggregate weight amounted to near two thousand pounds . The height of the lowest individual was six feet two inches , and that of the tallest six feet six . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightest two hundred and fifty-five . They were all Americans , and most of them natives of the state in which we saw them . One fact more on this topic , and we have done . As we were walking for amusement , some years ago , in company with five other Americans , who had met accidentally in the saloon of Drury-lane theatre , we observed ourselves gazed at in a manner deemed exceptionable . On inquiring into the cause , we found it to be our inordinate size . The writer of this article , whose height is nearly six feet two inches , was the smallest of the party . From matter of supposed offence , the fact was changed into a subject of diversion . And yet we have been pronounced a diminutive people ! In fine , the average height of Americans surpasses that of the people of England , France , and most other European countries , by two inches at least ; some observers make the difference greater . In consequence of this , we understand that the military step of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , longer than that of the military of other nations . Again ; our prowess and firmness were once called in question . Yet history has recorded it , and both the land and the ocean testify to its truth , that these have been proved , in chastisement , on the persons of our reviler ; as often as we have met them on equal terms , in gen* // eral battle , or single combat . That error , therefore , has been beaten down by the most suitable weapon of logic , the argurnentum baculinum . We have been pronounced not only an enfeebled , but a short-lived race , entirely destitute of instances of longevity . Mr. Godwin , an English author now living , and enjoying the confidence of a great body of his fellow subjects , has asserted , in his late " Reply to Malthus on Population , " that in most parts of the United States ( and he has specified one of the healthiest of them ,  --  the state of Pennsylvania ) the inhabitants begin to feel the decrepitude of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . He has further asserted , that were it not for the constant tide of migration to them , from the north and from Europe , the states of the South and West would be soon depopulated , owing to their insalubrity , and the shattered constitutions of those who reside in them . His obvious meaning is , that the southern Americans are so near a state of impotency , as to be disqualified to people the earth by their descendants . Such , we say , are some of the specific charges preferred from abroad , denying us longevity and vigor of constitution . Let recorded facts in our own country answer them . They will be found abundantly in our bills of mortality , and our grave-stone inscriptions . Consult them , and they will prove , that , some parts of Russia excepted , no country in Europe furnishes , in proportion to its population , a greater number of octogenarians , nonagenarians , and centenarians , than the United States . Nor is this true , as some allege , of New-England alone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Louisiana , abound in instances of great longevity . From our late census it appears that North-Carolina , containing a population of 738,470 , numbers 304 persons who have reached and passed the age of one hundred years . As far as we are informed , this instance of popular longevity is unequalled . The western states have been too recently populated , by white inhabitants , to testify on the subject . But many of the Indians in them have lived to a very advanced age , and appearances promise that the Caucasians will do the same . Being in correspondence with a friend in England , in 1822 , on the subject of American longevity , we applied to the Hon. J. C. Calhoun , then Secretary of War , and were obligingly furnished by him with the following document , accompanied by others to substantiate its accuracy . " A statement of the number of non-commissioned officers , and privates of the regular troops furnished by the several states , at the close of the revolutionary war , showing how many each flirnished . New-Hampshire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 372 Connecticut , - 1,740 New-York , 1,169 New-Jersey , 675 Pennsylvania , 1,598 Delaware , 235 Maryland , 974 Virginia , *3*9 North-Carolina , 697 South-Carolina , 139 Georgia , 149 Total , 13,476 // Our revolutionary army was disbanded in 1783 . Between that time and 822 is included a period of thirty-nine years . It appears from the Pension-list in the war office , that , at the latter date , 5043 of the above 13,476 were still living . Nor did that number constitute the full amount of the survivers . Many others were known to be alive , whose names were not on the Pension-list , on account of their prosperous condition . Of the troops disbanded at the close of the war near twelve thousand are believed to have been natives of the United States . At that period their average age could not have been less than twenty-seven or twentyeight years . Probably it was more . In 1822 , then , there were still living five thousand and forty-three of our revolutionary soldiers , whose average age could not have been less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is well known , that soldiers are not the most temperate and regular in their habits . Search the annals of all nations , through all times , and it is confidently believed , that no similar instance of the longevity of the remnant of an army can be found . We might defy Europe to show any thing comparable to it . We doubt whether there is a place in the world , more strongly marked by the longevity of its inhabitants , than Montpelier , the residence of Mr. Madison , and the country immediately around it . During a visit which we made to the venerable ex-president a few years ago , we were informed by him of about ten or twelve individuals , who were either then living , or had died a short time before , the most remote of them not more than eight or ten miles apart , each of whom was upwards of eighty , arid most of them between ninety and a hundred years of age . Among them were a near female relation of Mr. Madison , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each of them in her ninety-fourth year . We learned from the same source , as well as from others equally authentic , that the adjacent counties abounded in similar instances of longevity . Individuals nearly eighty years old and upwards were numerous . Mr. Madison was himself seventy five , and several of his servants about the same age ; some of them turned of eighty . We shall only add , that in that tract of country the human frame has received generally a development more gigantic , than we have ever witnessed elsewhere . We think the average height of the men but very little , if at all , short of six feet . We saw one , Mr. S. Martin , six feet nine inches high , and of good propertions . We saw also two sisters , the tallest of whom was six feet two inches in height , and the other six feet an inch and a halT . They were the daughters of a man who afterwards kept a public house , in Hancock , a small town situated on the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we doubt not , they have been seen by thousands of travelers . We are thus particular , that we may guard ourselves from any suspicion of inaccuracy or exaggeration . As to the freshness , elasticity , and vigor of its inhabitants , nc%t only after the age of thirty , but after that of fifty , and in many instances of sixty , Pennsylvania , in common with every state in the union , speaks for itself ; and its language should redden the cheek and silence the tongue of every European who has charged us with degeneracy . If a want of knowledge or a disregard of truth betoken degeneracy , well might we retort the charge on themselves , where it would not &amp;iJ to // fasten . As telates to the southern and western states , every observant and kind-hearted traveler who passes through them , is surprised and delighted at the unusual number of healthy , vigorous , and beautiful children he every where beholds . Families containing twelve and upwards are often met with , and from six to nine , when the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are sun-burnt , and not often clad in either purple , scarlet , or fine linen . But so much the better . They will form men the more perfectly fitted to subdue the monsters of the wilderness , overawe the savage , fell the forest , and compel the earth to yield them its fruits . And such are the occupations that Heaven has alloted to them . Their appearance and deeds are the fairest comment on British defamation . They hold , moreover , the fictions of their slanderers in as deep scorn , as they would their strength arid prowess , should they ever come into conflict with them . In further confirmation of what we have said respecting the southern states , we shall only add , that , in Louisiana , which is reputed the sickliest of them , individuals of four successive generations have often danced as partners in the same cotillion . By such qualified judges as Captain Hall , of whose taste and manners we have already spoken , and whose mind is a compound of ingratitude and prejudice , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this charge we shall not circumstantially reply , because the world is already sufficiently informed on it . We take the liberty , however , to remark , that we have rarely , if ever , known a young Englishman to visit the United States , who did not , in a few months , acquire much more of good breeding and gentlemanly manners , than he brought along with him . Nor did he fail to improve in good sense also , unless his inordinate conceit , or want of capacity , prevented him . Nor do we know of any other cause to which this could be attributed but the influence of better society than he had before enjoyed . Had even Captain Hall , intractable as he is , and every way unfit for the work of refinement , remained with us long enough to acquire a little knowledge of us , and fashion himself somewhat to the circumstances around him , he would have learned to think , and behave himself better than he did . He might , perhaps , have been even so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honesty , as not to have disgraced himself by his book of travels . But we have bestowed too much of our time on him and his pasquinade . We , therefore , dismiss them forever from . our thoughts . With all persons of sense , candor , or taste , he has dug his own grave . There let the worm consort with his fellow . As if all the vices and defects of climate and country were to be visited on ourselves , it was charged against us , as a mark of degradation , that even the inferior animals are wanting in perfection in the New World . It was tauntingly observed of us , that our forests and mountains produce neither the lion , the tiger , the rhinoceros , the elephant , nor the camel ; nor our lakes and rivers , the hippopotamus , or the crocodile . Nor does the anaconda cross the path of the traveler , or enfold and crush him with his cable-like coils . But , in preferring against us these imputations , if such they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are as true of Great-Britain , and of all Europe , as they are of the United States . The animals re // ferred to are natives only of Asia and Africa , and the adjoining islands . Europe , both insular and continental , is as barren of them as America . The largest wild animals found in Britain , on its first discovery , were the stag and the wolf . The wild-boar and the urus belonged to the continent . But these are all inferior , in size and strength , to the bison , the elk , the moose , and the grizzly bear , which inhabit the wilds of the United States . Besides , such are the diversities of animated nature , that it is absurd to infer the necessary deterioration of man in any place , merely because large and fierce species of inferior beings are not there produced . In New South Wales , the largest native animal is the kangaroo , which , in size and strength , is greatly below sev* eral animals of our own country . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spot , the human frame is there expanding to unusual dimensions . We do not find that man is larger , more powerful , or more courageous in the land of the elephant , the camel , and the lion , than in that of the wild boar , the stag , and the hare . Nor does it follow that he will attain the perfection of his nature in tangled swamps and reeking morasses , or along the oozy banks of rivers , because these are the native haunts of the crocodile and the hippopotamus . It was further asserted that our domestic animals , especially the horse , the ox , and the dog deteriorated in our country ; that they became smaller and feebler , less active , and less courageous . But this also is a mistake ; the result of ignorance or wilful misrepresentation . Our breed of horses , when skilfully cultivated , is not surpassed , in the high and noble qualities of the animal , by that of any country in Europe . One or two American horses have lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that England could bring to oppose them our running horses are not less fleet and staunch than theirs , nor our draft horses less powerful ; and the bulk and weight of some of our bullocks have exceeded those of any that that island has ever produced . Nor are the dogs reared in the United States inferior in swiftness , strength , and courage to those of any other country . If there exist an exception to this , it is found in the Irish greyhound , a race which we have never seen on this side of the Atlantic ; and which is now rarely seen any where . The Newfoundland dog attains as high perfection in America as in Europe . In truth , he is an American , Newfoundland being an appendage of our continent . But the most grievous charge is to come . It was laid against our intellect ; that power which governs the whole being of man , gives effect to his exertions , and makes him what he is . It was confidently affirmed , not alone by men of ordinary standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in all its attributes , the American mind was of an inferior cast ; in terms apparently coined for the occasion , that the " man of America was essentially belittled . " No doubt a belief to this effect , pronounced and supported by such high authority , had much influence in inducing the British Parliament to issue their resolve , that they had a " right to bind us in all cases . " In their pride , power , and rapacity , why should they not thus resolve and act , when they had ( in their own opinion ) so much to gain by it , and nothing to lose ? when , on the condition supposed to be settled , // that we had neither the spirit nor the capacity to resist , it placed at their mercy our property , liberty and lives ? In point of extent , this inglorious charge against us , of mental inferiority , underwent several successive changes , amounting to abatements . As already stated , it was at first general and sweeping , denying to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . It was then admitted that , in the humbler pursuits of life , embracing petty traffic and certain mechanical trades , some of them as important as boat , and , perhaps , ship-building , we had great cleverness , but an incurable unfitness for any thing elevated . The next admission was more liberal ; that we were sagacious and dexterous in directing the affairs of churches , boroughs , and other limited corporations , but incompetent to the government of large communities . When driven from these and other positions , by the events and issue of our revolutionary war , and the forms of government we soon afterwards established , our accusers seized on new ground , and , with their wonted audacity , pronounced us destitute of true genius , utterly devoid of a national literature , and incapable of forming one . This is their last retreat . When compelled to surrender that , their discomfiture will be complete . It was , in a particular manner , to aid in vindicating his countrymen against this latter charge , that Mr. Knapp engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent publication of his " Lectures on American Literature . " lie is himself well fitted by nature for literary labor . This his productions , marked by research , and bearing on them the seal of taste and refinement , abundantly prove . His own feelings , therefore , united to a knowledge of his intellectual constitution , must have assured him that the charge against us was unfounded ; and his pride , as an American , together with his patriotism and sense of justice , urged him to resist it . Nor was he long in finding , in the productions of his countrymen , ample means to resist it successfully . But let us hear him speak for himself on the subject , as no one else can expound so satisfactorily his views and motives . In a very neat and modest dedication of his work to a literary friend , he holds the following language : " I have taken the liberty ( that of dedication ) because I was confident that you would favor the effort , whatever might be its success with the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and for another reason , which is , that I know you are among the number who are anxious that we , as a people , should speak freely and justly of ourselves , and honestly strive to place our claims to national distinction on the broad basis of well-authenticated historical facts ; this would soon be accomplished , if all our able and enlightened scholars would come forward in aid of the few who are toiling in the cause ; yet , with few exceptions , our pride has rather led us to make spirited retorts , than laborious researches , for an answer to those who question our literary and scientific character . " * * * * " The work I now present to you and the public , is offered as the opening argument of junior counsel , in the great cause instituted to establish the claims of the United States to that intellectual , literary , and scientific eminence , which we say she deserves to have , and ought to maintain ; and in this I attempted but little more than to state my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole field for those abler advocates who may follow me . Our author appreciates , as he ought , the wisdom and importance of the maxim , " Train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it . " lIe , therefore , intends his " Lectures " for the use of schools , and has adapted them to that end , confi // dent that , if suitable impressions , respecting the intellectual renown of their country and countrymen , be made on the susceptible minds of children , and corresponding sentiments be awakened in the glowing bosoms of youth , they will be valued and nurtured as precious seeds , and be productive of the fruits of patriotism and virtue . In his preface , therefore , he addresses American teachers in the following pertinent and eloquent strain " Your calling is high , I had almost said holy . To your intelligence , patience , good temper , purity of life , and soundness of principles , parents look for the forming of healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * " The temple of knowledge is committed to your care ; the priesthood is a sacred one . Every inscription on the walls should be kept bright , that the dimmest eye may see , and the slowest comprehension may read and be taught to understand . " * * * " The elements of learning have been simplified . Geography has been made easy and fascinating , and natural philosophy very pleasant . History , both sacred and profane has assumed new charms , as it has been prepared for the school-room ; I speak of the history of other cotintries , not of our own . We have very good histories , narrative , political , military , and constitutional ; but I know of none , as yet , that can be called literary-meaning by the term , a history of our literature , and of our literary men . " * * * " You will struggle in vain to make American history well understood by your pupils , unless biographical sketches , anecdotes , and literary selections are mingled with the mass of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized , to make lasting impressions upon the memory . " One word to your pride . You are aware that it has been said by foreigners , and often repeated , that there was no such thing as American literature ; that it would be in vain for any one to seek for proofs of taste , mind , or information , worth possessing in our early records ; and some of our citizens who have never examined these matters , have rested so quietly after these declarations , or so faintly denied them , that the bold asserters of these libels have gained confidence in tauntingly repeating them . The great epoch of our history ,  --  the revolution of 1775 ,  --  seemed sufficient alone , to many of the present generation , to give us , as a people all the celebrity and rank , among the nations of the earth , we ought to aspire to , without taking the trouble to go back to the previous ages of heroic virtue and gigantic labors . Many of the present generation are willing to think that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who really did possess some strength of character , but , without further reflection , they are ready to allow that a few pages are " ample scope and verge enough " to trace their character and their history together . I have ventured to think differently , and also to flatter myself , that , at the present day , it would not be a thankless task to attempt to delineate some of the prominent features of our ancestors in justification of my opinion . This error can only be eradicated by your assistance , and that by instilling into the minds of our children , in your every day lessons , correct information upon these subjects ; and while you lead your pupils through the paths of miscellaneous and classical literature ,  --  and , at the present day , even the humblest education partakes of much that is of a classical nature ,  --  be it your duty also to make them acquainted with the minutest portion of their country 's history . No people that do not love themselves better than all others , can ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him who unduly reverences another . If " know thyself " be a sound maxim for individual consideration , " think well of thy self " should be a national one . " * * * " Guardians of a nation 's morals , framers of intellectual greatness , show to your charge , in proper lights , the varied talent of your country , in every age of her history ; and inscribe her glories of mind , and heart , and deed , as with a sunbeam , upon their memories . With these views before him , and animated by the sentiments here expressed , our author boldly commences his labors . And were we to call them Herculean , we should scarcely speak extravagantly . To overthrow entirely , though already shaken , the inveterate and deeprooted slanders of foreigners , to awaken the slumbering indifference of his own countrymen , and to enlighten the ignorance , and dissipate the 54 // errors and prejudices of all , in relation to his subject , constituted a task , which it required the firmest resolution to encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , enterprise , and perseverance , difficulties submit , and most things become practicable . This , if it had not been already an established truth , our author has demonstrated , in the issue of his labors . Although he brought into requisition , as he tells us , but a part of his means , he has vindicated , we think triumphantly , the claim of his country , to a very respectable literary standing ,  --  one greatly beyond what her condition promised ; although inferior to that of some of the older nations of Europe . He has shown satisfactorily , on the evidence of their works , that many Americans have ranked justly with the foremost literary and scientific characters of their day , if they were not themselves the foremost . He has done more . *He has aided not a little , by his own contributions to the general stock , in filling up the measure of his country 's renown . While citing examples in proof of his opinions , he has also set one . In defending the literary reputation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own may rest securely , and which will materially strengthen the claim of his country , for which he contends . Long after the writings of the puny re*ilers of American genius shall have supplied the grocer with wrappings , and the book worm with food , the " Lectures on American Literature " will have a place in the library of the American scholar , and minister to the instruction of American youth . Nor will the improvement derived from them consist alone in the knowledge they will communicate . The conductors of education , on a plan at once enlarged and amended , will employ them also as means for the promotion of refinement and virtue ; they will find in them matter well suited to cultivate the taste of their pupils , awaken their patriotism , purify and strengthen their moral feelings , and confirm in them laudable resolutions to excel . And to what higher or more sacred purpose can the fruits of genius and learning be applied ? Let our youth be suitably trained in knowledge , virtue , and the love of country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and the picture will be reversed . Evil will befall us , as certainly as any other effect proceeds from its cause . And what can more effectually contribute to such training , than that teachers should constantly present to their pupils , with a sentiment of due veneration , and in suitable colors , the talents , virtues , and glories of their ancestors ? The in* fluence of the example of our own worthies on the minds of their descendants and countrymen , is infinitely more inspiring and salutary , than that of Greek and Roman example . The teachers in other countries are sensible of this important truth , and act accordingly . Hence , when the English , French , Swiss , or Russians , would fire their youth with patriotic ardor , and implant in them high resolutions to excel , instead of Phocion or Epaminondas , Curtius or Cato , they point to their own Alfreds , Henries , Tells , or Peters . Why , then , should not Americans follow their example , since they are so abundantly supplied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their high attainments and glorious deeds , become sacred objects to us . They cling to our hearts , and incorporate with our natures , or hover around us , as household gods , shield us from vice and dishonor , and confirm us in virtue . To all other motives to well doing , they add that of family and // 427 national pride , a sentiment which can not be awakened by either the examples of the ancients , or those of the moderns of foreign countries . By adapting his work , therefore , to the purposes of schools , our author has greatly enhanced its usefulness . But it is time we should speak more particularly of its contents . To this part of our duty , therefore . we shall now proceed , with the single remark , that , from the limited space to which we must confine ourselves , we feel it impossible to perform it with justice . To understand what the volume really is , and duly to appreciate it , the reader must peruse it . But , having already filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postpone our further remarks to the next number.
