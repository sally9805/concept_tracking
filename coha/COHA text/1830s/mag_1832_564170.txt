txt WE live in an age of associations . In the pursuit after wealth , in the advancement of a political party , and in the correction of moral evil , we are equally desirous of the strength which results from union , and the rapidity which springs from concert . The success of the Society for the Suppression of Intemperance is one of the most striking moral phenomena of the age , and it encourages me to hope that the excellent men who have already done so much good , will go a step farther , and form a Society for the Suppression of Eating . " A truly facetious correspondent we have here , " may be the remark of some rosy-gilled gentleman on the shady side of forty , who takes up the New-England Magazine and a segar after dinner to aid in the important process of digesting ; ( malice might add to bring on that delicious drowsiness from which one slides so easily and delightfully into a nap . ) But he is mistaken . I was never more serious in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts of the incalculable quantity of fish , flesh and fowl , which is devoured daily by my countrymen , and long have I fretted myself with ways and means to lessen it . It may be stated as a general rule , that all men , women and children in the United States , eat , at least , one quarter more than is good for them . To be sure , there is to qualify this melancholy statement , the reflection , that this excess supposes a great abundance of all things eatable , for it is an undeniable proposition , that a man can not eat too much unless he has too much to eat . To be convinced of the truth of the assertion , let any man take a journey of a hundred miles in a stage-coach , and first observe the quantity of good things under which the tables of the hotels groan , and the celerity and completeness with which they vanish under the knives and forks of a half a dozen travelers , who have been sitting perfectly still all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they had been digging on a canal since sunrise , there might be some apology for their voracity . After this , open some book on Dietetics , and see the quantity of food which a man ought to take , in order to have his physical and intellectual nature in the highest perfection , and you may form some idea of the abominable excesses which these aforesaid travelers commit . And these are all good men , or at least , they would tell you so themselves . That withered old gentleman , whose face you can hardly see behind the huge piece of turkey upon his plate , is a deacon , and reads prayers every morning in his family . That red faced man opposite to him , who is just beginning to discuss a slice ( his second one ) of corned beef , nearly as large as Boston Common , and with the perspiration standing in beads upon his forehead , from the violence of his exertions , is the President of a Temperance Society , and turned off one of his men for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking personage in black , who eats with such silent and effective celerity , is a clergyman , who preached , the Sunday before , a very powerful sermon , from the text , " He that eateth and drinketh Vo1*. i*. 41 // unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation unto himself . " All of these seem to have no idea , that by stuffing themselves , till Nature can take no more without loathing , they are as guilty of intemperance , as if they had drank themselves under the table . But there is no need of traveling , to see men eat more than they ought to . it may be seen at every ordinary in this good city , and at a great many tables that are not ordinaries . There is never a supper prepared , that would not suffice for double the number of those who are to sit down to it . I am somewhat whimsical and sensitive , myself , and have , on several such occasions , entirely lost a fine appetite , in the disgust at the tasteless and insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were huddled together , as if the tables had been spread for an Irish regiment . And what is the most deplorable thing of all , on those splendid occasions , " when youth and beauty meet To chase the glowing hours , with flying feet , " the supper is what is looked forward to , with the keenest anticipation , by nine-tenths of the guests , and remembered with the most lasting fondness . The beauty , the grace , the elegance , pass from their minds , like the shapes of last year 's clouds ; but on their minds ' palate , dwells forever the flavor of the oysters and Champagne . On this subject , ( as Mr. Ames says ) my emotions are unutterable , and yet , like him , I will proceed to express them . When I have occasionally left my books for the blaze of a brilliant party , and have elbowed myself into the supper-room , ( not to eat , but to observe ) while all eyes were sparkling with delight , and all hands and mouths occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cud of a most bitter fancy . How painful it is , to see a fair creature , that looks as if , like the Pens , she derived her sustenance from the perfume of flowers , swallowing oysters , or lobster sallad , with as much gotit as any he-monster in the room . The squeezing , the crowding , the pushing , the selfishness shewn in obtaining some particular dainty , make me wish to have the power to condemn them all to live for a month on salt-fish and potatoes . This custom of giving extravagant suppers , which has grown up into such a rage , is , on every account , a most preposterous one . it prevents all who are not rich , from opening their houses to their friends , and among them , it begets a silly emulation in expense , and a teasing anxiety about what ought to be of no consequence at all . It defeats entirely the purposes for which society was meant . Let us be honest , and acknowledge that we do not go to parties to refresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , to thaw ourselves in the sunshine of beauty , to listen to the conversation of intelligent men and women , to unbend our tired faculties , by the graceful play of wit , or the unchecked exercise of fancy , to pour out the wealth of our minds , and to aid others to pour out theirs ;  --  but we go to eat and drink the good things we can get no where else so cheaply , and then to go home , to ride on a nightmare all over space , and to wake up the next morning , unable to do or conceive any thing great or valuable . Does any one doubt the truth of what I say ? Let him see for himself . Let him observe how uneasy the company appear , as the supper hour approaches ,  --  how the gentlemen look at their watches , and how tumultuously they hurry up or down , as the // case may be , when the long-wished moment has arrived . They have no wish to encumber themselves with a lady ,  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to say , that I notice that the ladies know the way to the supper-room very well alone . Now look in upon the company ,  --  is it possible that these people have had any thing to eat for twenty-four hours ? There is a steady sound of mastication , that might be heard in a calm night , for a quarter of a mile . Those well-dressed beaux have all concentrated their being into one sense . The cheek of beauty and the lip of eloquence are unheeded . They would have no eyes for Venus , and no ears for Minerva . Let the ladies be assured by one who is their friend , that these splendid entertainments are fatal to true politeness ,  --  that the gentlemen will never appreciate the delightful intellectual enjoyment which they may have in the conversation of a beautiful and intelligent woman , while their grosser nature is tempted by a l ) rofusion of such delicacies as Apicius never dreamed of . But this is a digression , entered upon because I could not resist the temptation of pouring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this department of my subject . I trust the point will be granted to me from which I want to start , which is , that our countrymen eat too much ; the amount of the excess varying , of course , according to circumstances . The effects produced by this pernicious habit , if followed out to their utmost extent , are such as will awaken the most serious alarm in the breast of every sincere lover of his country . I do not propose to enlarge upon the immediate consequences of this inordinate stuffing , to the bodily health ; this subject will be found amply and learnedly discussed in treatises by professional men . Any doctor will tell you that you can eat yourself out of the world , as certainly , and nearly as expeditiously , as you can drink yourself out of it . I am firmly per - suaded , that half the diseases of civilization arise from our forcing the stomach , from our earliest years , to hold more than Nature meant it should . Strength of limb and long life are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking . Disease lurks behind the fat surloin , and there is Death in the tureen of turtle-soup . Whenever I go to a dinner party , it seems to me that I see in my mind 's eye , the incarnate forms of Gout , Apoplexy and Fever , bringing in the dishes , and coaxing their victims , " just to take one slice more . " But this point is too plain to be enlarged upon , and if a man choose to commit slow suicide , by so simple and pleasant a process as eating every day , till he can eat no longer , why there is nothing to prevent it , seeing that we live in a free country . But it is not alone our bodies that this national vice attacks . After much reflection on the subject , I have come to the conclusion , that the seat of the soul is the stomach , and that upon the healthy or unhealthy state of this organ , depends the soundness or unsoundness of the moral and intellectual nature of the individual , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling proposition by nine-tenths of those who read it , but , they may depend upon it , the more they think about it , the more nearly will they agree in sentiment with me . When we take no more food , than we can with perfect case ( lispose of how full of sunshine is the inner world . All things then go right with us ; we // take hold of every thing by its handle ; we promise ourselves success in whatever we undertake ; the tongue nimbly gives birth to the shapes with which the mind teems , and through the unclouded regions of the brain , images flash to and fro , bright , and thick , and swift as butterflies upon a ( lay in Spring . And the heart , too , keeps tune with the understanding . We love every thing that lives ; our bounteous affections are overflowing , and running over , upon every man , woman and child , every wild-flower , and every blade of grass ; we meet our friends with a dancing eye and a tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaded down into the soft drab of indifference . But suppose we have been cramming and gorging ourselves for a week , and eating the food of three men ,  --  how every thing is changed I The brain is darkened and oppressed with gross , animal vapors , the smoke and steam of the sacrifice we have been offering to our god , the belly , and the ducts of the body are all clogged , so that the blood creeps as lazily through our veins , as muddy water through a canal . Our mind is as much buried beneath the mountain of fish , flesh and fowl , we have swallowed , as Enceladus was under J3*tna . A newspaper paragraph is a burden to us . Life looks dark to us , and no rainbow of hope spans the leadencolored clouds that overhang the future . We look coldly upon our best friends , growl at the blessed sun in heaven , and , as for our enemy , we can hardly keep our hands from his throat . I ask every man , if the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Now , after this , conceive a whole nation doing such injury to their better nature by pampering their viler one , and the imagination itself can hardly do justice to the mass of crime and unhappiness which must be the result . The frequent suicides , the numerous cases of madness , the robberies , the frauds and the murders , all the strange , fantastic and unnatural forms of crime , which stain the annals of civilization , are all fruits growing from this one root of bitterness . If a man eat as much as he can , or , in other words , like a beast , what wonder is it that the animal nature should triumph over the moral and intellectual , and that wrath and revenge should be the dark tenants of his breast . I have no doubt that the abductors of Morgan were excellent livers , and that their plan was conceived while they were suffering from the effects of repletion , after a good supper . I think that the fable of Prometheus is susceptible of a new interpretation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evils entailed upon the world , by the introduction of fire , arose in consequence of its application to culinary purposes . While men lived upon acorns , and drank the running stream , there was no temptation to eat too much ; but when roast meat and strong waters came into fashion , they brought crimes , violence and war in their train . This explanation is confirmed by a well-known passage in Horace , Book I. Ode 16 . Fertur Prometheus-insani leonis Vim stornacko oppossuisse nostro . What can this passage mean , unless it be a strong expression of The insane violence of appetite , which Prometheus was the means of creating ? Capt . Hall , who , in the midst of a great deal of falsehood , and a great deal of asinine absurdity , now and then stumbles upon a true remark , says very justly , that the A mericans do not know how to be amused . // On all holidays and public occasions , there is no hearty abandonment of ourselves to the pleasurable sensations of the moment , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in our pockets , and nothing seems to rouse us from our apathy , but the excitement of some paltry game of skill and hazard , or the animating spectacle of a fight . Now this arises from our considering these occasions merely as opportunities to eat and drink more than usual The little boy that goes to " lection , " with a nine-pence in his pocket , lays out the greater part of it in gingerbread , and eats so that he can hardly walk . And so we keep on , the quantity and quality of the good things increasing with our years and means . this depraved taste renders us incapable of that joyous , self-forgetting delirium of fun and frolic , which bounds along the blood , and whirls the brain into pleasant madness . We can not give ourselves up , like bubbles , to be borne along by the current of hearty , spontaneous impulse , which comes , we know not whence , and goes , we know not whither . It is not alone in our professed merry-makings , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the charmer , charm he never so wisely ; " - it is a defect woven into the stuff out of which my countrymen are made . We are sternly prosaic , deficient in poetic sensibility and susceptibility of tender emotions . We can laugh with Falstaff , for we have a fellow-feeling with the jolly old knight , but the sorro*vs of Lear and the gravity of Hamlet do not seem to know the way to our hearts . Was there ever a people that danced as we do ? A deaf man , peeping into a ball-room , would suppose , from the long faces and the solemn movements , that the company were performing some act of punishment or penance . This sluggishness of body and inertness of mind , arise from an overloaded stomach ; the animal spirits have lost their nimble motion , and the blood its animating celerity ; the bosom 's lord sits heavy on his throne . I honor and respect the many estimable and admirable qualities of our agricultural population , but I wish they had more love of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We never see any roses , or flowering shrubs , or ornamental trees about their dwellings , and the houses themselves are generally built without any regard to appearance . They are not sufficiently awake to the beauty of the outward world , and a taste for music is rare among them . Without knowing what the word means , they are Utilitarians , after Jeremy Bentham 's own heart . They neglect to make use of a thousand obvious sources of happiness , which are scattered at their feet , like wild-flowers . I ascribe a large portion of this rugged apathy to the quantity of food , particularly animal food , that they eat , and partly , too , to their deep potations of that vile liquor , cider , which has all the stupefaction of wine , without any of the exhilaration . The French peasant , who lives upon brown bread , with an onion or a bunch of grapes , is overflowing with animal spirits , and after the hardest day 's work , is ready to join in a dance , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the barren hills of Scotland , living on oat-meal and barley* bannocks ! the poetry of Burns melts and kindles them by turns , and the sound of a fiddle , or a bag-pipe , sends their souls straight to their heels . I think it would be an excellent plan for the Governor to order a General Fast throughout the Commonwealth , at least once a week ,  - -  that is , provided it could be enforced . At present , the only difference // between fast and any other day , seems to be , that theii , instead of the usual meal at the regular hour , the dinner extends all along from breakfast till supper , and instead of one pitched battle , there is a guerilla warfare carried on against the cupboard , all day long . Every one must have remarked the extreme violence with which political discussions are carried on in our country , the pungent paragraphs continually appearing in our newspapers , and the tart speeches made in our deliberative assemblies . Now a little abstinence would greatly abate this , for politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation and ferocity arising from the peccant humors , which are generated by so much of the food we take , as is more than necessary for the support of the system . It is amazing how pacific an empty stomach makes a man . How much foam and fury we might easily be spared on such subjects as the Tariff , Internal Improvement , Bank of the United States , &amp;c . It is from the fulness of the stomach that so many tongues wag , and so many pens scrawl . I would suggest , as an excellent plan , that , for two months before any important election takes place , all the editors of papers , that interest themselves in the result , 4should be put upon a strict , water-gruel regimen , and that the same precautionary measures should be extended to all legislatures throughout the land , previous to any discussion that is likely to call forth any explosions of passion . This would be particularly advisable at Washington , where there has been so much breath and ink wasted every year . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of bickerings in the House , and open quarrels out of it . I have no doubt that it would be found , upon sufficient examination , that provisions have been uncommonly abundant , and the indulgencies of the table proportionally increased . This system of starving , might be employed with great effect , not only as a preventive , but as a corrective of evil . When any of the professors of the rough-and-tumble style of eloquence , indulge themselves with scurrilous personalities against their opponents , or make a long speech in favor of a rail-road over the Alleghany Mountains , or a canal to Columbia River , let the speaker give orders to the sergeant-at-arms , to take the honorable gentleman into custody , feed him very sparingly upon arrow-root , crackers , and *veak tea , till his blood is cooled down to the proper legislating temperature . How deeply interested every man in the Union , who reads the papers , must be , to have such an experiment tried , needs not to be demonstrated . I once asked a German gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet lived so long ? Why , he said , it was because they never ate any thing-that is , comparatively speaking . Almost all our scholars eat too much , though no one would be shocked beyond measure , at being told so . How few of them do you see , that have ruddy complexions , erect carriage , and an elastic step ? They are languid in body , and , too often , irresolute in mind ; they get into a way of imagining themselves invalids , and distrust their ability of doing what they ought to . They are deficient in that resolute promptness and energy of character , which arises from a sound body no less than a sound mind , which goes to its purpose like an arrow to its mark , and dashes obstacles aside , like " dew-drops from a lion 's mane . " Their friends are anxious about them , talk of a voyage to Europe , and tell // them that their application is drying up the springs of life , and remonstrate with them on their fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is all fudge-it is their devotion to eating that makes them such pale , sapless , round-shouldered spectres . He who eats much , and exercises little , must , of necessity , be a good-for-nothing , habitual invalid . Your literary man eats three or four large meals in a day , spends his time in the close air of his study , and , perhaps , when the weather is very pleasant , takes a walk of half-an-hour , at a pace that might become a snail 's funeral ; and , after this , can he expect to have that boundless sense of capability , which riots in the veins of the temperate man ? The stomach , poor over-worked organ , soon becomes paralyzed and worn out with hard duty , and refuses to perform its proper functions ; the " harp of thousand strings , " gets all out of tune ; and , last of all , comes Dyspepsia ; and when that becomes a confirmed disorder , it is all over with a man . Let his friends write his epitaph , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well be dead and buried , and better too ; for besides his uselessness , your dyspeptic is as cross as a scalded bear , and a terror to all those who are obliged to approach him . Many distinguished writers , particularly Franklin and the poet Shelly , have maintained , that , by living entirely upon vegetable food , we may preserve our intellectual faculties in a state of much higher perfection . It seems to me that is not quite true , and that the secret of the matter is , that we eat much less , if we confine ourselves to vegetables , than if we eat animal food also , since the latter is more tempting to the taste . Besides , it is much more solid , and contains a greater amount of nourishment in an equal bulk . Excess , in the one , is as much to be deprecated , as in the other ; and moderation in each , will be attended with the same happy results . I have thus shown some of the alarming consequences growing out of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause , will , of course , be also a removal of the effects . I hope my countrymen , collectively and individually , will bear it in mind , that nothing great or good , can be effected without abstinence , or , at least , temperance . Let him who wishes to write learned books , to compose great poems , to make eloquent speeches , avoid the temptations of the table . No man , who is an habitual glutton , ( and I call any body a glutton that always eats as much as he can hold , ) can be a good husband , a good neighbor , or a good citizen . Every grain of wheat that goes to make up the bread he eats , has filled its place in the great scale of being , more creditably than he ; for wheat was made to be ground up into flour , and flour to be made into bread ; but man was made to be of use to other men , and not to eat himself stupid , and drink himself mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had intended , shown the extent of the evil , it remains for me only to propose , as briefly as possible , the outlines of my plan for the Society for the Suppression of Eating . It is a subject which is very near my heart , and I should ask for no better inscription on my tomb , than this- " Here lies the man who was the means of lessening , by one quarter , the food consumed in the United States . " I call upon all sincere Christians , true patriots , and honest men , to join me in forming the above proposed society . I want it to be as extensive in its operations , and as beneficial in its re // suits , as the Temperance Society . Of course , till the opinion of the public is definitively expressed upon this subject , it would be superfluous to do any thing more than to suggest the contemplated institution , leaving it to more experienced heads to organize it . I respectfully submit the plan to the community , putting down , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its success . 1 . It shall be the duty of this Society , to obtain , immediately , from the Massachusetts Medical Society , a statement of the quantity of food most convenient for a healthy man , and the proportions of solid , and liquid , animal and vegetable ; and every member shall pledge himself scrupulously to adhere to the same . 2 . A premium shall be offered for the best treatise , setting forth the pernicious effects of inordinate eating upon the moral , intellectual and physical character , and all keepers of public houses shall be supplied with a sufficient number of copies to enable them to put one to every plate upon their tables . 3 . The members of this Society shall pledge themselves to go without dinner at least , once a week . 4 . No member shall eat meat more than once a day . 5 . No member shall eat any thing after eight at night.
