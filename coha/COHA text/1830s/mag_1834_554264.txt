txt THE manner , in which we dispose of the remains of our deceased friends , is a subject which , within the last few years , has occupied a greater share , than formerly , of the public attention // in our own vicinity . It involves not only considerations which belong to the general convenience , but includes also the gratification of individual taste , and the consolation of private sorrow . Although , in a strictly philosophical view , this subject possesses but little importance , except in relation to the convenience of survivors ; yet so closely are our sympathies enlisted with it , so inseparably do we connect the feelings of the living with the condition of the dead , that it is in vain that xye attempt to divest ourselves of its influence . It is incumbent on us therefore to analyze , as far as we may be able , the principles which belong to a correct view of this subject ; since it is only by understanding these , that we may expect both reason and feeling to be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The complicated textures which the living body elaborates within itself , begin to fall asunder , almost as soon as life has ceased . The materials of which animals and vegetables are composed , have natural laws and irresistible affinities , which are suspended during the period of life , but which must be obeyed the moment that life is extinct . They continue to operate , until the exquisite fabric is reduced to a condition , in no wise different from that of the soil on which it has once trodden* In certain cases art may modi&amp; , and accident my retard , the approaches of dhorganization , but the exceptions thus pro ( luced are too few and imperfect , to invalidate the certainty of the general law . If we take a comprehensive survey of the progress and mutations of animal and vegetable life , we shall perceive , that this necessity of individual destruction is the basis of general safety . The elements which have once moved and circulated in living frames , do not become extinct , nor useless after death - they offer themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed . What has ohee possessed life , is most assimilated to the living character , and most ready to partake of life again . The plant which springs from the earth , after attaining its growth , anti perpetuating its species , falls to the ground , undergoes decomposition , and contributes its remains to the nourishment of plants around it . The myriads of animals which range the woods , or inhabit the air , at length die upon the surface of the earth , and , if not devoured by other animals , prepare for vegetation the place which receives their remains . Were it not for this law of nature , the // of several Kings . soil would be soon exhausted , the earth 's surface would become a barren waste , and the whole race of organized beings , for vant of sustenance , would become extinct . Man alone , the master of the creation , does not willingly stoop to become a participator in the routine of nature . In every age , he has manifested a disposition to exempt himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living beings . Although he is prodigal of the lives of other classes , and sometimes sacrifices a hundred inferior bodies , to procure himself a single repast , yet he regards with scrupulous anxiety the destination of his own remains ; and much labor and treasure are devoted by him to ward off for a season the inevitable courses of nature . Under the apprehension of posthumous degradation , human bodies have been embalmed , their concentrated dust has been inclosed in golden urns , monumental fortresses have been piled over their decaying bones ; - with what success , and with what use , it may not be amiss to consider . We have selected a few instances , in which measures have been taken to protect the human frame from decay , which will be seen to have been in some cases partially successful , in others not so . They will serve as preliminaries to the general considerations which-are connected with the subject . One of the most interesting accounts of the preservation of a body , the identity of which was undoubted , is that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers of I*nglish history will recollect that this monarch gave , as a dying charge to his son , that his heart should be sent to the Holy land , but that his body should be carried in the van of the army , till Scotland was reduced to obedience . lie died in July , 1307 , and notwithstanding his injunctions , was buried in Westminster Abbey in October of the same year . It is recorded , that he was embalmed , and orders for renewing the cerecloth about his body were issued in the reigns of Edward LII. and Henry IV . The tomb or this monarch was opened and his body examined in January , 1774 , under the direction of Sir Joseph Ayloffe , after it had been buried 467 years . The following account we extract from a contemporaneous volume of the Gentleman 's Magazine . - Some gentlemen of the society of antiquaries , being desirous to see how far the actual state of Edward ist 's body answered to the methods taken to preserve it , obtained leave to open the large // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been deposited , on the north side of Edward the Confessor 's chapel . This was accordingly done on the morning of January 2 , 1774 ; when in a coffin of yellow stone , they found the royal body in perfect preservation , enclosed in two wrappers ; one of them was of gold tissue , strongly waxed , and fresh ; the other and outermost con* siderably decayed . The corpse was habited in a rich mantle of purple , paned with white , and adorned with ornaments of gilt metal , studded with red and blue stones and pearls . Two similar ornaments lay on the hands . The mantle was fastened on the right shoulder by a magnificent fibula of the same metal , with the same stones and pearls . His face had over it a silken covering , so fine , and so closely fitted to it , as to preserve the features entire . Round his temples was a gilt coronet of fleurs de lys . In his hands , which were also entire , were two sceptres of gilt metal ; that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left by three clusters of oak leaves , and a dove on a globe ; this sceptre was about five feet long . The feet were enveloped in the mantle and other coverings , but sound , and the toes distinct . The whole length of the corpse was five feet two inches . ' This last statement , it will be observed , is the only point in which the narrative appears to disagree with history . We are generally given to un ( lerstand that Edward I. was a tall man ; and that he was designated in his own time by the name of Long-shanks . Baker , in his Chronicle of the Kings of England , says of him that he was tall of stature , exceeding most other men by a head and shoulders . We have not been able to find Sir Joseph Ayloffe 's account of the examination , and know of no other mode of reconciling the discrepancy , but by supposing a typographical error of a figure in the account which has been quoted . Edward I. died at Burgh-upon-Sands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1307 , in the sixty-eighth year of his age . Another instance of partial preservation , is that of the body of King Charles I. , the subject of the work at the head of this article . The remains of this unfortunate monarch are known to have been carried to Windsor , and there interred by his friends , without pomp , in a hasty and private manner . It is stated in Clarendon 's History of the Rebellion , that when his son , Charles II. , was desirous to remove and re-inter his corpse at Westminster Abbey , it could not by any search be found . In constructing a Mausoleum at Windsor in 1813 , under // the direction of George IV. , then Prince Regent , an accident . led to the discovery of this royal body . The workmen , in forming a subterraneous passage under the choir of St. George 's chapel , accidentally made an aperture in the wall of the vault of King Henry VIII . On looking through this opening it was found to contain three coffins , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ascertained to be the coffins of Henry Viii. , and of one of his queens , Jane Seymour . The other was formally examined , after permission obtained , by Sir Henry Halford , in presence of several members of the Royal family , and other persons of distinction . The account since published by Sir Henry , corroborates the one which had been given by Mr. Herbert , a groom of King Charles 's bed chamber , and is published in Wood 's Athena* Oxonienses . On removing the pall , ' says the account , ' a plain leaden coffin presented itself to view , with no appearance of ever having been inclosed in wood , and bearing an inscription , " King Charles , 1648 , " in large , legible characters , on a scroll of lead encircling it . A square opening was then made in the upper part of the lid , of such dimensions as to admit a clear insight into its contents . These were , an internal wooden coffin , very much decayed , and the body , carefully wrapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unctuous matter , mixed with resin , as it seemed , had been melted , so as to exclude , as effectually as possible , the external air . The coffin was completely full ; and from the tenacity of the cere-cloth , great difficulty was experienced in detaching it successfully from the parts which it enveloped . Wherever the unctuous matter had insinuated itseW the separation of the cere-cloth was easy ; and where it came off , a correct impression of the features to which it had been applied , was observed . At length the whole face was disengaged from its covering . The complexion of the skin of it was dark and discolored . The forehead and temples had lost little or nothing of their muscular substance ; the cartilage of the nose was gone ; but the left eye , in the first moment of exposure , was open and full , though it vanished almost immediately ; and the pointed beard , so characteristic of the period of the reign of King Charles , was perfect . The shape of the face was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left ear , in consequence of the interposition of the unctuous matter between it and the cere-cloth , was found entire . It was difficult , at this moment , to withhold a declaration , that , notwithstanding its disfigurement , the countenance did bear // a strong resemblance to the coins , the busts , and especially to the picture of King Charles the First , by Vandyke , by which it had been made familiar to us . It is true , that the minds of the spectators of this interesting sight were well prepared to receive this impression ; but it is also certain , that such a facility of belief had been occasioned by the simplicity and truth of Mr. Herbert 's Narrative ,  --  every part of which had been confirmed by the investigation , so far as it had advanced and it will not be denied that the shape of the face , the forehead , the eye , and the beard , are the most important features by which resemblance is determined . When the head had been entirely disengaged from the attachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without any difficulty was taken out , and held up to view . The back part of the scalp was entirely perfect , and had a remarkably fresh appearance ; the pores of the skin being more distinct , and the tendons and ligaments of the neck were of considerable substance and firmness . The hair was thick at the back part of the head , and , in appearance , nearly black . A portion of it , which has since been cleaned and dried , is of a beautiful dark brown color . That of the beard was a redder brown . On the back part of the head it was not more than an inch in length , and had probably been cut so short for the convenience of the executioner , or perhaps by the piety of friends soon after death , in order to furnish memorials of the unhappy king . On holding up the head , to examine the place of separation from the body , the muscles of the neck had evidently retracted themselves considerably ; and the fourth cervical vertebra was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surfaces of the divided portions perfectly smooth and even , an appearance which could have been produced only by a heavy blow , inflicted with a very sharp instrument , and which furnished the last proof wanting to identify King Charles the First . The foregoing are two of the most successful instances of posthumous preservation . The care taken in regard to some other distinguished personages has been less fortunate in its result . The coffin of Henry VIII . was inspected at the same time with that of Charles , and was found to contain nothing but the mere skeleton of the king . Some portions of beard remained on the chin , but there was nothing to discriminate the personage contained in it . During the present century , the sarcophagus of King John has also been examined . It contained little else than a disorganized mass of earth . The principal substances found , were // some half decayed bones , a few vestiges of cloth and leather , and a long rusty piece of iron , apparently the remains of the sword-blade of that monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , depends upon the particular circumstances under which they are placed . A certain temperature , and a certain degree of moisture are indispensable agents in the common process of putrefaction , and could these be avoided in the habitable parts of our globe , human bodies might last indefinitely . We shall be excused for dwelling a short time on the influence of some of these preservative agents . Where a certain degree of cold exists , it tends powerfully to check the process of destructive fermentation , and when it extends so far as to produce congelation , its protecting power is complete . Bodies of men and animals are found in situations where they have remained frozen for years and even for ages . Not many years ago , the bodies of some Spanish soldiers were found in a state of perfect preservation among the snows of the Andes , where they were supposed to have perished in attempting to cross . those mountains , nearly a century ago ; their costume , and some historical records , indicating the probable period of their expedition . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some receptacles of the dead are shown to travellers , in which , owing to the effect of perpetual frost , together with the lightness of the atmosphere , but little absolute decay has taken place in the subjects deposited during a lapse of years . But the most remarkable instance of preservation by frost of an animal body , is that of an elephant of an extinct species , discovered in 1806 in the ice of the polar sea , near the mouth of the river Lena , by Mr. Michael Adams . This animal was first seen by a chief of the Tonguse tribe , in the year 1799 , at which time it was imbedded in a rock of ice about 180 feet high , and had only two feet , with a small part of the body , projecting from the side , so as to be visible . At the close of the next summer , the entire flank of the animal had been thawed out . It nevertheless required five su*nmers , in this inclement region , to thaw the ice , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1804 , the enormous mass separated from the mountain of ice , and fell over upon its side , on a sand bank . At this time it appears to have been in a state of perfect preservation , with its skin and flesh as entire as when it had existed , antecedently to the deluge , or to whatever convulsion of the // globe may have transported animals apparently of the torrid zone to the confines of the Arctic circle . The Tonguse chief cut off the tusks , which were nine feet long and weighed 200 pounds each . Two years after this event , Mr. Adams , being at Yakutsk and hearing of this event , undertook a journey to the spot . He found the animal in the same place , but exceedingly mutilated by the dogs and wolves of the neighborhood , which had fed upon its flesh , as fast as it thawed . He however succeeded in removing the whole skeleton , and in recovering two of the feet , one of the ears , one of the eyes , and about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and black bristle . These are now in the museum at St. Petersburg . The foregoing facts are sufficient to shew that a low degree of temperature is an effectual preventive of animal decomposition . On the other hand , a certain degree of heat combined with a dry atmosphere , although a less perfect protection , is sufficient to check the destructive process . Warmth , combined with moisture , tends greatly to promote decomposition ; yet if the degree of heat , or the circumstances under which it acts , are such as to produce a perfect dissipation of moisture , the further progress of decay is arrested . In the arid caverns of Egypt , the dried flesh of mummies , although greatly changed from its original appearance , has made no progress towards ultimate decomposition , during two or three thousand years . It is known that the ancient Egyptians embalmed the dead bodies of their friends , by extracting the large viscera from the cavities of the head , chest and abdomen , and filling them with aromatic and resinous substances , particularly asphaltum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with similar materials . These impregnations prevented decomposition for a time , until perfect dryness had taken place . Their subsequent preservation , through so many centuries , appears to have been owing , not so much to the antiseptic quality of the substance in which they are enveloped , as to the effectual exclusion of moisture and air . In the crypt under the cathedral of Milan , travellers are shown the ghastly relics of Carlo Borromeo , as they have lain for two centuries , enclosed in a crystal sarcophagus , and bedecked with costly finery , of silk and gold . The preservation of this body is equal to that of an Egyptian mummy , yet a more loathsome piece of mockery than it exhibits . we can hardly imagine . // It will be perceived that the instances which have been de* tailed are cases of extraordinary exemption , resulting from uncommon care , or from the most favorable combination of circumstances ; such as can befall but an exceedingly small portion of the human race . The common fate of animal bodies is to undergo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their living features in a few years , and sometimes even weeks , after their death . No sooner does life cease , than the elements which constituted the vital body , become subject to the common , laws of inert matter . The original affinities , which had been modified or suspended during life , are brought into operation , the elementary atoms re-act upon each other , the organized structure p&amp;sses into decay , and is converted to its original dust . Such is the natural , and we may add , the proper destination , of the material part of all that has once moved and breathed . The reflections which naturally suggest themselves in conteinplating the wrecks of humanity , which have occasionally been brought to light , are such as lead us to ask , of what possible use is a resistance to the laws of nature , which , when most successfully executed , can at best only preserve a defaced and degraded image of what was once perfect and beautiful ? Could we by any means arrest the progress of decay , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a visible and tangible shape ; could we fill our houses and our streets with mummies ,  --  what possible acquisition could be more useless , what custom could be more revolting ? For precisely the same reason the subterranean vaults , and the walls of brick , which we construct to divide the clay of humanity from that of the rest of creation , and to preserve it separate for a time , as it were for future inspection , are neither useful , gratifying , nor ultimately effectual . Could the individuals themselves , who are to be the subjects of this care , have the power to regulate the officious zeal of their survivors , one of the last things they could reasonably desire would be , that the light should ever shine on their changed and crumbling relics . On the other hand , when nature is permitted to take its course , when the dead are committed to the earth under the open sky , to become early and peacefully blended with their original dust , no unpleasant association remains . It would seem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were merged and lost in the surrounding harmonies of the creation . // When the body of Major Andr6 was taken up , a few years since , from the place of its interment near the Hudson , for the purpose of being removed to England , it was found that the skull of that officer was closely encircled by a network , formed by the roots of a small tree , which had been planted near his head . This is a natural and most beautiful coincidence . It would seem as if a faithful sentinel had taken his post , to watch , till the obliterated ashes should no longer need a friend . Could we associate with inanimate clay any of the feelings of sentient beings , who would not wish to rescue his remains from the prisons of mankind , and commit them thus to the embrace of nature ? Convenience , health , and decency require that the dead should be early removed from our sight . The law of nature requires that they should moulder into dust , and the sooner this change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in the immediate contiguity of survivors , not in frequented receptacles provided for the promiscuous concentration of numbers , not where the intruding light may annually usher in a new tenant , to encroach upon the old . It should take place peacefully , silently , separately , in the retired valley or the sequestered wood , where the soil continues its primitive exuberance , and where the earth has not become too costly 40 afford to each occupant , at least his length and breadth . Within the bounds of populous and growing cities , interments can not with propriety take place beyond a limited extent . The vacant tracts reserved for burial grounds , and the cellars of churches which are converted into tombs , become glutted with inhabitants , and are in the end obliged to be abandoned , though not perhaps until the original tenants have been ejected , and the same space has been occupied three or four successive times . Necessity obliges a recourse at last to be had to the neighboring country , and hence in Paris , London , Liverpool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed without the confines of their population . These l ) laces , in consequence of the sufficiency of the ground , and the funds which usually grow out of such establishments , have been made the recipients of tasteful ornament . Travellers are attracted by their beauty , and dwell with interest on their subsequent recollection . The scenes which , under most other circumstances , are repulsive and disgusting , are by the // joint influence of nature and art rendered beautiful , attractive , and cons6ling . The situation of Mount Auburn , near Boston , is one of great natural fitness for the objects to which it is devoted . It may be doubted whether any spot , which has been set apart for the same purposes in Europe , possesses half the interest in its original features . In a few years , when the hand of taste shall have scattered among the trees , as it has already begun to do , enduring memorials of marble and granite , a landscape of the most picturesque character will be created . No place in the environs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the mourner it offers seclusion , amid the consoling influences of nature . The moralist and man of religion will Find room And food for meditation , nor pass by Much , that may give him pause , if pondered fittingly . ' We regard the relics of our deceased friends and kindred , for what they have been , and not for what they are . We can not keep in our presence the degraded image of the original frame , and if some memorial is necessary to soothe the unsatisfied want , which we feel when bereaved of their presence , it must be found in contemplating the place , in which we know that their dustis hidden . The history of mankind , in all ages , shows that the human heart clings to the grave of its disappointed *vishes , that it seeks consolation in rearing emblems and monuments , and in collecting images of beauty over the disappearing relics of humanity . This can be fitly done , not in the tumultuous and harassing din of cities , not in the gloomy and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdure of the field , under the broad and cheerful light of heaven ,  --  when the harmonious and ever changing face of nature rernindsus by its resuscitating influences , that to die is but to live again.
