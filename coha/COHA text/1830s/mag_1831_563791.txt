txt The following Lecture and another of about the same length on the same subject were delivered last winter , by request of the Committee of the Mass*chusstts Charitable Mechanic Association , before that body , to whom they are now very respectfully dedicated . The second lecture , embracing the period from the fall of Napoleon to the abdication of Charles X. will appear in the next number of the Magazine . THE public attention has been very much occupied during the last few months with the important events which have recently occurred in France and the neighboring European States ; and it must be owned , that the interest we feel in these events is amply justified by their character . They are of the highest moment to the parties immediately affected by them , and who constitute at present the most enlightened and civilized portion of the human family . They have been brought about in a considerable degree by the agency of one of our own adopted citizens , in whose success and glory we all feel a just pride ; and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but exercise a strong indirect influence upon our own welfare . It is therefore quite proper for us to watch the progress of these movements with much attention ; and to devote to the consideration of them such portions of our leisure , as we can with propriety withdraw from other and more urgent affairs and studies . And these events are so intimately connected with those which have preceded them in the same country during the last thirty or forty years , that it is obviously impossible to form a correct notion of the character and results of the second revolution without previously possessing some general idea of those of the first . As the course of my life or several years past has led me to bestow some attention upon the politics of Europe , I shall venture in this and a following lecture to attempt a rapid sketch of the principal events and characters of the French Revolution . I shall , of course , be able , within so short a compass , to present only a mere outline of this vast subject ; which however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you who are not acquainted with it , and may refresh in some particulars , the memory of those who are . In taking this cursory survey of a long and interesting series of events , I shall not make myself the indiscriminate eulogist or censor of any person or party . Every thing was done in the name of liberty ; but that sacred name , although often honored by glorious achievements , and noble sacrifices , was often disgraced by foul crimes . I shall endeavor to render justice to the different parties , and shall deduce occasionally some practical conclusions from the various results that have attended their respective efforts , which may not be without their application in our own more fortunate country . There is doubtless some illusion in the importance which we attach to all contemporary events , and there have probably been other periods in the history of the world which have appeared to be at the time and in fact really were not less interesting than that in which we live . But after makiiig all proper allowance for any error on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of events which constitute or have grown out of the French Revolution is one of the most remarkable that have ever occurred . The Reformation ,  --  the Crusades ,  --  the Fall of the Roman Empire , were all attended with long , tremendous and widely spreading political convulsions , which unsettled for a time the whole fabric of civilized society . But the French Revolution seems to concentrate within a shorter compass of time a still greater number of important events and illustrious characters . There is also this difference between this and the other revolutions to which I have alluded , that the latter occurred at comparatively barbarous periods ; for which reason we feel somewhat less interest in the fortunes of the persons who took a part in them . The French Revolution has been effected in the full daylight of a highly civilized age and gives us a view of human nature , employing all its powers for good and evil on the grandest scale , at the hi gheat point of perfection , which they seem to be capable og attaining . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to furnish to the moral and political observer a more magnificent , and , at the same time , a more appalling spectacle , than is offered by any other chapter in the history of man . The apparent immediate cause of the French Revolution was hardly commensurate in importance with the grandeur of the effect . After the close of the // American war , the finances of the kingdom were somewhat in disorder , and there was an annual deficiency of no very alarming amount in the revenue . As the public resources were in the main unimpaired , a skilful financier would have found no difficulty in applying a remedy to this trifling mischief . The counsellors of Louis XVI . could think of no other but that of calling together an Assembly of Notables , or , as we should say in this country , a Convention of the principal persons in the kingdom , a step which could hardly be taken without important consequences , and which , in this case , led the way directly to the great events of the revolution . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which occasioned this measure with all its important results , was the apparent a*4 ostensible , but not the real , cause of the movement that followed . So trifling a circumstance could not have produced such astonishing consequences , unless the kingdom had been ripe for great changes ; and if this difficulty had not existed , any other , equally unimportant , occurring at about the same time would have served the same purpose . The real cause of the French Revolution was the great alteration that had gradually taken place in the state of society by the effect of the progress of civilization , and the consequent incongruity between the new condition of the people and the ancient forms of government . The northern barbarians who conquered the Roman empire divided the land and wealth of which they incame possessed among their principal military followers , and reduced the mass of the people to absolute slavery . This arrangement created the classes of nobles , vassals and slaves , which formed the basis of the political system that succeeded , and under the name of the Feudal System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization affected this system in two ways . By corrupting the nobles , who , from their wealth , were of course the first to feel its effects , it diminished their importance and augmented that of the kings . On the body of the people , it operated differently . It released them from bondage ; endowed them with wealth and knowledge , and gave them as a necessary consequence a substantial importance in the state . This double operation of the same cause had proceeded so far at the time when the revolution actually occurred that the higher classes had become as a body , and , with some illustrious exceptions , intellectually and morally completely corrupt and imbecile , and that the body of the people , or ,  --  as they were then called in France ,  --  the Third Estate , possessed all the talent , information and virtue in the community . In the mean time , the form of government , - which gave the whole political power to the privileged classes , and treated the body of the people as a mere passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reflections to which it naturally led , were concisely and pointedly described by the Abbe Sieyes in a pamphlet , which consisted of a short commentary on the three following questions and answers . What is the Third Estate ? Every thing . What has it hitherto been ? Nothing . What ought it to be in future ? Something . The same state of things existed substantially through the whole continent of Europe , and hence the facility with which the revolution , after it once began in France , invaded and subjugated all the other countrie* . The right of the people to be something in the state was in fact too plain to be gainsaid ; and after the freedom of thought and speech had been made general by the controversies of the Reformation , there-were not long wanting persons to asseit it . Between the peace of Westphalia , which closed the religious wars in 1648 , and the opening of the revolution , a series of masterly writers in different parts of Europe , but especially in France , took up the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its branches . The works of some of them , particularly Locke and Montesquieu , are of permanent and standard value . Those of Voltaire , Rousseau and others are of more questionable merit , but produced at the time a prodigious effect . As a standing commentary on the text of these writers , the example of England was at hand ; a country where the people , - if not every thing ,  --  had long been something in the state , and where the state was evidently none the worse or it . Thus a variety of circumstances concurred to bring matters to a crisis , and nothing was wanted but some accidental spark to determine the explosion . This was supplied by our revolution , which furnished an example of successful resistance , and inspired the young French officers and soldiers who fought under our standard , with an almost frantic eagerneas to imitate it in their own country . The financial embarrassments to which I have alluded , were also the direct result of the expenses into which the French government had been led by co-operating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every way the immediate moving cause of that of France . I may // add , as another circumstance that greatly facilitated it , the character of the king , whose good intentions and feelings led him to give a ready ear to the plans of improvement that were proposed to him , while his total want of firmness and talent rendered him incapable of controlling and directing to any good result the movementC which he created by attempting to execute them . Such were the causes , remote and immediate , of the French Revolution . The first scene in this grand and bloody tragedy was the Assembly of Notables , to which I have already alluded , and which met for the first time at Versailles , then the residence of the Court , in May , 1787 . It was of course in session at about the same time with the convention that framed the Constitution of the United States . They met for purposes ostensibly similar , but the mission of one was to create , and that of the other to destroy . The Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned and the following one , but their only result was a recommendation to the king to convoke the States.General . Observe , gentlemen , that all this time the only ostensible difficulty , for the removal of which this tremendous machinery was put in fnotion ,  --  one convention assembled and another still more formal recommended ,  --  was a comparatively trifling deficiency in the revenue . In pursuance of the recommendation of the Notables the king summoned the States-General , or Parliament , as it is denominated in England , which met in like manner at Versailles on the 5th of May , 1789 , and consequently just two months after our constitution went into operation . The States-General was a body well known in the ancient practice of the French government , but had not been assembled for more than two centuries preceding ; so that the mere fact of its convocation constituted of itself an epoch in the history of the monarchy . The States-General consisted of three chambers , or as they were called , States , composed respectively of deputies elected by the nobles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rather curious circumstance , that the name of States which was thus given to these different orders seems to recognize them for what they in fact very nearly were , three communities , independent of , if not hostile to , each other , dwelling , side by side , on the same territory . The most prominent members of the popular party in this body , and those whose characters gave the tone to its proceedings , were Talleyrand , Sieyes , and the Count de Mirabeau . The action of the two former , who both belonged to the order of the clergy , was more behind the scenes . Sieyes seldom or never spoke in the assembly , and his silence was declared by Mirabeau to be a public calamity . Mirabeau was himself the soul and moving spirit of the body . He was in point of talent the John Adams of the French Congress , but his moral character was widely different from that of the Colossus of our Independence ; and to this difference may be traced in no small degree the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the conduct of political affairs at about the same age of forty , but their previous pursuits had been of a very opposite description . Adams had passed his youth in reading and study , and his mature age in the laborious practice of an honorable profession and of every public and private virtue . Mirabeau , at a period of general licentiousness , was the most licentious person of his time . It was remarked by his brother the Viscount de Mirabeau , who was also distinguished for his talent and immorality , but was eclipsed by the superiority in both respects of his brother , that in any other family he should have been a wit and a rogue , but that in his own , he was a fool and a saint . Mirabeau had been seventeen times imprisoned at the instance of his father by the process then common in France under the name of a lettre de cachet , which was a warrant under the king 's privy seal for the commitment of an individual to some state prison , granted generally at . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of niischief . He had , however , distinguished himself by some political writings which had recommended him to the attention of the government , and a short time before the revolution had been employed as a secret diplomatic agent at the Court of Prussia . When the decree was issued for the convocation of the States-General , he offered himself to the nobles of his province as a candidate for the honor of being one of their deputies , but was unanimously rejected on account of his notorious immorality . Repulsed in this quarter , he next addressed himself to the Third Estate , and for the purpose of qualifying himself to represent them , opened a little shop at the city of Aix in Provence . The people were pleased with such condescension in a nobleman , and elected him by acclamation . Thus it was that the champion of the popular party , with the sense of a thousand wrongs , as he doubtless supposed 16 // them , received from the government and nobles , rankling in his bosom , came up , like Marius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the camp of his enemies . There was something extraordinary , and as it were , portentous in the very person of this remarkable man . His monstrous head , large features and long thick hair , which he wore in a loose and shaggy state , gave him an almost savage aspect . In a letter to a lady who had not seen him and wished for a description of his person , he tells her to figure to herself a tiger pitted with the small pox . He had on each side of his mouth a large projecting tooth , and when he spoke of his intention to attack his opponents , he was accustomed to say , that he would show them the boar 's tusks . Such were the person and qualities of Mirabeau . I have dwelt upon them at some length , because he is one of tI*e three or four most eminent persons of the whole revolution . The ostensible object for which the States-General had been convoked , was ,  --  as I have remarked ,  --  to provide the means for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , taken advantage of the occasion to endeavor to obtain a redress of a variety of special grievances real or supposed ; and most of the deputies afrived at Versailles provided with copious written instructions from their constituents for this purpose . It was not , however , upon the subject of the finances or of any of the projected alterations in the laws that the decisive battle was fought between the court and the popular party . This great case was tried upon a question of mere form . According to the ancient usage , the deputies of the three orders which composed the States-General met in separate chambers ; and had this form been maintained , the two houses of the nobles and clergy , both of which adhered by large majorities to the court , would have furnished a complete check upon the proceedings of the popular body . If , on the contrary , the three classes of deputies met together in joint convention , the deputies of the third estate , or comm6ns , who were equal in number to both the other orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would possess an overwhelming superiority , and would act without any check whatever . Had the court proceeded with firmness and discretion , they would have settled these points of form beforehand ; but nothing had been done , and the whole matter had been left open for the decision of the states themselves . After the ceremony of the opening , the several orders met in separate chambers , and the nobles and clergy manifested , as was natural , a disposition to adhere to this arrangement . The commons insisted firmly on a joint convention . Several weeks elapsed in negociations upon this subject , which , however , were never brought to any formal conclusion , for while they were going on , the individual members of the clergy and nobility who were favorable to the pretensions of the commons successively quitted the assemblies of their own orders , and joined that of the third estate , which , thus reinforced , finally declared itself the sole representation of the people , and rejecting its original name , assumed the title of the National Assembly . The court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretension . The king summoned a joint meeting of the three estates , at which he assisted in person , and where , after making of his own mere motion certain changes of a popular character in the laws , he finally dissolved the states . The assembly refused to acknowledge the validity of this dissolution , and , after the king had retired , continued their sittin* as before . On hearing this , the king despatched his master of ceremonies to c ear the room ; and it was then that the champion of the commons first exhibited to the astonished eyes of the adherents of the court the boar 's tusks . Slave said Mirabeau ,  --  ' return and tell your master , that we came here in compliance with the will of the people , and that nothing but the point of the bayonet shall induce us to separate . ' Alarmed at this violent language , and.at the popular commotions which about the same time took place at Paris , the court yielded , and acquiesced in the continuance of the session . These proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto been nothing , and who had aimed at being something , were already every thing . The National Assembly proceeded to arrange a constitution in which they assigned to the king a certain share of power , but it was apparent to all , that the substance was entirely in possession of the commons , if it had not already passed into the hands of a still more violent party . While these proceedings were in progress , the populace of Paris had stormed the Bastile , and subsequently marched in tumultuous array to Versailles ,  --  invaded the palace ,  --  massacred the guards ,  --  and brought back the royal family in triumph to the capital . Lafayette , who commanded the National Guard , had been wholly unable to control the fury of the populace . Meanwhile the princes and most of the nobility , // foreseeing the storm which was to follow , left the kingdom ; and the king himself , not long after his return to Paris , attempted to follow their example , but was apprehended when on the point of crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had he effected it ,  --  without materially altering in other respects the course of events , would have prevented one great crime . In the mean time , however , the National Assembly , who had now transferred their sittings to Paris , having completed the new constitution , and obtained its acceptance from the king , finally brought their labors to a close . It was before this time apparent to all that the revolution was taking an unfortunate course , and that , unless some measure could be taken to arrest it , it would plunge the kingdom into a gulf of incalculable evils . The two great champions of the friends of liberty , Mirabeau and Lafayette , perceived the danger , and earnestly endeavored in different ways , and without concert with each other , to avert it . Before the king 's attempt to escape , Mirabeau had come to an understanding with the court , that he should use his influence with the assembly in favor of a moderate policy , and was concerting measures with the government for the purpose of placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check upon the progress of anarchy . Whether his influence , great as it was , would have been sufficient to effect the object , is perhaps uncertain ; but it so happened that in the midst of these negociations and arrangements he was suddenly taken ill , and died , not without strong suspicions of poison . I am dying , ' were the last words he uttered , I am dying , and the monarchy will perish with me . ' Such was the end of the brief and brilliant career of Mirabeau ;  --  a man , who in a few short months of political action exercised more influence ,  --  produced more important immediate results ,  --  and acquired a more extensive and permanent notoriety by merely civil means than any individual of ancient or modern times . Lafayette , at a somewhat later period , when the opening of the war had ptaced him at the head of the army on the frontiers , and when the invasion of the Thuilleries by the populace on the 20th of July , 1792 , had shown that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his post , and repaired to Paris for the purpose of using his influence in their favor . Finding himself but feebly supported , he proposed to the king to effect his escape , and offered to lend him his assistance ; but he could not prevail upon the feeble monarch to venture on another attempt . Afterwards , when the storming of the palace on the following 10th of August , and the subsequent imprisonment of the king had rendered the danger still more pressing , Lafayette arrested the persons who resided at his head-quarters as commissioners of the government , and declared that he would hold them as hostages for the safety of the royal family . But at this juncture , he was deserted by his troops and was compelled to provide for his own safety by a hasty flight . On his arrival in the territory of the allies , he was treated as a state prisoner , and placed in close confinement in the castle of 01-rnutz in Moravia . Washington vainly interceded for his release , and he remained in his dungeon until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first and most brilliant campaign he dictated peace to Austria on his pwn terms ,  - -  stipulated for the liberty of his generous countryman . The failure of the attempts of Lafayette and Mirabeau to check the progress of disorder , shows how much easier it is to raise a popular commotion than to quell it or direct it to useful ends ; but it serves - at least in the case of Lafayette ,  --  to evince the rectitude of his own intentions , and to keep his character , unstained by the excesses of the first revolution , to be the main dependence and safeguard of liberty in the second . The National Assembly ,  --  as I have already remarked ,  --  after terminating the work of the constitution , had declared its own dissolution , and another , commonly called the Legislative Assembly , was forthwith elected and organized according to the forms of the system . It consisted wholly of new members , the persons composing the former having declaied themselves , before the dissolution , ineligible to the next . This measure , though adopted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country of the services of its ablest men , who had already acquired an experience which would have been even more useful than their talents . The party that possessed the ascendancy in the Legislative Assembly has been commonly called the Gironde party , because some of the principal leaders came from the neighborhood of the city of Bordeaux , which is watered by a river of that name . They were generally young men , from the middling classes of society , of fine talents , lively imaginationss , ardent // passions , and brilliant eloquence . They were real enthusiasts in the cause of fi*ee .. dom , and if excellent intentions and noble sentiments had been sufficient to insure success they would doubtless have obtained it , but they were swept away by a headlong torrent which no personal qualities , however eminent and valuable , could have enabled them to stem . Their most distinguished orator was a lawyer from Bordeaux , named Vergniaux . Brissot , a m*n of letters , who had published , among other works , an account of his travels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most eminent man among them on the whole was Condorcet . He had been distinguished before the revolution as a profound scholar , particularly in mathematics . The study of this branch of learning is enerall supposed to create a precise and rigorous method of thinking , but it so y appened that Condorcet ,  --  one of the ablest mathematicians of his day ,  --  when he turned his attention to politics , professed the wildest and most visionary theories that have ever been started . He believed , that our nature was susceptible of improvement to an indefinite extent , and that by the effect of successive meliorations in the forms of government and the habits of private life , we should aduall reach such a point as to become not only perfectly wise , virtuous and y appy , but actually immortal upon the face of the earth . This doctrine he bequeathed to posterity in a work entitled an Essay on the Progress of the Human Mind , composed in the prison to which he was consigned by the fall of his party , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to produce a stronger example of the inconsistency that we often observe between theory and experience , than that of Condorcet ,  --  in the depths of a dungeon , in a kingdom abandoned for the time to all the horrors of complete anarchy , and with the poison which was his only resource against an ignominious death in his pocket ,  --  indulging in dreams of the practicability of a state of perfect innocence and happiness . BTrt the most interesting person in this group , and the one who may perhaps be considered as the leader of the party , was the celebrated Madame Roland , the wife of the Minister of the Home Department at the time of which I am now speaking . Although educated under circumstances not very favorable to improvement , she had by the mere force of her own taste and talent placed herself on a level in point of information and extent of views with the highest minds of her own or any other time . She co-operated actively with her husband in the discharge of the duties of his department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerations and delusions of the period , she nevertheless exhibited a sounder sense and a more resolute humanity than any of her political associates . She made the strongest efforts , in particular , to prevent her friends from allowing themselves to be carried away by the more violent party in the Convention into a co-operation in the measures that led to the trial and condemnation of the unfortunate king . She wrote with an elegance and a manly vigor , which would have done honor to the best authors in the language . Her accomplishments and talents were of course no title of exemption from the fate of her friends , and she suffered with a courage and constancy worthy of her character . She employed the time of her imprisonment in writing memoirs of her life which are not inferior in beauty of composition to the celebrated Confessions of Rousseau . One of her companions in peril has given a touching account of her deportment under these trying circumstances ; Although well aware of the fate that awaited her , her tranquillity was in no wa a ected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance was still extremely en a ing . She was tall and elegantly formed . Her countenance was exceedingly intelligent , but her misfortunes and her long confinement had imprinted on it an expression of melancholy , which softened the vivacity that was natural to it . She had the soul of ii republican , enclosed in a form modelled by the graces , and fashioned by a certain courtly elegance . There was something more than the ordinary feminine expression in her large black eyes , which were full of softness and meaning . She conversed with the freedom and courage of a great man . This republican language , in the mouth of a beautiful French woman about to mount the scaffold , was one of the miracles of the revolution , for which we were not prepared . We all listened to her with admiration and astonishment . Her conversation was serious , without being cold ; and such was the pure and harmonious flow of her language , that it seemed like a sort of music , with which the ear would never be satiated . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effeminate regret , and often lamented their want of firmness . Sometimes , her sex resume d the ascendancy , and we saw that she had // been weeping at the recollection of her husband and child . The woman who attended her , said to me one day ,  --  " Before you she collects her strength , but in her cell she sometimes leans upon the casement , and weeps for three hours together . " This mixture of softness and force made her still more interesting . On the day of her trial she dressed herself with care , in white , and her long black hair fell in loose ringlets to her waist . Her appearance would have moved the sternest heart . On her return from court , she entered the room with a liveliness that seemed like pleasure . One of her companions , who was to share her fate and who appeared to want courage , she consoled with so much unaffected gaiety , that she made him smile several times . At the place of execution she bowed before the statue of Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! what crimes are not committed in thy name ! ' Such was the character and composition of the celebrated Gironde party , which possessed the ascendancy in the Legislative Assembly . They exhibit the bright side of the character which was naturally formed by the circumstances under which they lived . Although prevented by insurmountable obstacles from effecting any real good , and even hurried reluctantly into a participation in excesses which they internally abhorred , they possessed originally the qualities and graces which most highly adorn our nature , and had or une been more propitious to them , would have recorded their names among those of the benefactors and ornaments of our race . But the revolution was now rushing forward in its downward career with a fury which no person or party was able to resist , until it finally exhausted its force by its own excesses . The invasion of the palace on the 20th of July , 1792 , the storming of it on the 10th of August , the imprisonment of the royal family , and the massacre of the prisoners in September of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris had taken the government into their own hands . The royal authority was extinct , and the Legislative Assembly , overawed by the terrors which surrounded them , gave up the struggle , pronounced their own dissolution , and summoned a Convention of the people to form another constitution , and proceed to the trial of the unfortunate monarch . This body , whose existence and activity corresponded with the worst period of the revolution , will ever be an object of detestation and horror to the friends of humanity and freedom . It contained in the first instance a majority of members from the Gironde party ; but these were from the first over-awed , and pretty soon forcibly over-mastered by the violent party , which had formed the minority in the Legislative Assembly , and which was the representative and instrument of the populace of Paris . This party were denominated Jacobins , because the club which regulated their proceedings held its meetings in a convent of Jacobins or Monks of the order of St. James . They were generally men without education , talent or principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thrown up from the lowest walks of society by the convulsive agitations of the times , and whose only means of sustaining themselves was the blind and frantic energy with which they directed the fury of the populace against their real or supposed adversaries . So low indeed was the most enlightened and civilized nation in Europe reduced at this period , as to be governed for two years by a set of tyrants , precisely on a level in point of character and manners with a horde of common pirates and highwaymen . Among the persons who have obtained an infamous notoriety as the leaders of this party , the most conspicuous were Marat , Danton and Robespierre . The last combined a little more external decency of manner than belonged to the others , with equal or greater essential ferocity , but does not appear to have possessed any real superiority of talent . He had been , before the revolution , a lawyer of low reputation , and as a member of the national assembly had made himself ridiculous by an affected and almost burlesque style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when his hands were daily dippe4 in the blood of the most respectable and blameless among his fellow-citizens , he insulted still farther the common sense and feeling of the world by organizing a public festival in honor of the Supreme Being ; and it is thought by some , that had his influence continued , he would have attempted to establish a new system of religion , and to make himself a sort of modern Mahomet . But it would be painful and useless to dwell at length upon the character , and actions of these miscreants . As they possessed the coarseness and ferocity of common banditti , so their system of administration was a repetition , on a larger scale and during a period of more than two years , of the scene which takes place on board a quiet trading vessel which has been captured by pirates ,  --  an indiscriminate // slaughter of all whose position in society rendered them formidable , or whose wealth excited cupidity . The termination of their career corresponded with its character . While they were acting in concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they successively destroyed each other in mutual broils ; until at length , after the fall of Robespierre , which was immediately effected by men not much better than himself , the popular frenzy , that had given them importance , appeared to have spent its force , and a reaction took place , which gradually brought about another state of affairs . From this time forward , until the fall of Napoleon , the revolution assumed an exclusively military character ; and , though still sanguinar , gains at least in the large scale on which it was conducted , and the prodigious extent which it brought into action . I have already remarked that the same circumstances which were the real and substantial causes of the French revolution ,  --  the inconsistency which had gradually grown up between the state of society and the form of government ,  --  existed not only in France , but in most of the continental nations , and to a certain extent in England . It was quite natural , therefore , that when the people of France had abolished their government as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other governments constituted on similar principles , should begin to feel alarmed for their own safety . It is evident , in fact , that from the time of the complete triumph of the revolution till the return of the Bourbons , there was a virtual war between France and all the other governments in Europe , although in the course of that long period many , and at one time nearly all of them , were ostensibly in alliance with her . The French , perceiving that the other powers were taking measures to act in concert a ainst them , deemed it prudent , as it probably was , to commence the attack themselves ; and , in the spring of 1792 , declared war against Austria . The other powers immediately took part with the emperor , and the war soon became general . It would have been natural to suppo*b that this great coalition would have overwhelmed at once a single nation , especially one distracted as France then was by the struggles of contending factions . The result , however , soon proved that the frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of liberty and independence was more than sufficient to counterbalance the immense superiority of force and discipline on the other side . The allies were repulsed in an attempt at invasion . Shortly after , the French carried back the war into their own territory , and conquered the whole of Holland in a single campaign . In other quarters , the success was in general on their side ; but it was not until the appearance of Napoleon Bonaparte on the scene of action that it became so decisive as first to alarm and finally to subjugate or overawe the whole continent of Europe . The first decisive exhibition of that force of character , and prodigious military talent which enabled this person ,  --  the most remarkable that has ever appeared in active life ,  --  to determine for many years the destinies of the civilized world , was made at Paris , on the 5th of October , 1795 , in defence of the Convention against an armed insurrection of the sections or wards of the capital . After the fall of Robespierre , the party which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have remarked ,  --  of men not much better than he , were led by the reaction of public feeling to pursue a rather more moderate course . The form of government under which the horrors of the reign of terror had been perpetrated had become odious , and it was determined to establish another , the particular arrangements of which , as of all the ephemeral constitutions that so rapidly succeeded each other at this period , are too unimportant to require a-recapitulation . But in carrying these arrangements into effect , the members ofthe Convention , for the purpose of perpetuating their own power , decided that two thirds of the principal legislative assembly , which was to act under the new constitution , should consist of persons to be chosen by them from their own body . This act , sufficiently exceptionable in its own nature , was rendered still more so by the odium which naturally attached itself to all the members of the Convention who had been either actively or passively concerned in the sanguinary scenes that had just terminated . An extensive feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested itself at this disturbed period in the form of open insurrection . On the day I have just mentioned , the national guard of Paris actually assembled in arms to the number of thirty thousand men , but without artillery , and marched upon the Thuilleries for the purpose of overthrowing the government which had been organized under the new constitution , and which was then in session at the palace . It is proper , gentlemen , to remark , that // although the ostensible , and one of the real objects of this movement was to get rid of the remains of the obnoxious Convention , it is also known , that it was the intention of the leaders , had they succeeded , to restore the monarchy in the person of the Bourbons . The government relied for their defence upon a regular army of about five thousand men , provided with two hundred pieces of artillery , in which consisted their principal advantage . After having successively made trial of two or three persons to command this little force , who proved inadequate to the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the decisive action , cast their eyes upon a young Corsican officer , of about twenty-six years of age , who had obtained the rank of brigadier-general , but had been withdrawn from active service , on account of his real or supposed connexion with the party of Robespierre , and was now at Paris , without employment , in very narrow and embarrassed circumstances . This officer was Napoleon Bonaparte . He was then wholly undistinguished from the crowd of- brigadier-generals , but had accidentally made himself known , by his good conduct at the siege of Toulon by the English , to Barras , one of the chiefs of the new government , who had been present there , and now recommended him to his colleagues as a little Corsican , who would not stand upon ceremony . The suggestion was adopted ; and it is easy to conceive that the future conqueror of Marengo and Austerlitz , with two hundred pieces of artillery at his disposal , found no difficulty in dispersing the militia of Paris . A battle of one hour 's length decided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the insurrection succeeded , the monarchy would have been restored ,  --  Bonaparte would have lost his position in the army ,  --  and the course of subsequent events must have been entirely different . His easy and brilliant success on this decisive occasion recommended him of course to immediate promotion . He was forthwith appointed commander-in-chief of the army of the interior , shortly after exchanged this command for that of the army of Italy , and in the spring of 1796 , departed from Paris to enter upon that astonishing campaign from which he returned the virtual master of his country and a great part of Europe . Such , gentlemen , was the first apparition of this extraordinary character on the great poltical theatre which for the twenty years following was almost wholly occupied with his achievements . It would be impossible to recapitulate upon this occasion even in the most summary manner the particulars of this series of events , of which the general features are also too familiar to you to require repetition . I can only make a slight and rapid allusion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married at Paris , on the 9th of March , 1796 , and on the 10th of April following , after traveling more than one thousand miles , placing himself at the head of his army , and making the necessary arrangements , he gained his first victory over the Austrians at Montenotte . Such , gentlemen , was his mode of employing the honey-moon . Two days after followed the victory of Millesimo ; within a week that of Mondovi ; and before the expiration of a month , he had occupied the capital of Piedmont , and dictated peace on his own terms to the king of Sardinia . On the 10th of May , the celebrated victory of Lodi gave him possession of Milan . Arcola and Rivoli assured him of Mantua and annihilated the last remains of the Austrian power in Italy . Rome , now the shadow of a great name , sealed her degradation at the peace of Tolentino , and the indefiLtigable conqueror , following up his advantages over the Austrians , pursued them into their own country , and having brought them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign by the conquest of the proud and illustrious commonwealth of Venice , the most ancient independent state existing in Europe . After this series of victories , unparalleled excepting perhaps by some of his own subsequent achievements , he returned to Paris in a sort of triumph . He had already conceived the project of seizing in form the power which he now possessed in substance ; but he appears at this time to have eonsidered the attempt premature . The fruit , as he afterwards said , was not yet ripe . Whether it was for this reason , or whether his imagination was really flattered with the idea of establishing an empire on the ancient but now desolate seats of civilization , we next find him exhibiting his miracles of science , talent , and activity , on the banks of the Nile , and the sandy deserts of Arabia . It is curious to trace his progress through regions consecrated by their associations with the most interesting events in sacred and secular history ,  --  crushing their ferocious possessors by repeated victories with one hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scientific labors upon their almost forgotten antiquities . It is curious to see // him proceeding on an expedition of discovery to the Red Sea , crossing it at the point where the Jews on their retreat from Egypt had crossed it three thousand years before , mid as he came back narrowly escaping with his life from the same rapid and mountainous tide , which of old , under Providence , overwhelmed the host of Pharaoh . The battle of the Pyramids had given him the complete control of Egypt , and he seems at this time to have entertained a vague idea of taking the direction of Constantinople , and thence marching on the track of Alexander the Great through Persia to the conquest of the British empire in the East . He in fact set forth on this expedition , and proceeded as far as the entrance of Palestine , nor would the success of it , however adventurous it may appear in description , have been by any means so extraordinary as that of some of the projects which he afterwards executed . But on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the little fortress of St. Jean d'Acre , and he was compelled to retrace his steps into Egypt . In the mean time news arrived from Europe which proved that his absence was felt in his own country . The war had been renewed by the allies with considerable advantage , and there was much danger that the results of his former brilliant campaign would be lost by the inefficiency of his successors . With his usual prompt determinatio , * , he embarked at once for Europe ,  --  with his usual good fortune passed safely through the fleets of hostile vessels that covered the Mediterranean ,  --  lost not a moment at his landing even to comply with the usual sanitary regulations , and arrived in person at Paris , before the receipt of his own despatches announcing his return . The moment was one every way favorable to the execution of his projects . The fruit was ripe , and at the first touch fell into his hands . He swept away before him , almost without an effort , the cob-web constitution of the Directory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Corsican , who , as was now plain enough to all the world , as well as to his first patron , had no disposition to stand upon ceremony , seated himself under the name of First Consul , on the throne of St. Louis . But with him the throne of St. Louis was not even a resting-place in the race of ambition . Scarcely had he occupied it , when he started again upon a new career of conquest . Leaving Paris on the 9th of March , 1800 , he crossed the Alps with his army , over heights and through defiles that were scarcely thought passable before for the solitary pilgrim ,  --  burst like a torrent on the astonislied Austrians who were encamped below in the plains of Piedmont ,  --  once more overwhelmed them at the decisive battle of Marengo , and on the second of July made another triumphant entry into the capital of France . In all this , gentlemen , there was something almost miraculous ; nor need we wonder that the people of France and the governments of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand by this astonishing display of military power , and disgusted on the other by the horrors of the preceding periods of the revolution , should have been disposed at first to acquiesce in the pretensions of Napoleon . Such , in fact , was the general feeling . The continental powers were all overawed . England herself consented to the treaty of Amiens , and in the year 1802 ) a general peace prevailed throughout Europe . It soon appeared , however , that this peace was to be of short duration . The restless ambition of Napoleon prompted him to several movements of a nature to alarm the jealousy of his . neighbors , and the treaty of Amiens was never completely executed . In 1803 , Great-Britain declared war against him , and frem this time forward , new coalitions of the leading powers of Europe were successfully formed against him every two or three years , which he for a long time as often crushed by new exhibitions of the same transcendant military talent which had raised him to eminence . That of 1805 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . On the 22d of September , 1805 , Napoleon placed himself at the head of his army . On the 19th of October , he captured the main body of the Austrians under Mack , at Ulm . On the 13th of November he entered Vienna , and on the 2d of December defeated the combined Austrian and Russian armies at Austerlitz . The next year Prussia ,  --  who had unaccountably refrained from acting while the other powers were on foot ,  --  took the field alone , and was overwhelmed at once by a single blow at Jena , before her Russian auxiliaries had time to arrive . These the conqueror proceeded to meet half-way , and , after much hard fighting , brought to terms at Tilsit . Finally , in 1809 , Austria once more tempted fortune , and once more a few rapid and vigorous movements brought her back to submission . On the 9th of April , the Austrian armies took the field ; on the 12th of May Napoleon occupied Vienna , and on the 9th of June closed the campaign with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was // cemented by a family alliance between the powers and appeared to be permanent . In the mean time Napoleon had improved his victories to extend his dominions and his influence in all directions . He had united Holland , part of Germany and a great part of Italy to France . He had placed his brothers on the thrones of Spain , Naples and Westphalia . As his real power increased , he had given himself new and more magnificent titles . He was Emperor of the French ,  --  King of Italy ,  --  Protector of the Swiss Confederation ,  --  and Mediator of that of Germany . The powers that retained a nominal independence bowed before him in dismay and silence . He was virtually the master of Continental Europe . This , gentlemen , might have appeared sufficient to satisfy the ambition of a man , who , twenty years before , was master of nothing but his sword , and found some difficulty in procuring with that the ordinary means of subsistence . And had he chosen to rest here , he might still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transmitted it afterwards to a long line of descendants . England , it is true , still held out , and might probably have held out a good while longer . As Napoleon extended his dominions and power by land , England had extended hers by sea and abroad . As he conquered kingdoms , sh0 had conquered colonies , and her victories on the ocean had been not less brilliant and decisive than his on shore . Nelson had tracked him to Egypt , and while he was crushing the Mamelukes at the foot of the Pyramids , had destroyed his fleet at the battle of the Nile . The triumph of Austerlitz had been clouded by the intelligence of the fatal defeat at Trafalgar . Even now , when he was the master of the continent , he could not show his a upon the ocean . England had drawn a line of circumvallation round the vast extent of the continental coasts , and completely cut off his intercourse by sea with foreign nations . But this blockade , though galling to his pride , had but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of England , he might , if he had chosen , have remained where he was . And it is well observed by Madame de Stael , that he would have rested here , and have been for life the most powerful sovereign in the world , had he possessed any one of the milder or better feelings of our nature ; either the paternal affection that leads a father to wish to provide an inheritance for his child , or compassion for his subjects who had so long been slaughtered by millions in his service , or a just regard for the rights of other nations , or finally , that sort of prudence , which is natural to every man in middle life , when he sees approaching the large shadows that are soon to envelope him forever . One virtue ! any one virtue ! says this elegant writer , " would have been sufficient to secure to him , for life , every bosom . " earthly good . But the heavenly spark was deficient in his What , in fact , was wanting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortune ? Was he ambitious ? He had reached a loftier height of political power than any mortal had in any age or country ever attained before . Did he still desire some farther object on which to exercise this ever restless passion He had before him the glorious task of organizing the internal administration of his own empire ,  --  perfecting the codes of law which he had formed ,  --  completing the magnificent public works of use and ornament which he had commenced ,  - -  making , in a word , the happiness of his people . Was he a lover of science and letters ? He resided in a city which was the acknowleAiged metropolis of civilization , and might have surrounded himself at any time with the most accomplished scholars in every branch of learning . Was he finally a man of taste , fond of the arts , of intellectual and sensual gratification ? Every form of pleasure , every description of amusement courted is senses in the highest state of perfection . The best living artists of every description ,  --  poets , painters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , crowded his capital . The best works of ancient and modern art bad quitted their former seats in different parts of Europe , to come to Paris and do him homage . The Apollo Belvedere and the Venus de Medici attended at his levee , as well as the Pope and the Emperor of Austria . In short , there was nothing of all that has ever been conceived or is in any way conceivable as necessary to fill up the sum of human enjoyment , that was wanting to him . All this , gentlemen , availed him nothing , so long as there was a single nation in Europe which enjoyed an existence in any way independent of his will ; and this was the case with Russia . The Emperor of Russia had connected himself with the system of Napoleon , but in the consciousness of his great resources and real power he was not disposed to acquiesce with tameness in every requisition . 17 // Napoleon , on the other hand , in the state of intellectual intoxication to which he had been gradually exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest appearance of opposition to his will ; and there grew up in consequence between them a feeling of mutual offence and animosity . In an evil hour , Napoleon determined to avenge his supposed injuries , and extinguish forever the last spark of political independence remaining on the continent by a desperate and decisive attack upon Russia . Accordingly , after making preparation on the most extensive scale , and concentrating his troops from every part of Europe , he finally fixed upon the spring of 1812 , to begin his operations , and on the 9th of May of that year , took his departure from Paris upon the celebrated Russian campaign . A few days previous , being at that time a young traveller in Europe , I had arrived at Paris , and had the satisfaction of seeing the Emperor at one of his visits to the theatre . Though at the height of his power , he had lost much of his personal popularity , and was welcomed in public with vuiry little show of friendly feeling . Every expression of sentiment on political matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much greater liberty in private conversation , so universal was the terrQr inspired by the power and well-known remorseless severity of the Emperor . But through this thick veil of prudent disguise it was easy to perceive a foreboding of something disastrous to result from the contemplated expedition . There was a general though suppressed feeling that the head of this fortunate soldier had been turned by the unexampled elevation to which he had risen ,  --  that a sort of madness had seized his brain , and that he was rushing on his ruin , which however could not be effected without the previous infliction of an incalculable amount of additional injury on his unhappy country . A few months previous , I had also seen at Petersburgh his illustrious antagonist . Though his government rested in the main upon the same basis of military power , the Emperor Alexander was personally at the time the object of much more popular favor . He had a naturally manly and open manner which inspired esteem and confidence . He daily walked the streets of the capital , conversing familiarly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with expressions of cordial good-will . The impending contest was at that time distinctly foreseen , and it was perceived that it would be desperate ; but the nation felt that their cause was just , and , trusting in the extent of their resources and the favor of Providence , looked forward with great assurance to the issue . The issue , gentlemen , corresponded , as you know , with these impressions . The great events that brought it about are familiar to us all . Who has not heard of the conflagration of Moscow , the disastrous retreat from Russia , the convulsive efforts of the following years , and the Battle of the Nationsat Leipsic , which proved them to be all ineffectual ,  --  the abdication of Napoleon ,  --  his retirement to Elba ,  --  his miraculous return from that island prison ,  --  the hundred days ,  --  the battle of Waterloo ,  --  the second abdication ,  --  and the final scene at St. Helena ? They have been ever since the standing themes for conversation and writiror , and will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excesses and the punishment of wild ambition . Such , gentlemen , on a rapid and of course most cursory review , were the fortunes of this illustrious soldier . If we look at him merely as a military character , we may say , that he stands unrivalled in ancient or modern times . His achievements far transcend those of Alexander , Caisar , or Frederick , and the great commander , who conquered him in his last battle , would hardly pretend to be his equal . He possessed indeed in the highest perfection all the intellectual and moral qualities necessary to complete success in war ,  --  judgment ,  --  boldness ,  --  energy ,  --  decision ,  --  restless and indefatigable activity ,  --  contempt for effeminate indulgence . In other valuable moral qualities ,  --  in the gentle and kindly affections of our nature ,  --  he seems , as I remarked before , to have been wholly deficient ; and his history shows how little the loftiest talents and the most unwearied efforts can do , without them , for the happiness of their possessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French Revolution , Napoleon , the most distinguished military leader which it brought into action , occupies in it the place which belongs in ours to Washington . As a mere military leader , we may readily admit that he was the superior , although Washington , by doing complete justice to every situation in which he was placed , merited and has obtained the reputation of a commander of the highest class . But Washington possessed the civic and humane virtues which Napoleon wanted ; and it is a subject of consoling // reflection to see how this difference affected their success . Napoleon for want of these virtues ultimately failed in all his objects , while Washington by the aid of them realized infinitely more than his warmest hopes could ever have aspired to . Was the object of their youthful passion the advancement of liberty ? Bonaparte became under the influence of his own ambition the instrument of imposi*g*for a long time a galling despotism upon France and a great part of Europe . Washington contributed more than any one individual to secure the freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wise and well-balanced political constitution . Did they aim at power ? Napoleon grasped the rod of empire with an unsteady hand , and soon lost his hold upon it forever ; while Washington ,  --  with or without the names and insignia of office ,  --  exercised through life an undisputed dominion over the hearts of his countrymen . Did they seek the bubble reputation ? Napoleon experienced the fate of Cromwell , damned to everlasting fame , while the name of Washington is surrounded with a purer and brighter glory than belongs to any other recorded in history . Compare , too , the different terminations of their two careers . Behold Napoleon expiring in agony ,  --  remote from his family , friends and country ,  --  on a burning rock on the coast of Africa ; - Washington restinir in his quiet tomb under the shade of his paternal cedars on the banks of the T*otomac ,  --  his memory embalmed by the tears eternal ' of the wise and good . The comparison , gentlemen , affords consolation to the friends of humanity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race ;  --  and it must be owned that we need some such consolation and instruction , when we contrast the later scenes of the series of remarkable events to which I have now invited your attention with the earlier . I was particularly struck with the contrast , when , three months after the battle of Waterloci , I visited the field where this memorable action was fought , and while viewing the fresh and fearful traces of it , recollected the high and generous enthusiasm for liberty that inspired the patriots of the National Assembly , the glowing visions of political improvement and perfect innocence and happiness which then inflamed and bewildered their imaginations , and led them to efforts which had hitherto produced nothing but unheard of carnage , and a universal uproar of the civilized world . I was tempted to inquire whether the hope of improvement were not in fact a vain illusion , and to doubt the reality of virtue . Happily the experience of our country authorises us to reject these gloomy coiiclusions ; and we may even venture to anticipate that the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own situation suggests to us , will be finally confirmed by the results of the great political experiment that is now in progress in France . The fall of Bonaparte opened the way for a new series of events which has been conducted , on the whole under much better auspices , and may well be thought to hold out a prospect of much more desirable results than that which preceded . Although the character of the future is still far from being quite clear , we may at least indulge a hope that the glory and success of the second French Revolution will ultimately redeem the disgraceful failure of the llrst. 1 propose , gentlemen , to offer a few observations upon the events and characters of the second Revolution in another lecture.
