txt A NOTICE of the first edition of this work appeared in the sixteenth number of our journal ; but in the interval of nineteen years , which separates the first from the . second edition , the field of legal bibliography has been so much enlarged , that the present edition has a fair claim to be considered rather a new work than the extension and enlargement of an old one . During that period , the science of the law has , in England , been illustrated by the labors of the Chittys , father and sons , Sugden , Preston , Theobald , Phillips , Starkie , Amos , Shelford , Collyer , and Stephen , whose treatise on Pleading is , perhaps , the most beautiful and philosophical work on any legal sub which has appeared in England , since the days of Blackstone . Our own country too , which , twenty years ago , had done little more than adapt a few English text-books to our meridian , with just enough of editorial matter to make a decent apology for a copyright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and value of its works on legal subjects . In proof of this , we need only mention ( among others ) the learned treatises of Mr. Willard Phillips on Insurance and on Patents , and of Judge Gould on Pleading , Mr. Laussat 's Essay on Equity in Pennsylvania , which the London Law Magazine pronounces " an admirable book for any man , a wonderful book for a student to write , " the treatises of Mr. Stearns and Judge Jackson on Real Law , the various legal publications of Mr. Angell , Mr. Cushing 's Essay on the Trustee Process in Massachusetts , which , though an unpretending little work , on a subject of local and limited interest , deserves honorable mention as a model of neatness , accuracy , and philosophical disposition of parts , Dunlap 's Treatise on Admiralty Practice , ( in which , by the by , the editorial labors of Mr. Sumner constitute much the most valuable portion , ) and , above all , the Commentaries of Chancellor Kent on American law in general , and of Mr. Justice Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Equity Jurisprudence , all of // which have acquired an European reputation , and earned , for these eminent jurists , in other countries , that meed of applause , which is like the calm , unbiassed judgment of posterity . Nor , in this connexion , should we omit the name of Mr. Theron Metcalf , in the list of American law writers ; for although he has , as yet , appeared before the public only in the capacity of an Editor , the annotations with which he has enriched the text submitted to him , constitute , generally speaking , the most valuable part of the reprint , and bear the same relation to the text itself , which the notes of Mr. Serjeant Williams do to Saunders 's Reports . We hazard the conjecture , that he has in his desk manuscripts enough to give him a high reputation as a discriminating and philosophical law writer , would he present them to the public . An extended and minute analysis of Mr. Hoffman 's " Course of Legal Study , " a work exclusively professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers of a literary journal . For them , it will be sufficient to state , that it contains a general course of legal study , followed by a particular syllabus under every title of the general course , and under each particular title are collected the various works which have been written upon the several subjects which belong to it . Connected with these titles , is a succession of learned , elaborate , and most valuable critical observations upon the most conspicuous of the works , recommended for study and perusal , interspersed with judicious reflections of a general nature , which manifest a mind of great general cultivation , and a lively interest in the progress and improvement of the student . A considerable portion of the second volume is devoted to the head of " auxiliary subjects , " under the various divisions of the geography , and civil , statistical , and political history of the United States , forensic eloquence and oratory , legal biography and bibliography , legal reviews , journals , and essays , codification and proposed amendments of the law , medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional deportment . To the whole is subjoined an appendix , containing hints and advice on note-books , and on debating societies , and moot-courts . In such a work , the most essential and indispensable merit is that of learning and thoroughness . Without these requisites , it would be worse than useless , since it would lead the student to be content with superficial attainments , and give him the notion that he had reached the summit of professional // acquisition , when he had little more than mastered the rudiments . In this respect , Mr. Hoffman 's work is not only unexceptionable , but admirable . Its learning is thorough , copious , and exact , - pressed down and running over , it would take a high rank in this respect , if compared with the labors of European jurisprudents , whose unbroken days , from morn to dewy eve , are passed within the walls of their studies ; but when we remember that it is the work of one , who has been more or less engaged in practice , during its composition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon even the scholars and men of letters , in our young and bustling country , it moves our astonishment no less than our admiration . By what process he has contrived to find time to read so many books , and collect together so stupendous a mass of erudition , quite passes our comprehension . That an ambitious and hardworking lawyer should make himself well acquainted with the learning of the common law , is not so surprising , since that is a kind of knowledge which can readily he exchanged for wealth and honor . But Mr. Hoffman has not contented himself with an acquaintance with such hooks as are authority in Westminster Hall , though these are numerous enough to break the hacks of many camels . He is equally at home among the voluminous treatises of the Roman and Continental law . The catalogue of authors on these subjects , contained in the beginning of the second volume , is , in itself , a work of no inconsiderable research , and we have no doubt that a large l ) roportion of the names will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , we think that those portions of Mr. Hoffman 's work , which treat of the civil law , and recommend its study , are of peculiar value and importance . The study of the philosophical and scientific treatises of the distinguished legal writers of France and Germany , affords an excellent corrective to that narrow spirit which an exclusive devotion to the common law is liable to produce . English law-treatises are , for the most part , mere formularies for practice , and are little more than digests of cases , written without reference to general principles , in a purely technical form , and without any l ) retension to that scientific arrangenent which is deemed so indispensable on the Continent . As this is a work intended for the guidance and information of students , accuracy of judgment is a quality hardly less de // sirable than soundness of learning . In this particular , every lawyer will be likely to think Mr. Hoffman 's opinions more or less correct , in proportion as they coincide more or less nearly with his own . After an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , very generally , correct ; and to most of his critical observations upon books and authors we express our hearty assent , *o far as our knowledge qualifies us to speak . Not that we should on all occasions , have used precisely his language ; sometimes we should have thrown in an additional warmth of eulogy , and sometimes a deeper shade of censure ; but in the main , we go along with him . The hook has one quality , which we especially like . It is a good-natured hook . Mr. Hoffman is a benevolent censor , and seldom puts on the critical black cap of condemnation . He is disposed to do justice to all that is good in an author , and mentions defects and omissions in such a manner as plainly to show that he does it , not because it is agreeable to him , hut because the truth and his duty require it . There are one or two names in his pages who have richly earned a critical flagellation , and we should have felt it to be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands so well qualified as those of Mr. Hoffman ; but we are not sorry that he has not done it . Much as we should have enjoyed the correction , it might have impaired the agreeable impression which the book has left , of the generous and benevolent nature of its author , in obedience to that mysterious feeling which makes a man shrink from the hangman , however much he may wish that murderers and pirates should be hung . To show , however , that with all his kindness of feeling , and disposition to look upon the bright side of books , he is no dealer in unqualified and indiscriminate praise , as well as to give to our readers a fair specimen of his style and manner , we cite the following note upon the Commentaries of Chancellor Kent , premising that , in our opinion , the criticisms upon that admirable work are as correct in substance as they are proper in expression . " ( Note 18 . ) KENT 'S COMMENTARIES ON AMERICAN LAW. - rrhe Commentaries on American Law , ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for many years Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature , of New York , and subsequently Chancellor of that State , have already gained the high reputation of a standard work , and justly rank // next in value and estimation to those of the great commentator on the laws of England . " Much might be said of the deep research , the classical embellishments , the apt illustrations , and the clear and manly style , which characterize every portion of this able work ; but this would be superfluous , as the well-merited fame of this great American jurisconsult , is too well known to need any remarks of this kind . Our duty to the student , in such a case , is rather to note defects , if there be any , than to collect beauties ; the latter abound , the former are to be sought after . In compliance with this view , we shall briefly notice such as have occurred to us. " 1 . The general arrangement , or method of the work , as we think , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few exceptions , the contents of the first volume would have been more suitably found in a fourth ; and those of the fourth would have been better as the second volume ; whilst most of the topics embraced by his second and third volumes should have found their appropriate places elsewhere . " 2 . The learning is sometimes too particular and minute , for an elementary work , as it occasionally loses sight of its iustitutionary character ; and topics are , at times , too abruptly discussed , the student not having presented to him the requisite definitions , and elementary knowledge essential to the due comprehension of the argument . " 3 . The laws of the State of New York are rather too much dwelt on , for a treatise on American jurisprudence ; and the references to legal doctrines , homogeneous throughout the Union , are not always clear and satisfactory . " 4 . Many important titles of the law are wholly omitted ; and but little is said of the extensive doctrine of equity , on which the learned commentator is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of penal law , as they have been softened down by the pervading humanity of our legislation , might have been embraced in his scheme ; and as a system of American law it is defective in some other material branches , which are peculiarly national ; the practical proceedings of courts are , perhaps , justly omitted , but the outlines of pleading , evidence , actions , &amp;c. we should have been much gratified to see explained by so able a pen . " 5 . In the fourth volume , on the doctrines of the realty , we have much to admire ; but we perceive that the learned author 's pen has been too frequently restrained by the consideration , that very many of the common law principles of this abstruse branch of our jurisprudence have been abolished in the State of New // York , by the recent code of that State . This American students generally will have just cause to regret . " Such is our sincere admiration of the labors of this estimable and philosophical jurist , that it sometimes appeared to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many excellences . But as the foregoing ( if they be defects ) , are trivial and easily remedied , we doubt not they will be amply corrected in a new edition : and if not , they can never diminish the class of his readers and admirers . The feelings with which we express our opinions on all occasions , are those of gratitude to all who have enlarged the boundaries of our science , and contributed to its philosophical illustration ; and none deserves the meed of high praise more justly than Chancellor Kent , in this work , as also in his decisions , which must for ever remain a monument of judicial wisdom , learning , and eloquence , without superior in those of any country , or any age ; moreover , the maxim which has guided us in this volume is , Amicus Plato , amicus Socrates , sed magis amica veritas. " - Vol. 1 . pp. 166- 168 . The members of the profession of the law owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Hoffman , for his endeavours to elevnte it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has prescribed to its students . He , who values the law merely as a means of securing a respectable social position and accumulating property , may smile , as he reads the list of books which are recommended in the first and second titles , and will probably skip the eloquent pages which inculcate their diligent perusal . But he , who is aware of the intellectual dangers which attend upon the exclusive study of the technicalities of the law , will take diligent heed to Mr. Hoffman 's advice , and lay deep the foundations of his professional preparation in a thorough course of history , ethics , and natural law . The young student , however impatient he may be to thrust his sickle into the harvest , need not fear that he is losing time in thus devoting himself , for a season , to liberal studies , and lingering in the " primrose paths " of literature and philosophy . The principles of law strike root most deeply , and bear fruit most abundantly , in a mind fertilized by general reading . An ignorant man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may become a walking index of decided cases ; but he will never be a great lawyer . Many honorable names may be pointed out in the annals of the profession , who , it is easy to perceive , would have been better lawyers , had they been better scholars . So long as the question is , merely , how the de // cisions are upon a given point , the difference between one who is a lawyer and nothing more , and a man of ripe and general cultivation , is not perceptible ; but , when the problem proposed is the elucidation of a new point , in which the truth is to be sought by the help , not of direct but of indirect and collateral light , the superiority of the latter over the former is made manifest . His habits of reflection , of tracing effects to causes , and of reasoning from given data to the establishment of contested propositions , enable him to tread firmly in those untried paths , in which the man of forms and precedents stumbles with uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice to Mr. Hoffman , if we omitted to mention , with the highest commendation , the tone of moral feeling , which breathes from every page of his work . He loses no opportunity to impress upon the mind of the youthful student , that it is not enough for him to be a good lawyer , and a good scholar , hut that he must also be a good roan , and that the highest attainments are imperfect , without that delicate moral sense which feels a stain like a wound , and that resolute moral strength which makes a man submit to be torn in pieces rather than do what he knows to be wrong . His remarks on professional deportment are conceived and written with an energy and glow , which remind us of some of the most eloquent passages in the ethical writings of Cicero . These portions of his work we most earnestly recommend to our young legal friends , to confirm and enlighten that moral sensibility which the young are not often without , but which so many cast aside , as an unprofitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's race . Let them read again and again the Resolutions in regard to professional deportment , in the latter part of the second volume , which could have been written only by one , who , in all the various perplexities of an extensive practice , had preserved a spotless purity of moral feeling , and in whom the instinctive sense of right had been aided and strengthened by practical good sense and clear mental discrimination . They are valuable , as giving distinctness and definiteness to principles which are vague , because general ; and they sustain the same relation to a rule of conduct , which the problems in arithmetic and algebra do , to the formula by which they are solved . There is hardly one of the whole forty , about which there can be any doubt ; and though a few of them may seem to betray a dainty and fastidi // ous sense of professional decorum , the fact that they proceed from so high an authority should lead one to suspend his opinion , and inquire whether his own standard may not require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh at the contrast presented by the actual state of things ) , how different and how much more attractive an aspect the profession and practice of the law would assume , were these to become the ruling principles of even any considerable portion of the members of the bar . How would those needless asperities and irritations disappear , which goad a gentle nature into madness , or something like it , and petrify a stubborn one into stone . How would the dark places be enlightened , and the crooked paths be made straight ! But why contemplate a picture , whose ideal hues only serve to make the harsh tints of reality more unsightly ? We feel strongly upon this subject , because the practice of the law is full of peril to the moral nature , and because we fear that we are not improving in this respect . We have been assured , by some of our seniors , not particularly given to the croaking mood , that in their younger days there was a higher standard of character and a better tone of feeling among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , and a more unerring moral sense presiding over their relations to their clients . To these representations , however , we do not yield implicit credence , knowing , that from the time of Nestor downwards , it has been the habit of those who have passed into the lengthening shadows of life , to disparage the things that are , and magnify those which have been . But it can not be doubted that , comparisons apart , there is very great room for improvement . We have ourselves heard ad-. vocates , in their addresses to the jury , ( especially where they closed ) wilfully pervert and color the testimony of witnesses , in a manner it was melancholy to bear . We have seen witnesses themselves treated with an insolent rudeness , betokening as much want of moral feeling as of courtesy and humanity . We have known of lawyers , degrading their honorable profession by mean and dirty tricks , for which the most appropriate punishment would be a ducking in a horse-pond . Without assenting exactly to the comparison , which likens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke , which would otherwise render the house uninhabitable , we are aware , that there are so many disagreeable circumstances attending the // practice of the law , that a lawyer who is disposed to make the most of his privileges , may render himself a very uncomfortable person to every one , with whom he comes in contact ; and we feel also that one who is at the same time a good lawyer and a had man , is a perfect caput lupinum , upon whom honest men have a right ( morally speaking ) to set their dogs , as upon a wolf or a hear . Those moral perils , which we have spoken of as encompassing the practice of the law , are of two kinds ; one , of obvious and palpable ones , against which he who is forewarned is fore-armed . There is danger that the professional man , in his zeal for his client 's success , will not examine the quality of the means by which that success may be attained and that he will surrender his conscience into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apology for oppression or dishonorable conduct ; than which a more lame apology was never offered , none more savouring of that odious sophistry by which a man endeavours to drown the remonstrances of his own outraged moral sense . There is danger , too , that in his intercourse with his brethren , he will obey the law of selfishness , rather than the law of honor or the law of love , and endeavour to gain paltry advantages , by disingenuous suppressions of the truth , by treacherous surprises , by wilful procrastination , and a surly , disobliging temper , which makes the most of accident , oversight , and forgetfulness . The love of money too will beset him with continual temptation . It will tempt him to give such advice as shall be beneficial to his own interests , and fan the expiring embers of ill-will till they kindle into a broad blaze of litigation . It may constrain him to forget the distinction between his own money and that which is intrusted to him on behalf of others , and may lead him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays the payment of a just due . Besides these , and others like them , in which he who sins , sins against light , there are other perils , perhaps more formidable , because less obvious . There is danger , that the habit of constantly taking and supporting one side of a contested question , may in time extinguish the power of separating what is true from what is false* and that evil shall wear no different likeness from good . " . /Ibeurmt studia in mores , " is a remark peculiarly applicable to the studies and employments of the bar . Lawyers , too , are in the habit of seeing so much of the // guilt and infirmities of humanity , and of contemplating its darkest side , that they are in imminent peril of losing all respect for , and sympathy with , human nature , and degenerating into cold-blooded skeptics and sneering misanthropes . He who enters upon the profession with the resolve that the man shall never dwindle into a fractional part of the lawyer , will not fail to guard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purifying , elevating , and softening exercises ; and Mr. Hoffman 's eloquent pages will furnish powerful moral talismans to sustain and defend the pilgrim on his dim and perilous way . Mr. Hoffman earnestly recommends to the student , to take up some one of the four courses of study which he prescribes , and go through with it . We have no doubt that a faithful attention to the most limited of the four would be enough to make one a sound and competent lawyer ; but we doubt whether many will undertake it ; and xve do not consider the chief value of the work to consist in the courses of study which it prescribes , simply as courses . There are different ways of learning law , as well as of learning any thing else ; and each mind selects the course most congenial to its nature . Without wishing to discourage hard study ( without which nothing great was ever accomplished ) , the fact that a man may read more books than is good for him , is as true in law as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as much encumbered with his hook-learning , as David was with Saul 's armour . Great learning requires great powers to make it efficient . The club of Hercules , without the arm of Hercules to wield it , is but a harmless piece of timber . The great value of the " Course of Legal Study " to the practising lawyer , will be found to consist in the help which it will afford in the investigation of law points . It is an admirable catalogue raisonruie to the vast treasures of the Roman , continental , and common law . Here one sees , at a glance , the path of inquiry opened to him ; and all he has to do is to pursue it with resolute steps . So extensive , thorough , and profound is Mr. Hoffman 's learning , that the most experienced practitioner , and the best read lawyer , can not fail to derive benefit from his labors , especially in such questions as require them to seek the foreign aid of the European and ancient Roman law . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is calculated to exert upon young lawyers // and law students . It is emphatically the student 's friend . It is written with a glow of professional enthusiasm , which mature years and long commerce with the world have not had power to chill ; and which , though it may move the ridicule of the frivolous , and the sneer of the morose , can not fail to awaken a throb of responsive feeling in an ingenuous and manly bosom . Here may he found the most judicious advice on books and study , elegant criticism and ripe learning , all conveyed in those cordial tones of encouragement , which are calculated to rouse the indolent , animate the desponding , and confirm the aspiring . The tone of the work is uniformly elevated , addressing itself to the highest and best principles of our nature , and leading the young to the pure and unfading sources of honor , happiness , and respectability . The constant reply of Lagrange to the young men who consulted him respecting their mathematical studies , was , " Study Euler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every law student from Maine to Louisiana , " Study Hoffman . " Without the " Course of Legal Study , " we should deem the most ample law library imperfect . We want no better test than this work supplies , to judge of a young man 's fitness to excel in the profession of the law . If he read it with coldness and apathy , lay it down without reluctance , and return to it a a task , we should tell him frankly , that he had mistaken his vocation , that the stuff was not in him out of which a lawyer could be made ; and we should advise him to seek some other more congenial employment . But if he take it up with eagerness and close it with regret , study diligently the didactic portions , and read the eloquent passages with sparkling eyes and glowing cheek , we should joyfully encourage him to persevere ; we should confidently predict his future eminence ; we should see already within his grasp , the laurel of the advocate and the ermine of the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pleasure which his work has afforded us , and assure him that it will give us much gratification to hear from him again . We hope that he will continue to enrich the jurisprudence of our country , with those harvests which his years of study and reflection have given him.
