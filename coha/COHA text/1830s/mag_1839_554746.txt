txt THERE are few topics of greater attraction , or , when properly treated , of higher importance , than literary history . For what is it , but a faithful register of the successive steps , by which a nation has advanced in the career of civilization ? Civil history records the crimes and the follies , the enterprises , discoveries , and triumphs , it may be , of humanity . But to what do all these tend , or of what moment are they , in the eye of the philosopher , except as they accelerate or retard the march of civilization ? The history of literature is the history of the human mind . It is , as compared with other histories , the intellectual as distinguished from the material , - the informing spirit , as compared with the outward and visible . When such a view of the mental progress of a people is combined with individual biography , we have all the materials for the deepest and most varied interest . The life of the man of letters is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , even in those days when the cloister was the familiar abode of science . The history of Dante and of Petrarch is the best commentary on that of their age . In later times , the man of letters has taken part in all the principal concerns of public and social life . But , even when the story is to derive its interest from his own personal character , what a store of entertainment is supplied by the eccentricities of genius , the joys and sorrows , not visible to vulgar eyes , but which agitate his finer sensibilities , as powerfully as the greatest shocks of worldly fortune would a hardier and less visionary temper . What deeper interest can romance afford , than is to be gathered from the melancholy story of Petrarch , Tasso , Alfieri , Rousseau , Byron , Burns , and a crowd of familiar names , whose genius seems to have been given them only to sharpen their sensibility to suffering ? What matter , if their sufferings were , for the most part , of the imagination ? They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of imagination , and by the gift of genius , unfortunate to its proprietor , have known how , // in the language of one of the most unfortunate , " to make madness beautiful " in the eyes of others . But , notwithstanding the interest and importance of literary history , it has hitherto received but little attention from English writers . No complete survey of the achievements of our native tongue has been yet produced , or even attempted . The earlier periods of the poetical developement of the nation have been well illustrated by various antiquaries . Warton has brought the history of poetry down to the season of its first vigorous expansion , - the age of Elizabeth . But he did not penetrate beyond the magnificent vestibule of the temple . Dr. Johnson 's " Lives of the Poets " have done much to supply the deficiency in this department . But much more remains to be done , to afford the student any thing like a complete view of the progress of poetry in England . Johnson 's work , as every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular plan . The biographies were dictated by the choice of the bookseller . Some of the most memorable names in British literature are omitted , to make way for a host of minor luminaries , whose dim radiance , unassisted by the magnifying lens of the Doctor , would never have penetrated to posterity . The same irregularity is visible in the proportion he has assigned to each of his subjects ; the principal figures , or what should have been such , being often thrown into the background , to make room for some subordinate personage , whose story was thought to have more interest . Besides these defects of plan , the critic was certainly deficient in sensibility to the more delicate , the minor beauties of poetic sentiment . He analyzes verse in the cold-blooded spirit of a chemist , until all the aroma , which constituted its principal charm , escapes in the decomposition . By this kind of process , some of the finest fancies of the Muse , the lofty dithyrambics of Gray , the ethereal effusions of Collins , and of Milton too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticisni , all the effect , that relies on impressions , goes for nothing . Ideas are alone taken into the account ; and all is weighed in the same hard , matter-of-fact scales of common sense , like so much solid prose . What a sorry figure would Byron 's Muse make , subjected to such an ordeal ! The Doctor 's taste in composition , to judge from his own style , was not of the highest order . It was a style , // indeed , of extraordinary power , suited to the expression of his original thinking , bold , vigorous , and glowing , with all the lustre of pointed antithesis . But the brilliancy is cold , and the ornaments are much too florid and overcharged for a graceful effect . When to these minor blemishes we add the graver one of an obliquity of judgment , produced by inveterate political and religious prejudice , which has thrown a shadow ox er some of the brightest characters subjected to his pencil , we have summed up a fair amount of critical deficiencies . With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great and good man , in which he has displayed more of the strength of his mighty intellect , shown a more pure and masculine morality , more sound principles of criticism , in the abstract , more acute delineation of character , and more gorgeous splendor of diction . His defects , however , such as they are , must prevent his maintaining , with posterity , that undisputed dictatorship in criticism , which was conceded to him in his own day . We must do justice to his errors , as well as to his excellences , in order that we may do justice to the characters which have come under his censure . And we must admit , that his work , however admirable as a gallery of splendid portraits , is inadequate to convey any thing like a complete or impartial view of English poetry . The English have made but slender contributions to the history of foreign literatures . The most important , probably , are Roscoe 's works , in which literary criticism , though but a subordinate feature , is the most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general survey of this department , they are wholly deficient . The deficiency , indeed , is likely to be supplied , to a certain extent , by the work of Mr. Hallam , now in progress of publication ; the first volume of which , - the only one which has yet issued from the press , - gives evidence of the same curious erudition , acuteness , honest impartiality , and energy of diction , which distinguish the other writings of this eminent scholar . But the extent of his work , limited to four volumes , precludes any thing more than a survey of the most prominent features of the vast subject he has undertaken . The Continental nations , under serious discouragements , too , have been much more active than the British , in this field . The Spaniards can boast a general history of letters , extending to more than twenty volumes in length , and com // piled with sufficient impartiality . The Italians have several such . Yet these are the lands of the Inquisition ; where reason is hoodwinked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exile , and the stake . How can such a people estimate the character of compositions , which , produced under happier institutions , are instinct with the spirit of freedom ? How can they make allowance for the manifold eccentricities of a literature , where thought is allowed to expatiate in all the independence of individual caprice ? How can they possibly , trained to pay such nice deference to outward finish and mere verbal elegance , have any sympathy with the rough and homely beauties , which emanate from the people , and are addressed to the people ? The French , nurtured under freer forms of government , have contrived to come under a system of literary laws , scarcely less severe . Their first great dramatic production gave rise to a scheme of critical legislation , which has continued , ever since , to press on the genius of the nation , in all the higher walks of poetic art . Amidst all the mutations of state , the tone of criticism has remained essentially the same , to the present century , when , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , have made the classic models , on which their literature was cast , appear somewhat too frigid ; and a warmer coloring has been sought by an infusion of English sentiment . But this mixture , or rather confusion of styles , neither French nor English , seems to rest on no settled principles , and is , probably , too alien to the genius of the people to continue permanent . The French , forming themselves early on a foreign and antique model , were necessarily driven to rules , as a substitute for those natural promptings , which have directed the course of other modern nations in the career of letters . Such rules , of course , while assimilating them to antiquity , drew them aside from sympathy with their own contemporaries . How can they , thus formed on an artificial system , enter into the spirit of other literatures , so uncongenial with their own ? That the French continued subject to such a system , with little change , to the present age , is evinced by the example of Voltaire ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Blew where it listed , laying all things prone ; // but whose revolutionary spirit made no serious changes in the principles of the national criticism . Indeed , his commentaries on Corneille furnish evidence of a willingness to contract still closer the range of the poet , and to define more accurately the laws by which his movements were to he controlled . Voltaire 's history affords an evidence of the truth of the Horatian maxim , " . Nhturam expellas , " &amp;c . In his younger days he passed some time , as is well known , in England ; and contracted there a certain relish for the strange models which came under his observation . On bis return , he made many attempts to introduce the foreign school , with which he had become acquainted , to bis own countrymen . His vanity was gratified by detecting tbe latent beauties of his barbarian neighbours , and by being the first to point them out to his countrymen . It associated him with names venerated on the other side of the Channel , and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , he was not backward in transferring as much as he could of it , by borrowing on his own account , where he could venture , man*-bus plenis , and with very little acknowledgment . The French , at length , became so far reconciled to the monstrosities of their neighbours , that a regular translation of Shakspeare , the lord of the British Pandemonium , was executed by Letourneur , a litt*rateur of no great merit ; but the work was well received . Voltaire , the veteran , in his solitude of Ferney , was roused by the applause bestowed on the English poet in his Parisian costume , to a sense of his own imprudence . He saw , in imagination , the altars which had been raised to him , as well as to the other master-spirits of the national drama , in a fair way to be overturned , in order to make room for an idol of his own importation . " Have you seen , " he writes , speaking of Letourneur 's version , " his abominable trash ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no epithets bad enough , nor fool's-caps , nor pillories enough , in all France , for such a scoundrel . The blood tingles in my old veins in speaking of him . What is the most dreadful part of the affair is , the monster has his party in France ; and , to add to my shame and consternation , it was I who first sounded the praises of this Shakspeare ; I , who first showed the pearls , picked here and there , from his overgrown dungheap . Little did I anticipate , that I was helping to trample under // foot , at some future day , the laurels of Racine and Corneille , to adorn the brows of a barbarous player , - this drunkard of a Shakspeare . " Not content with this expectoration of his bile , the old poet transmitted a formal letter of remonstrance to D'Alembert , which was read publicly , as designed , at a regular s6artce of the Academy . The document , after expatiating , at length , on the blunders , vulgarities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the critical body he was addressing . " Paint to yourselves , Gentlemen , Louis the Fourteenth in his gallery at Versailles , surrounded by his brilliant court - a tatterdemalion advances , covered with rags , and proposes to the assembly to abandon the tragedies of Racine for a mountebank , full of grimaces , with nothing but a lucky hit , now and then , to redeem them . " At a later period , Ducis , the successor of Voltaire , if we remember right , in the Academy , a writer of far superior merit to Letourneur , did the British bard into much better French than his predecessor ; though Ducis , as he takes care to acquaint us , " did his best to efface those startling impressions of horror , which would have damned his author in the polished theatres of Paris " ! Voltaire need not have taken the affair so much at heart . Shakspeare , reduced within the compass , as much as possible , of the rules , with all his eccentricities and peculiarities , - all that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be tolerated , and to a certain extent countenanced , in the " polished theatres of Paris . " But this is not Shakspeare , 2'Cature 's child , Warbling his native wood-notes wild . " The Germans present just the antipodes of their French neighbours . Coming late on the arena of modern literature , they would seem to be particularly qualified for excelling in criticism by the variety of styles and models for their study , supplied by other nations . They have accordingly done wonders in this department , and have extended their critical wand over the remotest regions , dispelling the mists of old prejudice , and throwing the light of learning on what before was dark and inexplicable . They certainly are entitled to the credit of a singularly cosmopolitan power of divesting themselves of local and national prejudice . No nation has done so much to lay the foundations of that reconciling spirit // of criticism , which , instead of condemning a difference of taste in different nations as a departure from it , seeks to explain such discrepances by the peculiar circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discord , as it were , to build up a universal and harmonious system . The exclusive and unfavorable views , entertained by some of their later critics , respecting the French literature , indeed , into which they have been urged , no doubt , by a desire to counteract the servile deference , shown to that literature by their country men of the preceding age , forms an important exception to their usual candor . As general critics , however , the Germans are open to grave objections . The very circumstances of their situation , so favorable , as we have said , to the formation of a liberal criticism , have encouraged the taste for theories and for system-building , always unpropitious to truth . Whoever broaches a theory , has a hard battle to fight with conscience . If the theory can not conform to the facts , so much the worse for the facts , as some wag has said ; - they must , at all events , conform to the theory . The Germans have put together hypotheses with the facility with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last as long . They show more industry in accumulating materials , than taste or discretion in their arrangement . They carry their fantastic imagination beyond the legitimate province of the Muse into the sober fields of criticism . Their philosophical systems , curiously and elaborately devised , with much ancient lore and solemn imaginings , may remind one of some of those venerable English cnthed rals , where the magnificent and mysterious Gothic is blended with the clumsy Saxon . The effect , on the whole , is grand , but somewhat grotesque withal . The Germans are too often sadly wanting in discretion or , in vulgar parlance , taste . They are perpetually overleaping the modesty of nature . They are possessed by a coldblooded enthusiasm , if we may so say , - since it seems to come rather from the head than the heart , - which spurs them on , over the plainest barriers of common sense , until even the right becomes the wrong . A striking example of these defects is furnished by the dramatic critic , Schlegel whose " Lectures " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since they have been reprinted , in the English version , in this // country . No critic , not even a native , has thrown such a flood of light on the characteristics of the sweet hard of Avon . He has made himself so intimately acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of the poet 's age and country , that he has been enabled to speculate on his productions as those of a contemporary . In this way , he has furnished a key to the mysteries of his composition , has reduced what seemed anomalous to system , and has supplied Shakspeare 's own countrymen with new arguments for vindicating the spontaneous suggestions of feeling on strictly philosophical principles . Not content with this important service , he , as usual , pushes his argument to extremes , vindicates notorious blemishes as necessary parts of a system , and calls on us to admire , in contradiction to the most ordinary principles of taste and common sense . Thus , for example , speaking of Shakspeare 's notorious blunders in geography and chronology , he coolly tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anachronisms are , for the most part , committed purposely , and after great consideration . " In the same vein , speaking of the poet 's villanous puns and quibbles , which , to his shame , or rather that of his age , so often bespangle , with tawdry brilliancy , the majestic rohe of the Muse , he assures us , that " the poet here , probably , as everywhere else , has followed principles which will bear a strict examination . " But the intrepidity of criticism never went further than in the conclusion of this same analysis , where he unhesitatingly assigns several apocryphal plays to Shakspeare , gravely informing us , that the three last , " Sir John Oldcastle , " " A Yorkshire Tragedy , " and " Thomas Lord Cromwell , " of which the English critics speak with unreserved contempt , " are not only unquestionably Shakspeare 's , but , in his judgment , rank among the best and ripest of his works " The old bard , could he raise his head from the tomb , where none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . N'ort tali auxilio ! " It shows a tolerable degree of assurance in a critic , thus to dogmatize on nice questions of verbal resemblance , which have so long baffled the natives of the country , who , on such questions , obviously , can be the only competent judges . it furnishes a striking example of the want of discretion , of a regard to the r* *r*i ' * noticeable in so many of the German scholars . With all these defects , however , // it can not be denied , that they have widely extended the limits of rational criticism , and , by their copious stores of erudition , furnished the student with facilities for attaining the best points of view for a comprehensive survey of both ancient and modern literature . The English have had advantages , on the whole , greater than those of any other people , for perfecting the science of general criticism . They have had no Academies , to bind the wing of genius to the earth by their thousand wire-drawn subtleties . No Inquisition has placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark shadow over the recesses of the soul . They hive enjoyed the inestimable privilege of thinking what they pleased , and of uttering what they thought . Their minds , trained to independence , have had no occasion to shrink from encountering any topic , and have acquired a masculine confidence , indispensable to a calm appreciation of the mighty and widely diversified productions of genius , as unfolded under the influences of as widely diversified institutions and national character . Their own literature , with chameleon-like delicacy , has reflected all the various aspects of the nation , in the successive stages of its history . The rough , romantic beauties and gorgeous pageantry of the Elizabethan age , the stern , sublime enthusiasm of the Commonwealth , the cold brilliancy of Queen Anne , and the tumultuous movements and ardent sensibilities of the present generation , - all have been reflected , as in a mirror , in the current of English literature , as it has flowed down through the lapse of ages . It is easy to understand , what advantages this cultivation of all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in divesting himself of narrow and local prejudice , and in appreciating the genius of foreign literatures , in each of which some one or other of these different styles has found favor . To this must be added the advantages derived from the structure of the English language itself , which , compounded of the Teutonic and the Latin , offers facilities for a comprehension of other literatures , not afforded by those languages , as the German and the Italian , for instance , almost exclusively derived from but one of them . With all this , the English , as we have remarked , have made fewer direct contributions to general literary criticism than the Continental nations ; unless , indeed , we take into the account the periodical criticism , which has covered the voi*. xLix. - No. 105. 42 // whole field with a light skirmishing , very unlike any systematic plan of operations . The good effect of this guerrilla warfare may well be doubted . Most of these critics for the nonce ( and we certainly are competent judges on this point ) come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been habitually called , for the most part , in other directions ; and they throw off an accidental essay in the brief intervals of other occupation . Hence their views are necessarily often superficial , and sometimes contradictory , as may be seen from turning over the leaves of any journal , where literary topics are widely discussed ; for , whatever consistency may be demanded in politics or religion , very free scope is offered , even in the same journal , to literary speculation . Even when the article may have been the fruit of a mind ripened by study and meditation on congenial topics , it too often exhibits only the partial view suggested by the particular and limited direction of the author 's thoughts in this instance . Now , truth is not much served by this irregular process ; and the general illumination , indispensable to a full and fair survey of the whole ground , can never be supplied from such scattered and capricious gleams , thrown over it at random . Another obstacle to a right result , is founded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics , and addressed to a miscellaneous class of readers , its chief reliance for success , in competition with the thousand novelties of the day , is in the temporary interest it can excite . Instead of a conscientious discussion and cautious examination of the matter in hand , we too often find an attempt to stimulate the popular appetite , by picquant sallies of wit , by caustic sarcasm , or by a pert , dashing confidence , that cuts the knot it can not readily unloose . Then , again , the spirit of periodical criticism would seem to be little favorable  --  to perfect impartiality . The critic , shrouded in his secret tribunal , too often demeans himself like a stern inquisitor , whose business is rather to convict than to examine . Criticism is directed to scent out blemishes , instead of beauties . " Judex damrmatur c*im nocens absolvitur , " is the bloody motto of a well-known British periodical , which , under this piratical flag , has sent a broadside into many a gallant bark , that deserved better at its hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotism , // - or what passes for such with nine tenths of the world , the spirit of national vanity , - we shall find abundant motives for a deviation from a just , impartial estimate of foreign literatures . And if we turn over the pages of the best-conducted English journals , we shall probably find ample evidence of the various causes we have enumerated . We shall find , amidst abundance of shrewd and sarcastic observation , smart skirmish of wit , and clever antithesis , a very small infusion of sober , dispassionate criticism ; the criticism founded on patient study and on strictly philosophical principles ; the criticism on which one can safely rely as the criterion of good taste , and which , however tame it may appear to the jaded appetite of the literary lounger , is the only one that will attract the eye of posterity . The work , named at the head of our article , will , we suspect , notwithstanding the author 's brilliant reputation , never meet this same eye of posterity . Though purporting to he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is , in fact , a multifarious compound of as many ingredients as entered into the witches ' caldron ; to say nothing of a gallery of portraits of dead and living , among the latter of whom M. de Chateaubriand himself is not the least conspicuous . " I have treated of every thing , " he says , truly enough , in his preface , " the Present , the Past , the Future . " The parts are put together in the most grotesque and disorderly manner , with some striking coincidences , occasionally , of characters and situations , and some facts not familiar to every reader . The most unpleasant feature in the book , is the doleful lamentation of the author over the evil times on which he has fallen . He has , indeed , lived somewhat beyond his time , which was that of Charles the Tenth , of pious memory , - the good old time of apostolicals and absolutists , which will not be likely to revisit France again very soon . Indeed , our unfortunate author reminds one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and dry on the strand , and whose signals of distress are little heeded by the rest of the convoy , which have trimmed their sails more dexterously , and sweep merrily on before the breeze . The present work affords glimpses , occasionally , of the author 's happier style , which has so often fascinated us in his earlier productions . On the whole , however , it will add little to his reputation nor , probably , much subtract from it . When a man has // sent forth a score of octavos into the world , and as good as some of M. de Chateaubriand 's , he can bear up under a poor one now and then . This is not the first indifferent work laid at his door , and , as he promises to keep the field for some time longer , it will probably not be the last . We pass over the first half of the first volume , to come to the Reformation ; the point of departure , as it were , for modern civilization . Our author 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are not precisely those we should entertain . In a religious point of view , " he says , " the Reformation is leading insensibly to indifference , or the complete absence of faith ; the reason is , that the independence of the mind terminates in two gulfs , - doubt and incredulity . " By a very natural reaction , the Reformation at its birth rekindled the dying flame of Catholic fanaticism . It may thus be regarded as the indirect cause of the massacre of St. Bartholomew , the disturbances of the League , the assassination of Henry the Fourth , the murders in Ireland , and of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes , and the dragonnades " ! - Vol. i. p. 193 . As to the tendency of the Reformation towards doubt and incredulity , we know that free inquiry , continually presenting new views , as the sphere of observation is enlarged , may unsettle old principles without establishing any fixed ones in their place , or , in other words , lead to skepticism . But we doubt if this happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Romish church , which , by precluding examination , excludes the only ground of rational belief . At all events , skepticism , in the former case , is much more remediable than in the latter ; since the subject of it , by pursuing his inquiries , will , it is to be hoped , as truth is mighty , arrive , at last , at a right result ; while the Romanist , inhibited from such inquiry , has no remedy . The ingenious author of " Doblado 's Letters from Spain " has painted in the most affecting cc1ors the state of such a mind , which , declining to take its creed at the bidding of another , is lost in a labyrinth of doubt , without a clue to guide it . As to charging on the Reformation the various enormities with which the above extract concludes , the idea is certainly new . It is , in fact , making the Protestants guilty of their own persecution , and Henry the Fourth of // his own assassination ; quite an original view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hitherto escaped the attention of historians . A few pages further , and we pick up the following information respecting the state of Catholicism in our own country . " Maryland , a Catholic and very populous State , made common cause with the others , and now most of the Western States are Catholic . The progress of this communion in the United States of America exceeds belief . There it has been invigorated in its evangelical aliment , popular liberty , whilst other communions decline in profound indjfference. " - Vol. i. p. 201 . We were not aware of this state of things . We did , indeed , know , that the Roman church had increased much , of late years , especially in the valley of the Mississippi . But so have other communions , as the Methodist and the Baptist , for example , the latter of which comprehends five times as many disciples as the Roman Catholic . As to the population of the latter in the West , the whole number of Catholics in the Union does not amount , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single western State of Ohio . The truth is , that in a country , where there is no established or favored sect , and where the clergy depend on voluntary contribution for their support , there must be constant efforts at proselytism , and a mutation of religious opinion , according to the convictions , or fancied convictions , of the converts . What one denomination gains , another loses , till roused , in its turn , by its rival , new efforts are made to retrieve its position , and the equilibrium is restored . In the mean time , the population of the whole country goes forward with giant strides , and each sect boasts , and boasts with truth , of the hourly augmentation of its numbers . Those of the Roman Catholics are swelled , moreover , by a considerable addition from emigration , many of the poor foreigners , especially the Irish , being of that persuasion . But this is no ground of triumph , as it infers no increase to the sum of Catholicism ; since what is thus gained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounces the Reformation hostile to the arts , poetry , eloquence , elegant literature , arid even the spirit of military heroism . But hear his own words . " The Reformation , imbued with the spirit of its founder , // declared itself hostile to the arts . It sacked tombs , churches , and monuments , and made in France and England heaps of ruins The beautiful in literature will be found to exist in a greater or less degree , in proportion as writers have approximated to the genius of the Roman church . " . . " If the Reformation restricted genius in poetry , eloquence , and the arts , it also checked heroism in war , for heroism is imagination in the military order . " - Vol . I. pp. 194-207 . This is a sweeping denunciation ; and , as far as the arts of design are intended , may probably be defended . The Romish worship , its stately ritual and gorgeous ceremonies , the throng of numbers assisting , in one form or another , at the service , all required spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painting , and music also , to give full effect to the spectacle . Never was there a religion which addressed itself more directly to the senses . And , fortunately for it , the immense power and revenues of its ministers enabled them to meet its exorbitant demands . On such a splendid theatre , and under such patronage , the arts were called into life in modern Europe , and most of all in that spot , which represented the capital of Christendom . It was there , amid the pomp and luxury of religion , that those beautiful structures rose , with those exquisite creations of the chisel and the pencil , which embodied in themselves all the elements of ideal beauty . But , independently of these external circumstances , the spirit of Catholicism was eminently favorable to the artist . Shut out from free inquiry , - from the Scriptures themselves , - and compelled to receive the dogmas of his teachers upon trust , the road to conviction lay less through the understanding , than the heart . The heart was to be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the senses to he dazzled . This was the machinery , by which only could an effectual devotion to the faith be maintained in an ignorant people . It was not , therefore , Christ as a teacher , delivering lessons of practical wisdom and morality , that was brought before the eye , but Christ filling the offices of human sympathy , ministering to the poor and sorrowing , giving eyes to the blind , health to the sick , and life to the dead . It was Christ suffering under persecution , crowned with thorns , lacerated with stripes , dying on the cross . // These sorrows and sufferings were understood by the dullest soul , and told more than a thousand homilies . So with the Virgin . It was not that sainted mother of the Saviour , whom Protestants venerate , but do not worship ; it was the Mother of God , and entitled , like him , to adoration . It was a woman , and as such the object of those romantic feelings , which would profane the service of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being in accordance with human sympathies . The respect for the Virgin , indeed , partook of that which a Catholic might feel for his tutelar saint and his mistress combined . Orders of chivalry were dedicated to her service ; and her shrine was piled with more offerings , and frequented by more pilgrimages , than the altars of the Deity himself . Thus , feelings of love , adoration , and romantic honor , strangely blended , threw a halo of poetic glory , if we may so say , around their object , making it the most exalted theme for the study of the artist . What wonder , that this subject should have called forth the noblest inspirations of his genius ? What wonder , that an artist , like Raphael , should have found , in the simple portraiture of a woman and a child , the materials for immortality ? It was something like a kindred state of feeling , which called into being the arts of ancient Greece , when her mythology was comparatively fresh , and faith was easy ; when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a later day , gave a real existence to the beings of fancy , and the artist , embodying these in forms of visible beauty , but finished the work which the poet had begun . The Reformation brought other trains of ideas , and with them other influences on the arts , than those of Catholicism . Indeed , its first movements were decidedly hostile , since the works of art , with which the temples were adorned , being associated with the religion itself , became odious as the symbols of idolatry . But the spirit of the Reformation gave thought a new direction , even in the cultivation of art . It was no longer sought to appeal * the senses by brilliant display , or to waken the sensibilities by those superficial ernotions , which find relief in tears . A sterner , deeper feeling was roused . The mind was turned within , as it were , to ponder on the import of existence and its future destinies . For the chains were withdrawn from the soul , and it was permitted to wander at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of sentiment , - the useful of the merely ornamental . Facts were substituted for forms , even the ideal forms of beauty . There were to be no more Michael-Angelos and Raphaels , no glorious Gothic temples , which consumed generations in their building . The sublime and the beautiful were not the first objects proposed by the artist . He sought truth , - fidelity to nature . He studied the characters of his species , as well as the forms of imaginary perfection . He portrayed life , as developed in its thousand peculiarities before his own eyes ; and the ideal gave way to the natural . In this way , new schools of painting , like that of Hogarth , for example , arose , which , however inferior in those great properties for which we must admire the master-pieces of Italian art , had a significance and philosophic depth , which furnished quite as much matter for study and meditation . A similar tendency was observable in poetry , eloquence , and works of elegant literature . The influence of the Reformation here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the arts . How could it be otherwise on literature , the written expression of thought , in which no grace of visible forms and proportions , no skill of mechanical execution , can cheat the eye with the vain semblance of genius ? But it was not until the warm breath of the Reformation had dissolved the icy fetters which had so long held the spirit of man in bondage , that the genial current of the soul was permitted to flow ; that the gates of reason were unbarred , and the mind was perniitted to taste of the tree of knowledge , forbidden tree no longer . Where was the scope for eloquence , when thought was stifled in the very sanctuary of the heart ? For out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh . There might , indeed , be an elaborate attention to the outward forms of expression ; an exquisite finish of verbal arrangement , the dress and garniture of thought . And , in fact , the Catholic nations have surpassed the Protestant in attention to verbal elegance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brilliancy of composition . The poetry of Italy , and the prose of France , bear ample evidence how much time and talent have been expended on this beauty of outward form , the rich vehicle of thought . But where shall we find the nowerful reasoning , various knowledge , and // fearless energy of diction , which stamp the oratory of Protestant England and America ? In France , indeed , where prose has received a higher polish and classic elegance than in any other country , pulpit eloquence has reached an uncommon degree of beauty . For , though much was excluded , the avenues to the heart , as with the painter and the sculptor , were still left open to the orator . If there has been a deficiency , in this respect , in the English church , which all will not admit , it is probably that the mind , unrestricted , has been occupied with reasoning , rather than rhetoric , and sought to clear away old prejudices and establish new truths , instead of wakening a transient sensibility , or dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fault of the preacher , at all events , and not of Protestanism , is shown by a striking example under our own eyes , that of our distinguished countryman , Dr. Channing , whose style is irradiated with all the splendors of a glowing imagination , showing , as powerfully as any other example , probably , in English prose , of what melody and compass the language is capable , under the touch of genius instinct with genuine enthusiasm . Not that we would recommend this style , grand and beautiful as it is , for imitation . We think we have seen the ill effects of this already , in more than one instance . In fact , no style should be held up as a model for imitation . Dr. Johnson tells us , in one of those oracular passages somewhat threadbare now , that " whoever wishes to attain an English style , familiar but not coarse , and elegant but not ostentatious , must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison . " With all deference to the Doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just quoted , shows , that he did not care to follow his own prescril ) tiOn , we think otherwise . Whoever would write a good English style , we should say , should acquaint himself with the mysteries of the language , as revealed in the writings of the best masters , but should form his own style on nobody but himself . Every man , at least every man with a spark of originality in his composition , has his own peculiar way of thinking ; and , to give it effect , it must find its way out in its own peculiar language . Indeed , it is impossible to separate language from thought , in that delicate blending of both which is called style . At least , it is impossible to produce the same effect with the original , by any copy , however literal . We may , indeed , imitate the struc // ture of a sentence , but the ideas , which gave it its peculiar propriety , we can not imitate . The forms of expression , that suit one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than one man 's clothes will suit another . They will be sure to be either too big or too small , or , at all events , not to make what gentlemen of the needle call a good fit . If the party chances , as is generally the case , to be rather under-size , and the model is over-size , this will only expose his own littleness the more . There is no case more in point than that afforded by Dr. Johnson himself . His brilliant style has been the ambition of every school-boy , and of some children of larger growth , since the days of the Rambler . But the nearer they come to it , the worse . The beautiful is turned into the fantastic , and the sublime into the ridiculous . The most curious example of this , within our recollection , is the case of Dr. Symmons , the English editor of Milton 's prose writings , and the biographer of the poet . The little Doctor has maintained , throughout his ponderous volume , a most exact imitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotundity of period . With all this cumbrous load of brave finery on his back , swelled to twice his original dimensions , he looks , for all the world , as he is , like a mere bag of wind , - a scarecrow , to admonish others of the folly of similar depredations . But to return . The influence of the Reformation on elegant literature was never more visible than in the first great English school of poets , which came soon after it , at the close of the sixteenth century . The writers of that period , one and all , displayed a courage , originality , and truth , highly characteristic of the new revolution , which had been introduced by breaking down the old landmarks of opinion , and giving unbounded range to speculation and inquiry . The first great poet , Spenser , adopted the same vehicle of imagination with the Italian bards of chivalry , the romantic epic but instead of making it , like them , a mere revel of fancy , with no further object than to delight the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it a deeper and more solemn import by the mysteries of Allegory , which , however prejudicial to its effect as a work of art , showed a mind too intent on serious thoughts and inquiries itself , to be content with the dazzling but impotent coruscations of genius , that serve no other end than that of amusement . // In the same manner , Shakspeare and the other dramatic writers of the time , instead of adopting the formal rules recognised afterwards by the French writers , their long rhetorical flourishes , their exaggerated models of character , and ideal forms , went freely and fearlessly into all the varieties of human nature , the secret depths of the soul , touching on all the diversified interests of humanity , - for he might touch on all without fear of persecution , - and thus making his productions a store-house of philosophy , of lessons of practical wisdom , deep , yet so clear , that he who runs may read . But the spirit of the Reformation did not descend in all its fulness on the Muse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in heart , as thoroughly a reformer , and , in doctrine , much more thoroughly so , than Luther himself . Indignant at every effort to crush the spirit , and to cheat it , in his own words , " of that liberty , which rarefies and enlightens it like the influence of heaven , " he proclaimed the rights of man as a rational , immortal being , undismayed by menace and obloquy , amidst a generation of servile and unprincipled sycophants . The blindness , which excluded him from the things of earth , opened to him more glorious and spiritualized conceptions of heaven ; and aided him in exhibiting the full influence of those sublime truths , which the privilege of free inquiry in religious matters had poured upon the mind . His Muse was as eminently the child of Protestanism , as that of Dante , who resembled him in so many traits of character , was of Catholicism . The latter poet , coming first among the moderns , after the fountains of the great deep , which had so long overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wonderful composition , all the elements of modern institutions , as distinguished from those of antiquity . He first showed the full and peculiar influence of Christianity on literature . But it was Christianity under the form of Catholicism . His subject , spiritual in its design , like Milton 's , was sustained by all the auxiliaries of a visible and material existence . His passage through the infernal abyss is a series of tragic pictures of human woe , suggesting greater refinements of cruelty than were ever imagined by a heathen poet . Amid all the various forms of mortal anguish , we look in vain for the mind as a means of torture ; at least , we recall but one solitary exception to this remark . In like manner , in ascending the scale of celestial being , we // pass through a succession of brilliant fetes , made up of light , music , and motion , increasing in splendor and velocity , till all are lost and confounded in the glories of the Deity . Even the pencil of the great master , dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the attempt to portray the outlines of Deity itself . In this he aspired to what many of his countrymen in the sister arts of design have since attempted , and , like him , have failed . For who can hope to give form to the Infinite ? In the same false style , Dante personifies the spirits of evil ; and Satan himself is drawn in all the hughear monstrosities of a superstitious fancy , or , more properly , age . For much was , doubtless , owing to the age , though much , also , must he referred to the genius of Catholicism , which , appealing to the senses , has a tendency to materialize the spiritual , as Protestantism , with deeper reflection , aims to spiritualize the material . Thus Milton , in treading similar ground , borrows his illustrations from intellectual sources ; conveys the image of the Almighty hy his attributes ; and , in the frequent portraiture which he introduces of Satan , suggests only vague conceptions of form , the faint outlines of matter , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime by the unconquerable energy of his will , - the fit representative of the principle of evil . Indeed , Milton has scarcely any thing of what may be called scenic decorations , to produce a certain stage effect . His actors are few , and his action nothing . It is only by their intellectual and moral relations , by giving full scope to the Cherub Contemplation , He that soars on golden wing , Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne , that he has prepared for us visions of celestial beauty and grandeur , which never fade from our souls . In the dialogue with which the two poets have seasoned their poems , we see the action of the opposite influences we have described . Both give vent to metaphysical disquisition , of learned sound , and much greater length than the reader would desire . But in Milton it is the free discussion of a mind trained to wrestle boldly on abstrusest points of metaphysical theology ; while Dante follows in the same old , barren footsteps which had been trodden by the schoolmen . Both writers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should belong to the citizen of // every free state ; that civil liberty which had been sacrificed , in his own country , by the spirit of faction . But Milton claimed a higher freedom ; a freedom of thinking and of giving utterance to thought , uncontrolled by human authority . He had fallen , indeed , on evil times . But he had a generous confidence , that his voice would reach to posterity , and would be a guide and a light to the coming generations . And truly has it proved so ; for in his writings we find the germs of many of the boasted discoveries of our own day in government and education ; so that he may be fairly considered as the morning star of that higher civilization , which distinguishes our happier era . Milton 's poetical writings do not seem , however , to have been held in that neglect by his contemporaries , which is commonly supposed . He had attracted too much attention as a political controversialist , was too much feared for his talents , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell from his pen to pass unnoticed . He lived to see a second edition of " Paradise Lost , " and this was more than was to have been fairly anticipated of a composition of this nature , however well executed , falling on such times . Indeed , its sale was no evidence that its merits were comprehended , and may be referred to the general reputation of its author . For we find so accomplished a critic as Sir William Temple , some years later , omitting the name of 1'Lilton in his roll of writers who have done honor to modern literature ; a circumstance which may , perhaps , be imputed to that reverence for the ancients , which blinded Sir William to the merits of their successors . How could Milton be understood in his own generation , - in the grovelling , sensual court of Charles the Second ? How could the dull eyes , so long fastened on the earth , endure the blaze of his inspired genius ? It was not till time had removed him to a distance , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated . Indeed , Addison , as is well known , was the first to bring them into popular view , by a beautiful specimen of criticism , that has permanently connected his name with that of his illustrious subject . More than half a century later , another great name in English criticism , perhaps the greatest in general reputation , Johnson , passed sentence of a very different kind on the pretensions of the poet . A production more discreditable to the author is not to be found in the whole of his voluminous // works ; equally discreditable , whether regarded in an historical light , or as a sample of literary criticism . What shall we say of the biographer , who , in allusion to that affecting passage , where the blind old bard talks of himself as " in darkness , and with dangers compast round , " can coolly remark , that " this darkness , had his eyes been better employed , might undoubtedly have deserved compassion " ? Or what of the critic , who can say of the most exquisite effusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no man could have fancied , that he read Lycidas with pleasure , had he not known the author " ; and of " Paradise Lost " itself , that " its perusal is a duty rather than a pleasure " ? Could a more exact measure be afforded than by this single line , of the poetic sensibility of the critic , and his unsuitableness for the office he had here assumed ? His " Life of Milton " is a humiliating testimony of the power of political and religious prejudices to warp a great and good mind from the standard of truth , in his estimation , not merely of contemporary excellence , but of the great of other years , over whose frailties Time might be supposed to have drawn his friendly mantle . Another half century has elapsed , and ample justice has been rendered to the fame of the poet , by two elaborate criticisms , the one in the Edinburgh Review , from the pen of Mr. works ; remarkable performances , each in the manner highly characteristic of its author , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose compositions of their subject , as the criticism of Addison did to his poetry . There is something gratifying in the circumstance , that this great advocate of intellectual liberty should have found his most able and eloquent expositor among us , whose position qualifies us , in a peculiar manner , for profiting by the rich legacy of his genius . It was but discharging a debt of gratitude . Chateaubriand has much to say about Milton , for whose writings , both prose and poetry , notwithstanding the difference of their sentiments on almost all points of politics and religion , he appears to entertain the most sincere reverence . His criticisms are liberal and just . They show a thorough study of his author ; but neither the historical facts nor the reflections will suggest much that is new , on a subject now become trite to the English reader . // We may pass over a good deal of skimble-skamble stuff about men and things , which our author may have cut out of his commonplace-book , to come to his remarks on Sir Walter Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics . " The illustrious painter of Scotland , " he says , " seems to me to have created a false class ; he has , in my opinion , confounded history and romance ; the novelist has set about writing historical romances , and the historian romantic histories . " - Vol. ii . p. 306 . We should have said , on the contrary , that he had improved the character of both ; that he had given new value to romance , by building it on history , and new charms to history , by embellishing it with the graces of romance . To be more explicit . The principal historical work of Scott is the " Life of Napoleon . " It has doubtless many of the faults incident to a dashing style of composition , which precluded the possibility of compression and arrangement in the best form of which the subject was capable . This , in the end , may be fatal to the perpetuity of the work ; for posterity will be much less patient than our own age . He will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to bear up under all of his own time , and ours too . It is very certain , then , some must go by the board ; and nine sturdy volumes , which is the amount of Sir Walter 's English edition , will be somewhat alarming . Had he confined himself to half the quantity , there would have been no ground for distrust . Every day , nay hour , we see , ay , and feel , the ill effects of this rapid style of composition , so usual with the best writers of our day . The immediate profits which such writers are pretty sure to get , notwithstanding the example of M. Chateaubriand , operate like the dressing improvidently laid on a naturally good soil , forcing out noxious weeds in such luxuriance , as to check , if not absolutely to kill , the more healthful vegetation . Quantities of trivial detail find their way into the page , mixed up with graver matters . Instead of that skilful preparation , by which all the avenues can verge at last to one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of unity , on the reader , he is hurried along zig-zag , in a thousand directions , or round and round , but never , in the cant of the times , " going ahead " an inch . He leaves off pretty much where he set out , except that his memory may be tolerably // well stuffed with facts , which , from want of some principle of cohesion , will soon drop out of it . He will find himself like a traveller , who has been riding through a fine country , it may be , by moonlight , getting glimpses of every thing , but no complete , well-illuminated view of the whole ( " quale per incertam lunam " &amp;c. ) ; or rather , like the same traveller , whizzing along in a locomotive so rapidly , as to get even a glimpse fairly of nothing , instead of making his tour in such a manner as would enable him to pause at what was worth his attention , to pass by night over the barren and uninteresting , and occasionally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view for commanding the various prospect . The romance-writer labors under no such embarrassments . He may , indeed , precipitate his work , so that it may lack proportion , and the nice arrangement required by the rules , which , fifty years ago , would have condemned it as a work of art . But the criticism of the present day is not so squeamish , or , to say truth , pedantic . It is enough for the writer of fiction , if he give pleasure ; and this , everybody knows , is not effected by the strict observance of artificial rules . It is of little consequence how the plot is snarled up , or whether it be untied or cut , in order to extricate the dramatis persono* . At least , it is of little consequence , compared with the true delineation of character . The story is serviceable only as it affords a means for the display of this ; and if the novelist but keeps up the interest of his story and the truth of his characters , we easily forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heedless motion . Indeed , rapidity of motion may in some sort favor him , keeping up the glow of his invention , and striking out , as he dashes along , sparks of wit and fancy , that give a brilliant illumination to his track . But in history there must be another kind of process ; a process at once slow and laborious . Old parchments are to be ransacked , charters and musty records to be deciphered , and stupid , worm-eaten chroniclers , who had much more of passion , frequently , to blind , than good sense to guide them , must be sifted and compared . In short , a sort of Medea-like process is to be gone through , and many an old bone is to be boiled over in the caldron , before it can come out again clothed in the elements of beauty . The dreams of the novelist , - the poet of prose , // - on the other hand , are beyond the reach of art ; and the magician calls up the most brilliant forms of fancy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his History , was relieved , in some degree , from this necessity of studious research , by borrowing his theme from contemporary events . It was his duty , indeed , to examine evidence carefully , and sift out contradictions and errors . This demanded shrewdness and caution , but not much previous preparation and study . It demanded , above all , candor ; for it was his business , not to make out a case for a client , but to weigh both sides , like an impartial judge , before summing up the evidence , and delivering his conscientious opinion . We believe there is no good ground for charging Scott with having swerved from this part of his duty . Those , indeed , who expected to see him deify his hero , and raise altars to his memory , were disappointed ; and so were those also , who demanded , that the tail and cloven hoof should be made to peep out beneath the imperial robe . But this proves his impartiality . It would be unfair , however , to require the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a distance from the theatre of strife , from those national interests and feelings , which are so often the disturbing causes of historic fairness . An American , no doubt , would have been , in this respect , in a more favorable point of view for contemplating the European drama . The ocean , stretched between us and the Old World , has the effect of time , and extinguishes , or , at least , cools , the hot and angry feelings , which find their way into every man s bosom within the atmosphere of the contest . Scott was a Briton , with all the peculiarities of one , - at least , of a North Briton ; and the future historian , who gathers materials from his labors , will throw these national predilections into the scale in determining the probable accuracy of his statements . These are not greater , however , than might occur to any man , and allowance will always be made for them , on the ground of a general presumption ; so that a greater degree of impartiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , would scarcely have served the cause of truth better with posterity . An individual , who felt his reputation compromised , may have made fight , indeed , on this or that charge of inaccuracy . But no such charge has come from any of the leading journals in the country , which , however , would // not have been slow to expose it , and which would not , considering the great popularity , and , consequently , influence of the work , have omitted , as they did , to notice it at all , had it afforded any obvious ground of exception on this score . Where , then , is the romance , which our author accuses Sir Walter of blending with history He did , indeed , possess the power of giving a sort of dramatic interest to every thing he handled , whether true or fictitious , by his faithful portraiture of character , and his lively delineations of events . We shall look in vain , among The multitudinous records of the French Revolution , for a more exact , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions and complicated causes . 7lvThat a contrast does it present to that harlequin compound , which passes under the name of History , by Carlyle ; in which the author flounders on , amid a sort of " crude consistence , " half prose , half poetry , like Milton 's Devil , xvorking his way through Chaos , " A boggy Syrtis , neither sea Nor good dry land . " Scott had too masculine a spirit to condescend to such affectations ; and too sound a taste , to attempt to produce effect by overcoloring what Nature may be said to have colored too highly before . He knew that a simple statement of the extraordinary events of the time , was all that was demanded for effect . Scott was , in truth , master of the picturesque . Tie understood , better than any historian since the time of Livy , how to dispose his lights and shades so as to produce the most striking result . This property of romance he had a right to borrow . This talent is particularly observable in the animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . No man ever painted those terrible scenes with greater effect . He had a natural relish for gunpowder ; and his mettle roused , like that of the war-horse , at the sound of the trumpet . His acquaintance with military science enabled him to employ a technical phraseology , just technical enough to give a knowing air to his descriptions , without embarrassing the reader by a pedantic display of unintelligible jargon . This is a talent rare in a civilian . Nothing can he finer than many of his battle-pieces in his " Life of Bonaparte , " unless , indeed , we except one or two in his " History of Scotland " ; as // the fight of Bannockhurn , for example , in which Burns 's " Scots , wha hae " seems to hreathe in every line . It is when treading on Scottish ground , that he seems to feel all his strength . " I seem always to step more firmly , " be said to some one , " when on my own native heather . " His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sympathetic glow for the age of chivalry . Accordingly his delineations of this period , whether in history or romance , are unrivalled ; as superior in effect to those of most compilers , as the richly-stained glass of the feudal ages is superior in beauty and brilliancy of tints to a modern mutation . If this he borrowing something from romance , it is , we repeat , no more than what is lawful for the historian , and explains the meaning of our assertion , that he has improved history by the embellishments of fiction . Yet , after all , how wide the difference between the province of history and of romance , under Scott 's own hands , may be shown hy comparing his account of Mary 's reign in las " History of Scotland , " with the same period in the novel of " TI Abbot . " The historian must keep the / heaten track of events . The novelist launches into the illimitable regions of fiction , provided only that his historic portraits he true to their originals . By due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , and may , in point of fact , contain as much real truth , - truth of character , though not of situation . " The difference between the historian and rue , " says Fielding , " is , that with him every thing is false but the names and dates ; while with me nothing is false but these . " There is at least as much truth in this as in most witticisms . It is the great glory of Scott , that , hy nice attention to costume and character in his novels , he has raised them to historic importance , without impairing their interest as works of art . Who now would imagine , that he could form any thing like a satisfactory notion of the golden days of Queen Bess , that had not read " Kenilworth " ? or of Richard Cmur-de-Lion and his brave paladins , that had not read Ivanhoe " ? Why , then , it has been said , not at once incorporate into regular history all these traits , which give such historical value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , which history requires , would he violated . This can not be . The fact is , History and Romance are too near // akin , ever to be lawfully united . By mingling them together , a confusion is produced , like the mingling of day and night , mystifying and distorting every feature of the landscape . It is enough for the novelist , if he be true to the spirit ; the historian must be true , also , to the letter . He can not coin pertinent remarks and anecdotes to illustrate the characters of his drama . He can not even provide them with suitable costumes . He must take just what Father Time has given him , just what he finds in the records of the age , setting down neither more nor less . Now , the dull chroniclers of the old time rarely thought of putting down the smart sayings of the great people they biographize ; still less of entering into minute circumstances of personal interest . These were too familiar to contemporaries to require it ; and , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , allimportant in their generation , but not worth a rush in the present . What would the historian not give , could he borrow those fine touches of nature , with which the novelist illustrates the characters of his actors , - natural touches , indeed , but in truth just as artificial as any other part , - all coined in the imagination of the writer . There is the same difference between his trade and that of the novelist , that there is between the historical and the portrait painter . The former necessarily takes some great subject , with great personages , all strutting ahout in gorgeous state attire , and air of solemn tragedy ; while his brother artist insinuates himself into the family groups , and picks out natural , familiar scenes and faces , laughing or weeping , but in the charming undress of nature . What wonder that novel-reading should be so much more amusing than history ? But we have already trespassed too freely on the patience of our readers , who will think the rambling spirit of our author contagious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste of his quality , by one or two extracts , not very germane to English literature , but about as much so as a great part of the work . The first is a poetical sally on Bonaparte 's burial-place , quite in Monsieur Chateaubriand 's peculiar vein . " The solitude of Napoleon , in his exile and his tomh , has thrown another kind of spell over a brilliant memory . Alexander did not die in sight of Greece ; he disappeared amid the pomp of distant Babylon . Bonaparte did not close his eyes in the presence of France ; he passed away in the gorgeous hon // zon of the torrid zone . The man , who had shown himself in such powerful reality , vanished like a dream ; his life , which belonged to history , cooperated in the poetry of his death . He now sleeps for ever , like a hermit or a paria , beneath a willow , in a narrow valley , surrounded by steep rocks , at the extremity of a lonely path . The depth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to the vastness of that tumult which had surrounded him . Nations are absent their throng has retired . rihe bird of the tropics , harnessed to the car of the sun , as Buffon magnificently expresses it , speeding his flight downwards from the planet of light , rests alone , for a moment , over the ashes , the weight of which has shaken the equilibrium of the globe . " Bonaparte crossed the ocean , to repair to his final exile , regardless of that beautiful sky which delighted Columbus , Vasco de Gama , and Camo*ns . Stretched upon the ship 's stern , he perceived not that unknown constellations were sparkling over his head . His powerful glance , for the first time , encountered their rays . What to him were stars which he bad never seen from his bivouacs , and which had never shone over his empire ? Nevertheless , not one of them has failed to fulfil its destiny ; one half of the firmament spread its light over his cradle ; the other half was reserved to illuminate his tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next extract relates to the British statesman , William Pitt . " Pitt , tall and slender , had an air at once melancholy and sarcastic . His delivery was cold , his intonation monotonous , his action scarcely perceptible ; at the same time the lucidness and the fluency of his thoughts , the logic of his arguments , suddenly irradiated with flashes of eloquence , rendered his talent something above the ordinary line . " I frequently saw Pitt walking across St. James 's Park , from his own house to the palace . On his part , George the Third arrived from Windsor , after drinking beer out of a pewter pot with the farmers of the neighbourhood ; he drove through the mean courts of his mean habitation in a grey chariot , followed by a few of the horse-guards . This was the master of the kings of Europe , as five or six merchants of the city are the masters of India . Pitt , dressed in black , with a steel-hilted sword by his side , and his hat under his arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his passage he only met with three or four emigrants who had nothing to do ; casting on us a disdainful look , he turned up his nose and his pale face , and passed on . // " At home , this great financier kept no sort of order he had no regular hours for his meals , or for sleep . Over head and ears in debt , he paid nobody , and never could take the trouble to cast up a bill . A valet-de-chambre managed his house . Ill dressed , without pleasure , without passion , greedy of power , he despised honors , and would not be any thing more than William Pitt . In the month of June , 1822 , Lord Liverpool took me to dine at his country-house . As we crossed Putney-Heath , he showed me the small house , where the son of Lord Chatham , the statesman who had had Europe in his pay , and distributed with his own hand all the treasures of the world , died in poverty .

Separated from the continent by a long war , the English retained their manners arid their national character till the end of the last century . All was not yet machine in the working classes , - folly in the upper classes . On the same pavements , where you now meet squalid figures , and men in frock coats , you were passed by young girls with white tippets , straw hats tied under the chin with a riband , with a basket on the arm , in which was fruit or a book ; all kept their eyes cast down , all blushed when one looked at them . Frock coats , without any other , were so unusual in London , in 1793 , that a woman , deploring with tears the death of Louis the Sixteenth , said to me , But , my dear Sir , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frock coat when they cut off his head ? " The gentlemen-farmers had not yet sold their patrimony to take up their residence in London ; they still formed , in the House of Commons , that independent fraction , which , transferring their support from the opposition to the ministerial side , upheld the ideas of order and propriety . They hunted the fox and shot pheasants in autumn , ate fat goose at Michaelmas , greeted the sirloin with shouts of Roast beef for ever complained of the present , extolled the past , cursed Pitt and the war , which doubled the price of port wine , and went to bed drunk , to begin the same life again on the following day . They felt quite sure , that the glory of Great Britain would riot perish , so long as God save the king ' was sung , the rotten boroughs maintained , the game-laws enforced , and hares and partridges could be sold by stealth , at market , under the names of lions and ostriches.

The dandy of the present day must have a conquering , frivolous , insolent look . He must pay particular attention to his toilet , *vear mustaches , or a beard trimmed into a circle , like Queen Elizabeth 's ruff , or like the radiant disk of the sun . He shows the proud independence of his character by keeping his hat upon his head , by lolling upon sofas , by thrusting his boots into the faces of the ladies , seated in admiration upon chairs before him . He rides with a cane , which *e carries like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestrides , as it were , by accident . His health must be perfect , and he must always have five or six felicities upon his hands .

Chateaubriand , who thinks , truly enough , that Milton 's " political ideas make him a man of our own epoch . " When an exile in England , in his early life , during the troubles of the RevoluP01 , our author picked up a subsistence by translating some of Milton 's verses ; and he now proposes to render the bard and himself the same kind office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus , he concludes ; " I again seat myself at the table of my poet . He will have nourished me in my youth , and my old age . It is nobler and safer to have recourse to glory than to power . " Our author 's situation us an indifferent commentary on the value of literary fame , - at least , on its pecuniary value . No man has had more of it in his day . No man has been more alert to make the most of it , by frequent , reiterated appearance before the public , - whether in full dress or dishabille , - yet always before them and now , in the decline of life , we find him obtaining a // scanty support by " French translation and Italian song . " We heartily hope , that the bard of " Paradise Lost " will do better for his translator than he did for himself , and that NI . de Chateaubriand will put more than five pounds in his pocket by his literary labor.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
