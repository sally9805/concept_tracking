txt AN original , sprightly , readable book ! A little volume full of curious observation on manners , shrewd remark , sound good feeling , fine touches of description , and strong sensible writing . A sly vein of humor runs through it , which , in these dull , illtempered , quarrelsome times , makes one 's heart glad . There is an occasional dash of coarseness ,  --  an approach of the waggish to the wicked , - which had better been away , particularly as the author is an " old Man . " An old man , quotha ! We would not hear his enemy say so . We trust there is many a cheerful , vigorous , and active year still destined to cast up its bright and cheerful bubbles , in his cup of life , before that part of the jest shall turn into sad reality . We are not disposed , however , to violate the confidence , which lies hidden , in the harmless little mystery of our Author 's nom de guerre ,  --  a secret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers , on both sides of the Atlantic ; and so , " old " he shall be , or any thing else he wishes , in reward for the cheerful and significant little volume , which has done more than any other we have laid hold of for some weeks , to make us young again . It would not be easy to pick out a chapter in it , that does not contain more sense , taste , and amusing matter , than can be found in one half the volumes , which the American press is daily borrowing from the English ; arid for this reason it is , we suppose , that it has not been reprinted . The book contains the remarks and sketches of the Author , on a tour to the celebrated Mineral Waters in the duchy of Nassau , a place of vast resort for German invalids , fasbionables , and grandees ; but as yet barely found out by English tourists . No people in the world , perhaps , deem a summer 's excursion to a watering-place so absolutely essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fashionably , and politically considered , - as the Germans . It is said there are two hundred bathing-places , within the limits of the region covered by the broad name of Germany ; from Carlsbad , where none but emperors , and princes , and favorites resort , - the bath of none but kings , - down to the poor little fountain of brackish // water , which in every petty principality oozes out of the limestone , and furnishes a pretence of stealing for a week or two , from the scene of their accustomed labors and cares , to the sickly student , the wasted village preacher , the broken-hearted country lassie , drooping under the res angusta , that sends her faithful swain to seek his fortune afar . The matrimonial matches , that engraft the great families of Europe on the safe stock of German neutrality , and raise the astonished heirs and heiresses of four miles square to imperial thrones , are settled at the baths . The first projects of holy alliances and counter-revolutions are formed at the lirunnen ; and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhilarated . Our author has taken us to some of the most celebrated of those watering-places ; but by something of a caprice has almost shut out the throng of men , and women , princes , merchants , beaux esprits , and fashionables that resort to them . Though he speaks in passing terms of the crowd and the resort , and describes some of the groups , you feel almost alone with him ; as if he and you had gone there , just before the season began , or two weeks after it is over . This effect is produced by the originality of his observations , - the strong turn of his mind as a thinker , and a describer of natural scenes , - and the evident polite disdain which he feels for the sort of anecdote , - the wretched gossip , - which usually fills the pages of the modern tourist . - Still , however , there is an occasional paragraph , which sets the mingled throng of living and travelling and bath-hunting men and women , in the boldest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the steam-boat to Rotterdam , and start with our author at once , on his passage in a steamboat up the Rhine . After describing the adroitness , with which the stoppages of the boat were managed , for the purpose of receiving and landing passengers , he thus describes the appearance , on board , of a new married couple from London ; - Just started on a matrimonial tour : " As hard as they could drive , they had posted to Dover , hurried across to Calais , - thence to Brussels , - snapped a glance at the ripe corn waving on the fields of Waterloo , - stared at the relics of that great Saint , old Charlemagne , on the high altar of Aix-la-Chapelle , and at last sought for rest and connubial refuge at Cbln ; * but the celebrated water of that town , having , in its // manufacture , extracted all perfume from the atmosphere , they could not endure the dirt and smell of the place , and therefore had proceeded by land toward Coblenz ; but as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our steam-boat in view , they ordered a party of peasants to draw their carriage to the banks of the river , and as soon as our vessel came smoking alongside , they , their rosy fresh-colored French maid , their dark , chocolatecolored chariot , and their brown , ill-looking Italian courier , were all on board . " As soon as this young London couple lightly stepped on deck , I saw at one glance , that , without at all priding themselves on their abilities , they fancied , and indeed justly fancied , that they belonged to that class of society , which in England so modestly calls itself ,  --  good . That it was not healthy society , - that its victims were exposed to late hours , crowded rooms , and impure air , was evideut euough from the contrast which existed between their complexions , and that of their healthy country attendant : however , they seemed to be not only perfectly satisfied with themselves arid the clique which they had left behind them , but to have a distaste for every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had slightly bo*ved to them , they looked with a haughty vacant stare , as if they conceived there must be some mistake ; and as if , at all events , it would be necessary to keep such people off . Yet , after all , there was no great harm in these two young people . That in the countries , they were about to visit , they would be fitted only for each other , was sadly evident ; however , on the other hand it was also evidently not their wish to extend their acquaintance . Their heads were lanthorns , illuminated with no more brains than barely sufficient to light them on their way ; so , like the babes in the wood , they sat together , hand-in-hand , regardless of every thing in creation , but themselves . " For running their carriage down to the shore , the brown confidential courier , whose maxim was , of course , to pay little and charge much , offered the gang of peasants some kreuzers , which amounted , in English currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain of the party , while arguing with the flint-skinning courier , was actually carried ofl by our steam-boat , which , like time and tide , waited for no man . The poor fellow , finding that the Italian was immovable , came aft to the elegant English couple , who were still leaning toward each other like the Siamese boys . He pleaded his case , stated his services , declared his poverty , and , in a manly voice , prayed for redress . The dandy listened ,  --  looked at his boots , which were evidently pinching him , - listened , - passed four white fingers through the curls of his jet black hair , - showed the point of * pink tongue gently // playing with a front tooth , - and when the whole story was at an end , without moving a muscle in his countenance , in a sickly tone of voice , he pronounced his verdict as follows Alley ! " The creditor tried again , but the debtor sat as silent and inanimate as a corpse . However , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , he protested in a few angry exclamations , against the injustice with which he had been treated , ( a sentiment I was very sorry to hear more than once mildly whispered , by many a quiet looking German , ) and descending the vessel 's side into a small boat , which had just brought us a new captive , he landed at a village , from which he had about eight miles to walk , to join his comrades . " It is with no satirical feeling , that I have related this little occurrence . To hurt the feelings of " gay beings born to flutter but a day , " - to break such a pair of young flimsy butterflies upon the wheel , affords me neither amusement nor delight ; but the every day occurrence of English travellers committing our well-earned national character for justice and liberality , to the base slave-driving hand of a courier , is a practice which , as well as the bad taste of acting the part of a London dandy , on the great theatre of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving the beautiful Moselle on his right , quits the steam-boat at Coblenz , and crossing to the opposite side of the river , takes up his quarters in a large hotel , standing immediately beneath the rock , whose precipitous summit is crowned by the celebrated towers of Ehrenbreitstein . From Coblenz he proceeds to Mainz , enters the duchy of Nassau , and passes through Ems , the first of the famous watering places in the principality . Here , however , he makes no stay , but pursues his course , ascending to the elevated table land of Nassau , till he arrives at Langenschwalbach , ( long Swallow 's stream ) , whose sulphur and chalybeate springs are among the finest in Germany . The former were known in the time of the Romans , the latter are a comparatively recent discovery . Having taken due counsel , as to the times of visiting the springs and the quantity of water to be drank from them , our author gives us , in a chapter *hcaded reveiiU , the result of his first experiment . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement of our readers , some of the entertaining chapters of his book , we may as well make an extract of this - " At a quarter past five , I rose , and as soon after as possible , left the hof . ' Every house was open , the streets already swept , the inhabitants all up , the living world appeared broad awake , and there wa* nothing to denote the earliness of the hour , but the // delicious freshness of the cool mountain air ; which as yet , unenfeebled by the sun , just beaming above the hill , was in that pure state , in which it had all night long been slumbering in the valley . The face of nature seemed beaming with health , and though there were no larks at Schwalbach , gently to carol at the morn , ' yet immense red German slugs were everywhere in my path , looking wetter , colder , fatter , and heavier , than they or I have words to express . They had evidently been gorging themselves during the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . " As soon as , getting from beneath the shaded walk of the All*e Saal , I reached the green valley leading to the Pauline brunnen , it was quite delightful to look at the grass , as it sparkled in the sun , - every green blade being laden with dew , in such heavy particles , that there seemed to be quite as much water as grass . Indeed the crop was actually bending under the weight of nourishment , which ) during the deep silence of night , nature had liberally imparted to it ; and it was evident , that the sun would have to rise high in the heavens , before it could attain strength enough , to rob the turf of this fertilizing and delicious treasure . " At this early hour , I found but few people on the walks , and , . on reaching the brunnen , the first agreeable thing I received there , was a smile from a very honest , homely , healthy old woman , who having seen me approaching , had selected from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked by a piece of tape . " Guten Morgen ! ' she muttered , without at all deranging the hospitality of her smile , and then , stooping down , she dashed the vessel into the brunnen , beneath her feet , and in a sort of civil hurry , ( lest any of its spirit should escape , ) she presented me with a glass of her eau m6dicinale . Clear as crystal ) sparkling with carbonic acid gas , and effervescing quite as much as champagne , it was nevertheless miserably cold ; and the first morning , what with the gas , and what with the low temperature of this cold iron water , it was about as much I could do to swallow it ; and , for a few seconds , feeling as if it had sluiced my stomach completely by surprise , I stood hardly knowing what was about to happen ; when , instead of my teeth chattering as I expected , I felt the water suddenly grow warm within my waistcoat , and a slight intoxication , or rather exhilaration , succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walking backwards and forwards , as on a formal parade , as soon as I had drank my first glass , I at once commenced ascending the hill , which rises immediately from the brunnen . Paths in zig-zags are cut in various directions through the woods , but so steep , that very few of the water-drinkers like to encounter them . I found the trees to be oak and beach , the ground beneath being covered // with grass and heather , among which were growing wild , quantities of ripe strawberries and raspberries . The large red snails were in great abundance , and immense black beetles were also in the paths , heaving at and pushing upwards loads very much bigger than themselves . The grass and heather were soaked with dew , and even the strawberries looked much too wet to be eaten . However , I may observe that while drinking mineral waters , all fruit , wet or dry , is forbidden . Smothered up in the wood , there was of course nothing to be seen ; but as soon as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty hexagonal rustic hut , built of trees with the bark on , and thatched with heather , presented itself . The sides were open except two , which were built up with sticks and moss . A rough round table was in the middle , upon which two or three young people had cut their names , and round the inner circumference of the hut was a bench , on which I was glad enough to rest , while I enjoyed the extensive prospect . " The features of this picture , so ( lifferent from anything to be seen in England , are exceedingly large , and the round rolling clouds seemed bigger even than the distant mountains , upon which they rested . Not a fence was to be seen , but dark patches of wood , of various shapes and sizes , were apparently dropped down , upon the cultivated surface of the country , which , as far as the eye could reach , looked like the fairy park of some huge giant . In the fore-ground , however , small fields and little narrow strips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poor proprietors ; and even if Langenschwalbach had not been seen , crouchiiig at the bottom of its deep valley , it would have been quite evident , that in the immediate neighborhood , there must be , somewhere or other , a town ; for in many places the divisions of land were so small , that one could plainly distinguish provender growing , for the poor man 's cow , - the little patch of rye , which was to become bread for his children , - and the half acre of potatoes , that was to help them through the winter . Close to the town , these divisions and sub-divisions were exceedingly small ; but when every little family had been provided for , the fields grew larger ; and at a short distance from where I sat , there were crops ripe and waving , which were evidently intended for a larger and more distant market . " As soon as 1 had sufficiently enjoyed the freshness and the freedom of this interesting landscape , it was curious to look down from the hut upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brunnen , or well of Pauline ; for , by this time , all ranks of people had arisen from their beds , and the sun being now warm , the beau monde of Langenschwalbach was seen slowly loitering up and down the promenade . " At the rate of about a mile and a half an hour , I observed VOL . XL. - NO.87. 46 // several hundred quiet people , crawling through and fretting away that portion of their existence , which lay between one glass of cold iron-water and another . If an individual were to be sentenced to such a life , which in fact has all the fatigue without the pleasing sociability of the tread-mill , he would call it melancholy beyond endurance ; yet there is no pill which fashion can not gild , or which habit can not sweeten . I remarked that the men were dressed generally in loose , ill-made , snuff-colored great coats , with awkward travelling caps of various shapes , instead of hats . The picture , therefore , taking it altogether , was a homely one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking people , although their gait was by no means attractive , yet , even from the lofty distant hut , I felt that it was impossible to help admiring the good sense and good feeling , with which all the elements of this German community appeared to be harmonizing with each other . There was no jostling or crowding ; no apparent competition ; no turning rQund to stare at strangers . There was no martial look nor lordly stride , ' but real genuine good breeding seemed natural to all . It is true there was nothing which bore a very high aristocratic polish ; yet it was equally evident , that the substance of their society was good enough not to require it . " The behaviour of such a motley assemblage of people , who belonged of course to all ranks and conditions of life , in my humble opinion did them and their country very great credit . It was quite evident that every man on the promenade , whatever may have been his birth , was desirous of behaving like a gentleman ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , who wished to do any more . " That young lady , rather more quietly dressed than*the rest of ' her sex , is the Princess Leuenstein . Her countenance , ( could it but be seen from the hut , ) is as unassuming as her dress , and her manner as quiet as her bonnet . Her husband , who is one of the group of gentlemen behind her , is mild , gentleman-like , and , ( if in these days such a title may without offence be given to a young man , ) I would add , - he is modest . There are one or two other princes on the promenade , with a very fair sprinkling of dukes , * counts , and barons . There they go , altogether in a row , ' but though they congregate , - though like birds of a feather they flock together , - is there , I ask , any thing arrogant in their behavior ? And the respect , which they meet with from every one , Our author 's English notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title than prince . The former is confined to some reigning princes in the German confederacy . The latter is a mere title of nobility . // does it not seem to be honestly their due ? That uncommonly awkward short little couple , who walk , holding each other by the hand , and who dpropos to nothing , occasionally break playfully into a trot , are a Jew and Jewess lately married ; and , as it is whispered , that they have some mysterious reason for drinking the waters , the uxorious anxiety , with which the little man presents the glass of cold comfort to his partner , does not pass conipletely unobserved . That slow gentleman , with such an immense body , who seems to be acquainted with the most select people on the walk , is an ambassador , who goes no where , - not even to mineral waters , - without his French cook , a circumstance quite enough to make every body speak well of him . A very honest , good-natured man he seems to be ; hut as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own cook is killing him ; and what possible benefit can a few glasses of cold water do to a corporation , which Falstaff 's belt would be too short to encircle ? " Often and often have I pitied Diogenes for having lived in a tub ; but this poor ambassador is infinitely worse off , for the tub , it is too evident , lives in him , and carry it about with him he must , wherever he goes. ** The grenter part of the residue of this chapter is taken up in a discussion of the comparative modes , in which horses are harnessed for draught , in England , France , and Germany . In England the animal 's bead is drawn back or up by the check rein ; in Germany it is drawn down to the lower edge of the collar ; in France it is drawn neither up nor down , but is left to take its natural position . Our author gives the preference to the French practice , as affording the freest scope to the natural action of the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as confining the head indeed , but confining it , in that position , xvbich the animal , in applying his strength for the purposes of draught , naturally assumes . The English method of reining up he decidedly condemns , as putting it wholly out of the power of the animal , to accomplish his task by weight and impulse , and compelling him to perform it , by the strain of muscle and sinew . The next chapter describes the external use of the waters of Langenschwalbach , which we must give as a pendant to the foregoing picture : " As soon as the patient was ready to enter his bath , the first feeling , which crossed his mind , as he stood shivering on the hrink , was a disinclination to dip even the foot into a mixture , which looked about as thick as a horse-pond , and about the color // of Mullagitawney soup . However , having come as far as Langenschwalbach , there was nothing to say , but en avant ; and so , descending the steps , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iron , that the body , when a couple of inches below the surface , was invisible . The temperature of the water was neither hot nor cold ; but I was no sooner immersed in it , than I felt it was of a strengthening , bracing nature ; and I could almost have fancied myself lying with a set of hides in a tan-pit . The half hour , which every day I was sentenced to spend in this decoction , was by far the longest in the twenty-four hours ; and I was always very glad , when my chronometer , which I hung on a nail before my eyes , pointed permission to extricate myself from the mess . While the body was floating , hardly knowing whether to sink or swim , I found it was very difficult for the mind to enjoy any sort of recreation , or to reflect for two minutes on any one subject ; and as half shivering I lay , watching the minute-hand of the dial , it appeared the slowest traveller in existence . " These baths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other slightly apoplectic symptoms ; but surely such effects proceed from the silly habit of not immersing the head . The frame of man has beneficently been made capable of existing under the line or near either of the poles of the earth . We know it can even live in an oven , in which meat is baking ; but surely if it were possible to send one half of the body to Iceland , while the other was reclining on the banks of Fernando Po , the trial would be exceedingly severe , inasmuch as nature , never having contemplated such a vagary , has not thought it necessary to provide against it . In a less degree , the same argument applies to bathing , particularly in mineral waters ; for even the common pressure of water on the portion of the body , which is immersed in it , tends mechanically to push or force the blood toward that part of it , ( the head , ) enjoying a rarer mediu*i . But when it is taken into calculation , that the mineral mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by pressure , but medicinally , being a very strong astringent , there needs no wizard to account for the unpleasant sensation so often complained of . " For the above reason , I resolved that my head should share alike with the rest of my system ; in short that it deserved to he strengthened as much as my limbs . The way in which I bathed , with the reasons which induced me to do so , were mentioned to Dr. Feuner . He made no objection , but in silence shrugged up his shoulders . However , the fact is , in this instance , as well as in many others , he is obliged to prescribe no more than human nature will comply with . And as Germans are not much in the habit of washing their heads , - and even if they were , as // they would certainly refuse to dip their skulls into a mixture , which stains the hair a deep red color , upon which common soap has not the slightest detergent effect , - the doctor probably feels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly to undergo the defeat of being driven from a system , which all men would agree to abominate . Although , of course , in coming out of the bath , the patient rubs himself dry and apparently clean , yet the rust , by exercise , comes out so profusely , that not only is the linen of those who bathe stained , but even their sheets are similarly discolored ; the dandy 's neckcloth becomes red ; and when the head has been immersed , the pillow , in the morning , looks as if a rusty thirteen-inch shell had been reposing on it . " The succeeding chapters contain a description of a dinner at the ordinary , ( in which , while the civility of the company is highly commended , the taste of the German cuisine is roughly handled ) , the promenade after dinner , the Schwein general , or swine-herd , a grotesque sketch of the manner , in which the swine of the village are driven out every morning to their woodland pasture , and home in the evening ; the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-house ; a deserted protestant church , a fine touching picture of a place of village worship , sinking under the weight of years ; the Jewish synagogue ; the harvest , and the practice of employing cows , in the small carts of the peasants , instead of other animals of draught ; sunset , - a charming landscape , ending with the singular adventure of a young lady , who ( whether in vision or reality appeareth not ) alarmed at the belief , that there are rats in her bed* disturbs the quiet of midnight , with her outcries ; a knight of Malta , a description of that island , a glance at its importance , and at the history of its acquisition , with an admirably told story of a wretched Turkish renegade , executed for a inurder committed on a Maltese . - These chapters , miscellaneous and diversified as they are , in their contents , are all written with great spirit , and contain a world of entertaining and original remark ; but we must hasten with our author to the neighboring waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this name will appear from the following passage - " After following my attendant , through a labyrinth of passages , ( one of which not only leaned sideways , but had an ascent like a hill , ) she at last unlocked a door , which was no sooner opened , than I saw glide along the floor , close by me , a couple of small serpents ! As the lady was talking very earnestly at the time , I // merely flinched aside , as they passed , without making any observatiori ; hut after I had crossed a small garden , she pointed to a door , which she said was that of the source , and while she stopped to speak to one of the servants , I advanced alone and opening the gate , saw beneath me a sort of brunnen , with three serpents , about the size of vipers , swimming about in it ! Unable to contain my surprise , I made a signal to the lady , with my stafl and as she hurried towards me , I still pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Esculapius , they were allowed thus to contaminate the source of the baths ? " In the calmest manner possible , my conductress , ( who seemed perfectly to comprehend my sensations , ) replied au contraire c'est ce qui donne la qualit6 d ces eaur . " The quantity of these reptiles , or Schlangen , that exist in the woods surrounding the spring , is very great ; and they , of course , have given their name to the place . When full grown , they are about five feet long , and in hot weather are constantly seen gliding across the paths , or rustling under the dead leaves of the forest . " The following description of the quality of the Schlangenhad waters will go far , we think , to overcome the repugnance , which the foregoing account of the origin of their name , may have awakened in one class of our readers . We have heard their efficacy commended in language equally strong , by many persons , who have made trial of it . " The baths at Schlangenbad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever enjoyed ; and I really quite looked forward to the morning , for the pleasure , with which I paid my addresses to this delightful element . The effect it produces on the skin is very singular . It is about as warm as milk , hut infinitely softer ; and after dipping the hand into it , if the thumb be rubbed against the fingers , it is said by many to resemble satin . Nevertheless , whatever may be its sensation , when the reader reflects , that people not only come to these baths from Russia , but that the water in stone bottles , merely as a cosmetic , is sent to St. Petersburg and other distant parts of Europe , he will admit , that it must be soft indeed , to have gained for itself such an extraordinary degree of celebrity : for there is no town at Schlangenbad , not even a village . Nothing therefore hut the real or fancied charm of the water could attract people into a little sequestered valley , which in every sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet I must say , I never remember to have existed in a place , which possessed such fascinating beauties . Besides which , ( to say nothing of breathing pure dry air ) , it is no small pleasure to live in a skin , which puts all people in good humor , at least with themselves . But besides the // cosmetic charms of this water , it is declared to possess virtues of a more substantial character . It is said to tranquillize the nerves , to soothe all inflammation ; and from this latter property , the cures of consumption which are reported to have been effected , among human beings and cattle , may have proceeded . Yet , whatever good effect the water may have upon this insidious disorder , its first operation most certainly must be , to neutralize the bad effect of the climate , which , to consumptive patients , must be a decidedly severe trial ; for delightful as it is to people in robust health , yet the keenness of the mountain air , together with the sudden alternations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed , must , I think , be any thing but a remedy for weak lungs . " The effect produced upon the skin , by lying about twenty mmutes in the bath , I one day happened to overhear a short fat Frenchman describe to his friend , in the following words ; - Monsieur , dans ces bains , on devient absolument amoureux de soim6me . ' I can not exactly corroborate this gallic statement , yet I must admit , that limbs , even old ones , gradually do appear as if they were converted into white marble . The skin assumes a sort of glittering phosphoric brightness , resembling very much white objects , which , having been thrown overboard , in calm weather within the tropics , many of my readers have probably watched sinking in the ocean , which seems to blanch and illuminate them , as they descend . The effect is very extraordinary , and I know not how to account for it , unless it be produced by some prismatic refraction , caused by the peculiar particles , with which the fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the reader acquainted with some of the humors of a German watering-place . It seems , that , in the basement story of our author 's abode , was an aged couple . whose business it was to prepare the baths and furnish towels to those who used them . The waters of Schlangenbad , notwithstanding their marvellous powers in smoothing and softening the skin , appear to have had the opposite effect , on the temper of this worthy couple , who seem to have furnished a specimen of xvhat Mr. l3ulwer happily describes as a cat and dog union . The " old woman , " however , as our author unceremoniously calls her , invariably got the better of the argument . This , we believe , is all that is necessary , ( by way of introduction ) , to the understanding of the following extract : - " After I had had my bath , the old wife being out of the way , // I one day paid a visit of compliment to her husband , who had shown , by many little attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve me . With great delight , he showed me several bottles full of serpents ; and then opening a wooden box , he took out , as a fisherman would handle eels , some very long ones , - one of which , ( first looking over his shoulder to see that a certain personage was away , ) he put upon a line , which she had stretched across the room , for drying clothes . In order , I suppose , to demonstrate to me that the reptile was harmless , he took it off the rope , along which it was moving very quickly ; and without submitting his project for my approbation , he suddenly placed it on my breast , along which it crawled , until stretching its long neck , with half its body into the air , it held on in a most singular manner , by a single fold in the cloth , which by a sort of contortion of the vertebra , it firmly grasped . " The old man , to appearance highly satisfied with this first act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all colors and sizes , - stuffed serpents and serpents ' skins , - all of which seemed very proper hobbies , to amuse the long winter evenings of the aged servant of Schlangenbad , or the serpent's. bath . At last , however , the fellow 's dry , blanched , wrinkled face began to smile . Grinning , as he slowly mounted on a chair , he took from a high shelf , a broad-mouthed , white glass bottle , and then , in a sort of savage ecstacy , pronouncing the word Baromet ! ' he placed it in my hand . " The bottle was about half full of dirty water , - a few dead flies and crumbs of bread were at the bottom , - and near the top , there was a small piece of thin wood , which went about half across the phial . Upon this slender scaffolding , its fishy eyes staring upwards at a piece of coarse linen , which , being tied round the mouth of the bottle served as a cork , - the shrivelled skin of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - there sat a large , speckled , living toad ! " Like Sterne 's captive , he had not , by his side , a bundle of sticks , notched with all the dismal days and nights he had passed there . ' Yet their sum total was as clearly expressed in the unhealthy color of the poor creature 's skin ; and certainly in my life-time , I never before had seen what might truly be called - a sick toad . " It was quite impossible to help pitying any living being , confined by itself in so miserable a dungeon . However , the old man 's eyes were beaming with pride and delight , at what he conceived to be his own ingenuity , - and exclaiming Sch5nes wetter , ' ( fine weather ) , he pointed to the wood-work on which the poor creature was sitting ; - and then he exultingly explained , that , as soon as it should be going to rain , the toad would get // down into the water . Barom*t , ' repeated the old fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chair , he replaced his prisoner on the shelf . " Apropos to a peep into the village-school at Sehiangenbad , our author treats us to a pretty long and very ingenious essay on classical education , condemnin0 , in no very measured terms , the system pursued at the public schools of Great Britain , as being altogether ill-adapted to fit the future legislator , naval or military officer , or country gentleman , for the duties of life . He complains , in his own person , that , at the age of fourteen , he left his classical school , scarce knowing the name of a single river in the new world , and tired almost to death with the history of the Ilissus ; whereas , in after life , he entered a river of America , more than five times as broad as from Dover to Calais , and repeatedly walked across the Ilissus in twenty seconds , without xvctting his andes . Our author seems also , in his school-boy days , to have been a good deal worried with the names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection of " Dromas , et Canace , Sticteque , et Tigris , et Alce . " We do not propose to say a word , in this out-of-the-way place , on the utility of classical literature , for the purposes of after-life . That is a theme far too important for an incidental discussion . But the great evil of English education is , ( supposing the facts to he as our author represents them , of which we have not information , sufficiently accurate to enable us to judge , ) that the attention of the learner , at the schools and the universities , is unnecessarily confined to classical studies . There is no necessity , because ancient geography is taught , that modern geography should he neglected . There is time enough to learn all about the Ilissus and all about the river Plate ; and a young man may study Greek and Latin , and French and Italian , and geography and history , into the bargain . This simple truth is overlooked in most of the discussions , which we have seen of the expediency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . It has been hastily assumed , that we are driven to the alternative of dactyles and spondees on the one hand , or history , and statistics , and other branches of what is commonly called useful science on the other . The consequence has been , that when sensihle men have taken hold of the subject , ( erring only in supposing // that such an alternative of necessity exists ) , they have satisfactorily demonstrated either side of the question . There is no difficulty in proving , that classical literature is an indispensable part of a thorough education ; and quite as little in proving the same of the most important modern languages and of the leading branches of natural and exact science . What then is to he done ? - Teach them all ; which , with the multiplication and improvement of aids , can he done in less time and with greater ease , than may he thought . The years usually spent at school are amply sufficient for the purpose ; and nothin0 is wanted but the ability to teach on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . We repeat again , we hy no means undertake to say , that the English schools are what our author describes them , confined to a meagre classical routine . But if they are , they are vastly in arrears of the schools in Germany , and much hehind many in our own country ; in which , while the learned languages are well taugl*t , the other branches of useful knowledge receive their share of attention . But it is time to pass , with our author , from Schlangenbad to Nieder-selters , the springs from which , what is commonly called Selzer-water is drawn , and exported to every part of the civilized globe . It is situated at the distance of ahout eighteen miles from Langenschwalbach , and is described in the following terms . " The features of the country now began to grow larger than ever ; and though crops , green and brown , were , as far as the eye could reach , gently waving round me , yet the want of habitations , plantations , and fences , gave to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps grand , hut it wanted foreground . However , this deficiency was soon most delightfully supplied , by the identical object I was in search og - viz , the brunnen and establishment of Nieder-selters , which suddenly appeared on the road-side , close before me , scarcely a quarter of a mile from its village . " The moment I entered the great gate of the enclosure , which , surrounded by a high stone wall , occupies ahout eight acres of ground , so strange a scene presented itself suddenly to my view , that my first impression was , I had discovered a new world inhabited by brown stone bottles ; for in all directions were they to be seen , rapidly moving from one part of the establishmont to another , - standing actually iii armies on the ground , or piled in immense layers or strata , one above another . Such a profusion and such a confusion of bottles , it had never entered into human imagination to conceive ; and before I could bring my eyes to stoop // to detail , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement . " On approaching a large circular shed , covered with a slated roof ; supported by posts but open on all sides , I found the single brunnen or well , from which this highly celebrated water is forwarded to almost every quarter of the globe ,  --  to India , the West Indies , the Mediterranean , Paris , London , and to almost every city in Germany . The hole , which was about five feet square , was bounded by a frame-work of four strong beams mortised together ; and the bottom of the shed being boarded , it very much resembled , both in shape and dimensions , one of the hatches in the deck of a ship . A small crane with three arms , to each of which there was suspended a square iron crate or basket , a little smaller than the brunnen , stood about ten feet off ; and while peasant girls , with a stone bottle ( holding three pints ) dangling on every finger of each hand , were rapidly filling two of these crates , which contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winch , until it hung immediately over the brunnen , into which it then rapidly descended . The air in these seventy bottles being immediately displaced by the water , a great bubbling of course ensued ; but , in about twenty seconds , this having subsided , the crate was raised ; and while seventy more bottles descended from another arm of the crane , a fresh set of girls curiously carried off these full bottles , one on each finger of each hand , ranging them in several long rows upon a large table or dresser , - also beneath the shed . No sooner were they there , than two men , with surprising activity , put a cork into each ; while two drummers , with a bug stick , in each of their hands , hammering them down , appeared as if they were playing upon musical glasses . " Another set of young women now instantly carried them off , four and five in each hand , to men , who , with sharp knives , sliced off the projecting part of the cork ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were delivered over to women , each of whom actually covered three thousand of them in a day with white leather , which they firmly bound with packthread round the corks ; and then , without placing the bottles on the ground , they delivered them over to a man seated beside them , who , without any apology , dipped each of their noses into boiling hot rosin ; and before they had recovered from this operation , the Duke of Nassau 's seal was stamped upon them , by another man ; when off they were hurried fifteen and twenty at a time , by girls , to magazines where they peacefully remained ready for exportation.
