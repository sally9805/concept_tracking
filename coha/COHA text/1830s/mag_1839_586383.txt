txt AMoxo the pl*ilanthropic enterprises of our time , one of the most interesting is that which has for its object the abolition of War , and the adoption of the Peace princi** by natic*ns and individuals , in the settlement of all differences and disputes of a public and a private nature . The manner in which the cause of Peace has been advocated by the societies expressly formed for its promotion , has led to the discussion of topics of the highest importance to the intercourse of nations , and the existence of every government . The question has been raised whether war , defensive or offensive , be justifiable in any case ; *vliether the taking of human life , and the resort to physical force by nations or individuals in self-defence , and for the redress of injuries , be not absolutely immoral and opposed to the principles of Christianity ; and whether a Christian can consistently own allegiance to any government that claims the use of coercive measures for the execution of its laws. - It is with the view to a satisfactory settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation of the cause of Peace in our country , that we offer the following considerations . The history of the Peace Societies in this country is remarkable not so much on account of their increase in numbers and means , as because , short as it is , it exhibits the growth of principle , which , whether true or erroneous , is ever the most important part of human history . An anonymous pamphlet , bearing the title of A Solemn Review of the Custom of War , ' published in Boston in the year 1814 , and republished in England , called into existence the different societies which afterward united under the name of the American Peace Society . That pamphlet was the work of a New England country clergymafl , * whose fame had hardly reached beyond the sound of the bell of his village church , until the periodical of which he became the editor endeared the name of the " Friend of Peace , " to all who found in this enterprise a sphere of action suited to their benevolent desires . " The Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and this by the " Advocate of Peace " which is at present the organ of the Peace Societies . Kindred societies have been formed in England , France , and Switzerland . Memorials for the institution of a Congress of nations with a view to a peaceable adjustment of all international disputes , have been brought before one of the State Legislatures* and before Congress , at its last , and again at its present , session . The committee appointed for the con* // consideration of this subject by the Legislature of Massachusetts in 1837 , moved several resolutions , condemning the " resort to War to settle questions of national profit or honor ; " arid recommending " the institution of a Congress or Court of Nations . " The first petition of the New York Peace Society besought Congress , to " adopt the principle of reference to a third Power of such international disputes as can not be. *amicably adjusted by the parties themselves , as an invariable rule instead of an occasional one ; " and further , that , " in pursuance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to those of other nations , that they would unite with it in the establishment of a great international Board of Arbitration , or a Congress of Nations , to which to refer international disputes ; and also for the purpose of digesting and preparing a regular code of international law , obligatory on such nations as may afterwards adopt it . " This memorial was read , and laid upon the table , in consequence of a very able report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , by Mr. Legare , of South Carolina . The Peace movement has encountered less opposition in this country and abroad , than perhaps any other cause of moral reform ; and the inconsiderable degree of interest it has hitherto excited may , in part at least , be traced to the nature of the principle itself , which , when stated in its most general form , meets with universal assent or acquiescence ; but when set forth with nil the consequences derived from it by uncompromising practical reasoners , finds but few minds willing to a ( lopt it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than War ; and that for the redress of wrong the use of moral power is generally preferable to physical force . But that coercion and war ought never to be resorted to , even in defence of life and liberty-this is a corollary to the Peace principle which would require a radical change of sentiment to gain admission to the practical creed of individuals and nations . This internal impediment to the progress of the Peace cause , arising from the nature of the principle on which it rests , is sufficiently evident from the change which the constitution of the society has undergone in the fundamental article which defines its object ; and in the recent attempt at a still more thorough reform which has led to the formation of the " New England Non-Resistance Society . " The object of the American Peace Society as stated in its original constitution was the abolition of offensive war . Nothing was said with regard to the moral character of defensive war , because a difference of opinion was known to exist among the friends of Peace on that subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied that of defensive warfare as a necessary consequence . But this prudential restraint , und calculation of couseq nences , did not satisfy those who had embraced the principle of Peace as a divine precept that required explicit profession and // strict obedience . They also argued , with much effect , that the term defensive war ' is in practice at least a vague title , which in most cases , as recently in the war*s of Napoleon , has been used by each of the contending powers to justify its having recourse to arms . Accordingly , at the ninth anniversary of the society , iii 1837 , the constitution was amended so as to declare , that " all war is contrary to the spirit of the *ospel . " This change was deprecated by those members of the society who approved of defensive war ; and they thought themselves bound in conscience to dissolve their connexion . The official organ of the society endeavoured to persuade them to remain united , although " the revised constitution had recognised for its basis the contrariety of all war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a constitution , " it was said , " can not all the friends of peace consistently unite ? We do not propose this principle as a pledge ; we do not enforce it as a test ; we merely give it as a guarantee , that our influence as a society shall never go to countenance any form of war . " * But this mode of reasoning , while it did not convince the conscientious believers in the justice of defensive war , failed , on the other hand , of satisfying those whose opposition to all war was only the consequence of a more radical principle . They reasoned in this way ; and it is a singular instance of the general tendency of the times to push abstract principles to impracticable and even absurd extremes in their application : If the Government have no right to use and prepare means for defence against foreign aggressors , how can it be justified in proceeding forcibly against internal enemies by threatening and inflicting punishments ? And " if . a nation has no right to defend itself against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual possesses that right in his own cause . " The Gospcl precepts , Do not kill , ' Resist not evil , ' and Render not evil for evil but overcome evil with good , ' absolutely forbid the taking of human life , and discountenance the use of force against enemies in every case , and inculcate an implicit faith in moral means , in reinonstrance and self-sacrificing endurance , as sufficient to protect the just from the unjust , and to convert enemies into friends . These sentiments which had been cherished for some time by some of the most zealous advocates of the cause , though disavowed by the ofhicia-l organ of the society , found a full expression in the Peace Convention , held in Boston , on the 18th , 19th , and 20th of Septem her last . This convention resulted in the formation of the " New England Non-Resistance Society , " which put forth a Declaration of Sentiments , and adopted a constitution distinct from that of the American Peace Society . The second article of the new society states its object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 3 , December 1837 , page 107. // *394 Pcace and War . " ART . II . The membersof this society agree in opinion , that no man , norbody *of men , however constituted , and by whatever name called , have a right to take the life of any man as a penalty for transgression ; that no one who professes to ha*'e . the spirit of Christ , can consistently sue a man at 4aw for redress of injuries , or thrust ony evil-doer into prison , or fill any oftlce in which he would come under obligation to execute penal enactments  --  or take any part in the military service  --  or acknow ' - ledge allegiance to any human government  --  or justify any man in fighting in defence of property , liberty1 life , or religion*that he can not engage in , norcountenance any plot or effort to revolutionine , or chai*e , by physical violence , any government , however corrupt or oppressive ; that he will obey the powers that be , ' except in those cases in which they bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist , he will meekly su'nmit to the penalty *f disobedience ; and that , while he will cheerfully endure all things for Christ 's sake , without cherishing even a desire to soflict injury upon his persecutors , yet he will be bold and uncompromising for Goti , in hearing his testimony against sin , in high places and in low places , until rightenusness and peace shall reign iu 11 the earth , and there shall be none to molest or make afraid . " Soon after the doings of this convention were made public , the constituted organs of the American Peace Society ' published a Disclaimer ; ' in which they declared , that the convention had been called by individuals acting on their own personal responsibility ; that the society did not hold themselves accountable for any of the doings of , or sentiments expressed by , the convention ; that the sole object of the society , as unalterably laid down in its con stitution , was the Peace of Nations ; ' and that the New England Non-liesistance Society could not be considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have given this brief sketch of the progress of the Peace cause in our country partly because , as we have already observed , we look upon the history of moral principle , however well or however ill understood , as the most important part of human history ; *snd partly because it is a striking exhibition of the characteristic spirit and tendency of our time . Every institution , every law , every custom , every assertion , is subjected to the ordeal of an all searching and uncompromising skepticism which rejects every authority but that of facts , arid discredit every testimony but that of ien son . Neither the opinion of the world , neither origin , nor age , sior even present and past utility , can insure permanence to any form of faith or practice . The great question is whether a thing be true and right in itself-every thing else is of secondary imporL*nce* It can not be denied that this spirit of free inquiry has not only its true , but its false prophets also , whose course is marked by a superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the sympathy and encouragement which this thoughtless and reckless love of innovation occasionally meets with , may be traced to the solid advantages which the cause of truth and humanity has derived from this uncomoromisinir search after right . Our own political existence as a free people is grounded upon an attempt of it n precedented boldness in rejecting every historical , and fictitious // basis of government , and reducing it to first principks. - everi to the eternal principles of perfect justice . However inconsistent we may be in many points of practice when judged by the perfect law of liberty and equality as laid down in our Declaration of Independ. - ence , who would not prefer to be condemned by this rather thart be justified by a lower standard ? We do not share any of the conservative fears of many of ou*c0ntemporaries , either for our religious or political principles . We see in the skepticism of the ago a striving after a deeper foundation for the highest faith Instca*i of crying it down as ultraism , radicalism , infidelity , or fanaticism , we honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , . and meet with no other weapons than straightforward argument , any attack upon existing opinions and institutions , however just . and beneficial we may think them , if our antagonists do but appeal to our reason , and not to our faith in the infallibility of the new doctrine , or our patience to hear supercilioiss dogmatism . Entertaining these views we are not willing to join in the hue and cry which has been raised in almost every newspaper we have met with , against the principles contained in the Declaration of Sentiments , and the constitution of this New England Non-Resistance Society . Principles which are essentially the same as those enter. - tamed by the Society of Friends , have a right at least to be heard , and not to be condemned without benefit of reason . It is true , they attack that which every human government considers as the indispensable condition of its existence . But it should never be forgotten that the allegiance of republicans to their government rests not so much on the fact of its existence , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the conviction of its being founded in fustice. - There is great danger in our country lest the moral foundation of our institutions be overlooked , partly on account of the unexampled prosperity to which they have given rise , and which now tempts us to forget the cause in the effects ; and partly on account of our political inconsistencies which , so far as they are suffered to exist , degrade our government to the level of those which have no other support than brute force . It is on this account that we welcome this Peace controversy , and every other discussion which must induce our citizens to reflect *l ) Ofl the essential moral elements of our government . The authors of the New England Non-Resistance Society have rendered an important service to the cause of Peace inasmuch as th.ey have attempted to reduce it to tirst principles . The object of these associated efforts is the establishment of Peace . What then is Peace ? According to the practical definition contained in the constitution of the American Peace Society , peace is the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of ivar . And what is War ? It is a state of discord // between nations in which each thinks itself authorized to use agair*t the other any violent measures that may promote the object - :t contends for . Now , if all war be sinful , being contrary to the spirit of the Gospel , what is it that constitutes its sinfulness ? Evidently the resort to violent measures , the taking of human life , the destruction *f property , and the infliction of other innumerable - evils . If then war be sinful in all cases , and the use of violence constitutes the essence and essental immorality of ivar , the same principle must condemn the same means in every other case ; it makes its sinful in the individual to take the life of an enemy , or *se physical force , even in self-defence ; and equally sinful in the government to inflict riot only capital punishments but punishments of any kind , or to resort to coercive measures of any description . Hence the duty of every Christian not only to abstain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( absolute non-resistance , ) but of refusing allegiance to any human government , inasmuch as being COlistitute ( l to enforce its commands it is founded in sin . We do not see how any man adopting the premises laid down by the American Peace Society* viz : that all wcr is contrary to the spirit of the Gospel , can arrive at any other results than those maintained by the New England Non-Resistance Society . We have no fault to find , then , with the logic of the Non-Resistance Society . We will now briefly examine its premises , to see whether there be indeed no case in which war , or in general the use of force against human beings , he consistent with the spirit of the Gospel , and the principles of morality . Both parties in this controversy , the advocates and the opponents of the non-resistance principle , refer to numerous scriptural authorities to sizstain their respective views ; and it must be confessed that the former are indeed able to assemble a sufficiently imposing array of texts , to diminish the surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variance with every theory of human society that has ever been attempted to be applied to practice , could *nd any considerable number of intelligent partisans . For exam* ple , they cite the frequent repetition in the New Testament , of the precept , " Do not kill ; "  --  the sublime prophecy concerning the last days , ' that " people shall beat their swords into plough-shares , and their spears into pruning-hooks* nation shall not lift up sword against nation : neither shall they learn war any more ; " - the various annunciations of peace connected with the advent of the Messiah , the " Prince of Peace ; "  --  the example of non-resistance , even unto death , contained in the closing scenes of his own history *ipon earth ; - his rebuke of the disciple who drew his sword and woiln ( led the servant of the High Priest ; - his answer to Pilate , My kingdom is not of this wori ( l ; if my kingdom were of this // world , then would ray servants fight , that I should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let none render evil for evil , ' hut rather " overcome evil with good ; " and " Resist not evil , but . whosoever shall smite thee on t , he right cheek , turn to hint the other also , " - *vith others of similar import which it would be out of place here to enumerate . There is , we confess , something grand in this idea of abstinencG from the use of force as an e*ment of human society ; , and of a patient and abiding faith in the good principles of human nature alone , as being capable of working out a better and happier result . of social well-being , by the moral influences of Truth and Love , . iban can ever be produced by the action of the element of coercive force on its bad principles . The idea is , we repeat , a sublime one , however flippantly the superficial thinker may pronounce it ridieulous . And indeed the element of force* has been so sadly perverted and abused to the worst of purposes , in all human societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ling has been the moral as well as physical mischief growing out of its abtise , . that it is not surprising that the minds of men by long dwelling on thi single idea , . should carry it beyond the proper limits , within which every truth is regulated by its relations with all other truths , into ' the fanaticism of maintainir.g that air force is to be abjured , as essentially and eternally evil and the parent of evil . It is one of those pro plietic presentiments of a higher and bet tsr state ofbeingof which human tature , even in its present condition , is capable , . from the elements of good which lie at the heart of its constitution . It is even somewhat akin to the demoeratic spirit of the age , being a difference of degree rather than ot kind , in its- confidence in human nature , and in the principle of perfect Liberty , as a better principle than that of strong Law . We have no doubt that a grea.c many of the existing restraints upon the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishments , which are intended to force men to be good and happy , are in truth pernicious in their operation , doing more harm in one way than they do good in another . But still this doctrine of non-resistance , or the utter and total repudiation of force , is an ultraism in the opposite direction , . entirely inconsistent with the actual imperfection of human nature . which would probably be still more mischievous in its practi.cal* operation , supposing the possibility of its ever being seriously applied to practice by any community of men Without going elab9rately into an analysis of the scriptural arguments adduced in its favor , of which the leading passages are above referred to , it will be sufficient -- for the purpose of satisfying thoseminds which would rest the solution of the question on that grounds alone  --  to remark , that an enlightened criticism , , viewing- the mean -- ing of these and similar p*sseges in th2 ligjtt of the general priuci --  // ides both of Christianity and of human nature , and in comparison with other passages of a different import and bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultraism into which this newlight school of non-resistance would push the Peace principle , the spirit of which is in truth transparent throughout every part of toe Christian Scripture . On the contrary the language , and on more than one occasion the personal example , of the Founder of our religion himself , directly or impliedly *anction the use of force for the maintenance of right , and eves for the punishment of wrong . And if the ultimate tendency of the reform which he introduced is to such a state of things , of absolute and universal Peace , it is a result to be brought about only by the operation of the great moral principles of his reform , to remove the causes which , so long as they exist , in huma.n injustice and sin , render the moderate use of coercive force not only justifiable , but indispensable to the cohesion of human society . We may safely then assume it as proved , that this non-resistance theory is not borne out by the Christian Scriptures , neither by special precepts , nor by the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical force against rightful authority , or for the promotion of truth and counteraction of error of opinion , and generally enjoin a pacific , conciliatory and benevolent spirit . We will now examine the philosophy and practical fitness of this doctriiie as set forth by its most intelligent advocates . It is this . Man being endowed with a rational and moral nature , all men might and ought to be guided in their conduct by a sense of duty , and sentiment of kindness . All means , therefore , which , setting aside man 's higher nature , are intended to force them to do right , are essentially wrong . Now , war and the use of force for settling difficulties among men , will never be abolished unless some men resolutely begin with taking the ground of never resorting to these means under any circumstances . If it be understood that no force will be used even in ( lefence of right-if war , with all the preparations for war , as well as chains and prisons , be abolished-much greater exertions will be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion , argument , and persuasion , to respect the rights of their fellow-men . Still suppose that , notwithstanding these moral efforts , there should be some men who are not restrained by the mere con*ideration of the injustice of an act . Even among these , few would be found mean enough to inflict injustice upon one who is resolved to bear it without resistance . Thus , in the rebellion towards the close of the last century , the lives of the Quakers were spared ; and in the settlement of Pennsylvania , the peace policy of its founder prevented ail hostility on the part of the natives . Hence the principle of 2n-resi*tance is generally the safest , as well as the best , // course . But even if there be any human being so hardened and so mean as to inflict an injury upon an unresisting fellow-being , the voluntary martyrdom of the innocent is the highest glory attainable by man , as well as the surest way to establish the truth for which he suffers , and to effect even the conversion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , and will triumph at last completely over all its enemies . This mode of reasoning re*s on two distinct grounds-expediency and principle . The first of these relates to the personal safety of the individual who embraces the doctrine of non-resistance , and the probability of success in his pursuits . The other question concerns the morality of the two principles , of total abstinence from physical force , and a partial use of it . With regard to the alleged safety of the practice of non-resistance there can be no doubt , that distrust is very often the chief cause of danger , and faith the best security . The moral importance of the principle of faith in education is generally acknowledged ; but it is the peculiar merit of the friends of Peace to have brought forward many glorious instances of reckless crime disarmed by defenceless faith . They have shown that even when the character of a man is formed , and his habits are fixed , after he has thrown off all allegiance to virtue , and put on the whole armour of crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness ; he feels constrained to revere virtue in others even when this reverence is necessarily coupled with self-contempt . But on the other hand , the force of facts constrains us to admit , that in many cases the most devoted heroic faith has proved inadequate to overcome the ( letermmed wickedness or hopeless delusion of men . Thus the early converts to Christianity , according to the testimony of the fathers of the church , generally refused to fight , on the ground that they were Christians . Yet they , as well as the author of their faith , were accounted as sheep for the slaughter . ' It is not consistent with facts , then , that the non-resistance faith is always a safe and expedient doctrine . Those whose conduct is conformed to the be .. lief that men are creatures of circumstances , are generally safe ; but those who act upon the principle that circumstances are , or ought to be , the creatures of men , who dare to have an opinion , a conscience of their own , whether the world be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant ( langer . In the height of success they must he prepared to hear the cries of Crucify ! Crucify ! even before the last echoes of flosanna ! have died away . This question , whether one mode of conduct be less dangerous than anotber ,  --  whether it be probable that the man who has struck one blow to destroy my life , and having missed by accident , aims another , will forbear upon seeing my determination rather to die than to resist , or only upon finding me both able and resAved to // take his own life in case he should endanger mine ,  --  this question depends on a calm and discriminating consideration of the circumstances of the case . The theory of implicit faith in man 's better nature has been refuted by the whole history of martyrdom ; the opposite theory of distrust has been disproved by many instances of determined criminals , and even madmen , overcome by non-resistance , made irresistible to *j*em , by the power of faith and love . The safety of either of these*ntagonist principles can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case must be the practical guide for individuals and nations . " What king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , afl ( l con. sulteth whether he be able , with ten thousand , to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ? " But it is not only numbers , but natural advantages , and above all the encouraging an ( l inspiring influence of a good cause , which are to be taken into account . It was by partly accommodating themselves to existing circumstances , and partly by forcing circumstances into the service of their determined will , that the ancient Greeks resisted the countless hosts of the great king , and that in more recent times the Netherlanders. the Provinces of North America , and the modern Greeks , established their independence . With regard to the chances of war a computation has recently been made , with a view to ascertain in how many wars recor ( led in history right has prevailed over wrong . It is supposed that the number of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those in which it has been defeated , is about the same . The usefulness of war as a remedy against injustice has bcen inferred from that computation . But this conclusion does riot seem to be borne out by the facts adduced . The fact that justice does not always prevail in contest only proves that the goodness of the cause is not of itself sufficient to secure to its defenders the victory . The belief in an immediate interposition of Providence , which instituted ordeals , has long been given up as a superstition . Hence , he who maintains the justice of resistance against oppression , agrees with the advocate of non-resistance in condemning any attempt at insurrection made without reasonable prospect of success-unless the tyranny be so atrocious and degrading that the most hopeless struggle is preferable to brutalizing submission . But while it is true on the one hand that justice , without th' means of carrying it into effect , without ftsrecas , activity and deCisioli , does not insure success , it is equally true that of all the favorable auspices tinder which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is none so propitious and sure as the consciousness of a good cause . We remember to have seen in Germany in the hanos of one of the bravest of the brave who distinguished themselves ii* // the war of German Independence in 1813 , an old sword that bore this simple inscription : " Em gut Gewissen in Sachen Einen behcrzt und froh thut machen . " That is , " A conscience good in what we do Doth make one brave and cheerful too . " The cheerful courage inspired4y the justice of the cause we contend for , differs essentially not only from that which seems to be the effect of a vigorous physical constitution , but that also which springs from the intoxicating influence of ambition , or any other selfish passion . The courage of ambition has helped individuals to make themselves the masters of their fellow-men ; the courage of conscience has stirred up nations to shake off the degrading habits of servitude , and reenact their abrogated humanity . A single instance like that of the founders of the Swiss Confederacy , pleading their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausting all their means of entreaty and protestation against the ambitious rapacity of the Dukes of Austria , despised by her warlike nobility , until at last , grasping the weapons of despair , they rose against their oppressors , and the shepherd 's sling once more prevailed against the giant 's coat of mail and helmet of brass-this single instance of the only free community in monarchical Europe formed and self-sustained by dint of resistance against tyranny , is sufficient to prove the expediency of ivar as a last resort of oppressed justice . this and other examples of successful resistance rise in importance when we consider that the history of man does not exhibit more than one instance of a people recovering any considerable portion of their natural rights by free concession . Whether he who vindicates the cause of right on the battle field , or he who simply delivers his testimony to the truth and seals it with his blood , be the greater hero , this is a question which has drawn forth different aflswers . The charm of military eminence , and its vast practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , and corrupted the judgment , of men , that they have been disposed to overlook the . object , in pursuit of which , and the steps whereby , a Ca*sar and a Napoleon rose to greatness . The friends of Peace have exposed this false judgment , and have shown that military prowess may exist with , and may sometimes be traced to , moral cowardice . But the honest zeal to disabuse mankind of 50 dangerous a prejudice has carried some so far as to deny the existence of military virtue . Some have denounced all military heroism , that of the deliverers as well as that of the enslavers of men , as " wholesale murder . " To us the true characteristics of moral heroism seem to be these three : an honest conviction of // duty , however correct , or howcver mistaken ; an exalted effort ut wifl ; and the spirit of self-sacrifice . It is the possession of these qmiitics which makes us look upon a Washington as a moral as well as a military hero . What instance of unresisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Winkeiried , who made a breach in the fearful wall of armed spearsmen , the prime of Austria 's chvalry , that baffled the boldest attacks of the naked bravery of his couutrymen*y grasping a large number of hostile lances and thrusting them firmly into his own bosom , so that they could not be withdrawn before the Swiss host rushed over his body into the midst of the invincible square doomed to become the mausoleum of Arnold Winkelried ? When we compare this and many other instances of warlike philanthropy with the highest and purest examples of unresisting martyrdom , we feel unwilling to admit any invidious distinction that would ascribe either to the one or the other a higher degree of merit or virtue . There seems to be something in the peculiar physical and moral constitution of benevolent individuals , or in the different influences under which their characters have been formed , that fits and disposes each one more especially either for active or for suffering philanthropy . There are individuals , we know , whose voice and strength failed them when called upon to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though all the terrors of this world coul ( l not force from them a denial of a single article of their creed ; and there are others who rejoice in a public , but shrink from a more private , exhibition of fidelity to principle . The crown of martyrdom belongs to him who is rea ( ly both to act and to suffer , as the fulfilment of his moral mission may require the one or the other ; and humanity will own her votaries , and accept their sacrifice , and not allow those to go down to an unhonored grave who fall in her service , whether grasping the sword , or clasping the crucifix . Still it may be said with good reason , that although candid and enlightened men will judge the character of individuals by the stan ( lard of their own professed principles , the fact that there are conscientious soldiers does not establish the morality of their profession . The taking of human life , and generally the use of force against beings who are fitted and destined to govern themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefGre wrong , unless it be proved to be necessary to prevent greater evil . Punishment and war can be vindicated only on the ground on which the amputation of a limb , or the use of a dangerous medicine to save the life of the patient , is justifiable . XVhat , then , is the prin ciple of justice , if there be one , that authorizes and regulates the use of force ? It is evident that no human being can attain to that degree of // perfection and happiness in this world , which his own nature points out as his destiny , unless he be free to use his faculties , and the various means of improvement and enjoyment which the Creator has placed within his reach . Every man , in virtue of his being a man , claims the widest sphere of independent existence and action which a human being can possess , consistently with the equal inde ' pendence of every other . It is this . *qual sphere of freedom which we call his right . It includes pers*lal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The duty to respect the rights of all , and the injustice of every infringement , are obvious . Hence the duty to vindicate the just claims of all from injustice , by adequate means , even if these means should be painful to the offender , prop vided they do not inflict upon him any more evil than is necessary for the purpose of securing the rights of others , which he has violated . He who knowingly violates the right of others shows that . so far he is governed , not by his moral , but by his animal , nature . He so far justifies those whom he has injured , in treating him on the supposition that argument and persuasion are less likely to keep him within the bounds of justice , than the application of physical evil sufficient to check his criminal propensity . For though a man can not by force be made to respect the rights of others , he cart by force be made to abstain from violating them . That stipposition does not deny the possibility , however improbable , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mere consideration of its irijus tice is not sufficient to restrain him , may be converted by the unmerited forgiveness of the offended . This possibility is acknowledged and implied in the iact , that the use of force in defence of right is a matter of right , hi it not necessarily a duty . It is a duty in general to repress injustice by the gentlest means , if they be sufficient ; by the severest , if they be necessary . But as there is no external absolute standard to determine the degree of lenity or severity to be applied in every case , it is right , on the one hand , that he whose rights are violated should have the right to forego any or every means of redress and defence , in as much as he has to bear the consequences of his forbearance . But , on the other hand , it would be wrong to ( leprive the injured person of those physical means which , from the nature of the offence , are more likely to maintain or restore his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been rendered improbable by the very act of the offender . And it is the duty of all who are interested in the maintenance of justice , to affor ( l to every one who is not willing to suffer injustice that supply of physical force which , according to their deliberate judgment , is required to counteract the criminal motive evinced by the act . Even in the case of a person who is resolved rather to die than defend himself , the fact that he possesses in himself , or in the community , adequate means to repel force by // force , does much to enhance the glory and moral power of his inartyrdo in . The general principle , then , which authorizes and regulates the use of physical force , may be thus stated . Coercion should be used so far , and only so far , as it is necessary to check the criminal propensity of those who are not restrained , by considerations of justice , from infringing the *ghts of others . This principle limits the use of force to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the utmost consequence to hold fast the distinction between this and every other object , however desirable and laudable . Thus it is highly important to individuals , and to society , that all superstition and bigotry should be eradicated , and that true religion should be planted everywhere . But we have no right to promote religion by force , either directly by imprisonment and war , or by connecting with the profession of a certain creed any civil or political disabilities . The most thorough conviction , based on the clearest evidences , that our faith alone is true and conducive to the *velfare , temporal and eternal , of mankind , does not justify the use of any means but such as are included in the exercise of our common rights . My personal and social rights authorize me to use my own faculties for the purpose of enlightening and converting all who are disposed to hear me ; and I have a right to use my property for erecting churches , and supporting preachers an ( l missioii*ines . This is the extent of my rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it allows to every one an equal range of religious action , every one has a right to defend and secure from cue roachinent. 1'lhe principle that regulates the use of force , as above stated , justifies its employment only so far as it is necessary and sufficient to overcome the criminal propensity that is not restrained by a sense of justice . The restriction of physical power to cases of necessity implies the duty of individuals and of society , before resorting to force , to use every means that may render that resort unnecessary . Hence the individual who is attacked by others , under circumstances in which he can not apply to the constituted officers of the law , is bound first to remonstrate with the aggressor , then to threaten , and only when remonstrance and threatening prove fruitless , to employ force-unless the conduet of the aggressor should be such as to leave him no time but for immediate resistance . In both cases he ' is justified in using such forcible measures as are sufficient , an ( I no more than are necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reason , where the aid of the law is available , the individual must apply to ifs responsible administrators , instead of resorting to single-handed violence , or of raising a mob . it is for the purpose of removing or diminishing the necessity of coercive measures that laws arc made , which are or ought // to be nothing else than declarations of right , calculated by theit justice to inspire respect and obedience . Courts of justice are established for a peaceable , impartial settlement of contested claims .. To secure the compliance of those whom the respect for equal Jaws and impartial tribunals is not sufficient to restrain , punishments are threatened ; and only when the fear of them is not sufficient to repress the criminal desire , the actual infliction is resorted to for effecting this purpose . The same principle applies to nations . Both with regard to war and to punishments , the principle which authorizes force , only so far as it is necessary to secure invaded rights , forbids all useless violence and all cruelty . Hence the great importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishments to the nature and degree of guilt evinced by the crime , for the purpose of securing the rights of all . The manner and the degree of punishment should answer both the immediate object of depriving the criminal of the power , and the more remote end of checking the criminal propensity , and reforming the character of the offender . It is when *veighed in this scale , that capital punishments are found unjustifiable ; for they are not absolutely necessary to secure society from a repetition of the same crime , and not calculated to reform the criminal ; and no human being can be so utterly depraved as to render all attempt at reformation hopeless . The barbarous maxim that blood should be shed merely because blood has been shed , is growing obsolete ; and the vindication of any punishment , on the ground of its serving as a terrifying example , is unsatisfactory , in as much as terror may be the effect of unjust as well as just punishments . The terrifying character of the punishment does not make it just ; otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of penal legislation . If we add to these considerations , which may be summed up in the simple maxim , not to give unnecessary pain , that of the uncertainty of all human evidence , so justly urged by the author of the Penal Code of Louisiana , in opposition to capital punishments , we are satisfied that the taking of human life , though it may be necessary as a last resort of individual or national self-defence , is unjustifiable as a punishment , which , in order to be just , must bear the character of corrective ( liscipline . The same reasoning applies to war , and all . preparations for war . Every war , to be just , must possess these three attributes it must have justice for its object ; it must be resorted to only when all peaceable means of redress prove of no avail ; and it must inflict no injury beyond what is necessary for the redress of wrong . Of the last of these requisites we have already spoken , as implied in the general principle , that the infliction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propensity of the evil-doer , is crime . Even in war , the principle of peace should be acted upon // as far as possible . It should prevent the violation of the personal rights and private property of the inhabitants of a hostile country , as well as enjoin humanity toward prisoners . With regard to the first of the above-mentioned requisites of a just ivar , we have already remarked , that resort to arms for any purpose but the protection of human rights , is unjust ; though authorized by the legitimate sovereign , it is a conspiracy for robbery and murder , whether it be undertaken to satisfy the ambition or gratify the whim of a ( 105 pot , or to uphold the balance of power amo1*g nations , or to establish universal peace , or to promote the intemsts of the cross or the crescent . But when the rights of man , on the safet.y of which the destinies of mankind on earth depend , are violated though it be in the person of a single individual , or by the infringement of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this single right is identified with universal justice . It is guarded by the armed providence of the law , and insured by the collected moral and physical power of the community . It is not the injury ( lone but the injustice of the act which constitutes the right and the duty of war . Whether it be the Great King demanding earth and water , ' or a mother country laying an unconstitutional impost upon tea  --  the demand is wrong , and resistance right ; and when all peaceable means of opposition are exhausted , war becomes a duty . The justice of the war does not depend on its being either offen*ive , or defensive ,  --  if these words relate merely to the fact that one or the other of the contending parties was the first to commence actual hostilities . The question is simply who is the oppressor , and who the oppressed . He who disregards the rights of his feb low man , virtually commences hostilities , and he whom he has wronged , is acting in a moral point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the sword . Hence the assertion , that all offensive war is wrong , and defensive war alone is justifiable , is correct only when it is understood as relating not to the mere fact of one having been the first or the last to take up arms , but to the aggression or defence of right . But war in order to be just- must not only have justice for its object , but it must riot be resorted to until all peaceable means of redress have been tried in vain . This principle applies , as we have shown , to the use of physical force in general . The freer the government , the more manifold and powerful are the inducements to abstain from a violation of right , which makes the resort to force necessary . rI*he general information of the people with regard to the rights afl ( l duties of all , the participation of all the citizens in the dclil ) eration and enactment cf the law ; its promulgation in the manner best ealculaled to make it familiar to all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide upon every case of contention arising under the law ; still more the secure enjoyment of all the advantages which the law insures to every one who obeys it ; and the powerful influence of public opinion strengthening the principles of honesty in individuals ; and where such principles are wanting , the fear of just punishments contained in the law-all there are so many appeals to ever*y individual to abstain from acts which must bring down upon l*im*he sword of the law . And thus between nations , the more their mutual intercourse is unfettered and unrestricted , making each country interested in the welfare of every other by a constant interchange of productions , so much the stronger the inducements to settle any existing differences by arbitration and compromise , rather than war . It is not until all appeals to self-interest and conscience , all attempts at an amicable adjustment of difficulties , have proved fruitless , that resort to the last means of redress may be justified . How long and how far an injured nation may forbear , magnanimolisly enduring wrong rather than have recourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of peace before exchanging the olive branch for the sword-is a question which must depend on the nature and circumstances of the case . Arbitration is one of the means of amicable adjustment resorted to , particularly of late , with signal success . There are indeed questions , such as involve independence and sovereignty , which no nation can leave to be decided by arbitration . But with regard to those which come under the head of questions of national profit or honor , ' * there does not seem to he any good reason for governments to refuse the decision by an umpire . It is in most cases not a due sense of the rights of property and national honor , but rather the reckless passion of aggrandizement* and the sensitiveness of the duellist , which make governments willing to lavish the blood and treasure of nations rather than compromise a doubtful pecuniary claim , or simply to explain what could be easily settled by frank and honorable explanation . The efforts of the Peace Societies , therefore , for the purpose of inducing governments to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are founded upon just principles , and deserving of universal sympathy and co-operation . Another more permanent measure of universal pacification has been proposed by philanthropists , and recently brought before the Federal Legislature . It is a Congress of Nations , ' consisting of delegates from all the states of the civilized world for the purpose of composing a code of international law ; and a high Court ' // commissioned to decide all disputes between nations according to that 1a*v . These decisions , however , as well as the code , are to be invested with no other than an advisory power . The establishment of a Congress and High Court of Nations is certainly a sublime conception ; and we do not see any good reasons for considering it an impracticable scheme . But in order to make it a beneficent institution , the true object for which laws are made , and legislatures and co*ts of judicature are appointed , should not be lost sight of . Laws are just and morally binding , only inasmuch as they are declarations of the rights of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being the greatest freedom consistent with equality , that laws are made , legislators , judges , and magistrates appointed . All governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed ; and this power is delegated to them for no other purpose than to secure the inalienable rights with which the Creator has endowed all men ; and whenever they assume any other power , it is one of the inalienable rights arid duties of their constituents to take it from them . This is the doctrine of the Declaration of Independence , and to secure these blessings of liberty to themselves and their descendants , the Constitution of the United States was framed by the founders of this Republic . Whatever partial inconsistencies may be imputed to us in our attempts at carrying these principles into effect , still these are the principles which " We , the People of these United States , " have acknowledged as just in themselves , and to the support of which we stand pledged before the political world . In conformity with this our political creed , our Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been guided by the principle , that treaties for the protection of commerce and the private rights of the citizens of our own and other countries , be formed with those who actually possess the sovereign power in any country ,  --  so as to recognise only the fact , without acknowledging the justice of the title by which the power is held . Ia forming treaties with the Ottoman Porte , or with the Autocrat of all the Russias , it is evident that we are not negotiating with those who according to our political creed are the only rightful sovereigns of those countries ; we are not treating with the Turkish and Russian nations , but simply with those , whoever they be , who have the power to protect the private rights of our citizens in those parts of the world . Now , it would be inconsistent with our own political principles , as well as the most obvious facts , were our government to acknowledge an assembly composed almost entirely of delegates of the monarchs of Europe , ns a " Congress and High Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decisions and regulations they would be guided by any other maxims than those which arc // maintained by their constituents-that is , the maxims of the Moiy Alliance , which was formed expressly for the purpose of establishing peace and the principles of Christianity in Europe . These considerations derive additional strength from the state of public opinion in Europe , in consequence of which any war that should arise , from whatever cause , according to Canning 's prediction , is likely to become a war of principle-turning upon the very principle which forms the essenftal difference between this and the other governments of the world . It is said , that this central legislature and tribunal are not to have any other than an advisory power , so that the efficacy of their regulations and decisions must rely entirely on their wisdom and equity . But as long as the greatest portion of their constituents hold a power not derived from the people , and therefore dependent on a large standing army , it may be easily foreseen , that if the party in whose favor the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed for the executioii of the sentence . Hence the circumstance that the court possesses no armed force , does not remove the objections to such a central institution , consisting of delegates of so many absolute monarchs , together with those of one or two republics ,  --  added , as it were , by way of exception , to strengthen the general rule . These objections do not apply to the settlement of differences by arbitration , as it is easy in each instance to find some third power which , with regard to the case in question , may be considered as disposed to decide with a degree of impartiality which can not be expected beforehand in all cases to belong to a central court emanating from such heterogeneous elements . At the same time it is unquestionably desirable that certain doubtful points of international law , with regard to which the opinions of some of the most celebrated writers on this subject disagree , and the decision of which is in no way affected by the essential difference in the political constitutions of different countries , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these questiour . A Congress and High Court of Nations must be considered as a truly cosmopolitan and philanthropic institution , if it be founded on a republican constituency . It is fitted to promote the highest interests of humanity , if its members are the responsible delegates , and representatives of free communities , which consider all laws , both national and interr*ational , as binding upon themselves , only in as much as they are intended to make known and secure to every human being the greatest possible liberty consistent with equality ; and recognize no power , whether legislative , or judicial , or executive , as rightfully constituted , but in as much as it is derived from and responsible to the people . The true way then to realize this // sublime idea of a central board of international legislation and ju* dicature , is to republican ize the world . Let the principle of self-government be acknowledged as the only rightful form of government in every nation , and the chief source of all international discord is dried up . What national , nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conquest , if it be understood that the conquered pro*vince is to govern itself , and to tax itself for the sole purpose of s*pporting its own government ? In as much as the fundamental law of a state is truly republican , all its means and energies are directed not to its aggrandizement as a state , but to the protection of the rights of the individuals who compose it . If this were the condition of every state , it is evident that the civil institutions which are sufficient to secure the rights of the native would protect also those of the foreigner in his intercourse with the native . For although it is not to be presumed that men , being liable to err , and to be tempted by selfish motives , will ever cease to quarrel about their rights ; yet if these rights , as acknowledged by law , are essentially the same all over the world , and if the power of each state have no other object than to secure them , what could induce the majority of any nation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all mankind , to go to war with another nation ? Surely it is a true saying , expressive both of the main cause of war and the mode of removing it , that war is a game which , if nations were wise , kings would not play at . ' As soon , then , as the nations of the earth , or the greater portion of them , shall be sufficiently civilized and humanized , to recognize the protection of the individual rights of men as the only legitimate object of government , it will be safe and right for them to abolish war , and all preparations for war . It is thus , and thus alone , that the great prophecy can be fulfilled , that nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more. * Rulers who do not derive their power from , and do not hold themselves responsible to , the people , can not disband their armies ; and as long as there are such rulers , powerful enough to disturb the peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their political existence , it would be a suicidal measure in a free nation to lay down its weapons , trusting to the justice of armed despots . No true and intelligent friend of Peace , no one who is able to distinguish between the peace founded on freedom , and the peace of universal despotism , can advise a free natiQa to wrest the 5*vOr ( l from the hand of the Cherubim guarding the entrance to the Eden of Liberty . We have endeavoured to investigate the subject of Peace and War , and the attempts of the Peace Societies in our country , impartially and thoroughly . We have found that war , and the use of // force , are justifiable so far as they are necessary for the security of the rights of all . We have shown that within these bounds , wary and the use of force are not contrary , hut con Cormable to the spirit* the precepts , and the example , of the great Founder of our religion but that Christianity aims at abolishing war by removing its causes . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large number of true friends of P*eace , we would suggest to the Peace Societies an alteration in th ' *r present constitution , with a view to secure the cooperation of those who now feel themselves excluded by the manner in which their object is stated . Instead of asserting that " all war is contrary to the spirit of the gospel " - we should prefer a simple declaration of their purpose to carry into effect the object of Christianity , to establish peace on earth and good will towards n*n ' , by inducing all men to respect the rights of all ; and especially by urging upon nations the duty of settling any differences arising between them , by arbitration , or other peaceful means of obtaining justice . We feel a deep interest in this Peace movement . It is one of the symptoms of the working of that divine principle of human LIBERTY which , in harmony and cooperation with the divine philosophy of the religion of Perfect Love and Truth , is yet , as we fervently trust , notwithstanding the fearful accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many thousands of years , destined to elevate and ameliorate the condition of humanity to a point far in advance of its present condition . It is one of its fruits , fast beginning already to swell and move in the embryo . We are anxious to rescue it out of the hands of the fanaticism of its most active and zealous friends  --  the worst enemy of a good cause . We are anxious that a sound and universal public opinion should form itself on this subject in this country ; both with reference to the enormous mass of population which is destined in a comparatively brief period to overspread this continent , and to the moral influence , strengthening and spreading every year , which our example will exert upon the rest of the civilized world . The agitation of this question , and of the great principles , and deep moral elements of human nature , which it involves , will have a material influence on the progress of the cause of Liberty among the nations of Europe . Every year of peace crumbles away more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hammer of industry , which it leaves free to play , strengthens the cause of the Many against that of the Few ; and a few years of the discussion of this and similar topics , throughout the broad masses of the people , are alone required* to undermine the basis of their entire systems of force and fraud , of bayonet-circled palace , castle , and dungeon of state ; and to prepare the nations for their reconstruction on the broad and imperishable foundations of liberty and quility.
