txt Mr. Sparks has been long known as a laborious and able investigator of American history . Among his more serious works , he has found time to project and conduct this excellent series of biographical sketches . The plan is to " select prominent names , to which opportunity and inclination may attract the different writers , and thus enable them to perform the task of a biographer with the more fidelity and interest in the subject . " This first volume contains the lives of " John Stark , Charles Erockden Brown , Richard Montgomery , and Ethan Allen . " Mr. Edward Everett 's sketch of Stark is written with his usual skill in the selection and arrangement of incidents , and in a very lively style . It is a finished and classical piece of biography , in which the character of the subject is made more interesting than ever by the force , and grace , and freshness of the narrative . There was much in the condition of our countrymen , at the period of our history in which Stark figured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contempt of danger , and a hardy independence of character . These qualities were shown all over the colonies , during ou*r revolution , but no where more than in New-England , and in no man more than in Mr. Stark . His deeds exhibit a cool intrepidity , that would have done honor to the heroes whose names adorn the historic page , or the song of the poet , in any nation of Europe . It is highly gratifying to find such men as Mr. Everett , adorning the heroic annals of our early revolutionary times , by the polished style and graces of learning , acquired in a peaceful and prosperous age . The biography will be read with interest by all . The Life of Charles Brockden Brown is extremely well drawn up . In themselves , the adventures of literary men are imagined to he wanting in interest . The supposed quiet and retirement of their occupa // 429 tions induce people to think that but little can be found in a narrative of their lives , to attract the notice of a biographer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inclined to think that this is a mistaken notion . The literary man has rare opportunities of witnessing life in its more significant aspects , and of becoming familiar with many developments of the finer traits of character , that are but little observed hy men situated in the more bustling places of the world . If his biographer has a just discrimination , and can delineate his mind , with a due distribution of parts , and knows his relative position as connected with other minds , the life of the literary man may be made full of interest and instruction . It should be illustrated by his works and by his correspon ( lence with other literary men . It should be written with a *varm and sympathizing spirit , and not in the severity of theoretical and partial criticism . Such is Mr. Prescott 's life of Brown . The story is told in a most animated and elegant style , and the character of Brown is drawn with a freedom and at the same time a delicacy of coloring , that do full justice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents are commemorated . The lovers of American literature must be highly gratified at this successful effort to rescue from oblivion the name of one , whose genius was almost the first to adorn our annals with the graces of imaginative writing . We copy the following beautiful conclusion The success of our author 's experiment , which was entirely devoted to Amencaa subjects , fully established the soundness of his opinions , which have been al ) undantly confirmed by the prolific pens of Irving , Cooper , Sedgwick , and other accomplished writers , who , in their diversified sketches of national character and scenery , have shown the full capacity of our country for all the purposes of fiction . Brown does not direct himself , like them , to the illustration of social life and character . He is little occupied with the exterior forms of society . He works in the depths of the heart , dwelling less on human action , than the sources of it . He has been said to have formed himself on Godwin . Indeed , he openly avowed his admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects , adopted his mode of operation ; studying character with a philosophic , rather than a poetic eye . But there is no servile imitation in all this . He has borrowed the same torch , indeed , to read the page of human nature , but the lesson he derives from it is totally different . His great object seems to be to exhibit the soul in scenes of extraordinary interest . For this purpose , striking and perilous situations are devised , or circumstances of strong moral excitement , a troubled conscience , partial gleams of insanity , or bodings of imaginary evil which haunt the soul , and force it into all the agonies of terror . In the midst of the fearful strife , we are coolly invited to investigate its causes , and all the various phenomena which attend it ; every contingency , probability , nay possibility , however remote , is discussed and nicely balanced . The heat of the reader is seen to evaporate in th-i*-cold-blooded dissection , in which our author seems to rival Butler 's hero , who , Profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twixt south and southwest side . " We are constantly struck with the strange contrast of over-passion and over-reasoning . But , perhaps , after all , these defects could not be pruned away from Brown 's composition without detriment to his peculiar excellencies . Si non errasset , fecerae ille minus . If so , we may willingly pardon the one for the sake of the other . We can not close without adverting to our author 's style . He bestowed great pains on the formation of it , but , in our opinion , without great success , at least in his novels . It has an elaborate , factitious air , contrasting singularly with the general simplicity of his taste , and the careless rapidity of his composition . We are aware , indeed , that works of imagination may bear a higher flush of color , a poetical varnish , in short , that must be refused to graver and more studied namra // Literary Notices . five . No writer has been so felicitous in reaching the exact point of good taste in this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose , may be said to have enabled his readers to breathe an atmosphere of poetry . More than one author , on the other band , as Florian in French , for example , and Lady Morgan in English , in their attempts to reach this middle region , are eternally fluttering on the wing pf sentiment , equally removed from good prose and good poetry . Brown , perhaps , willing to avoid this extreme , has fallen into the opposite one , forcing his style into unnatural vigor and condensation . Unusual and pedantic epithets , and elliptical forms of expression in perpetual violation of idiom , are resorted to , at the expense of simplicity and nature . He seems averse to telling simple things in a simple way . Thus , for example , we have such expressions as these ,  --  " I was fraught with the persuasio that my life was endangered . " " The outer door was ajar . I shut it with trembling eagerness , and drew every bolt that op d d to it . " " His brain seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till their slow and hoarser inspirations showed them to be both asleep . Just then , on changing my position , my head struck against some things which depe. ded from the ceiling of the closet . " " It was still dark , but my sleep was at an end , and by a common apparatus tinder-box that lay beside my bed , I could instantly produce a light . " " On recovering from deliquium , you found it where it had been dropped . " It is unnecessary to multiply examples , which we should not have adverted to at all , had not our opinions in this matter been at variance with those of inure than one respectable critic . This sort of language is , no doubt , in very bad taste . It can not be denied , however , that , although these defects are sufficiently general to give a coloring to the whole of his composition , yet his works afford many passages of undeniable eloquence and rhetorical beauty . It must be remembered , too , that his novels were his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the defects of an immature mind , which longer experience and practice might have corrected . Indeed , his later writings are recommended by a more correct and natural phraseology , although it - must be allowed that the graver topics to which they are devoted , if they did not authorize , would at least render less conspicuous any studied formality and artifice of expression . These verbal blemishes , combined with defects already alluded to in the development of his plots , but which all relate to the form rather than the fond of his subject , have made our author less extensively popular than his extraordinary powers would otherwise have entitled him to be . His peculiar merits , indeed , appeal to a higher order of criticism than is to be found in ordinary and super . ficial readers . Like the productions of Coleridge , or Wordsworth , they seem to rely on deeper sensibilities than most men possess , and tax the reasoning powers more severely than is agreeable to readers who resort to works of fiction only as an epicurean indulgence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited than that of writers of less talent , who have shown more tact in accommodating themselves to the tone of popular feeling or prejudice . But we are unwilling to part ,  --  with any thing like a tone of disparagement lingering on our lips ,  --  with the amiable author , to whom our rising literature is under such large and various obligations ; who first opened a view into the boundless fields of fiction , which subsequent adventurers have successfully explored ; who has furnished so much for our instruction in the several departments of history and criticism , and has rendered still more effectual service by kindling in the bosom of the youthful scholar the same generous love of letters which glowed in his own ; whose writings , in fine , have uniformly inculcated the pure and elevated morality exemplified in his life . The only thing we can regret is , that a life so useful should have been so short ; if , indeed , that can be considered short , which has done so much towards attaining life 's great end . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical correctness and precision . Mr. Armstrong shows a practised pen and a serene judgement . It is a choice specimen of simple and chaste narrative , exciting the interest of the reader by the charms of its statements , and the romantic character of its subject . The Life of Ethan Allen is from the pen of Mr. Sparks . This is a particularly important sketch , involving , as it does , a history of the foundation of the state of Vermont . Mr. Allen was one of the most // 431 conspicuous leaders in every enterprise connected with this great event . His exploits and sagacity are commemorated in a dignified and manly style , and with a just appreciation of the characteristic qualities which they manifested . the controversy between the holders of the Grants and the government of New-York , is certainly a curious passage in the history of the " Empire State . " Her fair fame has always been too much eclipsed by the machinations of jobbers , speculators , and blacklegs , both religious and political . It is to be hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper moral influence over the character of the country . But of this we must not speak now . We take the subjoined extract , explaining the steps of the " Green Mountain Boys , " after the first unsuccessful controversy iu the Albany courts Actions of ejectment continued to be brought before tbe Albany courts ; but . the settlers , despairing of success after the precedents of the first cases , did not . appear in defence , nor give themselves any more troable in the matter . Next came sheriffs and civil magistrates to execute the writs of possession , and by due course of law to remove the occupants from the lands . At this crisis , the affair assumed a tangible shape . The mountaineers felt themselves at home on the soil , which they had subdued by their own labor* and in the territory over which they bad begun to exercise supreme dominion , by meeting in conventions and committees , and taking counsel of each other on public concerns . To drive one of them from his house , or deprive him of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue fatal alike to their dearest interests , and to the rights , which every man deems as sacred as life itself . It was no wonder , therefore , that they *should unite in a common cause , which it required their combined efforts to maintain . As it was expected the sheriffs would soon make their appearance , precautions were taken to watch their motions , and give due notice of their approach . In the first instance , when the sheriff arrived at the house , on the owner of which he was to serve a writ of possession , he found it surrounded by a body of men , who resisted his attempts , and defeated his purpose . Complaints were sent to Lord Dunmore , then Governor of New-York , accompanied with the names of the leaders of the " riotous and tumultuous ' assemblage ; and the Governor forthwith published a proclamation on the 1st day of November , 1770 , denouncing this presumptuous act , and commanding the Sheriff of Albany County to apprehend the offenders , whose names had been mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought to condign punishment ; authorixing him to call to his assistance the posse comitatiis , or the whole power of the country . But proclamations were of as little avail as writs of possession ; and the sheriff was never lucky enough to seize any of the rioters , who , doubtless , had the forethought to keep out of his reach . The next exploit was at the house of James Brackenridge , whose farm was within the township of Bennington , and on whom the sheriff came to serve a writ . The house was filled with armed men , who treated this civil officer with much disrespect , and set his authority at nought . A few days afterwards he returned with a posse , such as he could collect for the purpose ; but in this instance he was again repelled by a still more numerous party , armed with muskets , which they presented at the breasts of the sheriff and his associates , and exhibited other attitudes of menace and , contempt , against which these pacific messengers , armed only with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it prudent to contend . The rioters , as they were called , and perhaps by no very forced construction of language , came off a second time triumphant ; and thus the boldness of their resolutions received a new incitement . These examples , however , did not deter the civil officers from endeavoring to discharge their duty . They appeared in other places , and in one or two instances with success ; but they could not evade the vigilance of the people , who kept a watchful eye upon their movements , and who , when they caught the intruders , resorted to a mode of punishment less perilous than that with powder and ball , but attended with scarcely less indignity to the unfortunate sufferers . This summary process was // 432 denominated chastisement with the twigs of the wilderness , a phraseology too significant to need explanation . As open war now existed , and hostilities had commenced , the Green Mountain Boys , as the belligerents were denominated , thought it advisable te organize their forces and prepare for the contest in a manner worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enterprise and danger , as well as in matters of state policy , Ethan Allen had hitherto been the chief adviser and actor . It was natural , that , in arranging their military establishment , the people should look up to him as the person best qualified to be placed at its head . He was appointed colonel-commandant , with several captains under him , of whom the most noted were Seth Warner and Remember Baker . Committees of safety were likewise chosen , and entrusted with powers for regulating local affairs . Conventions of delegates , representing the people , assembled from time to time , and passed resolves and a ( lopted measures , which tended to harmonize their sentiments and concentrate their efforts . Among the punishments inflicted by the united " Green Mountain Boys , " on spies and refractory members of their society , the following amusing example is given by Mr. Sparks In the midst of these rigors , the mode of punishment was sometimes rather ludicrous than severe . In the town of Arlington lived a doctor , who openly professed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrespectfully of the convention and committees , espousing the cause of the New-York claimants , and advising people to purchase lands under their title . He was admonished by his neighbors , and made to understand , that this tone of conversation was not acceptable , and was requested to change it , or at least to show his prudence by remaining silent . Far from operating any reform , these hints only stirred up the ire of the couragenus doctor , who forthwith armed himself with pistols and other weapons of defence , proclaiming his sentiments more bo7ldly than ever , setting opposition at defiance , and threatening to try the full effects of his personal prowess and implements of warfare on any man , who should have the temerity to a ) proach him with an unfriendly design . Such a boast was likely to call up the martial spirit of his opponents , who accordingly came upon the doctor at an unguarded moment , and obliged him to surrender at discretion . He was thence transferred to the Green Mountain Tavern , in Bennington , where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his defence , sentenced him to a novel punishment , which they ordered to be put in imimediat* execution . Before the door of this tavern , which served the double purpose of a courthouse and an inn , stood a sign.post twenty-five feet high , the top of which was adorned with the skin of a catainount , stuffed to the size of life , with its head turned towards New-York , and its jaws distended , showing large naked teeth , and grinning terror to all who should approach from that quarter .. It was the judgement of the court , that the contumacious doctor should be tied in a chair , and drawn up by a rope to the catamount , where he was to remain suspended two hours ; which punishment was inflicted , in the presence of a numerous asserublage of people , much to their satisfaction and merriment . The doctr was then let down , and permitted to depart to his own house .. The most important event in Col. Allen 's military career was the capture of Ticonderoga . Of this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original plan , and Colonel Allen arrived ithout molestation on the shore of the lake , opposite to Ticonderoga . It was important to have a guide , who was acquainted with the grounds around he fortress , and the places of access . Allen made inquiriesas to these points of Mr. Beman , a farmer residing near the lake in Shoreham , who answered , that he seldom crossed to Ticonderoga , and was little acquainted with the particulars of its situation ; but that his son Nathan , a young lad , passed much of his time there in company with the boys of the garrison . Nathan was called , and appeared , by his answers , to be familiar with every nook in the fort , and every passage and by-path by which it could be approached . In the eye of Colonel Allen he ' was the very person to thread out the best avenue * and by the consent of the Th*ther // 433 and a little persuasion , Nathan Reman was engaged to be the guide of the party . The next step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in number as neither Captain Herrick nor Captain Douglass had sent any from Skenesborough or Panton . Eighty-three men only had crossed , when the day began to dawn ; and while the boats were sent back for the rear division , Colonel Allen resolved to move immediately against the fort . He drew up his men in three ranks , addressed them in a short harangue , ordered them to face to the right , and , placing himself at the head of the middle file , led them silently but with a quick step up the heights on which the fortress stood , and before the sun rose he had entered . the gate and formed his men on the parade between the barracks . Here they gave three huzzas , which aroused the sleeping inmates . When Colonel Allen passed the gate , a sentinel snapped his fusee at him , and then retreated under a covered way . Another sentinel made a thrust at an officer with a bayonet , which slightly wounded him . Colonel Allen returned the compliment with a cut on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his musket and . asked quarter . No more resistance was made . Allen demanded to be shown to the apartment of Captain Delaplace , the commandant of ' the garrison . It was pointed out , and Colonel Allen , with Nathan Beman at his elbow , who knew the way , hastily ascended the stairs , which were attached to the outside of the barracks , and called out with a voice of thunder at the door , ordering the astonished captain instantly to appear , or the whole garrison should he sacrificed . Startled at so strange and unexpected a summons , he sprang from his bed and opened the door , when the first salutation of his boisterous and unreasonable visiter was an order immediately to surrender the fort . Rubbing his eyes and trying to collect his scattered senses , the captain asked by what authority he presumed to make such a demand . " In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Con b ress , " replied Alien . Not accustomed to hear much of the Continental Congress in this remote corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commandant began to speak ; but Colonel Allen cut short the thread of his discourse by lifting Isis sword over his head , and reiterating the demand for an immediate surrender . Having neither permission to argue nor power to resist , Captain Delapiace submitted , ordering his men to parade without arms , and the garrison was given up to the victors . Our limits do not permit us to follow Mr. Sparks in his very interest mg narrative of Mr. Allen 's capture and imprisonment by the British , of his being carried in chains to England , and of his final return to liberty , in consequence of an exchange of prisoners negotiated bet'veen General Washington and the British commander . His career , after his restoration to his country , was in keeping with the qualities of mind , shown in his early adventures . Boldness in conception , vigor in execution , honesty in intention , a firm reliance on his own resources , marked all his efforts , both in peace and war . The following excellent summary closes Mr. Sparks 's work We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , who holds a place of some notoriety in the history of his times . His character was strongly marked , both by its excellencies and defects ; but it may safely be said , that the latter were attributable more to circumstances beyond his control , than to any original obliquity of his mind or heart . The want of early education , and the habits acquired by his pursuits in a rude and uncultivated state o* sochity , were obstacles to his attainment of some of the higher and better qualities , which were not to be overcome . A roughness of manners and coarser*ss of language , a presumptuous way of reasoning upon all subjects , and his religious scepticism , may be traced to these sources . Faults of this stamp , and others akin to them , admit of no defence , though , when viewed in connexion with their causes , they may have claims to a charitable judgement . Had his understanding been weak , his temperament less ardent , his disposition less inquisitive , and his desire of honorable distinction less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faults ; the shield of insignificance would have covered them ; but it was his destiny to be conspicuous , without time art to conceal or culture to soften his foibles . Yet there is much to admire , in the character of Ethan Allen . He was brave , generous , and frank , true to his , friends , true to his country , consistent and // unyielding in his purposes , seeking at all times to promote the best interests of mankind , a lover of social harmony , and a determined foe to the artifices of injustice and the encroachments of power . Few have suffered more in the cause of freedom , few have borne their sufferings with a firmer constancy or a loftier spirit . His courage , even when apparently approaching to rashness , was calm and deliberate . No man probably ever possessed this attribute in a more remarkable degree . lie was eccentric and ambitious , but these weaknesses , if such they were , miever betrayed him into acts dishonorable , unworthy , or selfish . His enemies never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret confidence misplaced or expectations disappointed . He was kind and benevolent , humane and placable . Jn short , whatever may have been his peculiarities , or however these may have diminished the weight of his influence and the value of his public services , it must be allowed , that he was a m n of very considerable importance in the sphere of his activity , and that to no individual among her patriot founders is the State of Vermont more indebted for the basis of her free institutions , and the achievement of her independence , than to ETHAN ALLEN.
