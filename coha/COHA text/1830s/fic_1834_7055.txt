BY THEODORE S. FAY . THE INTRODUCTION . " Prudence , whose glass presents the approaching jail , Poetic justice , with her lifted scale , Where in nice balance truth with gold she weighs , And solid pudding against empty praise . " I WALKED out one summer afternoon , to amuse myself after the troubles of a long and toilsome day , spent in poring over musty volumes of the law . As I rose from my fatiguing studies , and breathed the fresh , free air of heaven , I enjoyed that natural cheerfulness which is always felt when the elastic mind soars from the object to which it has been bound down , and sports away at pleasure through the regions of fancy . After having groped among the shadowy labyrinths of ambiguous science , wearied and bewildered in its mazy path , I rejoiced to be in a lighter sphere , amid merriment and bustling adventure  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my meditations , and the rosy-cheeked , bright-eyed girls who passed by me imparted a sweeter sensation to my mind . It had been extremely warm and sultry , but now a light breeze cooled the air ; the pigeons pecked and cooed and sported about in the shade ; a privileged dog might now and then be observed trotting along behind his master , panting and tired , with his tongue hanging from his unclosed mouth , and those unpoetical animals in the records of our Common Council , denominated  --  hogs , grunted through their long and dreamless slumber , in all the glory of independence and mud . It is an old maxim that something may be learned in whatever situation we are placed . The darkness of a solitary dungeon improves the contemplative disposition , and the mid-day splendor of the city is replete with instruction . The vast and wonderful variety of face and figure which on every side met my view , afforded an amusement for my ramble , of which I did not fail to take advantage . Sometimes brushed by me the smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye ; his new , shining hat , upon a head each particular hair of which possessed its assigned station , like well disciplined soldiers at a military post . In dark contrast behind him dragged the lazy sweep  --  wrapping his dusky mantle around his gloomy form , the personification of a moonless night . The man of broad dimensions waddled before the thin , consumptive , meagre wretch  --  poverty and plenty , emblematic of the rapid vicissitudes of life . Bullies , thinking of thunder and lightning  --  Dandies , thinking of nothing but themselves  --  and fools , thinking of nothing at all , went one after another before my observing sight . Editors , composing extemporaneous editorial articles  --  Players , conning over their half-learned parts  --  Lawyers , calculating what no one but lawyers could calculate  --  and Doctors in rueful , but resigned anticipation of their patient 's demise , passed by , and disappeared like Macbeth 's visions in the regions of Hecate . Now came a crowd of " Noisy children , just let loose from school , " in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  some from the troubles of incomprehensible ancient languages , and lines terrible to scan  --  and other young literary Bonapartes , who " had fought and conquered " whole troops of mathematical problems , who had surmounted obstacles seemingly insurmountable , and labored far up the rugged hill of science in spite of the brambles and shadows with which it so plentifully abounds . Then I beheld the philosopher , in his ordinary habiliments , scrupulously plain , careful to owe no portion of his celebrity to the vanities of dress  --  his brow clouded with a sublime frown , which spoke of crucibles , air-pumps , powerful acids , and electrical machines  --  pacing his steady way , with measured strides  --  all science and severity from head to foot . After him came the poet , in a poetical dress , with short sleeves to his coat , short legs to his pantaloons , and short allowances for his hunger  --  his hat was put back from his forehead in negligent grace  --  there was no awkwardness in his moving attitudes  --  no rose upon his thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered , Byronlike , and brimfull of imagination , and wrapped up in splendid visions , invisible to all but himself  --  through the various multitude he pursued his unerring career " In lofty madness , meditating song , " The richly dressed , fashionable belle dashed by me like a blazing meteor , sparkling and flashing in transitory brightness  --  and in bashful beauty , like some softly-passing dream , followed the sylph-like figure of a charming girl , with eyes cast down in the modesty of merit , and cheeks blushing at the earnest gaze which their loveliness attracted . It passed away from before me like the evanescent hopes of youth , and gave place to a person who monopolized all my attention . It was the short , prim form of a middle-aged , negligently dressed man , who wore an air of drollery , entirely irresistible . As he passed , maiden purity and philosophic sternness lent the tribute of a smile , and the little boys paused from the fascinations of their hoops and marbles to look and laugh . The clouded visage of misfortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary illumination , and in the wildness of my disenthralled fancy , methought the very birds of the air , and the beasts of the field , or , in plain English , the pigeons and the pigs , gave a glance of merry astonishment upon the object of my notice . His coat ( for although he was an author he had a coat ) had once been of handsome black cloth , but its charms had vanished " like fairy gifts fading away "  --  many winters had scattered their snows upon the shoulder-blades and elbows , from the pinnacles of the latter of which peeped something not very white , concerning which I had my own peculiar calculation . The collar , I mean of his coat , for that of his shirt had long since retired to the dignity of private life , beneath the complicated folds of his slovenly cravat  --  by the by , it would be well if some of our political dirty shirt collars would follow its examples  --  I say , the collar of his coat , by long acquaintance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity , had assumed a gloss which was by no means the gloss of novelty , and a dark brown waistcoat was buttoned carelessly around a body that seemed emptier than the head upon which it had depended for support . His pantaloons , " Weak , but intrepid  --  sad , but unsubdued , " were shrivelled tightly over a brace of spindleshanks , withered , weary , and forlorn , that would have put Daddy Longlegs to the blush . Uncleaned pumps covered every part of his feet but the toes , which came forth to enjoy the fresh summer breezes , shoes and stockings to the contrary notwithstanding . A pair of tattered kid gloves , " neat but not gaudy , " fluttered about his hands , so that it would be difficult immediately to discover whether the glove held the hand or the hand the glove . But it was not the dress which gained him so many broad stares and oblique glances , for our city annually receives a great increase of literary inhabitants , but the air  --  the " Je ne sais quoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-importance with holes at the elbow . It was the quintessence of drollery which sat upon his thin , smirking lip  --  which was visible on his crooked , copper-tinged , and snuff-bedaubed organ of smelling , and existed in the small eyes of piercing gray . As I love to study human nature in person , and have always believed the world was the best book to read , I formed a determination to become acquainted with him of the laughable aspect , and proceeded to act in conformity thereto . I was striving to hit upon some plausible method of entering into conversation with him , when fate being in a singularly good humor , took it into her whimsical head to favor my design . As I walked by him near the end of the pavement , when the multitude were by no means so numerous , and their place was supplied by the warbling birds , the bleating lambs , and all those sounds which constitute the melody of country breezes , with a slight inclination of his pericranium he turned towards me and spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour ? " " It is four o'clock , " answered I , " I believe  --  but am not sure ; walk on with me , and we will inquire of yonder gentleman . " " You are excessively good , " said he , with a smile , which gave much more expression to his face  --  " I am afraid I give you an infinite degree of trouble ; you are enjoying rural felicity , poetically correct  --  pray , do not let me interrupt you . " As he spoke the clock struck . " Fortune favors the deserving , " I remarked , as a continuation of the converse so happily commenced . He spoke with more familiarity  --  " Upon my honor , sir , you are very complimentary : if every body thought of me as you do , or at least , if they thought as much of my productions , I flatter myself I should have had a watch for myself . " " I 'll warrant me , " I replied , " many have the means of ascertaining time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it half so well . " " Sir , " said he with a bow , " if you will buckle fortune to my back  --  but you do n't flatter me  --  no , no . My excellent , good friend , you have much more penetration than people in general . Sir , I have been abused  --  vilely , wretchedly , da  --  , but I wo n't swear  --  I do n't follow the fashions so much as to make a fool of myself ; but on the honor of a perfect gentleman , I do assure you , sir , I have been very strangely used , and abused , too . " " I have no doubt , sir , " observed I , " but that your biography would be interesting . " " My biography  --  you 've hit the mark ; I wish I had a biographer  --  a Dunlap , a Boswell , a Virgil , or a Homer  --  he should begin his book with the line  --  " Multum ille et terris , jactatus et alto , Vi superum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the gods to play with . " " Tantne animis coelestibus ir , " said I , willing to humor the pedantry which I already began to discover , " but the race is not always to the swift , nor the battle to the strong . " " Aha ! sir , " he exclaimed with a gentle squeeze of my hand , " I know what you are  --  some kindred spirit  --  one of those kind , high beings who come upon this world like angel visits , few and far between . ' I see it , sir , in your eye , " continued he , with a gesture that might have spurred even Miss Kemble to new exertions . " I see it in your eye  --  charity , benevolence , affection , philosophy , and science . Ah ! my dear sir , I know you are better than the rest of mankind ; you 've done a great deal of good in the world , and will do a great deal more  --  " You portioned maids  --  apprenticed orphans blest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest : Is there a contest ? enter but your door , Balked are the courts , and contest is no more ; Despairing quacks with curses fled the place , And vile attorneys , now a useless race . " " Sir ? " ejaculated I , not very well pleased with this last slash at my beloved profession  --   --  " Or , perhaps , " continued he with increasing rapidity of speech , " you are a lawyer , my dear sir ,  --  the grand path to political glory  --  sweet occupation ; to put out the strong arm , and save drowning innocence ; to hurl the thunderbolt of eloquence against proud and wealthy oppression ; to weave a charm of safety around defenceless beauty ; and catch clumsy , and otherwise unconquerable power in your mazy net of law  --  Pray , sir , can you lend me a shilling ? " I handed him the money , and he turned to be off , when I seized him by the arm , and asked him where he was going ? He laid one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to a tavern , before which hung the sign " Entertainment for Man and Horse . " " My dinner  --  my dinner  --  my dinner ! " said he , " I have n't eaten a particle these three weeks ; poverty and poetry , sir , go arm and arm , sworn friends and companions , through this vale of tears ; one starves the body and the other rarefies the soul  --  my way has been rough and rugged as the Rock-away turnpike road , and misfortune jerks me along as if life went upon badly made cog-wheels . Will you be so kind as to lend me another shilling ? I want a dinner for once in my life  --  beefsteaks and onions , butter , gravy , and potatoes  --  " Hc olim meminisse juvabit . " It will be a grand era in my poetical career . " There was something so exquisitely whimsical in the fellow 's demeanor , that I determined to spend the afternoon in his company . I never shall forget the look and squeeze which he bestowed upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dine together at my expense . He seized hold of my hand , and drew himself up erect in all the enthusiasm of poetic madness  --  " Sir , " said he , informing me that he could not speak , with a rapidity of pronunciation , which reminded me of a horse running away  --  " Sir , Mr. a-a-a  --  my dear , dear friend  --  my tongue falters  --  I ca n't speak  --  I 'm dumb  --  gratitude has shut up the sluices of my heart ; and the cataract of my oratorical powers is dried up  --  pro tem . But it will come directly  --  Stop till I get in the house  --  " Arma virumque cano . " that is to say , I 'll tell you my history ; but just at this moment , " continued he , smacking his lips , and his little eyes dilating with the eager anticipation of epicurean delights , yet to come  --  " just at this crisis , " Oh ! guide me from this horrid scene , These high arched walks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smile , " Let 's run the race  --  he be the winner , Who gets there first , and eats his dinner . " As he spoke , he pulled me forcibly by the arm , and I found myself in a neat , clean room , with the hungry poet fastened close to my side . The conversation which occurred between us , and the history of his literary vicissitudes , must be the subject of the next chapter . CHAPTER II . THE NOVEL . " Now mayors and shrieves all hushed and satiate lay , Yet eat in dreams the custard of the day , While pensive poets painful vigils keep , Sleepless themselves , to give their readers sleep . " Though no spirit is so lofty but that starvation can bend it , yet in the tranquillity of our replenished bodies we are always wicked enough to enjoy the extravagant emotions which agitate authors and other hungry individuals , when by any strange variety of life they happen to get a good dinner . My friend , who had delighted me with his volubility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , than he fell upon his defenceless prize like a lion on his prey . Poetry and prose , fanciful quotations and lofty ideas , for a time were banished from his busy brain . Our conversation , the whole burthen of which had at first been borne by him , was now lost in the superior fascinations of beefsteak and onions ; and a few unintelligible monosyllables , uttered from a mouth crammed full of various articles , were the only attempts made toward an interchange of soul . The enthusiasm of his attack began at length to abate , and the fire of anticipated delight to give way to an expression less anxious and fluctuating . The discomfited steak lay before him mangled and in ruins . The onions shed a fainter perfume from the half-cleared dish  --  and the potatoes were done in the strictest sense of the word . The sated author threw himself back in his chair , and exclaimed , " The deed is done  --  the dinner is eaten  --  Fidus Achates  --  my beloved friend  --  I feel I know not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new confidence to brave the storms of life , or to look back upon the dangers already passed . And now , that I am comparatively composed , and have time to think , you will do me the favor to answer me , what in the name of all that 's beautiful in prose , poetry , or real life , induced you to give this strange conclusion to a hungry day ? " " Because , " I replied , " your face pleased me more than all the others which I saw  --  there was talent and taste in your very dress . " " Ah come , " said he , casting a slight glance upon his well-worn garments , " that wo n't do  --  I am perfectly aware that my external appearance is by no means prepossessing , but what of that ? she must marry me and not my clothes . ' I can not help it , if fate , in her unequal distribution of mutual effects , gives you a pair of breeches whose use is to come  --  and me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what a superior power has done for me . It is the mark of merit to be poor . Homer was poor  --  Johnson was poor  --  and I am poor . Besides , a rich man can not enter into the kingdom of heaven  --  that 's flat . " " If poverty , " said I , " is a passport through the happy gates , then  --  " " Then , " interrupted he , " I should have been there as soon as I commenced my literary life ; for though self-praise is no recommendation , I flatter myself I am as poor as any man in New-York , and what 's more , I confess it  --  I 'm proud of it "  --  " After dinner , " said I. " Oh , you 're a wag  --  but rich or poor , I 've had my hopes and disappointments as well as the rest of mankind . Sunshine and shadow have chased each other over my path  --  and now , by your kindness , I am warming myself in the rays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , I do assure you , to find the true feeling of generosity  --  the real , genuine virtue , cleansed from the ore of vanity and ostentation , and so unlike the pompous charity of the common world , " Not to the skies in useless columns tost , Or in proud falls magnificently lost , But clear and artless pouring through the plain , Health to the sick and solace to the swain . " " You are the man of my mind , and to you I will speak my sorrows , although my parched lips almost refuse them utterance "  --  and he cast a sidelong glance at an empty bottle which stood near us on a table . I took the hint , and called for some wine . He swallowed a glass full , smacked his lips , and assuming a serious and important air , thus commenced the narrative of his literary horrors : " Sir , my name is William Lackwit , Esquire . I am an author , whose greatest failure has been in not getting his works into notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions in its lethean stream  --  and fate , I do sincerely believe , has been trying upon me some philosophical experiment , to see how many privations human nature could bear . I have been tossed about , sir , like a juggler 's ball  --  and in all the poetical labyrinths in which I have been lost , memory can not behold One solitary resting place , Nor bring me back one branch of grace . " I was cast upon the world when about seventeen years of age , and possessing a vast share of vanity , which , by the by , is the staff of an author 's life , I determined to write for a living . Animated by the fame of great men who had lived before me , I plunged deeply into literary madness , and fell a victim to the present prevailing epidemic , the cacoethes scribendi , which is now sweeping many young gentlemen from professional existence . I wrote for the newspapers , but made no noise  --  heard no approbation  --  and last but not least , ' received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaisant friend would laud the little offsprings of my pen ; but it did not gain me bread and butter , and could not satisfy the cravings of hungry nature . With a full heart and an empty stomach , I relinquished my attempt , and bade farewell to my sweet lyre , in a manner that , I thought , could not fail of attracting universal sympathy . I walked out the next morning , expecting to meet many a softened heart and friendly hand , but the bell-man heaved his unaltered cry as he did the day before ; the carts rattled along with their usual thundering rapidity ; the busy crowd shuffled by me as if I was not in existence ; and the sun shone upon the earth , and the changing clouds floated through the air , exactly as they were wont to do before I determined to shed no more music upon an unfeeling world . " At length I recovered from my disappointment , and issued a little paper of my own ; but it dropped dead from the press , as silently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration followed me as I went ; no pretty black-eyed girl whispered that 's he ' as I passed ; and if any applause was elicited by my effort , it was so still , and so slily managed , that one would scarcely have supposed it was there . " Something must be done , thought I  --  while the great reward of literary fame played far off before my imagination , a glorious prize , to reach which no exertion would be too great  --  I walked to my little room , where a remnant of my family 's possessions enabled me to keep my chin above the ocean of life . In the solitary silence of my tattered and ill-furnished apartment , I sat me down upon a broken bench , and lost myself in rumination sad ' as to what course I should next pursue . Suddenly , and like a flash of lightning , an idea struck me with almost force enough to knock me down  --  I 'll write a novel  --  I 'll take the public whether they will or not  --  fortuna favet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I 'll go to fame . I do n't wonder that I did not succeed before . The public want something sublime , and I 'll give it to them wholesale . I 'll come upon them by surprise ; I 'll combine the beauties of Addison with the satire of Swift , Goldsmith 's sweetness and Pope 's fire . I 'll have darkness and storm , battle , treachery , murder , thunder , and lightning : it must take . The author of a novel like this will make an immense fortune . Old ivy-grown castles , moonlight landscapes , Spanish feathers , and Italian serenades , floated in brilliant confusion through my enamoured fancy . Daggers and despair , eloquence , passion , and fire , mingled in a delightful cloud of imagination , and heaved and changed in the dim and dreary distance like a magnificent vision of enchantment , which only wanted the breath of my genius to fan it into shape and exquisite beauty . " At it I went , tooth and nail , ' and watched over my young offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradle that contains her only boy . Already I began to hold up my head , and think how differently people would look at me if they only knew who I was , and what I was about to do . The splendid dresses , the ten dollar beaver hats turned upside in a basin of water , the handsome canes , and polished Wellington boots , which daily obtruded themselves upon my eager eye , as if in mockery of my miserable apparel , I began to look upon as objects already my own . Was I thirsty and hungry while musing on the variety of macaronies and cream-tarts , cocoanut-cakes and coffee , in a confectioner 's shop ? Only wait , ' thought I to myself , only wait till I get out my new novel . ' Was my coat threadbare and my hat old , only wait for my new novel . Did a coach and four dash by me , footman taking his ease behind , and driver with new hat and white top boots ? Drive away , coachee , thought I , drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extreme impatience kept me on pins and needles till my work was done . ' T was indeed a consummation devoutly to be wished . ' A kind of restless anticipation kept me in continual excitement till the development of my greatness , or what was the same thing , the publication of my work . " At length it was finished , and off it went , two volumes duodecimo , with a modest blue cover , and its name on the back . Long enough , thought I , have I labored in obscurity , but now  --  I pulled up my collar ( it was a long time ago ) and walked majestically along in all the pride of greatness incog . " Alas ! alas ! ' t was but a dagger of the mind . It dazzled for a moment before my enraptured sight , and left me again to descend into the nothingness from which , in fancy , I had risen . Although it was printed and published , with a preface artfully acknowledging it to be unworthy public patronage ; although I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " " An author 's opinion of his own works , expressed in a daily paper , by himself or his friends , " I answered . " Right , " continued he , " although I wrote a puff myself , informing the public that rumors were afloat that the new novel , which created such a sensation both abroad and at home , was from the well-known pen of the celebrated William Lackwit , Esq. , poet , editor , orator , and author in general  --  although I paid the editor of one of our most fashionable evening papers six shillings for reading it himself , and six and sixpence for recommending it to the perusal of his subscribers , credat Judoeus appellas '  --  it went dead , ' as the Irishman says ; a newspaper squib , a little pop-gun of a thing , first brought it into disrepute , and a few would-be critics ridiculed it to death . Herbert and Rogers , merchant tailors , lost a customer and I a fortune , and my unhappy book was used to carry greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took more care of their stomachs than of their heads , and liked meat better than mind . Oh ! that ever I was an author : oh ! that ever I panted after literary fame . I have chased the rainbow reputation over crag and cliff . I have waded through rivers of distress , and braved storms of poverty and scorn , to get one grasp at the beautiful vision ; and though I see it yet , as lovely and as bright as ever , yet still it is as cheating , and still as far from my reach . My next trial was of a higher nature , which , after we have again partaken of your excellent Madeira , I will relate to you "  --  And he proceeded to describe that which I shall lay before the indulgent reader in the next chapter . CHAPTER III . THE PLAY . " Fierce champion , Fortitude , that knows no fears Of hisses , blows , or want , or loss of ears ; Calm Temperance , whose blessings those partake , Who hunger and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded in his story , gathering new animation as he recapitulated the battles which he had fought , and the victories which he might have won . " For a long time , sir , after the melancholy catastrophe of my novel , I was completely discouraged . I felt an indifference towards the world . I had soared so high upon the wings of hope that the fall almost broke my heart ; but soon the disappointment began to lose its bitterness , and I received a consolation ( which , wicked as it was , I could not repress ) in discovering that hundreds of unsuccessful authors were exactly in my condition : then I remembered that as great fame , once acquired , would be everlasting , I could not expect to acquire it without immense trouble and assiduous application . Gradually I shook off the hateful fetters of gloomy despair , and , like some deluded slave , to a false woman 's charms , I allowed cheating hope to lead me captive again . My brain began to effervesce with exuberance of imagination , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question : I had manufactured one , and if the public did not like it , they might let it alone ; and so they did  --  the more shame for them . " I felt as proud as Lucifer in my defeat , and was resolved never to compliment with another the world who had used my last so villanously . No , thought I , I 'll write a play , and give Shakspeare and Otway a little rest . If I can not get in the great temple one way , I 'll try another ; and , with increasing avidity , I went at it again . It was not long before I began to entertain the idea that my mind was peculiarly adapted for dramatic writing . I was not formed to wade through the dull drudgery of novel descriptions  --  to expatiate upon little rivulets , tinkling among big rocks  --  and amorous breezes making love to sentimental green trees . In my present avocation , the azure heavens , the frowning mountain , the broad ocean , the shadowy forest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painter 's care : skies would be manufactured to give light to my heroes , and cities would sprout up , in which they could act their adventures . My play would present a great field for triumph , and young , blushing Merit , and neglected Worth , ' must be seen , and consequently admired . Now would the embodied visions of my fancy go to the hearts of the public through their ears , as well as their eyes , and genius would wing its sparkling way amid the thundering acclamations of thousands of admiring spectators . Now , ' said I to myself , I have the eel of glory by the tail , and it shall not escape me , slippery as it is . ' " With a perseverance which elicited praise from myself , if from nobody else , I mounted my Pegasus , and jogged along this newly discovered road to immortality . The external and common world melted from my mind when I sat down to my task , and , although it was evanescent as poets ' pleasures generally are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tattered trappings of my poor garret seemed dipped in the enchanting magnificence of my dreams , and I rioted in visions of white paper snow-storms , and dramatic thunder and lightning . I sought every opportunity for stage effect  --  to have trap-doors and dungeons , unexpected assassinations , and resurrections more unexpected still . " My undertaking seemed very easy at first , but I soon found myself bewildered amid difficulties seriously alarming . At one time I brought a whole army of soldiers on the stage , and made them fight a prodigious battle , without discovering , till half the poor fellows were slain , that the whole affair had taken place in a lady 's chamber ! This was easily remedied , but I experienced infinitely more trouble with the next . I had formed a hero , in whom were concentrated all the virtues , beauties , and accomplishments of human kind : a real Sir William Wallace  --  gigantic in person and mind  --  who never opened his lips but to speak blank verse  --  who did not know that there was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could put a whole army to flight by just offering to draw his sword . It was my design artfully to lead him into the greatest extremes of danger , and then artfully to lead him out again ; but , in the paroxysm of my enthusiasm , I at length got him into a scrape from which no human power could possibly extricate him . " His enemies , determined not to give so terrible a fellow the slightest chance of escape , had confined him in a tremendous dungeon , deep , and walled around on all sides , by lofty rocks and mountains totally impenetrable . To this dreadful abode there was only one little entrance , which was strictly guarded by a band of soldiers , who were ordered never to take their eyes off the door , and always to keep their guns cocked . Now here was a predicament , and I knew not what to do . The whole of the preceding was so beautifully managed , that to cut it out would be impossible . Yet there he was , poor youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among everlasting mountains , beneath which Atlas himself might have groaned in vain . What was I to do ? He must be released . The audience would expect it , as a common civility , that I would not murder him before their eyes . It would have been ungenteel to a degree . At length I hit it , after having conceived almost inconceivable plans , and vainly attempted to manage ponderous ideas which were too heavy for my use . I proposed to introduce a ghost  --  a spirit , which would at once please the pit , and be a powerful friend to the imprisoned soldier . " At the dead of the night , when he sat ruminating on the vicissitudes of life , and spouting extemporaneous blank-verse soliloquies , ( at which I had spent many midnight hours , ) the genius of the mountain comes down in a thunder cloud , and thus addresses the pensive hero . You will be pleased to observe the rude and natural dignity of language , which it was a great point with me to preserve . Genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping . Hero , ( laying his hand upon his sword . ) Who says he e'er saw Bamaloosa weep ? Gen. Nay , hold thy tongue , and shut thy wide-oped jaw : I come to save thee , if thou wilt be saved . Hero . I will not perish , if I help it can ; But who will cleave these cursed rocks apart , And give me leave to leave this cursed place , Where lizards crawl athwart my sinking flesh , And bullfrogs jump , and toads do leap about ? Gen. I  --  I can do whate'er I have a mind : I am the genius of this lonesome place , And I do think you might more manners have , Than thus to speak to him that is your host . Hero . If thou art really what thou seem'st to be , Just let me out of this infernal hole . Oh ! my dear fellow , take me hence away  --  My soul 's in arms , impatient for the fray ! ' Take me from deeds I 've often thought upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alliteration in the last line melts the tender heart of the genius : he waves his hand in the air ; his cloudy throne streams thunder and lightning from every side ; instantaneously a convulsion ensues ; the stage becomes the scene of general conflagration ; a number of small imps , and little devils , fiery-breathed dragons , and red-nosed salamanders , are seen sporting about in the confusion , till the whole explodes , and out walks my man through a prodigious crack in the mountain , which heals up after him as he goes along . The consternation of the guards may be imagined , but unless I had the MS. here , I could not attempt to describe it . " At length it was written , rehearsed , and advertised , and its name , in great capitals , stared from every brick wall and wooden fence in the city . " Delightful anticipations of immortality began to throng upon my mind , and I could almost hear the various theatre cries of bravo , ' encore , ' and author . ' With some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be spoken when I should be called out , and practised bowing before a looking-glass with great success . Indeed , by the time the evening of representation arrived , I was prepared for every triumph which fate could have in store for me ; and I had vowed an unalterable determination not to lose my firmness of mind in the heaviest flood of prosperity that could possibly pour in upon me . " The evening arrived  --  a fine , cool , moonlight night . The stars twinkled upon me as I hastened to the theatre , as if congratulating me from their lofty stations in the sky , and the most refreshing breezes played around my head , methought , whispering soft nonsense in my ear . I walked with a proud step to the door , entered majestically , and took my seat modestly . " The house was already thronged with ladies and gentlemen , with their various appendages of quizzing-glasses and bamboo canes ; and frequent murmurs of impatience buzzed around , by which I felt extremely flattered . The end of my troubles seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her adamantine tablet , had already written William Lackwit , Esquire , Author in general , ' in letters too indelible for time itself to erase . Fear faded away in the dazzling brilliancy of that smiling multitude , and my soul floated about in its delicious element of triumphant hope , with a sensation such as arises after a good dose of exhilarating gas . " Alas ! ' t was but a dream ! ' I soon perceived that fortune frowned on my efforts , and had taken the most undisguised method of blasting my hopes . A most diabolical influenza had for some time raged in the city , which on this very evening seemed at its height . A convulsion of coughing kept the whole audience in incessant confusion ; and with the most harrowing apprehensions , I listened to noises of every description , from the faint , sneeze-like effusion of some little girl 's throat , to the deeptoned and far-sounding bellow of the portly alderman . Besides this , I had the pleasure to observe some of my most devoted enemies scattered , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenfold blackness upon the scene , and apparently waiting in composed hatred , an opportunity to give me the goose . ' Meditation raged high , as I observed these significant and threatening appearances , and I could scarcely have been in greater trepidation if I had been attacked with hydrophobia itself . " The curtain rose soon , and my first characters appeared ; but , fire and fury ! I did not recognize them myself ! " The play proceeded , and a scene ensued which gentlest moderation might denominate murder , most foul . ' My dear sir , you can have no idea of it . They had cut out my most beautiful sentiments . The very identical remarks which I had intended should bring the house down , were gone , and left not a trace behind . ' One recited a speech which was intended to have been spoken by another , and he spouted one that should not have been spoken at all . My finest specimens of rhetoric failed , from their clumsy manner of delivery , and all my wit missed fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pack of wild bulls in a garden of flowers , breaking rudely over all those delicate bushes of poetry , and trampling down the sweetest roses in the field of literature . The prettily turned expressions , which should have been carefully breathed upon the audience , with a softened voice and pensive eye , were bawled out in an unvaried , monotonous tone of voice , and a face as passionless as a barber 's block . The whole play was destroyed . " There was nip , and snip , and cut , and slish , and slash , ' till the first act ended , and then was a slight hiss . Cold drops of sweat stood on my trembling flesh ; ' but I pulled my hat fiercely over my beating brow , and , angry and desperate , prepared for the brooding storm . On my mountain scene I laid my principal dependence ; and if that failed me , then welcome despair . ' At last it came : there was the dungeon and a man in it , with a wig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a face sublimely cut and slashed over with a piece of coal . Instead of the beautiful countenance which had gleamed upon me in my poetic vision , there was a thin , hump-backed little fellow , with a tremendous pair of red whiskers , and a pug nose ! My fac-simile of Sir William Wallace with red whiskers and a pug nose ! ! Sir , it threw me into one of the most violent fevers I ever had . Besides all these , his face was dirty , and his hands unwashed ; ' and he proceeded to give such a bombastic flourish of his arm , and his voice rose to such a high pitch , that he was hailed with loud laughter , and shouts of Make a bow , Johnny  --  make a bow , ' till my head reeled in delirious despair . " But the language and stage effect might redeem the errors of the actor , and I remained in a delightful agony for the result . Lazy time at length brought it upon the stage ; but oh , ye gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and genius were floating gracefully down , one of the ropes cracked , and the enchanter of the cavern hurt his nose against the floor , notwithstanding a huge pair of gilt pasteboard wings , which spread themselves at his shoulders . He got up , however , and went on till the explosion was to have taken place : then he waved his wand , with an air which was not intended to have been resisted ; but , miserabile dictu ! the crack would not open , and Bamaloosa trotted off by one of the side-scenes , amidst hoots of derision from every part of the house . " The green curtain fell . A universal hiss , from the many-headed monster of the pit , ' rung heavily in my ears . I had seen my poor play murdered and damned in one night , and it was enough to quench all future hopes of literary eminence . I rushed , desperate , from the spot , not choosing to stay for the farce ; and , in the confusion of unsuccessful genius , I kicked two little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . " In the anguish of my disappointment , I dreamed a combination of every thing horrible , to tantalize and terrify my poor , tired brain ; and I arose with a head-ach and a heart-ach , and no very great opinion of any one in the world , but myself . " You have convinced me that generosity has not taken French leave of every bosom , and I shall always look back upon the moments I have spent with you as bright exceptions to those of my past life . And , now , " continued he , pocketing the remaining bone , putting a couple of potatoes in his bosom , and taking a long draught of wine  --  " and now , I trust , we are square : you have provided me a dinner , and I have treated you to a feast of reason and a flow of soul . ' If I see you again , I shall remember you were bountiful ; ' if not , God bless you and yours . " He gave me a hearty shake by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of his figure as he passed the window  --  and saw the poor author no more . Back matter
