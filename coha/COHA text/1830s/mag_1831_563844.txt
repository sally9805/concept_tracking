txt To a person that arrives in the city of Charleston on a moonlight eve** fling of March or April , it seems that he has never seen or imagined so delicious a place . He will walk delighted though spacious streets , lined with the Pride of India ; he will see the multiflora rose , with its clusters of a hundred flowers , clasping pillars and balconies ; and he will breathe an air , perfumed with the blossoms of the orange and jessamine . He will see the dark green laurel shoot up its pyramidal form , covered with large glossy leaves , and studded with huge flowers of a delicate white ;  --  and he can not fail to admire the slender palmetto , shaped like an enormous umbrella , with a straight shaft of sixty feet , and a cluster of hanging leaves at the top . The stranger will see in Charleston not only colonnades , piazzas , and domes , with other parts of good architecture , but he will find many trees and gardens , without which the best edifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see , without a telescope , more beauties in the moon , than he could ever discover through a tube , in the latitude of forty-two degrees . Charleston , like Melrose , is seen to the best advantage only by the " pale moonlight . " It will , however , well compensate one for the loss of slumber , to see the sun rise from the ocean , dispersing the fogs , illuminating the higher vapors , and " trailing clouds of glory . " In the morning let the traveler go to the niarket-house , to see the productions of the South . He will find few portly butchers with red faces and white frocks , and of personal dimensions that speak well for their merchandize ; and he will not , as he walks down the market , pass through regions of different provisions , as he would of plants , in ascending from Vera Cruz to Xalapa ; for the beef is not kept apart from the mutton , nor the pork from both , nor the vegetables from all , as in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) called Quincy Hall . The priests , that slay the victims for these altars , in Charleston , are mostly of African descent , in whom the white apron and the glossy skin of the wearer mutually set off each other , like ebony inlaid with ivory . There is no lack of supplies to furnish forth a feast , and the array of fruits is tempting . The fruits as well as poultry , ( which is manacled in pitirs ) are sold by negro and mulatto females , whose gay turbans of Madras , and whose manner of sitting beside their merchandize , has a very Turkish appearance . There are oranges , the growth of Carolina , and the earth produces few larger or better ; there are clusters of bananas , weighing twenty pounds ; there are cocoa-nuts , figs , peaches , melons of vast dimensions , cones of lemons , and pyramids of yams . In the vicinity of the market are hundreds of large , sable , baldheaded birds , bearing the respectable compound name of Turkey-Buzzards , and enjoying an exterior particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance to Judge Barleycorn . The buzzard was reconnoitering , from the ridge pole , a shin bone , which he often turned his head to look at alternately with each eye , as I have often seen his Honor turn first one ear and then the other , to the words of the counsel . Nature , however , had furnished him with ears upon a bountiful scale . The buzzards are protected by law , and , in requital , make // themselves useful in the capacity of scavengers . Nothing escapes them ; they scent their food afar off ; and , to say truth , they may he found themselves at some distance in a similar manner . I had once killed an old alligator , nine feet in length , and had him flayed upon the spot . When the skin was taken off , there was no bird in sight but a garrulous mocking-bird upon a cypress stump ; yet we had not left the ground before there were seventy buzzards , rank and file , pressing to the banquet ; and in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an alligator that you would see in riding fifty miles , even in Alabama , where the fences are made of them . The gait of the buzzard is like the short hop of the bull-frog , and reminded me of a dancing school I once attended in Vermont . In Charleston , the stranger will not fail to remark , that he is in a country , where the negro , if not at home , is yet so much better fed , clothed , and conditioned than in New-York , that he seems to be well at ease , and comfortable , if not rising in the world . The stranger may not indeed praise the principle upon which the negro renders his labor , but he must admit , that the evils of slavery are softened by humane treatment . He will remember , too , that the evil is like the gout , one of inheritance , and that there is now no remedy . Among the people of Charleston are found many of almost every European nation , and the French society is very respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy , frequent swarms from the " northern hive . " These are called Yankees , and if they do not often rise to the highest dignities of the State , they receive , in the professions and otherwise , an equivalent for any denied political honors . This race of men is so well known to you , that 1 will spare you the description , and perhaps I could not describe them acceptably without a little flattery . They bear , as all New-England does , the impress of Franklin . The philosopher of thrift has done much to stamp upon his countrymen the principles of his own frugality , and where the seeds of his philosophy have fallen upon flinty ground , they have made the miser more avaricious , and the churl more niggardly . The Carolinian is widely different from the Yankee , but I know not that he is better . If he have not our faults , he may not be the possessor of all our virtues . I did not remain in his country long enough to see many of his faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few that appear in his conduct to his friends , though he is held to be rather intractable to his enemies . He has , in his carriage and feelings , something of the Don ; yet he is republican , and would not exact from another what he would be unwilling to render in return . Be generous and confiding , and he will out-do you in generosity and confidence ; be passionate and pugnacious , and he would have the less estimable victory there . He is not apt to give offence , for he is courteous , nor will he receive a provocation , without stronger remonstrance than men are accustomed to make in New-England . He will peril life for a word , but will fight no longer for principle than the northern race that I have mentioned . His faults are those of his institutions , his virtues are his own , and they have my undivided admiration . In the city he lives like a modera and a gentleman , among his peers ; in the country , he lives like a gentleman , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is entrusted with everything relating to the happiness and welfare of hundreds // of his fellow men , who are not indeed convicts , but are yet " guilty of a skin not colored like his own . " In administering justice he is prompt ; for he unites in his own person the powers of judge , jury , attorney-general , and sheriff ; generally speaking , however , he abuses no trust reposed in him by any of these incompatible relations . He has grown up among his slaves ; many of them have that tenacious hold upon his heart that comes from early companionship as playmates , and some of them are his foster-brothers . " We twa hae paidlet in the burn , Frae mornin ' sun till dine . " I have never seen elsewhere , and I fear I never shall , such an outgushing of affection as I have seen on the arrival of " young master " or mistress . I have even had a share of it myself in my relation of cousin to the young heir apparent . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was patted , petted , and thrice blessed . This is a feeling that you can hardly conceive in New-England , for it can not subsist between a man and his cattle ; but in Carolina it raised my estimation of the master and sympathy for the slave . The slave has nearly all the African good qualities , and his faults may be attributed to his circumstances , and the institutions that have " reduced his soul to his condition . " The worst of his traits are deceit and cunning ; but his is a life of unremitted and unrequited toil , and it is a natural impulse to avoid his task by deceiving his overseer . But he is kind and cheerful and he is never better pleased than when he can contribute to the pleasure of a white man . In riding , I have often known boys of fifteen and upwards run by my side for miles to open the gates , and the happiness of any negro is complete when he is permitted " to take his pleasure , " that is , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old women who are left in charge of the huts will offer yams and ground-nuts with as much pleasure as it gives a hungry traveler to receive them . It is on his plantation that the planter is the best known . He is there independent of all modes and circumstances , " as free as Nature first made man , " and more powerful than it is safe for men to be ,  - -  having little restraint upon his will but that of his prudence or his sense of justice . In New-England and other " foreign parts , " he may sometimes have an air of constraint , for he is " Lofty and sour to those that love him not , But to all such as seek him sweet as summer . " Yet in his own cotton-field he is himself , and what you see of him there you may consider ( as we say ) genuine . If you are his guest , he tells you that his plantation is your own , and while you remain it is such , in all things but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or take too much of the choice old wines , or curse the tariff too roundly . On this subject he can swear too , " with good emphasis , " and as he believes , " with good discretion . " I am myself no friend to the provisions of that celebrated paper , and I deprecate the dissensions that it causes to rage ; but I can not , while I wish a modification , consider it the sole occasion of the present depression of property in South Carolina . Were it now repealed , perhaps the Carolinians would be serprised that all things would not ensue to their own advantage . The // planter is impoverished , and he feels it deeply , for poverty is to none so irksome , as to the proud and generous , or to those who have once been rich . He sees in New-England neat villages , flourishing farms , and a gainful employment of machinery ; he contrasts these with the state of his own district , and is willing to attribute the difference to the tariff , as Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad and sorrowful union . " A year 's residence in a New-England village would give him , on these points , some useful intelligence . He would then see that every one toils ; the sons plough , the daughters spin , and few are idle but those who are contented to be poor . The system of economy is as rigid as that of toil ; and few of these sons of frugality will lightly part with what was slowly and hardly won ; whereas the Carolinians , ( I speak it not unkindly , for I love them , and , alas ! I imitate them , ) open their purses as wide as their hearts , and reverse the more economical practice of spending a shilling out of a dollar ; for they often contrive to take the greater quantity from the less . There are not , in Carolina , many corporations ,  --  those profitable associations , where capital may be safely invested to increase without the care of the holder . In New-England a man may put a hundred dollars in a bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance company , or a mill-dam , and thus blend his private advantage with the public good . Thus interest becomes a powerful ally to patriotism , for a man never pursues so zealously the good of the public , a when at the same time he follows that of the individual . It would be a lesson for a Carolinian to be present at a council at a farmer 's fireside , on the profitable investment of twenty dollars . To spend a sum so enormous is seldom within the verge of thought , and where to place it is slowly and safely decided . The planter is not aware , that the greater number of proprietors who dress New-England like a garden , whose farms he admires , and whose lot he almost envies , do not possess more than two or three thousand dollars , the product of a life of toil , and close economy , and hardly what even a small planter scatters in a year , or at most in two years . " But what is this new " doctrine , " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well worth the care of every citizen , to endeavor to allay , in his own circle , the rancor that is corroding the vitals of the republic . There are no relations in private life , in which the par . ties are not required to make mutual concessions . Even in families , there could be no peace without them . If a spirit of conciliation , of compromise , and of mutual concession , be so indispensible in private life , who is there that will not admit the necessity of it in public relations ? Shall there be no compromise of interests or feelings to preserve the Union ? Is it even certain that there may not be reasonable grounds for the tenets of both parties , when several of the best and most intelligent men of the country , have , in turn , conscientiously held the doctrines of each party ? The people of Carolina are not lightly to be accused of want of patriotism or devotion to the common country . They are now in a state of great excitement ; and their spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina is to be found in the scenes of the revo // lution , where she poured out her best blood , as a thing of no value , compared with freedom and independence . This is no place for politics , and I therefore repress my opinions . But be the present position of Carolina right or wrong-it is not al .. ways asserted in the proper spirit , nor has it been resisted in a better manner . All parties are exasperated , and , of course , are more disposed to extremes . But in Carolina the state of society affords great facilities , by which political excitements may be raised and extended . The people are themselves ardent and easily excited . They are , to a great degree , social and convivial , and in the whole state few gentlemen of standing are unknown to each other , while , in New-England , many are unacquainted in the same city . A common visiting distance for dinner is twenty miles ; and , at the races , all Carolina comes up to Charleston , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form closer fellowships in New-England , the West , or Europe in their periodical migrations . Thus it may happen that a man of convivial qualities , a person of high standing as an honorable man , such for instance as Governor Hamilton , may acquire an influence and a popularity that may not be had by a cooler and better statesman , who is personally less favorably known to his constituents . You have restricted me in space , and I have limited myself in time . My sketches may be inaccurate , for I was in Carolina but two months during the last winter . In another number I may send you something concerning Virginia , for I lived in the Old Dominion three years .

The national morale has been so far corrupted , that talents , intelligence , public services , and unimpeachable rectitude of character , are no longer considered as the distinctive qualifications for office , in competition with partizan zeal , unprincipled devotion to men , and the debasing intrigues of the demagogue . It is not asked ,  --  Is he honest , is he capable , is he faithful to the constitution ? but , Is he a clamorous , a reckless and a boisterous champion of faction ?

It is incompatible with the enjoyment of civil liberty , has prematurely shaken the foundations of the republic , and threatens the speedy prostration of that magnificent structure . Will not measures be adopted to prevent such disastrous consequences ? Are the prudential lessons of our revolutionary worthies to be thus soon disregarded ? Is the 36 // patriarchal advice of Washington to be lost upon his countrymen ? Is the experience of ages to have no influence ?

The career of commendable ambition has been converted into a political arena , by the profligate competitors for place . The aspirants for public distinction , instead of mounting the Olympian chariot , as rival conservators of the public weal , and contending for the prize of immortality , we behold descending to the humiliating condition of purchased gladiators , or the degraded slaves of faction , and furiously struggling for personal reward , rather than the glory of their country , and the reguerdon of patriotism . An epoch has been reached , from whence the ruin or regeneration of our republican institutions must be dated . It depends upon the virtues and intelligence of the people , whether the future destinies of their country shall be adverse or propitious . At such a momentous crisis , the generous co-operation of steadfast patriots , under the instruction and guidance of the most illustrious statesmen , is of more vital consequence than victories in the field , when discords shall have assumed the attitude of civil war . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when peace shall be restored , who can foretell , whether it be to many independent nations , or to this unsevered and united republic . This is the moment for cool deliberation , harmonious concert , and vigorous action . Prejudices are to be conquered , sectional exasperations appeased , and turbulent excitements quelled , by an appeal to the understanding rather than to arms . Principles are to be supporte ( l by argument , the errors of angry partizans corrected by the influence of reason , treasonable combinations discountenanced by the frowns of loyalty , and the rash threats of insurrection silenced by the stern voice of public disapprobation . In times of civil commotion , the precepts of wisdom and the warnings of experience come with a most cheering influence . Impassioned declamation being opposed by intelligent appeals to the understanding , and the absurdities of sophistry by the inductions of reason , we may be assured that rebellious denunciations will be lost in the animating shouts of " Independence and Union forever , " and tranquillity be again restored throughout the land . The real friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , and their zealous disciples , must come forth in the majesty of their strength , and boldly confront the desperate leaders of disorganization . No man , who is capable of rendering assistance , can remain inactive without a gross dereliction of duty . He can not avoid participating in the conflict , which rages with such alarming violence , without being considered traitorous to his country . The services of every citizen , who values the blessings he has long enjoyed , are imperiously required . It matters not how indifferent he may have been to stations *f honor and confidence ,  --  how regardless of the res // peotful attentions of his countrymen ,  --  how confident in the stability of the Union ,  --  how obtuse to the apprehensions of danger .

But he must no longer be governed by such consolatory , yet delusive considerations ; he must be roused to a vivid conception of the actual position , in which he is now placed ; he must be animated by more stirring and exalted sentiments ; he must act from a profound respect for that government which has been the wonder and admiration of the world ; he must evince a pure and holy reverence for those rights which are the acquisitions of adventurous independence and sanguinary conflict . The tranquil pursuits of retirement must be abandoned for the energetic duties of the ardent patriot . Emulating the examples of seventyfive , he must offer up his services on the altar of liberty . Appealing to those , who are acquainted with the impressive history of these United States , from the period of their individual existence , how natural , yet how painful is this inquiry : Could you have anticipated such a sudden and wide deviation from the virtuous course of your forefathers , such an entire abandonment of the fundamental principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prescribed orbit of national glory ? Was there an original and radical defect in the organization of the government , to which such flagitious consequences may be attributable ? This can not be alleged , with the least semblance of truth ; but rather , let it be acknowledged , with compunctious sincerity , that the age is in fault ; that there has been a lamentable degeneration from that sublime political morality , which characterized our ancestors ; that we must go back to the days of primitive purity and excellence , and be imbued with that holy spirit of independence , by which the adventurous founders of this western empire were inspired , and by whose influence their gallant and zealous descendants were enabled to throw off the yoke of foreign domination . Let us then hasten to read , with renovated interest and astonishment , of the personal sacrifices of the pilgrims , of the causes which induced their bold and hazardous emigration , of their unwavering fidel-. ity in periods of the greatest peril , of their firm adherence to the axioms of eternal justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubted confidence in ultimate success ; let us once more dwell , with increased pride and admiration , on their deeds of enterprize and valor , their constant , uniform and uncompromising opposition to arbitrary encroachments , during the long and onerous cycle of colonial dependence ; let us again endeavor to realize that lofty tone of thought and noble bearing , for which the sages and soldiers of the revolution were distinguished , and exult in their triumphant achievements . Having been excited by these glowing and instructive reminiscences , we may duly appreciate what has been acquired , what there is to cherish , what to correct , what to defend , and what are the demands upon us , by the present and all future generations ,  --  by oppressed and persecuted man throughout the globe ; for to this country the eyes of the // whole human race are directed . Encouraged by the example here presented , the people of all civilized nations have evinced a determination to retrieve their long lost liberties , and to establish representative republics on the ruins of despotism . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain that exalted character and station which it has so early and so justly acquired ; and how responsible is every citizen for the great trust which has been confided to him by the constitution and the law ! He is under the most solemn obligations to qualify himself to discharge his public duties with fidelity and ability ; it is therefore indispensable that he should be thoroughly instructed on all subjects connected with the theory and practical operations of the government , and so fully capable of deciding upon the requisite qualifications of the legislator and statesman , as never to disgrace himself or dishonor the country , by impolitic selections . He must be so circumspect in the bestowal of confidence , and so armed in honesty , as not to be deceived by the specious promises of the ambitious , the zeal of the factious , or the assumed gravity of the incompetent and venal ; but , with wary investigation , test the talents and integrity of all candidates for office ; be cautious that precedent does not sanction error , or innovation be hallowed by prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no other mode , by which private happiness and public prosperity can be promoted , than the universal dissemination of intelligence ; it is our only reliance  --  the rock of our political salvation . There can be no confidence in the continued purity and stability of the government , unless information shall be as generally extended as the rights of suffrage . All our advances in civilization , all the ameliorations which have been effected , beyond the condition of regal subjects , are the result of moral and intellectual instruction . In proportion as the faculties of the mind have been cultivated , the virtues of the heart developed , and the genial precepts of Christianity cherished and diffused , have the bounds of civil and religious freedom been enlarged . From these considerations , how evident is the conclusion , that the citizens of the United States should receive , not merely a literary and scientific but a political education , in the most expansive signification of that term . They are the source of all power , the absolute sovereigns , the creators of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for their own especial benefit , they established an unprecedented system of government , under which they are at all times in the full enjoyment of equal rights ; and while they alternately fill the stations of rulers and subjects , they reserve to themselves , exclusively , the supreme and indefeasible authority of prescribing the limits of the former and the duties of the latter . Such a novel organization of a republic pre-supposes an enlightened population ; and a retrogradation in morals and education is fatal to its existence . In them is placed the conservative principle of this anomalous experiment to elevate the character of man , and place him beyond the possibility of future degradation . If it should fail , it will not be from the imperfection of the theory , but the criminal negligence of the people , who are charged with its execution . Each and all being deeply interested , can it be possible , that the requisite means should not be efficiently applied , for insuring success ? The difficulties which are to be encountered // may be learned from history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall of other nations , which have vainly attempted to establish just , equal and free governments , should be profoundly investigated , that we may avoid the calamities which they suffered . Such retrospective inquiries are not urged for the mere purpose of theoretical speculation , but for practical appliance and substantial utility . As past ages are the admonitors of the present and the future , we must appeal to them for the stern lessons of experience ; and when contrasting the condition of man and of nations , at different epochs , in various climes , and under every form of government , with that here presented , how satisfactory is the result , how favorable to our hopes , how encouraging to our efforts ! But there must be no lack of vigilance , no want of activity , no relaxation of measures . Our duties as citizens , and the great interests of the country , must be the constant objects of meditation . While watching with eager gaze the progress of events in distant realms , where the wars of freedom and despotism are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probabilities of victory or defeat , on either side , with what deep solicitude should we revert to the peculiar position of our own country ! so admirable in the estimation of the liberal in foreign nations , and so peril . ous in aspect to its faithful citizens . If it is interesting and instructive to trace the phenomena of physical effects to their remote and recondite cause , and most useful to seek in principle , for the test and corrective of moral delinquency , how vastly more important is it , that we should be well versed in the history of our political institutions ,  --  of the constitutions , legislation , jurisprudence and statistics , of the several states and of the United States ; be ever watchful to detect and counteract deleterious innovations , whether of foreign or domestic origin ,  --  of minor or momentous import ; and zealous to secure the stability and promote the prosperity of the Union . It should never be forgotten , that , when the war of the revolution had closed , and these United States assumed the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be encountered , from the inefficiency of Congressional power , as prescribed by the articles of confederation . During the excitement and pressure of war , the administration of the general government was rendered eiThetual by the generous co-operation of the states , as well as of the whole people . One common and all-engrossing cause united all hearts and nerved every arm . But on the return of peace , innumerable obstacles successively arose , which national legislation could neither remove nor avoid . The public and private debts were enormous , and from the inadequacy of means , credit was destroyed . The requisitions upon the states were either entirely disregarded , or but partially and reluctantly answered . Commerce and navigation languished from the want of protection and encouragement . Agriculture , manufactures and the mechanic arts were in a lamentable state of decadence ; and there was no power in the general or state governments to cheer on exertion , re-establish confidence , and insure ultimate prosperity in any branch of national industry . A general gloom overshadowed the union , and portentous gleams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallant soldiers , firm statesmen , and unwavering legislators , who had fearlessly buffeted the revolution , were alarmed at the perilous situation of the country . At last , urged on by Washington and his illustrious compatriots , measures were adopted for averting those disastrous consequences , which they had " but too much reason to apprehend . " A convention was assembled at Philadelphia in 1787 , " for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation , and reporting such alterations and provisions , as would render the federal constitution adequate to the exigences of government and the preservation of the Union . " The meeting of that august assembly marks a most important era in the annals of our country and of the world . Gentlemen , eminent for their erudition , talents , moral excellence , and patriotism , had been selected , as the responsible Amphictyons , who were to form a system of government for this vast empire . Such an able , dignified , and imposing assemblage , and for such a purpose , had never been convened ; and the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it depended the happiness of millions . From the peculiar situation of the recently emancipated colonies , the causes of embarrassment were of no ordinary magnitude . Political , commercial , and various sectional jealousies existed among the states , while there was a difference in their extent , wealth and population , as well as in the habits , education and religion of their inhabitants . This presented obstacles , apparently insuperable ; and at one period it was seriously apprehended that the convention would be dissolved without being able to accomplish the object of its meeting ; but , fortunately , a liberal , magnanimous and exalted spirit prevailed , and a disposition for mutual compron*uise and concession , at length , overcoming every difficulty , the result was the admirable Constitution , which is now our boast . Under the salutary provisions of that great charter of our liberties , this country has advanced in all the arts of civilization , with a rapidity , unexampled in the history of the human race . During successive administrations , however variant the speculative opinions of rival parties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , have , generally , been kept constantly in view , and claimed the most serious attention of all branches of the government ; and if there have been periods , when every measure did not quadrate with public sentiment , in all parts of the Union , they were either modified or abandoned , or , after more mature consideration , so universally sanctioned , as to be effectually maintained . But whatever party has been dominant , men distinguished for their talents , integrity and honorable deportment , have , most usually , been called upon to fill the executive departments ; and with few exceptions , there was a cordial and an efficient co-operation of the cabinet and congress , for the prosecution of all such measures as were best calculated to promote the prosperity and happiness of the people , and to subserve the great interests of the general weal . The nation went on triumphantly through the sunshine of peace and the lurid storms of war . We were honored by all nations . Successful commerce adventured round the globe , and the " star-spangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within our borders , how cheering has been the advance and how encouraging the future ! // But to realize all those bright visions , which loom in the prospective , it is indispensable that there should be no abatement of vigilance , no want of energy , no negligence of duty . We must take warning from the fate of other republics , and recollect that the sentinels of liberty can never slumber with impunity , for the demon of usurpation is ever on the watch , to enter the unprotected portals of her sanctuary . The people have , but too often , been the sole cause of their own irremediable bondage . Instead of being guided by the honest , highminded and patriotic , they have been grossly deluded by the wily stratagems of reckless demagogues . In this country an opinion has , unfortunately , prevailed , which it is not prudent longer to sustain , although sanctioned by the highest authority , for it may be of disastrous consequence . It was presumed that so enlightened were the citizens , so fortified their rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistrustful of ambition , so determined to preclude the possibility of deception , that none but the truly eminent could ever receive their confidence and support . These exhilarating expectations were early induced ; they had their origin in the establishment of the constitution ; that governmental code was framed for the express purpose of warranting their indulgence , and inspired the doubtful with a full confidence in their complete consummation . So sanguine were the erudite authors of the Federalist , in the conservative provisions of our national charter ,  --  such their reliance upon the sound sense , and incorruptibility of the people , and on their unremitted vigilance , that it was considered impossible that any other than the great and meritorious could , in any event , reach the most exalted stations in the government . This is their emphatic declaration ; " The process of election affords a moral certainty that the office of President will seldom fall to the lot of any man , who is not , in an eminent degree , endowed with the requisite qualifications . It will not be too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing the station filled , by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue . " Such an asseveration , and from such mighty men , could not fail to make a deep and lasting impression . It was dictated from magnanimous conceptions of the American character , and enlarged views of an inevitable progress in political science ; a belief that there was the disposition and determination , throughout the country , to extend the means of education among all classes of society ; that the nation would , in after ages , be as distinguished for the moral improvement of its citizens , as for the free institutions , whose eternal foundations they successfully laid . But enough has been developed to cast a desponii. ing shadow over that brilliant prospect , which , with elated thoughts and gladdened hearts , was beheld in the distance , by the venerated compatriots of other days . Is there not danger in giving an unqualified assent to an axiom , which has not yet been sufficiently tested , to preclude the denial of its correctness ? History recounts innumerable instances of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious frenzy . There are times , when even the sage become demented , the intelligent stultified , and the habitually prudent are carried away by the delirium of public excitement . Such scenes may be anticipated here . Disappointment and revenge brutalize the mind ; pride of opinion often generates // arrogance ; error becomes contagious , and heedless ignorance , with remorseless treason , hastens to form the most terrible combinations ; the barriers against lawless innovation are broken down , and every thing is made to yield before the tremendous torrent of popular exasperation . In such an event , men , without talents , experience or moral rectitude , may be elected to the highest offices in the republic .

A.@@183067909.txt THE MORALITY OF MACBETH . I AM one of those who have no faith in the morality of the theatre . It is long since I have entered the walls of one ; and I know not that I ever carried from a dramatic performance a salutary impression . A sarcastic friend tells me the fault was my own ; he assures me I wanted the finer feelings which these oblique instructions were designed to reach ; and that it is only on the chords of a nicer sensibility that the tones of the drama will act . He informs me that I never had wit enough to guess the riddle ; and that it was in the latent meaning of the well-wrought scene , that the best instruction was found . It may be so ; if there was any deep moral instruction in the theatre , it was always latent to me ; and therefore I have long since left the school from which no profit was derived . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the deepest interest and delight . Though I never saw on our stage that perfection of art which we read of in Garrick ; the art which is lost in nature , and leads the spectator to forget that it is acting which he sees ; yet I used to admire the fine tones of Cooper , the majesty of Fennel , and the simplicity of Mrs. Jones . Still I never saw a tragedy , ( especially of Shakspeare 's , ) which I thought , on the whole , improved in the acting. * Certain passages * This very tragedy , ( Macbeth , ) is a striking example of how completely the designs of the poet may fail in the public exhibition . There can be no doubt that the author meant that the appearance of the witches should be exceedingly solemn ; be wished to thrill our blood when these agents of the world of darkness meet their victim and allure him to perdition by their metapitysi. cat aid . Yet I question whether it is possible to introduce three great strapping men on the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chins and broom-sticks in their hands , and not make the whole theatre laugh . The whole intended effect of such a scene must be lost . Though it is many years since I have seen a play , yet I distinctly recollect that the cauldron-38 // were , to be sure , elevated to a rant ; an unexpected emphasis was given to certain lines ; but the general tenor of the play was enfeebled ; and its pathos and its moral ( if it had a moral ) were less striking on the public scene than in the closet . With little faith , then , in the charms of the theatre , and still less in its utility as a school of morals , I can not help seeing that the dramatic form is the most striking mode of exhibiting the human heart ; and that such exhibitions may be moral so long as example is a motive to action . I assent to the proposition of the critics , that a good drama is the highest effort of human genius ; and , perhaps , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting truths from which a moral inference may be drawn . The great masters of human nature , however corrupt their own designs may be , must sometimes be teachers . Their keen discernment leads to truth ; and virtue is built on truth . Rousseau himself with all his ravings , is often moral ; and moral without meaning to be so . When we see something new in the structure of the human mind , we see more clearly the pivots on which the passions turn , and the foundations on which actions are built . We advance in self-knowledge . The corrupt writer , who explores the mind , is like the assassin , who rips open the body ; in both cases it was malice which urged the attempt ; but the moralist may enlarge his knowledge from the one crime , and the anatomist from the other ; and both may turn their discoveries to a good account . Of all the dramatic writers , it seems to me that Shakspeare is the most moral , though such a design , when he sat down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is moral , because he gave himself up to a kind of instinctive perception of what is true in human nature and thus made his character just what God has made man  --  a moral being . His pictures are so true , his course of events is often ( not always ) so natural , that we receive the same impression from his drama as from the living world . Now no one can doubt that the course of events is moral . If the life of any man , the worst that ever breathed , were written faithfully by some recording angel , it would be a fine moral lesson . Thus Shakspeare is the most moral of the dramatic writers , because he painted the human heart just as God made it . I have remarked that he wrote without any moral design ; and as a proof of the truth of this remark , I would adduce one of his most moral plays . Macbeth is one of the noblest productions of his genius . To say nothing of its fine language ,  --  the charming antique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the change in the fortunes of the actors , and the solemn grandeur of the events - we see there an amiable man , beginning the career of prosperity ; with many excellent qualities , but corrupted by ambition ,  --  tempted to crime ,  --  dallying with the temptation ,  --  yielding ,  --  and going from step to step , until he dies in a misery as deep as his guilt was great . Never were the balancings of the mind between duty and transgression brought out more fully ; scene in the fourth act was , in its effect on the audience , a perfect farce . Not all the agonies which Cooper was accustomed to excite in himself , when the armed head arose , could make the audience sympathize with him . VVe saw nothing hut a company of ridiculous old women , talking mummery , while they were boiling a pot . When we reaul this play , we can imagine the existence of witchcraft enough to feel its power ; hut when we see it acted , the dream is broken , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ludicrous from the sublimity of the deslgn. we laugh at the farcical effect ; and we laughmore at the contrast . // and never were the agonies of remorse more strongly painted . Every scene seems to say ,  --  Resist the beginnings of evil ; and beware , beware of those peculiar temptations , which are most powerful , because they are most adapted to your character . Yet we have reason to think that this fine play was written without any moral purpose . Shakspeare went through it with as much non-chalance as he wrote the filthy scenes in Love 's Labor Lost . There is a passage in Burnet 's History which , I apprehend , explains the object of this play . The king ( James I. ) was once hunting at Theobalds in a very careless and unguarded manner . Sir Dudley Carlton told him , that " Queen Elizabeth was a woman of form , and was so well attended , that all the plots of the Jesuits to assassinate her failed ; but a prince , who was always in woods and forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in private to inquire more particularly into this ; and he saw it made a great impression on him . But it wrought otherwise than as he intended . For the king , resolved to gratify his humor in hunting , and in a careless and irregular way of life , did immediately order all that prosecution ( i. e. against the papists for the gunpowder-plot ) to be let fall . " The truth is , he lived in constant dread of assassination , and any production , which showed the agonies of a murderer of a king , would be grateful to him . Besides , he was a great advocate for witchcraft . Shakspeare knew his trade ; and hence we owe , probably , the solemn incantations and the fine moral of this tragedy to the same cause ,  --  the desire to flatter a coward and a king . We have , in the first place , presented before us , a man of a very amiable and excellent character , skilled in his profession , and warmly devoted to his country . His valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the confidence of his sovereign . 0 worthiest cousin , The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me ; thou art so far before , The swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee . Would thou hadst less deserved ; That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine ! only I have left to say , More is thy due than more than all can pay . This testimony in his own favor he is represented as receiving with great modesty ; and professing still great devotedness to his king . Your highness ' part Is to receive our duties ; and our duties Are to your throne and state , children and servants ; Which do but what they should , by doing every thing Safe towards your love and honor . Nor is it in public stations alone that the social virtues of this man are seen . His wife , who is his bosom friend , and is represented as possessing remarkable discernment and energy of character , draws his portrait , in moral colors , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do fear thy nature , It is too full of the milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way ; thou wouldst be great ; Art not without ambition ; but without The illness should attend it . What thou wouldst highly , That thou wouldst holily ; wouldst not play false And yet wouldst wrongly win . // The Morality of Macbeth . It is evident , if such a man becomes abandoned , it must be through the influence of some strong temptation , addressed to some evil prim . ciple dormant in his heart , which may be the root alike of virtues or vices , as the occasion may be . Accordingly , Macbeth is tempted by the powers of hell and by his wife ; and both of them , with great art , suit their suggestions to the weak side of his character . The witches meet him on a blasted heath with predictions , which set before him his future honors without suggesting the means by which they should be obtained . This temptation is managed with great art , inasmuch as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , too , without any crime or agency on the part of Macbeth . He becomes Thane of Cawdor without any guilt ; and thus a possible door of hope is left open that he may reach the crown without soiling his hands in blood . But the case is doubtful ; the king has sons ,  --  is yet alive ,  --  and a crown is a prize , which is seldom innocently obtained , except by the lawful heir . Macbeth is thrown into deep musings ; and , though he does not resolve to commit a crime , he makes no resolution against it . The idea of murder crosses his mind ; he is agitated ; and these are no good symptoms . Why do I yield to that suggestion , Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair , And make my seated heart knock at my ribs , Against the use of nature ? Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings ; My thought , whose murder yet is but fantastical , Shakes so my single state of man , that function Is smothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last thought is most beautifully expressed ; though the poet has pushed the energy of expression to its utmost limits . He means to say ,  --  L am so lost in those ideal visions ; the future honors of a kingdom have so absorbed my mind ; that my imaginations have become realities , and my real state is nothing . Such was the strong desire of this ambitious heart to attain its end . Now it may be laid down as a maxim , that , when some great prize is before us to be obtained by doubtful means , and we shuffle out of sight the means and think only of the end ,  --  we are in a most dangerous state . The mind , whatever palliations it may offer to itself , is beginning to incline the wrong way . We are in the exact situation of our first parents , when they gazed at the forbidden fruit and forgot the command of God . Thus far Shakspeare appears as a moralist . But he now rises almost to the standing of a theologian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found only in the Bible . One would hardly believe it possible , that such principles of the closest religion would be introduced on the stage with so little appearance of departing from the histrionic path . We have always been told by the teachers of religion , that the law of God ,  --  a sacred regard to his authority ,  --  is the only principle that can carry us through the crossing interests , which meet us in the shock of life . The virtue , which is based on interest , will vary as that interest varies ; and the man , who loves the praises of men more than the praises of God , will act only as his fellow creatures ap // plaud or condemn . He will regard the outside of his character more than the state of his heart ; and his seeming goodness is only ambition in a moral dress . Such characters abound in the world ; such virtues deceive innumerable hearts . Human nature has often the sweetest flowers spread over its depravity , and , what is wonderful , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man changes with circumstances . He is the same idolater , but he changes the image which is the object of worship ; and it is useful , to tell the young and thoughtless , that that virtue which has no hold on futurity and no reference to God , is sure in time to break away . Christianity is a new passion ; and it enables us to overcome the temptations of life , because we love something better . This is perfectly philosophic ; the mind is like balances ; and , if the temptations of life are powerful weights in one scale , they can only be overcome by a more powerful weight in the other ,  --  supreme love to God . Shakspeare has introduced Macbeth , in a soliloquy , in which the contending principles are at war in his heart . Behold a most interesting spectacle ! Behold a sinner pausing on the brink of his crimes ! It is an awfhl moment . What will be the result ? Will the better principle prevail ? Will his good Angel come down to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impel him to crime ? No ; the battle is decided before it is begun . He is careful to inform us that he lays religious principle out of the question ; and such a man must fall . He is like a besieged city with batteries thundering at every gate , and provisions and powder exhausted . That man is sure to yield to temptation , whojumps the life to come . If it were done when t is done , then t were well It were done quickly ; if the assassination Could trammel up the consequence , and catch With his surcease , success ; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all here ,  - -  But here upon this bank and shoal of timeWE D JUMP THE LIFE TO COME . Such was the theology of Shakspeare ; he had no system , but it was forced upon him by his rapid and intuitive knowledge of the human heart . Though Macbeth is conscious that life is but a bank and shoal , he is willing to give up every principle for its transient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's religious faith does not have some control over his actions ? Believe it , ye licentious , on the authority of Shakspeare . Real faith is a mental view ; and our mental views govern us . A man , who has eyes , is influenced in his walk , by the prospect before him ; and , in moral things , that prospect is future truth . But it *ems that one lucid interval returns ; Macbeth resolves not to commit the crime , and this resolution is grounded , not on religious principle , but on some compunctious visitings of nature . Even the good purposes that cross his mind rest upon no solid base ; they are the mere calculations of the same selfish spirit which urged him to murder the king . There are opposing principles in our hearts , to the greater crimes , which are not strictly virtuous . The dialogue between Macbeth and his wife ) after the soliloquy , last alluded to , is the most striking in the whole play . Let the reader ponder the words well ; and remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer 's // mind during the whole transaction . He is talking of repenting and abstaining from his guilty design , and mark on what his best purposes are based . We will proceed no farther in this business ; He hath honored me of late ; and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people , Which should be worn now in their newest gloss , Not cast aside so soon . Here is not one word said about the intrinsic depravity of the deed , no reference to a higher power , no regard to the law of God , or our obligation to obey it ; the man shows himself as totally destitute of good principles , when he is entertaining purposes of amendment , as when he is pacing to his crime . It is all a calculation of selfishness ; it is a striking exhibition of the great law of nature and doctrine of religion , that no man is safe who builds his outward virtues on false principles ; who never reached a higher motive than the golden opinions , which he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be expected . A little sophistry from his wife overcomes him ; and he soon enters into her design , not only with no reluctance , but with eagerness . He hears her detail the plan of treachery and murder ; and bursts into the raptures of ambition . Bring forth men children only ! For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males . This is now the turning period of his character ; he gives himself up to guilt ; he expects all his pleasure from it ; he passes the line from which there is no return ; and whatever remorse he may feel , or however keen his perception of his own state , there remains no more place for repentance , though he seek it carefully with tears . It is thought by some to be an extremely mystical doctrine , that no man can be good without a great change in the affections of his heart . But surely a reference to the principles of our nature will lead us to this conclusion ; and we have Shakspeare on our side . Macbeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor was there one new principle called into action when he proceeded to the last stages of guilt . All his crimes were grafted on the common propensities of the heart . But the poet has told us the secret ; he was a mere man of the world ; he had no regard to a future state , and no fear of God . He was like thousands of specious characters , who are living at random , and are ready to receive the first temptation . No cord of law , no band of faith bound him to his duty . He was a bark on the sea , ready to be blown in any direction . He was a specimen of human nature , and from his mournful story every man , who lives for this life only , may learn to know himself These truths have often been taught from the authority of revelation ; but they have been disregarded . They are here repeated , in the hope that some may receive them on the authority of Shakspeare . There is another theological truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy ; and that is , the distinction between repentance and remorse . Macbeth is in the deepest remorse ever after he committed the murder ; though he is as far from // repentance as the most desperate persistency in sin can place him . He knows his guilt ; he knows the vanity of all his honors ; he knows that not one moment 's repose lies between him and the grave ; and the prospect beyond he shuts up in darkness and unbelief . Yet he hugs the vain shadows of his dignity ; and finds his hope in the exhausted rewards of ambition . He stands alone on the mount ; and enjoys nothing but the playing of the sun-beams on its barren ice . There is one speech of his where the regret of a hardened heart is brought out in the most striking language that tragedy can show . I allude to the speech , in which the usurper , in the very bloom of his success , and on the throne of his power , turns to the victim he has murdered , contrasts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tomb . No poet ever surpassed this ; for a moment , our detestation for the wretch is lost in pity ; and we own the deep anguish there is in mental punishment . Duncan is in his grave . After life 's fitful fever , he sleeps well ; Treason has done his worst ; nor steel , nor poison , Malice domestic , foreign levy , nothing Can touch him further ! I have long been convinced , that , when Christianity assumes *r presupposes a distinction in human nature , a careful analysis of that nature will always show such distinctions to be just . I am , therefore , happy to find , in this important tragedy , that the Bible and Shakspeare agree .. That great Master of human nature , who had no theories to support , . and hardly a prejudice to blind him , has come , by the powerful impulses of his genius , to a conclusion on which some of the most im** portant truths of revelation are built . There is something very convincing in the careless discernment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes observation warp to his system ; but the voice ot nature is always the voice of truth . G.@@183067913.txt ICELAND AND ICELANDERS . THE study of man under *very aspect of his existence has an interest , which belongs to no other subject that can engage enlightened curiosity . We are naturally desirous to learn , how far he is the master of his own destiny , or if he does but rough hew the course which is shaped for him by a power beyond his control . We desire to know , if it is indeed in the power of a tropical sun , to enervate the moral force of nations , and unfit them for the enjoyment of liberty and the delights of invention ; and again , if the intensity of the cold at the remote north can , indeed , make the blood flow lazily , and chill the passions that stimulate to enterprise . For ourselves we believe that man , if not wholly the master of him-. self , is yet not subservient to the elements , to time , or to climate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the breast of the ancient Greek and the modern republican ; that the well-springs of the affections flowed as abundantly and as purely under the skies of Latium as now on the banks of the Miami ; and the burdens patiently endured beneath the turrets of Babel , produced very much the same servility as is now visible in the serfs of Russia . Man is essentially the same , though the circumstances of his age may somewhat modify his character . Nor does climate necessarily control his destiny . The same wild laugh bursts from the peasant girls of Sweden when they greet the return of May , as from the Tuscans when they celebrate their early festivals ; and Iceland had trafficked for centuries with America , or at least had fished in its waters , before Genoa produced a pilot , to carry the Southern European across the ocean . It was as to an asylum , that men , in the ninth century , made their escape from the excessive tyranny of the despot of Norway to the remote coasts of Iceland . It was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe emancipation from the dominion of injustice , that men made their way to the island , whose name might have struck terror into the minds of brave men , and whose position on the very vt*rge * the Arc*tic regioii seemed to threaten nothing but inbos // pitable sterility ; it was to this place of night and solitude , that men came , to dispute the possession of the desert with the ferocious brutes of the Polar regions , and the still more fearful climate . Strange that no kindlier asylum should have offered for the rec&amp;ption of emigrants , who asked so little of fortune . But the place of refuge of the unfortunate is sure to thrive . A republic soon started into being , and the country became famous for its civil organization as well as for the contented prosperity of its inhabitants . We have said that the land , which is the asylum for the unfortunate , will always prosper . It is the sturdy minds , the choice and daring spirits , who resist the evils of accident and fortune , and fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to regions , where their enterprise may expand , and their abilities gather round them the safe reward of action . Hence it is , that civilization makes progress most rapidly , where such spirits meet together ; and as they are able to contemplate life under a simple aspect , remote from the influence of prescriptive abuse , and unmolested by the menaces of surrounding prejudices , so their institutions and their works usually exhibit evidence of the most successful application of human activity and wisdom . Is it surprising , then , that the refugees who had fled to the verge of Europe , should have been distinguished by astonishing deeds ? Is it wonderful , that the Icelanders were the first to make their way across the Atlantic , and return to announce the discovery of the new world ? Such is the fact , and centuries elapsed after the first voyages of these unpretending islanders to the American continent , before the daring of the Genoese mariner ventured on the enterprise , which has secured to him immortality . True , the successful seamen , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the first from the old world to take fish on the Grand Bank , did not promulgate the tidings to the rest of Europe . Why should they have done so ? They were but exiles from the kingdoms of the continent ; they had crept away into the realms of frost , to be safe and independent . Their moderate views did not aim at glory ; as for the nations whom they had left , they asked only for peace , and desired only to live unknown and unnoticed . It was enough for them , that their own curiosity was gratified . So their knowledge remained confined among themselves ; and as for emigrating to America , it seems not to have occurred to them . Their entire contentment with the spot where heaven had blessed them with the undisturbed possession of liberty , left them no sufficient inducement to change their abode . Is it remarkable , that under such favoring circumstances an original and highly valuable literature should have sprung up in a state of society so admirably suited to encourage and to reward ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icelanders . The rivals of the Troubadours appeared in the authors of the Edda ; the bards of the gay South found nowhere so powerful , so original , so excellent competitors , none so worthy of engaging permanent attention , as the poets who lived where moss grows instead of violets and flowers , and where there are icebergs for fountains The poets , whose minds were ripened by the contemplation of the wrecks of antiquity , and by the genial influences of a Southern sun , were rivalled , nay , were surpassed , by those who lived where there was no shade but of the rock and the mountain , no // communing with other men but across the ocean , no inspiration but such as existed in the hearts of the - bards . The Icelandic literature is superior in independence of character to all the antiquities of the Gothic nations , and surpasses them all in fervid excellence . The ancients represented the god of poetry as also the god of light , radiant in youth and joy ; here everything was reversed . In a climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " where , in the depths of winter , the sun is hardly seen , a literature bloomed , and the various productions of poetry came into existence in wild abundance among the rocks that resist the Arctic seas . Tell us then ,  --  Is not the mind of man . master of circumstances ? Can not the mind triumphantly resist the influence of climate ? Here , in the land which produces neither wine nor corn , no fruits , no trees , almost no esculent vegetables , the land of volcanoes and ice , high honors for intellectual culture have been won by this rude offset of the family of the Gothic nations . The thing would be incredible ; if the evidence were not complete . And what a life of privations and hardships these early Icelanders must have led ? Their maritime adventurers were so charmed with the aspect of Greenland , that , anticipating the Spaniards in the case of Florida , they gave it a name indicative of its lovely appearance . Much in the same manner , at a later period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Delaware , named it Paradise Point ; it was such a heaven compared with their native marshes . And when the Icelandic adventurers approached Newfoundland , they were enraptured with its enticing appearance . But , ascending the St. Lawrence , to where the waters are brackish , they found , on the shores of what seemed to them a vast lake , enormous wild grape vines , and , in an extasy of admiration , they called it the Land of the Grape . Ye inhabitants of Anticosta , ( we believe two or three contrive to live on that island , ) do but enjoy the thought , that your climate was an object of envy ! They say , that man , having been created in the evening , did homage to the stars , till the moon rose , and then he worshipped the moon till the sun came forth upon the Eastern hills . So it was with our worthy Icelanders ; Labrador was admirable , till they saw Newfoundland , and Newfoundland delightful , till Cape Rosier was discovered . But when that Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splendid visions of the luxuriant South appeared to be more than realized . Times are changed . The Icelanders no longer take the lead in maritime enterprise ; their commerce is shackled by the restrictions of monopolies ; their fountains of inspiration are dried up ; their independence has been lost ; their ancient diets superseded or dissolved , and now , politically and intellectually , their country might seem but subordinate to the Danish court . So true it is , that freedom , and free. - dom only , is the nurse of greatness . But if the political character of the Icelanders has declined , the rugged features of nature still remain , furnishing the strangest incongruities and the wildest and sublimest contrasts . Here we have glaciers of many miles extent , with rivers gushing impetuously from their sides , and near them , perhaps , the earth heaves with subterranean fires , and the mountain is pouring forth its liquid torrents of fire . All that there is of surprising and of grand in the rugged scenery and the 40 // chilling aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonders of volcanic energies , exhausted or in action , are here crowded together into one island , whose harbors are sometimes blocked up with the ice from Greenland , and sometimes by the cur* rents of lava . The traveler is now stopped in his career by the encroachment of an ice mountain on the usual path , and is now compelled to make his way across fields of sulphur . A thin crust only divides him from the subterranean heats ; and as he moves onward , he is compelled to lead his horse in the gentlest manner , lest that thin crust be broken . If by chance he breaks through , he is in danger of being scorched by the intensity of the enduring beat ; and where the hoofs of his horse have indented the surface , a flame bursts forth ; smoke issues ; and the path of the lean animal is marked by fiery footsteps . At one time , a lake or a morass may impede the progress of the wanderer ; or it may be a burning quagmire , which offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat are perpetually transforming the face of nature . The " cold , resistless mass " of the glacier is perpetually stealing into the valley ; and , in one instance , a field of ice has extended for a distance of twenty miles , and is still advancing , till now it has almost reached the sea-shore , and promises soon to present the rare phenomenon of a river of solid ice , discharging itself into the ocean in a frozen state . And , perhaps , in the depths of that very ocean , the heavings of earthquakes are preparing new islands , and the volcanic activity of nature laying the foundations of new abodes for man . Nay ; in 1783 , a new island was sent up from the depths of the ocean ; and was of such magnitude and promise , as to excite the cupidity of his Danish majesty . It was accordingly claimed and seized upon in his name ; but a decree went forth from a higher power , and it was not long before the sea resumed its own again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes terror into the soul ; and the silence of the valleys , which are sheltered behind the ramparts of lava , is appalling . Nature seems to sleep amidst the wrecks of her own creating . The stillness of death rests among the ruins of former forms of being . The v*ry mountains decay ; the very rocks melt with fire ; the earth itself is consumed and wasted . The traveler shudders , as he winds his way among these relics of former existence . Why should he muse on the vanity of human life , on the transient nature of human enjoyments ? when , behold Nature herself is changing , and the very hills , which he had deemed everlasting , are wasting away . If from this fearful quiet , he turns in quest of motion , he can hardly find it , except where he finds it in turbulent excess . The waves of the surrounding seas are never still ; now dashing against each other in sullen majesty ; now breaking on the immoveable rocks ; now making their way in eddies far into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and now throwing upon the shore masses of drift wood , the relics of a former creation , or , it may be , the plunder of the ocean from some undiscovered shore ; or the restoration of forests which , ages ago , were buried in the sea . All is mystery . At times the winds rage so furiously , and the billows rise with such power , that the masses of Greenland ice on the waters are hurled against each // other with so great force , that the drift-wood which may be caught between them is set on fire by the concussion . Nor are we to suppose , that the present race of inhabitants is wholly recreant . There are no more bold adventurers like Eirik the Red , or Leif Eirikson , the discoverers of Greenland and America ; but still the island is occupied by an intelligent population . It is not easy to find a child of ten or twelve , who can not both read and write . Indeed there is no country where men write so well . The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicest engraver would fear to attempt to imitate . The Icelanders do not appear to be deficient in the qualities , which conciliate and preserve affection . They are so merciful , that no one among them can be found , who is willing to do the office of executioner ; so that Copenhagen enjoys a monopoly of punishing the Icelandic rogues . And further , believe it who may , dispute it who can ; in an island of fifty thousand inhabitants , there is not one lawyer . Nor has the love of poetry quite expired . In a room , eight feet by six , which is entered by a door not four feet high , and is lighted by a window of about two feet square , the chef d'a ? uvre of Milton has been rendered into Icelandic in a style which is thought to excel every other translation of the bard . De Lille is surpassed by the simple islander ; and Thorlaksen is said to merit all the veneration with which his countrymen regard him . We have said , that the population is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few that exist are abundantly read . When the British and Foreign Bible Society sent a consignment of Bibles in the Icelandic language to the island , they were purchased with an avidity which would take no refusal ; and in their long wintry nights , it is common for the whole of a family to be assembled at household employments , while one reads aloud either from their ancient poetry and sagas , or from the Bible . Many of the farms are established in retired nooks , where in winter there can be little or no communication . In some of these places the farmer feeds his imagination with antiquarian recollections , and revels in the poetic traditions of the old Icelandic mythology . The manners of the good people are now marked by the characteristics of rural innocence and simplicity , rather than by the sturdy efforts of daring . In some instances the hospitality is more than patriarchal . After a meal , the guest salutes the master and mistress of the house with a kiss , and thanks them for their liberal entertainment . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soit qui rnal y pense , ) the eldest daughter of the house enters his apartment , pulls off his panta .. loons and stockings , in spite of his modest perturbation , sets by his side a lamp and a bowl of milk ,  --  and withdraws . But there is one point , in which it seems to us the inhabitants of Iceland must be most surprised by the contrast of their condition with ours . A house is only a shelter ; and a house five feet high can keep off wind , and rain , and cold , as surely as one of the comfortable constructions of our cities . An Icelander might , therefore , admire the decent neatness of our dwellings , and only perceive a difference in the degree of advantages secured . But in all Iceland there is not ( or a few years ago there was not ) a tree . Ye lovers of rural comfort ; ye // horticulturists and foresters ; ye planters of avenues ; ye enthusiasts , that recline under the shade of some stately elm , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a grove , nor a tree . Rocks and moss , ice and plains of sulphur ; with here and there a little plat of verdure ; hut not a forest , not a grove , not a tree . Imagine a young Icelander , who has learnt by heart the picture of the Garden of Eden , as described in the version from Milton , suddenly transplanted to the densest shades of Goat Island , and as he lifts up his head , wondering what it is that intercepts his view of the sky ; or , taken by witchcraft to the plains of Ohio , and shown the gigantic forms which there tower to such a height as to threaten the invasion of heaven ! How his blood would tingle with the rush of emotion at the novel and exciting spectacle . What an admirable incident it would be for one of Kotzebue 's plays : - Scene , the sea-shore ; an Icelandic ship off the coast .

Poverty is said to be the bulwark of their happiness ; it doubtless gives them a stronger interest in religious attainments . Their churches are very rude structures ; but then they all attend church . Their clergy receive seldom more than one hundred and fifty dollars annually , and often not more than twenty or thirty ; but then they are sufficiently learned , devoutly sincere , and cherish their humble parishioners with affectionate sympathy . Piety is the common habit . Every journey is preceded by a prayer ; the fishermen , as they go out to sea , when they have passed the surg pull off their hats and pray . The common courtesies of life are interchanged with a benediction . Contentment generally prevails , and Providence , which neglects no living thing , protects these Arctic exiles from the seventies of life , and gives them a due share of enjoyinent and happiness.
