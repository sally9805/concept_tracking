txt /z/ A boy ! yet in his eye you trace The watchfulness of graven years , And tales are in that serious face Of feelings early steeped in tears ; And in that tranquil gaze There lingers many a thought unsaid Shadows of other days , Whose hours with shapes of beauty came and fted . And sometimes it is even so The spirit ripens in the germ , The new sealed fountains overflow , The bright wings tremble in the morn . The soul detects some passing token , Some emblem of a brighter world , And with its shell of clay unbroken , Its shining pinions arc unfurled , And , like a blessed dream , Phantoms , apparelled from the sky , Athwart its vision stream As if the light of heaven had touched its gifted eye . /z/ " T is strange how childhood 's simple words Interpret nature 's mystic bookHow it will listen to the birds , And ponder on the running brook , As if its spirit fed . And strange that we remember not , Who fill its eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back to the home which it has scarce forgot /z/ Benjamin West , the subject of the following memoir , was the youngest son of John West and Sarah Pearson , and was born near Springfield , in Chester qounty , in the State of Pennsylvania , on the 10th of October , 1738 . About the year 1667 the family from which Mr West descended , embraced the tenets of the quakers , and in 1699 they emigrated from England to America . Thomas Pearson , the maternal grandfather of the artist , was the confidential friend of William Penn , and the same person to whom that venerable legislator said on landing in America , * Provi- dence has brought us safely hither ; thou hast been the companion of my perils , what wilt thou that I should call this place ? ' Mr Pearson replied , that ' since he had honored him so far as to desire him to give that part of the country a name , he would , in remembrance of his native city , call it Chester . ' The exact spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still pointed out with reverence by the inhabitants . Mr Pearson built a house and formed a plantation in the . neighborhood which he called Springfield , in consequence of discovering a large spring of water in the first field cleared for cultivation ; and it was near this spot that Benjamin West was born . When the West family emigrated , John , the father of Benjamin , was left to complete his education at the great school of the Quakers at Uxbridge and did not join his relations in America till the year 1714 . Soon after his arrival he married Sarah Pearson , the mother of the artist , and of the worth and piety of his character we have a remarkable proof in the following transactions which , pephaps , reflect more real glory on his family than the achievements of all his heroic ancestors . As a part of the marriage portion of Mrs West , he received a negro slave , whose diligence and fidelity very soon obtained his full confidence . Being engaged in trade , he had occasion to make a voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to superintend the plantation , or farm , in his absence . During his residence in Barbadoes , his feelings were greatly hurt , and his principles shocked , by the cruelties to which he saw the negroes subjected in that island , and the debasing effects were forcibly contrasted in his mind , with the morals and intelligence of his own slave . Conversing on this subject with Dr Gammon , who was then at the head of the society of Friends in Barbadoes , the Doctor convinced him that it was contrary to the laws of God and nature that any man should retain his fellow creatures in slavery . This conviction could not rest long inactive in a character formed like that of Mr West . On his return to America he gave the negro his freedom . Not satisfied with doing good himself , he endeavored to make others follow his example , and in a short time his example had such an effect on his neighbors , that after some public discussion on the subject , it was resolved by a considerable majority that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their example was followed by the Quakers in the township of Goshen , in Chester county , and finally , about the year 1753 , the same question was moved in the annual general assembly at Philadelphia , when it was established as one of the tenets of the Quakers , that no person could remain a member of their society who held a human creature in slavery , thus making a ' great public sacrifice of their own interests , purely from moral and religious principle . They were not satisfied with the benevolent work of restoring their natural rights to the unfortunate negroes , butthe society of Friends went further , and established schools for the education of their children ; and some of the first characters among themselves volunteered to superintend the course of instruction . The first six years of Benjamin 's life passed away in calm uniformity ; leaving only the placid remembrance of enjoy - /z/ ment . In the month of June , 1745 , one of his sisters , who had been married some time before , and who had a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her father 's . When the child was asleep in the cradle , Mrs West invited her daughter to gather flowers in the garden , and committed the infant to the care of Benjamin , during their absence , giving him a fan to flap away the flies from molesting his little charge . Alter some time the child happened to smile in its sleep , and its beauty attracted his attention . He looked at it with a pleasure he had never before experienced , and observing some paper on a table , together with pens and red and black ink , he seized them with agitation , and endeavored to delineate a portrait ; although at this period he had never seen an engraving or a picture , and was only in the seventh year of his age . /z/ Hearing the approach pf his mother and sister , he endeavored to conceal what he had been doing ; but the old lady observing his confusion , inquired what he was about , and requested him to show her the paper . He obeyed , intreating her not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time at the drawing with evident pleasure , said to her daughter , * I declare he has made a likeness of little Sally , ' and kissed him with much fondness and satisfaction . This encouraged him to say , that if it would give her pleasure , he would make pictures of the flowers , which she held in her hand , for the instinct of his genius was now awakened , and he felt that he could imitate the forms of those things which pleased his sight . The drawing was shown by Mrs West to her husband , who was delighted with this early indication of talent in his son . /z/ From the first emigration , in 1681 , the colony of quakers had continued to thrive with a rapidity unknown to any other European settlements . America had been chosen by their ancestors , as an asylum in which they might enjoy that affectionate intercourse , which their tenets enjoined , free from the military influence , and political jealousies of England . At the birth of Benjamin West the colony had obtained great wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blest in the maxim upon which it had been founded by William Penn , and the effects of his beneficence were felt throughout the settlement . In the houses of the principal families , unlimited hospitality formed a part of their regular economy . It was the custom among those , who resided near the highways , after supper , and the last religious exercise of the evening , to /z/ make a large fire in the hall , and to set out a table with refreshments for such travellers as might have occasion to pass during the night ; and when the families assembled in the morning , they seldom ( bund that their tables had been unvisited . This w r as particularly the case at Springfield . Poverty was never heard of in the land . William Penn and many of his friends traced their lineage to the ancient and noble families of England . In their descendants the pride of ancestn was so tempered with the meekness of their religious tenets , that it gave a sort of patriarchal dignitv to their benevolence. /z/ The neighboring Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual visits , which they were in the practice of paying to the plantations , they raised their huts in the fields and orchards without asking leave , nor were /z/ they ever molested . When the great founder of the state of Pennsylvania marked out the site of Philadelphia in the woods , he allotted a piece of ground for a public library . It was his opinion that the few hours of relaxation , which the first settlers enjoyed , could not be better improved than in reading good and serious books . It was the design of the quakers to make mankind wiser and better , but they were unfriendly to the cultivation of taste , and no works of imagination were admitted into their library . The fine arts were likewise uncultivated among them , so that in the whole Christian world , no spot was apparently so unlikely to produce a painter as Pennsylvania . It might , indeed , be supposed that a youth , reared in the midst of boundless forests , tremendous waterfalls and mountains , whose summits were inaccessible ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most , favorable situation to imbibe a strong love either of poetry or painting . But beautiful scenery , though it charms the taste , refined and alive to its influence , will not create or inspire the original talent for poetry , painting , or any other of the fine arts . Of all the nations of Europe the Swiss are the least poetical , and yet the scenery of no other country seems so well calculated as that of Switzerland to awaken the imagination ; and Shakspeare , the greatest of all modern poets , was brought up in one of the least picturesque districts of England . Soon after the occurrence of the incident we have related , the young artist was sent to a school in the neighborhood . During his hours of leisure he was permitted to draw with pen and ink ; for it did not occur to any of the family to provide him with better materials . /z/ In the course of the summer a part ) ' of Indians came to pay their annual visits to Springfield , and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed them , they taught him to prepare the red and yellow colors with which they painted their ornaments . To these his brother added blue by giving him a piece of indigo , so that he was thus put in possession of the three primary colors . The Indians also taught him to be an expert archer , and he was sometimes in the practice of shooting birds for models , when he thought that their plumage would look well in a picture . His drawings at length attracted the attention of the neighbors ; and some of them happening to regret that the artist had no pencils , he inquired what kind of things these were , and they were /z/ described to him as small brushes made of camel 's hair fastened in a quill . As there were , however , no camels in America , he could not think of any substitute , till he happened to cast his eyes on a black cat , the favorite of his father ; when , in the tapering fur of her tail , he discovered the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's scissors and laying hold of Grimalkin with all due caution , and a proper attention to her feelings , cut off the fur at the end of her tail , and with this made his first pencil . But the tail only furnished him . with one , which did not last long , and he soon stood in need of a further supply . He then had recourse to the animal 's back , his depredations upon which were so frequently repeated , that his father observed the altered appearance of his favorite , and lamented it , as the effect /z/ of disease . The artist , with suitable marks of contrition , informed him of the true cause ; and the old gentleman was so much amused with his ingenuity , that if he reproved him , it was certainly not in anger . In the following year , Mr Pennington , a merchant of Philadelphia , who was related to the West family , came to pay a visit to Benjamin 's father . This gentleman was also a quaker , and although very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper and indulgent disposition . He noticed the drawings of birds and flowers round the room , unusual ornaments in the house of a quaker ; and heard with surprise they were the work of his little cousin . He did not pretend to be a good judge of painting , . but he thought them wonderful productions for a boy only entering on his eighth year , and being told with what poor materials /z/ little Benjamin had been furnished , he promised to send him a box of paints and pencils from the city . On his return home he fulfilled his engagement , and at the bottom of the box placed several pieces of canvas prepared for the painter , and six beautiful engravings . The arrival of the box was an era in the history of the painter and his art . It was received with feelings of delight which can not be described . He opened it , and in the colors , the oils and the pencils , found all his wants supplied , even beyond his utmost conception . But who can tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen any picture but his own drawings , nor knew that such an art as the engraver 's existed ! He sat over the box with admiring eyes ; his mind was in a flutter of joy , and he could not refrain from constantly touching the dif- /z/ ferent articles to ascertain if they were real . At night he placed the box on a chair near his bed , and as often as he forgot his prize , in sleep , he started suddenly and stretched out his hand to satisfy himself that the possession of such a treasure was not merely a pleasing dream . He rose at the dawn of day , and carried the box to a room in the garret , where he spread a canvas , prepared a pallet , and immediately began to imitate the figures in the engravings . Enchanted by his employment , he forgot the school hours , and joined the family at dinner without mentioning the manner in which his forenoon had been , passed . In the afternoon he again repaired to his study in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devoted himself to painting . The /z/ schoolmaster , observing his absence , sent to ask the cause of it . Mrs West recollected that she had seen Benjamin going upstairs every morning , and suspecting that the box occasioned his neglect of the school , went to the garret and found him employed on the picture . Her anger was appeased by the sight of his performance , and changed to a very different feeling . He had not condescended to copy a single engraving , but had selected the most striking features from a number , and by combining and arranging them with wonderful taste and accuracy , had composed a picture as complete , in the arrangement of the several parts and coloring of the whole , as the most skilful artist could have painted , under the direction of a finished master . His mother kissed him with transports of affection , and assured him that she /z/ would not only intercede with his father to pardon him for having absented himself from school , but would go herself to the master , and beg that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approbation , thus bestowed , encouraged the young painter to greater efforts ; but who will not regret that the mother 's over anxious admiration would not suffer him to finish the picture , lest he should spoil what she thought was already perfect , even with half the canvas bare . Sixtyseven years afterwards Mr West had the gratification of seeing this piece in the same room , with his sublime painting of ' Christ Rejected , 7 on which occasion he declared that there were inventive touches of art in his first juvenile essay , which with all the knowledge and experience he afterwards acquired , he had never been able to surpass. /z/ In the course of a few days after the affair of the painting , Mr Pennington paid another visit to Mr West , and was so pleased with the effect of his present and the promising talents of his young relative , that he intreated the old gentleman to allow Benjamin to accompany him for a few days to Philadelphia . This was cheerfully agreed to , and the artist felt himself almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything in the town filled him with astonishment ; but the view of the shipping , which was entirely new , particularly attracted his eye , and interested his imagination . When the first emotion of his pleasure and wonder had subsided , he applied to Mr Pennington to procure him materials for painting . That gentleman was desirous of getting possession of the first picture , and had only resigned his claims , in consideration /z/ of the mother 's feelings , and on being assured that the next picture should be painted purposely for him . The materials were procured , and the artist composed a landscape , which comprehended a picturesque view of a river , with vessels on the water , and cattle pasturing on the bank . While he was engaged in this picture an incident occurred which though trivial in itself , had so much influence , in giving a decided bent to his genius , that it ought not to be omitted . Samuel Shoemaker , an intimate friend of Mr Pennington , and one of the principal merchants in Philadelphia , happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter , carrying home a picture . He was struck with the beauty of the painting , and inquired if it was intended for sale , and being told that it was already sold , he ordered another to be painted for himself . When the painting was finished , he requested Mr Williams to carry it to his friend 's , Mr Pennington 's house , in order that it might be shown to young West . He was so much astonished at the sight of it , and betrayed so much emotion and delight , that Mr William 's observation was attracted toward him , no doubt with a good deal of interest and sympathy . He entered into conversation with him , an$l inquired if he had read any books , or the lives " of great men . Young West told him that he had read the Bible , and was well acquainted with the history of Adam , Joseph , David , Solomon , and the other great and good men whose actions are recorded in the Holy Scriptures . Williams was much pleased with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that histories more in-/z/ teresting have never been written , or written so well . Turning to Mr Pennington , who was present , he asked if Benjamin was his son , advising him at the same time to indulge him in his present pursuits , assuring him that he was no common boy ; he afterwards lent him the works of Fresnoy and Richardson on painting and invited him to see his pictures and drawings . The effect which these books had on the imagination of West , finally decided his destination . ' He was allowed to carry them with him into the country ; and his father and mother soon observed a great change in his style of conversation produced by his study of the books we have named their effect on his mind , nray be conceived of , by the following incident . Soon after the artist had returned to Springfield , one of his school fellows , on a Saturday 's half-holiday , /z/ engaged him to give up a party at trapball to ride with him to one of the neighboring farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse saddled . West inquired how he was to ride , ' Behind me , ' said the boy ; but Benjamin , full of the dignity of the profession to which he felt himself destined , answered that he would never ride behind any body . ' O ! very well then , ' said the good natured boy , @#@ you may take the saddle , and I will get up behind you . ' Thus mounted they proceeded on their way ; and the boy began to tell Benjamin that bis father intended to send him to be an apprentice . ' In what business ? ' inquired West . ' A tailor , ' answered the boy . ' Surely , said West you will never follow that trade ; ' telling him at the same time that it was fit employment only for females . The boy was a shrewd soundheaded lad and defended his fathers /z/ choice very stoutly , saying that the person with whom he was to learn the business was much respected by all his neighbors. 1 But what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should like to be a painter . ' A painter ! ' exclaimed the boy , ' what sort of a trade is a painter ? I never heard of such a thing . ' ' A painter , ' said West , ' is a companion , for kings and emperors . ' ' Surely you are mad , ' replied the boy , ' for there are no such people in America ; ' ' Very true , answered Benjamin , ( but there are plenty in other parts of the world . ' The other still more amazed , repeated in a tone of greater surprise , 4 you are surely quite mad . ' To this the young artist , still proud of his own choice , replied by asking him if he really intended to be a tailor . ' Most certainly , ' answered the other . ' Then you may ride by yourself , for I will no longer keep your com- /z/ pany , ' said West , jumping from the horse , and immediately returned home . The report of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occasioned his absence from school , and visit to Philadelphia , made a great impression on the boys in the neighborhood of Springfield . All their accustomed sports were neglected , and their play hours devoted to drawing with chalk and oker . Benjamin it must be confessed was the most expert amons ; them , but he often afterwards declared , that , according to his recollection , many of his juvenile companions , evinced a degree of taste and skill in this exercise , that would have done no discredit to the students of any regular academy . Not far from the residence of Mr West a cabinet maker had a shop , in which Benjamin sometimes amused himself with the tools of the . workmen . One /z/ day several large and beautiful boards of poplar tree were brought to it ; and he happening to observe that they would answer very well for drawing on , the owner gave him two or three of them for the purpose , and he drew figures , and compositions on them with ink , chalk and charcoal . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after occasion to call at his father 's , noticed the boards in the room , and was so much pleased with the drawing , that he begged the young artist to allow him to take two or three of them home , which , as but little value was set on them , was thought no great favor , either by the painter or his father . Next day Mr Wayne called again , and after complimenting Benjamin on his taste and proficiency , gave him a dollar for each of the boards , svhich he had taken away , and intended to preserve . /z/ Doctor Jonathan Morris , another neighbor , soon after also made him a present of a few dollars to buy materials to paint with . These were the first public patrons of the artist . About twelve months after the visit to Philadelphia , Mr Flower , one of the justices of the county of Chester , who * possessed some taste for painting , requested Mr West to allow Benjamin to spend a few weeks at his house . A short time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he was most tenderly attached ; and he resolved to show his respect to her memory by devoting his attention exclusively to the improvement of his children ; for this purpose he had sent to England for a governess qualified to undertake the education of his daughters , and he had the good fortune to obtain a lady eminently fitted for the trust . She arrived only a /z/ few days before the young ' artist but she soon discovered the bent of Benjamin 's genius , and the strength and determination of his - mind . Finding him unacquainted with any other books than the Bible , and the works of Richardson and Fresnoy , she frequently invited him to sit with her pupils , and during the intervals of their tasks , she read to him 1 the most striEing passages from ancient history and poetry . It was from this intelligent women that he jbeard , for the first time , of the Greeks and Romans , and the impression which the history of those illustrious nations made on his mind , was answerable to her expectations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lawyer in the town of Lancaster , a placeJP that time remarkable for its wealth , and which had the reputation of posseting the best and most intelligent society in America , those who knew how to distinguish real genius , from mere mechanical art . It was exactly in such a place that such a youth as Benjamin West was likely to meet with that flattering attention , which is the greatest stimulous to juvenile talent . The wife of Mr Ross was greatly admired for her beauty , and she had several children who were so remarkable in this respect as to be the objects of general notice . One day when Mr Flower was dining with them he advised his friend to have their portraits taken , and mentioned that they would be excellent subjects for young West . They accordingly obtained permission of Mr West for the little artiPto go to Lancaster , for the purpose of taking the likeness of Mrs Ross and her family so great was his success in this undertaking that ir was with difficulty /z/ p /z/ be could answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was a person named William Henry , an able mechanic , who had acquired a handsome fortune by his profession of a gunsmith . Oil examining the young artist 's performance , he told him that , if he could paint as well he w-ould not waste his time on portraits , but would devote his time and talents to some historical piece , and mentioned the death of Socrates as a good subject , The painter knew nothing of the history of the philosopher ; and upon confessing his ignorance , Mr Henry , took a volume of Plutarch 's lives and read to him the account given bv that writer of this af- /z/ fecting story . The description produced a great effect on the imagination of young West , and induced him to make a drawing , which Mr Henry approved and requested him to paint . West said /z/ he should be happy to undertake the task , but having only painted faces , and men clothed , he should be unable to do justice to the - slave , who presented the poison to Socrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had among his workmen a very handsome young man , and without hesitating a moment he sent for him into the room . On his entrance he pointed him out to West , and said * there is your model . ' The appearance of the young man , whose arms and breast were naked , convinced the artist that he had only to look into nature for the best of models . When the death of Socrates was finished , it attracted much attention , and led to his fortunate acquaintance with Dr Smith , the provost of the college at Philadelphia . After seeing the picture and conversing with the artist , he offer- /z/ ed - to undertake- to make him , to a cer- /z/ tain degree , acquainted with classical literature ; while at the same time he would give him such a sketch of the taste and spirit of antiquity as would have all the effect of the regular education requisite for a painter . Old Mr West readily consented that his son should go for some time to Philadelphia to take advantage of the provost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days , Benjamin went to the capital , and resided at the house of his brother-in-law , Mr Clarkson , a gentleman who had been educated at Leyden , and was much respected for the intelligence of his conversation and the propriety of his manners . The plan of study which provost Smith had formed for his pupil was extremely judicious . He regarded him as destined to be a painter ; and on this /z/ account did not impose upon him those grammatical exercises of language , which are usually required from the young student of the classics , but directed his attention to those incidents which were likely to interest his fancy and furnish him at some future time subjects for the easel . In the midst of this course of education the artist happened to be taken ill of a slight fever , and when it had subsided , he was in so weak a state as to be obliged to keep his bed , and to have the room darkened . In this situation he remained several days , with no other light than what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the usual effect of expanding the pupils of his eyes to such a degree , that he could distinctly see every object in the room , which to others appeared in perfect obscurity . While he was thus lying in bed , he observed the shad- /z/ owy form of a white cow enter at one side of the roof , and walking over the bed , gradually vanish at the other . This appearance surprised him not a iittle , and he feared his disease had deranged his mind , which his sister also suspected , when he related to her what he had seen . She went immediately and informed her husband , who accompanied her back to the chamber ; and as they were standing near the bed West repeated the story ; declaring , at the same moment , that he saw several little pigs running along ' the roof . This confirmed their fears , that he was delirious , and they sent for a physician . But the doctor could discover no symptoms of a fever , the pulse was regular , the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the patient favorable to his recovery . Still the painter persisted in his story , and assur- /z/ ed them that he then saw the figures of several of their mutual friends passing on the roof over his bed ; and that he even saw fowls picking , and the very stones of the street . All this time his friends could discern nothing of all he described , their eyes being unaccustomed to the gloom of the chamber , and the learned physician himself began to suspect that his patient was really delirious , and prescribing a composing mixture , which the painter submitted to swallow , took his leave , requesting Mrs Clarkson and her husband to come away and not disturb the painter . After they had all left him , curiosity overcame the effect oT the medicine , and the artist got up , determined to find out the cause of this strange appearance . In a short time he divered a knothole in one of the windBhutters , and upon placing his hand oro it , the vis- /z/ ionary paintings on the roof disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple natural cause for what he had seen ; and having found out the way in which it acted , he called his sister and her husband into the room and explained it to them . When able to go down stairs Mr Clarkson gave him permission to cyt a horizontal hole in the shutter in order to obtain , on the wall , a representation of the buildings on the other side of the street . The effect was as he expected , but , to his astonishment , the objects appeared inverted , and every one who passed , to be walking on his head . He did not then undrstand how this mht be remedied , but on his return soon after to his father 's , he had a box made with a hole in one of the sides , and adverting to the reflectiva pogBof the mirror , he contrived , withourever having heard of the /z/ instrument , to invent a Camera , which he found of great use to him , as the means of studying the picturesque appearance of nature , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the art of painting . In this favorable state of things he attained his IGth year , when his father became anxious to seP him settled in some established business , for though he had been indulgent to the genius of his son , the old gentleman was sensible that the profession of a painter was not only precarious , but regarded unfavorably by thereligh " ty of which he was a member : a ; was anxious on his son 's accounqQPRRFcm his ov avoid those observations to w.jhicl was exposed by the freedom he had hitherto granted to the predilections of Benjamin . He therefore-consulted sev- /z/ eral of his neighbors on tBf* subject ; and a meeting of the society of Friends in the vicinity was called , to consider publicly , what ought to be the destiny of his son . The assembly mfet in the meeting house near Springfield , and after much debate , approaching to altercation , a man of the name of John Williamson rose and deliver* a very extraordinary speech upon the Mi ! ject . He was much respected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and enjoyed great influence on account of his superior natural wisdom , and an astonishing gift of eloquence , as a public preacher among the Friends . He pointed to old Mr West and his wife , and expatiated on the blameless reputation they had so long maintained , and merited so vrell. /z/ up in the fear of God and in the christian religion , and the youth whose lot in life we are now convened to consider , is Benjamin , their youngest child , It is known to you all that God is pleas-* ed , from time to time , to bestow upon some men extraordinary gifts of mind , and you need not be told by how wonderful an inspiration their son has been led to cultivate the art of painting . It is true that our tenets deny the utility of that art to mankind . But God has bestowed on this youth a genius for the art , and can we believe that Omniscience bestows his gifts , but for great purposes ? What God has given , who shall dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ournotions ; let us not presume to arraign his judgment by our ignorance , but in the evident propensity af the young man , be assured that 6 se e an iinpulse of the /z/ divine hand operating towards some high and beneficent end . ' The effect of this argument , and the lofty manner in which it was delivered , induced the assembly to agree that the young artist should follow the bent of his genius ; and a private meeting of the Friends was appointed to be holden at his father 's house , at which the youth himself was requested to be present , in order to receive the assent and blessing of the society . On the day of meeting , the great room was put in order , and a numerous company of both sexes assembled . Benjamin was placed by his father , and the men and omen took their respective i'omisHeach side . After sitting some lime in silence , one of the women arose andaddn ssed the mating , on the wisdom of God and the rious occasions in which he selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she had concluded , John Williamson also arose , and in a speech of most impressive oratory , resumed the topic , which had been the subject of his former address . At the conclusion of I this address , the women rose and kissed the young artist , and the men one by one , laid their hands on his head , and/ prayed that the Lord might verify ii his life the value of the gift which hac induced them , in despite of their religious tenets , to allow him to cultivate the faculties of his genius . The history of no other individual affords an incident so extraordinary . It may be added that a more beautiful instance of liberality is not to be foi ; nd in the records of any religious society . There is something at once simple and venerable in the humility with which they regarded their own peculiar principles , con- /z/ trasted with the sublime view they appeared to take of the wisdom and providence of the Deity . It would be impossible to convey any idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the object of its exercise . It inspired him with a lofty desire to attain eminence in his profession , nor did he forget in the honors which he afterwards received from all polished nations , that he was authorized bv his friends and his religion , to cultivate the art by which he obtained such distinctions , not for his own sake , but as an Instrument chosen by Providence to dejseminate the arts of peace , to draw the ties of affection closer , and diffuse over a vider extent of community the interests and blessings of paternal love . When it was determined among the Friends that Benjamin West should be /z/ allowed to cultivate the art of paining , he went to Lancaster , but was hastily recalled by a severe domestic misfortune . His mother was seized by a dangerous illness , and being conscious that she could not live long , she requested that he might be sent for home . Benjamin hastily obeyed the summons , but before he reached the house , her strength was exhausted , and she was only able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him approach the bed , before she expired . Her funeral , and the distress which the event occasioned to her family , by all of whom she was most tenderly be- /z/ loved , detained the young artist some time at his father 's . About the end of August 1756 , however , he took his final departure , and went to Philadelphia . But before proceeding with the nar- /z/ rative of his professional career , it is neccessary to refer to the public transactions of that period , by which his sensibility was powerfully excited . After the destruction of Gen. Braddock 's army the Pennsylvanians being alarmed at the defenceless state in which they were placed by that calamity , they resolved to raise a militia force ; and Mr Wayne , who has been already mentioned as a friend to West , was appointed colonel of the regiment raised in Chester county . This defensive measure was painfully felt by the peaceful quakers , as it indicated an alteration in their harmless manners and habits , so averse to war and strife . West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the troops under the command of Col. Wayne , and the sight of the men in arms , their purpose and array , warmed his lively imagination with /z/ military ardor . With a son of Colonel Wayne , a boy of his own age , with whom he had become acquainted , he procured a gun , and determined also to be a soldier . Younsj Wavne was regu- ti larly drilled , and he in turn exercised West , who being alert and active , soon obtained a decided superiority . But what different destinies awaited them ! West attained , in the exercise of a peaceful art , an enviable reputation , and Wayne who was then his inferior in military skill became afterwards an illustrious commander , and partook , with Washington , of the glory of having established the Independence of America . West soon after his drilling under young Wayne , visited Lancaster ; and the boys of that town having formed themselves into a little company , made choice of him for a commander . Among those who caught the military spirit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprising disposition . He was six years older than Benjamin , and was appointed Captain in Colonel Wayne 's army , under the command of General Forbes , who was sent to repair the disasters which had happened to the unfortunate Braddock ; and to search for the relics on his army . As the European soldiers were not so well qualified to explore the forests , Capt . West w : as appointed , with his company of American sharp-shooters to assist in the execution of this duty , and a party of Indian warriors were requested to conduct him to the places where the bones of the slain were likely to be found . In this solemn and affecting duty , several officers belonging to the British regiment accompanied the detachment , and with them major sir Peter Halket , who had lost his father and brother in the fatal destruction of the army . It might have /z/ been thought a hopeless task that he should have been able to select their remains from the common relics of the other soldiers ; but he was induced to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had seen an officer fall near a remarkable tree , which he thought he could still discover , telling him at the same time , that the incident was impressed on his memory by observing a young soldier , who in running to the officer 's assistance , was also shot dead on reaching the spot and fell across the other 's body . The major had a painful conviction in his own mind that the two officers were his father and brother , and , indeed , it was chiefly owing to his anxiety on the subject , that this pious expedition was undertaken . Capt . West and his companions proceeded through the woods , and along the banks of the river /z/ towards the scene of battle . The Indians regarded the expedition as a religous service , and guided the troops with awe , and in profound silence . The soldiers were affected with sentiments not less serious , and as they explored the beu ildering mazes of those vast forests , their hearts were often melted with inexpressible sorrow , for they frequently found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournful proof to their imaginations that the men who sat there had perished of hunger , in vainly attempting to find their way to the plantations . Sometimes their feelings were raised to the utmost pitch of horror , by the sight of sculls and bones scattered on the ground a certain indication that the bodies had been devoured by wild beasts ; and in other places they saw the blackness of ashes amidst the relics the tremendous evidence of atrocious* Indian rites . /z/ At length they reached a turn of the river , not far from the principal scene of destruction , and the Indian who remembered the death of the two officers , stopped ; the detachment also halted . He then looked round in search of some object , which might recal distinctly his recollection of the ground , and suddenly darted into the wood . The soldiers rested their arms without speaking . A shrill cry was soon after heard , and the other guides made signs to the troops to follow them to the spot from which it came . In the course of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cry had announced to his companions that he had found the place where he was posted on the day of battle . As the troops approached , he pointed to the tree under which the officers had fallen . Capt . West halted his men round the spot , and with Sir Peter Halket , and the other officers , formed a circle , while the Indians removed the leaves which thickly covered the ground . The skeletons were found , as the Indian expected , lying across each other . The officers having looked at them some time , the major said , that as his father had an artificial tooth , he thought he might be able to ascertain if they were indeed his bones and those of his brother . The Indians were therefore ordered to remove the skeleton of the youth , and to br'mz to view that of the old officer . /z/ This was immediately done , and after a short examination Major Halket exclaimed , ' It is my father , ' and fell back into the arms of his companions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in it together , a highland plaid was laid over them , and they were interred with the customary honors . The gloom of the vast forest , the na- /z/ ked and simple Indians supporting the skeletons , the grief of the son on recognizing the relics of his father , the subdued melancholy of the spectators , and the picturesque garb of the Pennsylvaniaii sharp shooters , were ever after present to the imagination of West as one of the most affecting occurrences under which the service was ever performed . On his return to Philadelphia , he again resided with Mr Clarkson , his brother-in-law , and provost Smith in the evenings continued to direct his studies . While his leisure hours were thus profitably employed , his reputation as a portrait painter was rapidly extended , and he looked forward to the time , when he might be enabled , by the fruits of his own industry , to visit the great scenes of the tine arts in Europe , and ihe care with which he treasured the /z/ money that he received for bis portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of realizing his expectations . The prices which he at first fixed for his portraits , were two guineas and a half a. head , and five guineas for a half length . While he was thus employed on portraits a gentleman of the name of Cox called on him to agree for a likeness of his daughter , and a portrait which West had made of his friend and patron , Dr Smith , attracted his attention . It appeared to him to evince such a taste for historical painting , that instead of then determining anything respecting his daughter 's portrait , he gave an order for an historical picture , allowing the artist himself to choose the subject . He made choice of the trial of Susannah ; for in the course of reading the Bible to his mother some time before , he had been led to think the trial of Susannah was a fine subject . He made his canvas about the size of a half length portrait , on which he introduced no fewer than forty figures . It is not known what has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr West was of opinion that , the Trial of Susannah was superior to the Death of Socrates . But although West found himself constantly employed in Philadelphia , he was sensible that he could not expect to increase his prices , if he continued constantly in the same place ; he was also very desirous to see more of the world and mankind ; and , beyond all , he was profoundly sensible , by this time , that he could not hope to attain eminence in his profession , without inspecting the great masterpieces of art in Europe , and comparing them with his own works , in order to ascertain the extent of his powers . Accordingly , impressed with these /z/ considerations , he frugally treasured the earnings of his pencil , that he might undertake , in the first place , a professional journey from Philadelphia . When he found that the state of his funds enabled him to undertake the journey , he went to New York . He found society there much less intelligent in matters of taste and knowledge than at Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parts of Europe , who had come thither for the express purpose of making money , and therefore wholly devoted to mercantile pursuits . Although West found in that city much employment in taking likenesses , destined to be sent across the Atlantic to relations and friends , he met with but few in whom he found any disposition and taste congenial to his own ; and the eleven months which he passed there contribu- /z/ ted less to the improvement of his mind than might have been expected from a city so flourishing . In the year 1759 , the harvest in Italy fell far short of the usual crops , and two merchants of Leghorn wrote to their correspondent , Mr Allen , at Philadelphia , to send them a cargo of wheat and flour . Provost Smith hearing that Mr Allen intended sending out his son commander of the vessel , immediately waited on the old gentleman , and begged him to allow West to accompany him , which he cheerfully agreed to , and the provost immediately wrote to his pupil at New York on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a vessel at Philadelphia loading for Italy , and had expressed to Mr William Kelly , a merchant , who was then sitting to him for his portrait , a strong desire to avail himself of this opportunity to visit the /z/ fountain head of the arts . Before this period , he had raised his terms for a half length portrait to ten guineas , by which he acquired a sum of money sufficient to defray the expenses of a short excursion to Italy . When he had finished Mr Kelly 's portrait , that gentleman , in paying him , requested that he would take charge of a letter to his agents in Philadelphia , and deliver it to them himself , on his return to that city . It stated to the concern to which it was addressed , that it would be delivered by an ingenious young gentleman , who intended to visit Rome for the purpose of studying the fine arts , and ordered them to pay him fifty guineas as a present from him towards furnishing his stores for the voyage ; an instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The artist having embarked with young Allen had a speedy and /z/ pleasant passage to Gibraltar , where in consequence of the war then raging , the ship stopped for convoy . After touching at several ports on the coast of Spain , the ship arrived safely at Leghorn , where mercantile affairs detained Mr Allen some time , and West being impatient to proceed to Rome , bade him adieu . Before his departure from Philadelphia , he had paid into the hands of old Mr Allen the money which he thought would be requisite for his expenses in Italy , and had received from him a letter of credit on Messrs Jackson &,; Rutherford . When they were made acquainted with the object of his voyage , and heard his history , they showed him a great deal of attention , and presented him with letters to Cardinal Albani , and several of the most distinguished characters for learning and taste in Rome ; and as he was unacquain- /z/ ted with French or Italian , they recommended him to the care of a French courier who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the last stage of their journey , while their horses were baiting , West walked on alone . It was a beautiful morning ; the air was perfectly placid , not a speck of vapor in the sky , and a profound tranquillity seemed diffused over the landscape . The appearance of nature was calculated to lighten and elevate the spirits ; but the general silence and nakedness of the scene touched the feelings with solemnity approaching to awe . He looked for a spot to rest on , that he might contemplate at leisure a scene at once so noble and so interesting ; and near a pile of ruins fringed and trellissed with ivy , he saw a stone that appeared to be a part of a column . On going /z/ towards it , he perceived that it was a mile-stone , and that he was then only eight miles from the capital . It was on the 10th July , 1760 , that he arrived at Rome . The French courier conducted him to a hotel , and having mentioned in the house that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine arts , the circumstance seemed so extraordinary , that it reached the ears of Mr Robinson , afterwards Lord Grantham , who immediately felt an irresistible desire to see him ; and who before he had time to dress or refresh himself , paid him a visit , and insisted that he should dine with him . In the course of dinner , that gentleman inquired what letters of introduction the artist had brought with him , on looking at them he observed that it was somewhat remarkable that the whole of them should be addressed to his most particular friends , adding /z/ that as he was engaged to meet them at a party in the evening , he expected West would accompany him . This attention and frankness was acknowledged and remembered by the artist , among those fortunate incidents which have rendered the recollection of his past life so pleasant as scarcely to leave a wish for any part of it to have been spent otherwise than it was . At the hour appointed , Mr Robinson conducted him to the house of Mr Crispigne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the evening party was held . Among the distinguished persons whom Mr West found in the company , was the celebrated cardinal Albani . His eminence , although quite blind , had acquired , by the exquisite delicacy of his touch , and the combining powers of his mind , such a sense of ancient beauty that he excelled all virtuosi then in Rome . /z/ Mr Robinson conducted the artist to the inner apartment , where the cardinal was sitting , and said , ' I have the honor to present a young American , who has a letter of introduction to your eminence , and who has come to Italy for the purpose of studying the fine arts . The cardinal fancying that the American must be an Indian , exclaimed , ' Is he black or white r ' and on being told that he was very fair , ' What as fair as I am ? ' cried the cardinal still more surprised . This latter expression excited a good deal of mirth at the cardinal 's expense , for his complexion was of the darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cardinal , after some other short questions , invited West to come near him , and running his hands over his features , attracted the attention of the company to the stranger , by the admiration he expressed at the form of his head . This occasioned inquiries respecting the youth ; and the Italians concluding , that as he was an American , he must , of course , have been brought up as a savage , became curious to witnes the effect which the works of art contained in the Belvidere and Vatican , would produce on him . The whole company , which consisted of the principal Roman nobility , and strangers of distinction then in Rome , were interested in the event ; and it was arranged that on the following morning they should accompany Mr Robinson and his protege to the palaces . At the hour appointed the company assembled ; and a procession , consisting of upwards of thirty of the most magnificent equipages in the city , and filled with some of the most learned characters in Europe , conducted the young quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that the statue of Apollo should be first submitted to his view , because it was the most perfect work among all the ornaments of Rome , and of course , the best calculated to produce that effect , which the company were anxious to witness . The statue then stood in a case , enclosed with doors , which could be so opened as to disclose it at once to full view . West was placed in a situation where it was seen to the most advantage , and the spectators arranged themselves on each side . When the keeper threw open the doors , the artist felt himself surprised by a sudden recol , lection , and without being aware of the force of wliflt lie said , exclaimed , ' My God , how like it is to a young Mohawk warrior ! ' The Italians , observing his surprise , and hearing but not understanding the exclamation , requested Mr Robinson to translate to them , what he /z/ said ; and they were excessively mortified to find that the god of their idolatry was compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment , and asked him to give some explanation , by telling them what sort of people the Mohawk Indians were . He described to them their education , their dexterity with the bow and arrow ; the admirable elasticity of their limbs ; and how much their active life expands the chest , while the quick breathing of their speed in the chase , dilates the nostrils with that apparent consciousness of vigor which is so nobly depicted in the Apollo . ' I have seen them often , ' added he , ' standing in that very attitude , and pursuing , with an intense eye , the arrow which they had just discharged from the bow . ' This explanation did not lose , by Mr Robinson 's translation , and the Italians were delighted , /z/ saying that a better criticism had rarely been pronounced on the merits of the statue . a The view of the other Threat works /z/ of art did not awaken the same vivid feelings . In the evening , after visiting the palaces , Mr Robinson carried Mr West to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before this , he had been acquainted only with me simple worship of the quakers . The pomp of the Roman Catholiceremonies was as much beyond his comprehension , as the overpowering excellence of the music surpassed his utmost expectations . Undoubtedly he possessed a keen relish for the spectacles and amusements Wf Rome , arising from the simplicity of his education and habits . But neither the Apollo , the Vatican , nor the pomp of the catholic religion , excited his feelings to so great a degree , as /z/ the spectacle which presented itself to his view around the portico of the church . Bred in the universal prosperity of Pennsylvania , where the benevolent were employed in acts of hospitality and mutual kindness , he had never witnessed any spectacle of beggary , nor had he giver heard the name of God uttered fb urge an entreaty for alms . Here , however all the lazars and the wretched of Rome were collected *t getfeih , hundreds of young and old in that extreme squalor , nakedness and disease , were seen on all sides , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and the mercy of Christ ! ' to relieve them , thrilled in his ears , and smote upon his heart to ch a degree , that his joints became as it were loosened , and his legs scarcely able to support him . As they returned from the church , a woman somewhat advanced in life , and /z/ of a better appearance than most of the beggars , followed them , and Mr West gave her a small piece dl coj$per money , the first Roman coin which he had jtfB received in change , and the value of which was unknown to mjm . Shortly afterward , they were joined%.by some of the Italians , whom they haeen in the morning , and while they were conversing together , he felt some one pull Iris coat , and turned round . It was the poor woman to whom he had givefn the piece of copper money . She held out in her hand several smaller pieces ; as he did not understand her language , he concluded that she was chiding him for Ifaving given her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His English friend observing his confusion , inquired what he had given her , and he answered that he did not know , but it was a piece of money , he had receiv- /z/ ed in change . Robinson after a short /z/ conversation with the beggar , told Mr West the sheHiad asked him for a farthing , *But a you gave her a two penny piecg , ' said he , ' she has brought you the change . ' This instance of humble honesty , contrasted with the awful mass of nrisejwith which it was united , gave him a favorable idea of the latent segtiments of the Italians . At this time Mengs ( a famous Italian artist ) was in the height of his popularity , and West was introduced to him at the cardinal 's villa . He was as much struck as any other person , with the extraordinary circumstance of an American coming to study the . fine arts : and begged that Mr West would show him a specimen of his drawing . In returning home our artist mentioned to Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not produce any /z/ sketch like those made by other students ; but that he could paint a little , and if Mr Robinson would take the trouble to sit , he would execute his portrait to show to Mengs 1 The proposal was readily acceded to , and it was also agreed , that except to two of their most intimate acquaintances , the undertaking should be kept a profo nd secret . When the picture was finished , it did him great credit , but before showing it to Mengs , it was resolved that the taste and judgment of the public , with respect to its merits , should be ascertained . Mr Crespigne , one of the two friends entrusted with the secret , lived as a Roman gentleman , and twice a year gave a grand assembly at his house , to which all the nobility and strangers of distinction , in Rome , were invited . It was agreed that the portrait should be ex-/z/ hibited at one of his parties , which happened to take place soon after it was finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in one of the rooms . The first guests who arrived were amateurs and artists , and as they knew that Robinson was sitting to Mengs for his portrait , it was at once thought to be that picture , and they agreed that they had never seen any painting of that artist so well colored . As the guests assembled the portrait became more and more the subject of attention , and Mr West sat behind on a sofa , equally agitated and delighted by their observations , which Mr Robinson reported to him from time to time . Mr Crespigne seizing the proper moment in their conversation to produce the effect intended , said ' The picture is not painted by Mengs . ' ' By whom then ? ' vociferated every voice , l for /z/ there is no other painter now in Rome capable of executing anything so good . ' * By that young gentleman there , ' said Mr Crespigne , turning to West . At once all eyes were bent towards him , and the Italians , in their way , ran and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by this picture , acknowledge him as only second in his art to the first painter then in Rome . Mengs himself , on seeing the picture , expressed his opinion in terms that did honor to his liberality , and gave the : ? artist an advice which he never forgot , nor remembered without gratitude . He told him the portrait showed , that he had no occasion to learn to paint at Rome ' You have already , sir , ' said he , ' the mechanical part of your art : what I would therefore recommend to you , is to see and examine everything deserving of attention here , and after /z/ making a few drawings of about half a dozen of the best statues . 2:0 to Florence , and observe what has been done by art in the collections there , then proceed to Bologna and study the works of Caracca ; afterwards visit Parma , and examine , attentively , the pictures of Corregio ; and then go to Venice and view the productions of the great master there . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paint an historical composition , to be exhibited to the RomarMKpublic ; and the opinion which will then be formed of your talents , should determine the line of our profession you ouht to follow . ' This judicious advice , West found accord so w : ell with his own reflections and principles , that he resolved to follow it with care and attention . But the thought of being in Rome , and the constant excitement arising from extraordinary and in- /z/ tcresting objects , so affected his mind , accustomed to the sober and un ' . form habits of the quakers , that si -p deserted his pillow , and he became ill , and constantly feverish . The public took : n interest in his situation . A consultation of the best physicians in Rome was held on his case , the result of which was a formal communication to Mr Robinson , that his friend must immediately quit the capital , and seek relief in quiet and retirement . Accordingly on the 20th of August he returned to Leghorn . Messrs Jackson and Rutherford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a degree of kindness and hospitality that merits for them the honor of being considered among the number of his early patrons . His mind being thus relieved from the restless delight which he felt at Rome , together with the bracing effect of sea- /z/ bathing , he was soon in a condition to resume his study in the Capital . But the same overpowering excitement of his feelings and imagination , soon produced a relapse of his former disorder , and compelled him to return to I . eghorn , where he was again speedily cured of his fever , but it left him with a painful affection in the ankle , that threatened the loss of the limb . An eminent surgeon , who had introduced many improvements in the treatment of diseased joints , was at this period resident in Florence , and Messrs Jackson and Rutherford wrote to Sir Horace Mann , then British minister at the ducal court , to consult him relative to the case of Mr West : his answer induced them to advise the artist to go to Florence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch and chamber , he was perfectly and radically cured . A state of pain and disease /z/ is adverse to mental improvement ; but there were intervals in which Mr West felt his anguish abate , and in which he was not only able to join in the conversation of the gentleman to whom he had been recommended , but was able , occasionally , to exercise his pencil . When he was so far recovered as to be able to take exercise , and ' to endure the fatigue of travelling , a circumstance happened which may be numbered among the many fortunate accidents of his professional career . Mr Mathews , the manager of the important commercial concerns of Messrs Jackson and Rutherford was one of those singular men , very rarely met with in mercantile life , combining the highest degree of literary and elegant accomplishments , with the best talents lor active business . Affairs connected with the business of the house , and a wish to see the principal cities of Italy , led Mr Mathevvs about the period of Mr West 's recovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should together make the tour recommended by Mengs . In the mean time the good fortune of West was working to happy effects in another part of the world . The story of Mr Robinson 's portrait had made so great a noise among the travellers in Italy , that Messrs Jackson and Rutherford , in sending back the ship to Philadelphia mentioned it in their letters to Mr Allen . It happened that on the very day this letter reached Mr Allen , Mr Hamilton , then governor of Pennsylvania , and the principal members of the government , along with the most considerable citizens of Philadelphia were dining with him . After dinner Mr Allen read the letter to the company , and mentioned the amount of the sum of money which West had paid into his hands , at the period of his departure from America , adding that it must be pretty far reduced . 13 ut , said he with warmth , ' I regard this joung man as an honor to die country , and as he is the first that America has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he frustrated in his studies , for I have resolved to write to my correspondents at Leghorn , to give him from myself , whatever money he may require . ' Mr Hamilton felt the force of this generous declaration , and said with , equal animation , ' I think exactly - as you do , sir , hutyou shall not have all the honor of it , to yourself , and , therefore , I beg that you will consider me , as joining you in the responsibility of the credit . ' The consequence of this % as , that upon West 's going , previously to leaving Florence , to take a small sum of about len pounds from the bankers , a letter was brought in while he was wait- /z/ ing for his money , and the gentleman who opened it , said to him , ' that the contents of the letter would probably afford him unexpected pleasure , as it iustructed him to give him unlimited credit . ' A more splendid instance of liberality is not to he found even in the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having stayed some time there , carefully inspecting every work of celebrity to which he could obtain access , he went on to Venice , visiting in his route all the objects which Mengs had recommended to his attention . Having completed his tour to the most celebrated repositories of art in Italy , and enriched his mind and improved his taste by the perusal , rather than the imitation of their best pieces , he returned to Rome , and applied himself /z/ to a minute and assiduous study of the great ornaments of that capital . In the meantime West was carefully furnishing his mind by an attentive study of the costume of antiquity , and the beauties of the great works of modern genius . In doing this , he regarded Rome only as a university , in which he should graduate ; and , preparatory to taking his degree among the students , he painted a picture of Cimon and Iphigenia , and , likewise another of Angelica and Madora . The applause which they received justified the opinion which Mengs had so early expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were composed . He was honored in consequence , with the marks of academical approbation , usually bestowed on fortunate artists . He then proposed to return to America , with a view to cultivate in his native /z/ country that profession , in , which he had already acquired so much celebrity . At this juncture he received a letter from his father , advising him to go home for a short time before coming to America ; for the mother country was at that period still regarded as the home of her American offspring . The advice of his father was in unison with his own wishes . He could hardly have resolved on quitting Italy more opportunely , for Dr Patonne , a Scottish gentleman , of considerable learning , and some taste in painting , was then returning homeward , and waiting at that time in Rome , until he should be able to meet with a companion . It was therefore agreed that West should be introduced to him ; and it was soon after arranged that the doctor should proceed to Florence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Leghorn , to express to /z/ them his gratitude for their constant and extraordinary kindness , which he estimated too highly to allow him to think of leaving Italy , without performing this pleasing and honorable pilgrimage , ft was also agreed between him and his companion , that the doctor should stop a short time at Parma , until West should have completed a copy of the St Jerome of Corregio , which he had begun during his visit to that city with Mr Mathews . During their stay at Parma , the academy elected him a member , an honor which the academies of Florence and Bologna had previously conferred on Mr West ; and it was mentioned to the prince that a young American had made a copy of the St Jerome of Corregio , in a style of excellence such as the oldest academicians had not witnessed . The prince expressed a wish to see this /z/ extraordinary artist , particularly when he heard that he was from Pennsylvania and a quaker . Mr West was accordingly informed that a visit from him would be acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be introduced to his highness by the chief minister . Mr West thought that , in a matter of this kind , he should regulate his behnviour by what he understood to be the practice in the court of London ; and accordingly , to the astonishment of all the courtiers , he ke t his hat on during the audience . This however , instead of offending the prince , was observed with client pleasure , and made his reception more particular and distinguished ; for his highness had heard of the peculiar simplicity of the quakers , and of the singularly Christian conduct and principles of William Perm . From Parma he proceeded to Genoa , /z/ and thence to Turin ; they then proceeded to France , but remained no longer in Paris than was necessary to inspect the principal works of the French artists , and the royal collections . Mr West , however , continued long enough to be satisfied , that the true feeling for the fine arts did not exist among the French to that degree he had observed in Italy . He next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this memoir was compiled from materials furnished by himself , and was intended to embrace only that period of his life , previous to his visiting England . The professional life of Mr Yest constitutes an important part of an historical work , in which the matter of this volume could not have been well introduced . Mr West , in relating the circumstances by which he was led to understand , without the aid of an instructor , those rules /z/ of art , which it is the object of schools and academies to teach and diffuse , has conferred a greater benefit on young artists than he could possibly have done by the most ingenious and eloquent lectures on the theory of his profession ; and it vas necessary that the narrative /z/ should appear in his own life time , in order that the truth of the incidents related might not rest on the authority of any biographer .
