txt We owe an apology to our readers , for not having taken an earlier notice of this work , which is one of the most valuable that have yet appeared in the United States upon the important subject of which it treats . Mr. Phillips , who was already advantageolisly known to the public by his work on Insurance , and several other literary essays of great merit , has condensed into this volume the results of an extensive course of reading , matured and digested by patient reflection . Without perhaps proposing any entirely new ideas , lie has subjected the whole compass of the science to a new examination ; presented many questions under new points of view ; discriminated , in general with great correctness , between the sound and unsound portions of the current theories ; and developed some important truths in // a fuller and more satisfactory manner than any preceding writer . The reasoning is accompanied , throughout , with copious historical and statistical illustrations , evincing a very accurate knowledge in the author of the economical resources of the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reference to this country ,  --  a great deal of useful information , which it would be difficult to come at so easily in any other quarter . We shall mention , in the course of our remarks , a few points on which we differ from Mr. Phillips ; but we have no hesitation in saying , that in our opinion his work may be read and consulted as a manual , particularly by the citizens of this country , with more profit than any recent publication on the subject with which we are acquainted in the English language . The literary execution of the work is highly creditable to the author . The style is correct , perspicuous , and , as far as the nature of the subject admits , elegant . We shall first offer a few remarks upon the present state of the science , and then notice particularly some of the more interesting portions of the work before us . The great work of Adam Smith , which created the science of Political Economy , is still the foundation and text-book of this branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly original and valuable treatise , which we have upon it . It is one of those standard productions , in which a master-mind , capable of grasping the whole domain of science and letters , has directed its great powers and resources with indefatigable perseverance to the illustration of a single subject . It is not less agreeable in form , than it is valuable in substance ; and , instead of being-as is supposed by some who have not read itdry and repulsive , is undoubtedly , to every reader of mature taste and liberal accomplishments , one of the most interesting as well as instructive books which he can take up . The writers on the continent of Europe , and particularly Say , have done little more than translate and arrange Smith , whose work will , of course , be studied with far more advantage in the original . The inquirer will there find the great and simple principles which constitute the basis of the science , distinctly stated in the most elegant language , proved and illustrated by curious and instructive details of facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most correct practical conclusions . The theories of Smith received a tinge from the philosophical character and tendency of the age in which he lived , and are // in some parts , better adapted to the practical use of a country where individual liberty is struggling for existence under a load of ancient abuses , than for one in which the battle is won , and where the principal object of the patriotic and judicious is to give efficiency to the opposite element of law . But if we even admit , that the work of Smith contains some errors of considerable importance , resulting from the cause to which we have alluded , it must still be regarded , and will probably remain for a long time , the standard treatise on the science of Political Economy . After the appearance of the Wealth of Nations , no important innovation was attempted in the science , until the publication of the Essay on Population by Mr. Malthus . The object of this work was originally purely political , and this circumstance probably contributed very much to procure for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading principle , if admitted , would effect a very important change in the whole aspect of the science of Political Economy . This principle , divested of the technical and somewhat pedantic form under which it was presented by Mr. Malthus , is , that there is a natural disproportion between the demand for , and the supply of the means of subsistence-that this disproportion is the real source of all the moral and physical evil tinder which we suffer  --  and that , although its operation may be to a certain extent counteracted , the mischief is on the whole irremediable . The economical results of this principle are sufficiently apparent . Thus , on a natural view of the subject , the wages of labor are the whole of its produce , or something of equivalent value . No man , who can produce in a given time an article of a certain value , will accept , as the wages of his labor for that time , any other article of less value than the one which he can make himself . But if we admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and necessarily insufficient to satisfy the demand , that is , the wants of the community , it follows , that the market for labor is always overstocked , and that labor will be always at a minimum price , which will be equal to the value of the least quantity of the means of subsistence , that will barely support the laborer and his family . Such is accordingly the theory of Mr. Malthus and his disciples on the subject of wages . Without following out in detail the application of the principle to the several subjects of rent , profits , taxation , and the other // leading titles in the science , it is sufficient for our present purpose to remark , that it leads in all of them to new conclusions , entirely at variance with those which result from the principles previously adopted and maintained in the Wealth of Nations . These new conclusions have been set forth by the contemporary British writers , Maithus , Ricardo , Mc Culloch , and otheis , and constitute the basis and substance of the science of Political Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . On the continent of Europe , these conclusions have been but partially adopted , and the science remains more nearly in the form in which it was left by Adam Smith . The character of a treatise on Political Economy , written at the present day , is therefore determined in a great measure by the view which the author takes of the principle of Malthus . If he adopt this principle , he must acquiesce in the conclusions of the contemporary British writers , and can only hope to improve the state of the science by illustrating these , or adding others deduced in a similar way from the same premises . if , on the contrary , he reject this principle , he must reject with it the whole body of Political Economy as now taught in England , and , going back about half a century , take up the science at the point where it was left by its great founder . In conducting a systematic inquiry into this subject , the first object would therefore be to examine the theory of Malthus , ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is , or is not to be received as the basis of the science . The plan of Mr. Phillips has led him to take a popular , rather than a systematic view of the field of Political Economy , and , although he rejects the theory of Maithus , and with it most of the conclusions of the contemporary British writers , he has not undertaken a formal refutation of the principle . He is rather disposed to consider it as a mere unsubstantial paradox , noworthy of any very serious examination , which has already had its day , and is not likely in future to engage much of the public attention . This view of the subject is , in our opinion , the correct one ; but we think , that Mr. Phillips would have rendered his work more complete and satisfactory , by devoting a chapter , or perhaps a preliminary essay , to this particular point . The high estimation in which the theory in question is still held in England , entitles it to respectful notice ; and this was the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means been wholly superseded by the writers whom // he cites as authorities for a different opinion. * But this deficiency-if it be one-in the work before us , will be less perceived hereafter than it is now . In general , the permanent value of a scienthic treatise is greater in proportion as it is less occupied by a refutation of the erroneous opinions of contemporary writers . The chapter on Innate ideas , in Locke 's Essay on the Human Understanding , which was probably at the time the most popular and interesting one in the work , is now looked upon as nearly superfluous . * We have before us a late work , in two thick octavo volumes , on the subject , by Mr. Sadler , a distinguished member of the British House of Commons , which is noticed in the last number of the Edinburgh Review , in the contemptuous and insulting tone so often employed by that , in many respects , valuable journal . The wurk is written throughout in an excellent spirit , and with a very correct moral feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style .. The argument consists of two parts ; a refutation of the theory of Malthus , and an attempt to establish a new one . In some passages of the former part , the reasoning of Mr. Sadler is powerful and conclusive . We think , however , that he fails in attempting to account for the rapid increase of population in this country almost wholly by the effect of emigration from Europe . Some other writers have perhaps attributed too little influence to this cause during the earlier periods of our history , but the continuance of the same general rate of increase through the last fifty years , when the proportion of the number of emigrants from Europe ( taken at the very highest estimate ) to the whole population is comparatively trifling , proves that this is , after all , not the principal agent in producing the effect . The precise theoretical objections to the sys ! em of Malthus are not distinctly stated in the work of Mr. Sadler . The new principle which he attempts to establish is , that population regularly increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it increases less rapidly in proportion as it becomes more dense ; and this by the effect of a mysterious adaptation of the number of births resulting from a marriage at a given time and place , to the state of population then and there existing . Some of the objections made by the Edinburgh Review to this principle are evidently captious ; but the principle is , we think , improbable in itself , and not proved by Mr. Sadler . There are some facts which apparently tend to show , that population increases less rapidly as it becomes more dense ; but these are easily accounted for in other ways , and , generally speaking , the current of examples is in favor of the directly opposite principle . Compare , for instance , the movement of population among the Indian tribes on this continent and among the citizens of the United States . We regret that Mr. Sadler , who is evidently a person of very considerable talent , and who appears to have employed a good deal of time and labor in collecting the materials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure for reflecting upon them , and preparing them for publication . He promises another volume , and we shall perhaps avail ourselves of the occasion afforded by its appearance , to notice the whole work in greater detail . // By rejecting the theory of ' Maithus with its consequences , and taking up the science where it was left by Adam Smith , Mr. Phillips has at once cleared his subject of a cloud of popular errors , and given a value to his work , which does not belong to any of the recent English productions . But while he discards the innovations posterior to the time of the author of the XVealth of Nations , he is far from following , with a blind and implicit confidence , in the track of that writer . He reasons on the contrary , with perfect independence , on every branch of the science , differs very frequently from Adam Smith , and has taken , we think , on the whole , too lo*v rather than too high an estimate of his merits . On some of the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Phillips 's doctrine ; on others , we consider his attempts at improvement as less fortunate . We regret , for example , that our author has not adhered closely to the master of the science in reoard to the more b great and simple truths which form the basis of it , and which it was his chief glory to have been the first to perceive and distinctly enunciate . These are , that labor is the only source of wealth , and as a necessary consequence , the only measure of value ; and that the division of labor is the principal means of rendering it more productive . On these points , Mr. Phillips either departs from the principles of Smith , or regards them as of little importance , and has thus , we think , thrown some confusion around the general plan of his work . As respects the first of these principles , Mr. Phillips holds , that in estimating the wealth of a nation , we are to consider not merely the accumulated produce of labor which it may possess , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even its political condition , and intellectual and moral character ; every thing , in short , which influences production . Such we take to be the import of the following passage . Political economy embraces the consideration of all the agents of production , and all the causes affecting the productiveness of national industry , and the distribution and consumption of its products . We are not limited in these inquiries to things that are bought , sold , and exchanged , and are subjects of property , since these are not the only things by which the national production is influenced . The people , excepting slaves , are not subjects of property , and yet they are the most important agents in produc // tion . A salubrious atmosphere , by promoting the health of the people , very materially contributes to the productive capacity of a country , yet the air is not made a subject of ownership . Where water can not be procured without great labor , and is , on this account , so scarce as to be sold , the productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , that individuals are thereby made richer , and the community poorer . And this is true , if we understand the wealth of a nation to be its productive capacity , since if one in a hundred is employed in raising water for the others from a deep well , the productive industry of that community for other purposes , is but ninety-nine hundredths of what it would be , if the water were supplied without labor . But if the water were procured without labor , though made a subject of sale on account of its scarceness , the owners of the Springs would be more wealthy by the amount of revenue derived from this source , as is the case with the Arab chiefs who derive revenue from the watering places in the desert of Zaarah , but the productive capacity of the whole community is not for this cause necessarily lessened . This effect follows only in case the proprietor of the well is rendered a less useful subject to the community in consequence of receiving this revenue . He may be either more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , will depend on the wealth and condition of the community , and the character and pursuits of the richer inhabitants . This distinction may be illustrated more clearly , perhaps , by the instances of a canal and navigable river , for if navigation can be done on a river , without tolls , as cheap as it could be done on a canal of the same length paying tolls , the river gives all the facility and advantage to industry , that could be ( lerived from the canal ; yet the canal is of great value to the proprietors as a navigable channel , and the river of no value at all . We perceive , from these instances , that the capacity and facilities for production are not tested and measured by the mere subjects of property , or things bought and sold in a community . It would be unnecessary to notice this distinction , had not the industrial means and faculties of a nation been denominated national wealth , and we must therefore guard ourselves against accepting the word wealth in its ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , although the physical , moral and political characteristics of a commtinmty , are among the most important elements to be taken into view in estimating its general condition , we apprehend , that they are not those , which we habitually look to , when we mean to ascertain its wealth . The wealthiest // nation is not the one which possesses the purest air-the clearest sky  --  the richest soil  --  the most abundant supply of water  --  the best political constitution  --  or the highest intellectual or moral qualities ; but the one which possesses the greatest amount of the accumulated products of labor ; that is-cultivated fields and gardens-houses and workshops-ships , carriages , furniture , machinery of all descriptions , and finally , money , which is the representative for the purpose of exchange of all other articles . It may happen , that the community which possesses the greatest natural advantages also possesses the greatest amount of the accumulated products of labor , and is therefore the wealthiest ; but the reverse is often , perhaps more frequently the case . Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries past , and still is regarded as the wealthiest nation in the world , is perhaps the one of all others which was originally the most sparingly endowed with the good gifts of nature . It is no doubt true , that a given amount of labor will produce a greater or less amount of wealth , in proportion to the natural advantages under which it is applied hut it is also certain , that the greatest natural advantages will not afford the smallest portion of wealth without the intervention of labor , by which is meant the application of our physical and intellectual powers . This being the case , it follows of course that labor is the source of all the wealth of nations , or in other words , is the only source of wealth . As the whole labor of a community is the source of all its wealth , so the amount of labor employed in the production of any particular portion of this wealth , determines the extent to which it forms a part of the general mass , or in other words fixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second of the great leading principles of Smith , and this too is controverted by our author . He denies that value is determined by the cost of production , and denies that labor is the r*atural measure of value . On the first of these points , the difference between him and Smith is perhaps rather verbal than real . He affirms that supposing the first cost and market price , or exchangeable value of things always to coincide , still it would not be the less ti ue , that any article would be more valuable than another , not merely because more labor and capital had been invested in its production , but because a greater quantity of others could be obtained in exchange for it . ' Now it is quite true in the theory // of Smith , as well as that of Mr. Phillips , that the value of a thing depends upon the quantity of others for which it can be exchanged , and it is so defined in the Wealth of Nations . But the question here is , what determines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange ? Why is it , that a yard of superfine French broadcloth may be exchanged for ten dollars , and a yard of cheap cotton cloth for only ten cents ? The answer undoubtedly is , that a proportionally greater amount of labor has been employed in the production of the broadcloth . The nomin'ii or market price of the article does not always ,  - -  as Mr. Phillips justly remarks ,  --  coincide with its real value , as determined by the cost of production ; but this does not prove , that the cost of production is not the circumstance which fixes the real value . The nominal price is constantly disturbed by accidental causes ; but has a constant tendency to return from all its aberrations to the point at which it coincides with the real value : and is therefore said with propriety ,  --  as a general proposition ,  - -  to coincide with it ; just as the magnetic needle is said to point to the North Pole , although it is almost always oscillating under the influence of some little temporary disturbance . In this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mean of an infinite number of minute variations in opposite directions . The value of objects being determined by the amount of labor employed in their production , it follows as a matter of course , that their value is measured by this amount , and that labor is the standard of value . If the capacity of one article to exchange for another be fixed by the quantities of labor respectively employed upon them , it is obvious , that by ascertaining the quantities of labor respectively employed upon any two objects , we may at once learn their comparative value , or the rates at which they may be exchanged . If I wish to know the money value of broadcloth , I have only to ascertain the quantities of labor respectively employed in producing a given quantity of each  --  a yard of cloth , for example , and a silver dollar  --  and their comparative value is seen at once . In practice , the real value of the precious metals which serve as the common medium of exchange , is supposed to be known ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor bestowed upon the article which we wish to compare with them . This is the theory of Smith , and it seems to be almost selfevident , but has yet been a good deal questioned by subsequent writers , and is rejected , as we have remarked , by Mr. Phillips . // The rate of wages , it is said , is constantly fluctuating ; and this fact proves that labor , instead of being a measure of the value of other things , is as variable in its value as any thing else . But it is quite obvious , that fluctuations in the rate of wages have no tendency to prove that labor is not the measure of value . They only prove , that labor is less productive , in some particular article , at one time and place , than it is at another ' . A day 's labor , we will suppose , would formerly produce only a yard of cotton cloth , and will now produce ten . The wages of a day 's labor estimated in cotton cloth , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not that labor is worth more than it was , but that cotton cloth is worth less . And so of the other variations in the rate of wages at different times and places . But how-says Mr. Phillips-is the amount of labor employed upon a given article to be ascertained ? . A native of New-England will do twice as much work in a day as a Hindoo , and will apply his labor with ten times the intelligence and skill . The produce of a day 's labor in New-England will therefore be a very different thing from the prod uce of a day 's labor in India . It is not certain , then , that because two articles have both been produced in the same number of days , t ! : ey are the produce of equal quantities of labor ; and this being the case , how are we to know , when they are the produce of such equal quantities ? To this we answer , that there would doubtless be in practice a good deal of difficulty in bringing to an exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles ; and that labor would consequently be a very inconvenient measure of value for the purpose of selling at retail , or for the transaction of the other ordinary business of life . If a person were to go into a milliner 's shop , and inquire for the produce of an hour 's labor in mrslin or shoe-ribbon , it would take more time to ascertain the quantity he wanted , than it did to produce it . But the fact , that labor is an inconvenient measure of value for ordinary purposes , has no tendency to prove that it is not the real and original standard to which every other practical measure , and particularly money , must be brought back . The case is the same as that of the practical measures of length , w6ight , and capacity . In France , for example , it would be very difficult , if not impossible , in selling silk and xvine at retail , to adjust the quantities wanted , by comparing them with the length of a degree and its divisions ; but we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures now in use , and the only invariable one that could have been employed for this purpose . The beneficial influence of the division of labor in rendering it more productive ,  --  which is the third of the leading principles of Smith ,  --  is admitted by Mr. Phillips ; but is apparently not considered by him as of much importance . He adverts to it incidentally in a single passage ; and does not appear to regard it as one of the fundamental truths of the science . With those who consider it as such ,  --  and we profess to be of the number ,  --  the manner in which he speaks of it will be viewed as a defect in his work . On the first great division of the subject , which respects the principles that regulate the creation of wealth , the theory of Mr. Phillips is on the whole somewhat less satisfactory than might be wished . On the other , which treats of the distribution of wealth , and includes the several titles of Wages , Rent , 1*rofits , and Interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generally correct . It is on this branch of the subject more particularly , that the modern English writers have been led by their adherence to the theory of Malthus into great errors ; and the work of Mr. Phillips will be read with much advantage as a corrective of their systems . We need not follow our author in detail through the exposition of the principles set forth in this portion of the work , which are substantially the same with those of Adam Smith . We may also remark , that here and elsewhere , the object of the author is not so much to lay down theoretical truths in a formal way , as to explain their practical applications , and illustrate them by a mass of instructive and often very curious details . In this respect , his manner is the same with that of the author of the Wealth of Nations , and it is undoubtedly the one best fitted to render the work interesting and useful to the common reader . We extract the following passage as a specimen of the character of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital or investments varies in different countries : According to the Massachusetts valuation of 1821 , the personal estate in the town of Boston , is about twice the value of the real estate , including buildings ; in the town of Salem , the income from each is nearly equal . In Northampton , the income from real estate is valued at about double that from personal . Taking an average of three small inland agricultural towns , the estimated income from real voL . XXXU. - NO. 70. // estate , including buildings , is eight times that for personal estate , and the estjmated income from lands , is to that from buildings and personal estate , about as seven to four , or 7-11 of the income is from lands and 4-11 from buildings and personal estate . But some kinds of personal estate were not included in this valuation , such as furniture , apparel , farming utensils , young cattle , and swine . And the real estate was doubtless returned more accurately and valued higher than the personal . Taking the whole country together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of buildings and personal estate , is equal , at least , to the value of the lands . We may then consider the value of the lands to be partially the result of labor in subduing , fencing , draining , and making roads . We will allot one third of their value to this cause ; and the result will be that two thirds of the whole capital of the community is the direct result of human labor , and one third is the bounty of nature . The value of all capital is estimated by the income derived from it , and this income can not be gained without labor , and it is a matter of interest to discover the share which industry has in the whole production , and how great a portion of the whole income is credited to industry , or in other words , at what value the people rate themselves in comparison with personal and real estate . Recurring then to the same valuation , it appears , that there were in Massachusetts in 1321 , about 122,600 rateable polls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one quarter of the population . A greater part of these people are industriously employed ; we will suppose the whole of them to be so . And in estimating the income from labor , we will not deduct the laborer 's food , since we might as well deduct his clothing and lodging . The whole production of the community is intended for the use and consumption of the people , including the income from rents and profits as well as labor , and men will eat , and must be clad , whether they are idle or at work , so that the value of his labor is not the net wages over and above the expenses of living , but the gross wages without any such deduction . Estimating wages then at seventy-five cents per day , as the medium between the highest and lowest , including all trades and professions , and probably too low , and allowing fifty-two Sundays , and thirty-three days more for holidays and sickness , and idle hands , and the result will be an income of $25,740,000 . The females are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in house*keeping or otherwise , and we will estimate their wages at half the rate of that of the men , making $12,870,000 , which added to the former sum gives $38,610,000 for the income from wages . Jn the valuation above mentioned the whole income from real and personal estate is put down at about $9,000,000 ; but we will suppose it // to be too low , and set it at 12,000,000 . The result is , that three fourths of the whole income of the community is derived from wages , and only one fourth goes to pay rents and profits . To pursue the inquiry a little farther , let us suppose the income of 12,000 , OOQ is derived from property yielding rents and profits at the rate of six per cent . per annum on its value , which in this case will he $200,000,000 ; and we perceive that the income from rents , profits , and wages , for four years , exceeds the whole value of property , real and personal . If the community saves nothing , but consumes its whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume and reproduce the whole value of its real estates and capital of all descriptions . If the people are idle one month , they consume one forty-eighth part of their whole possessions ; if by industry and economy they save the income of one month , they add a forty-eighth part . Whatever measures and enterprises keep the population usefully employed , make the country prosperous and rich , even though a part of them are making silks and raising corn , as some writers suppose the English population to do , at a greater expense of labor than it would cost others to do it for them . It has been the policy of England to keep its population employed , and this is the secret of its growth in wealth and productiveness . The nation has not quietly reposed itself in the theory of those economists , who say that a certain amount of capital will , proprio vigore , put in motion a certain amount of industry , and no more can be done ; a theory which is confuted by the experience of all communities every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage from another part of the work , gives some further very interesting details of the same description . In most communities the agricultural interest is the most important , whether we consider the income derived from it , the kind of products it supplies , or the number of persons employed . The rental of all France , as stated by Mr. Lowe , was in 1792 , 24 millions sterling , and in 1822 , 36 millions , and equal to its whole commerce ; that is , the annual income of the lands was equal to the whole amount of exports . If we suppose the profits of commerce to have been 7 1-2 per cent. , the agricultural income is over thirteen times that of commerce . If the lands are assumed to yield five per cent . on their value , the landed capital is twenty times the amount of the annual exports . The rental of Great Britain is estimated at 217 millions sterling , or six times the amount of that of France , reckoned in money . Notwithstanding the difference in the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rental seems to be too great to be accurate . // It appears by the returns for the direct tax of 1798 , that the value of lands and houses in the United States at that time was about 620 millions of dollars , the number of acres valued being about 164 millions , and estimated , including all the houses , as well those in the towns as in the country , at 3 77-100 dollars , per acre . The value of the lands with their improvements and dwelling houses in the same States , as estimated under the land taxes of 1813 , 1814 , and 1815 , was about 1560 millions , and the value per acre , including the buildings in the towns and in the country , 9 50-100 dollars , assuming the number of acres valued to have been the same as returned under the tax of 1798 . In the mean time Louisiana had been acquired , and the State of Ohio formed ; the value of lands , and houses , and improvements in which latter State , was under these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns under the tax of fl98 , the value of houses is put at about one third of that of lands . Deducting then one quarter from the value of both lands and houses in 1815 , we make the value of the lands to be 1515 millions , without including Louisiana , Alabama , Florida , Mississippi , Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , and Michigan . Since 1815 the lands must have greatly increased in value , but the increase in the money price has not been so great in proportion . As to the number of persons employed in agriculture , they are estimated in Great Britain to be about one third part of the whole population . In the time of Elizabeth , they are supposed to have been six-tenths ; and under George I. four-tenths . In this country their proportion to the whole population is quite as great as it was in England in the time of Elizabeth . Some tables state it at 83 per cent. , but probably too high . It is not surprising then , that agriculture has been considered under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rhe Chinese annual festival of opening the ground in the spring , in which the Emperor , and all the Viceroys and Grandees take a part , shows the high estimation in which the art of cultivation is held in that empire , and the honors there paid to this species of industry have doubtless contributed very essentially to the high state of its cultivation and its great productiveness . The annual cattle-shows and fairs of this country , have a similar object , and they are supposed to have had a great effect already in introducing improved implements and processes , and better species of animals , and plants , and in increasing the productiveness of agricultural labor . ' The chapter on Commerce will probably be read at the present moment with more interest than any other , from its connexion with the political controversies , which now agitate // the country . In this chapter , Mr. Phillips examines at considerable length the question , whether it be the duty and policy of a country to protect and encourage by law the growth of its own ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His argument on the subject is powerful , lucid , and we think , conclusive . Considering tile unanimity and success with which the protecting policy has been acted upon in all ages , by all the governments of the old and new worlds , it is rather singular , that the expediency of it should have been made a subject of dispute ; but such has been the influence of the authority of Adam Smith , that while the practice is wholly in favor of protection , the theories of the modern speculative writers are generally on the other side . We are therefore glad to find what we deem the correct opinion , stated in a scientific form with so much talent as it is in the work before us ; and we particularly recommend this portion of it to such of our readers as are really desirous of obtaining clear and just ideas upon this important subject . It will be apparent from tile tenor of our preceding remarks , that few persons are less disposed than ourselves to depreciate the merits , or undervalue the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindly in the footsteps of any writer . It is clear to us , as well from the particular passages in which this subject is treated , as from the spirit which pervades his w'hole work , that the author of the Wealth of Nations was in some degree influenced by the prevailing temper of the age in which he lived . At that period , the direction of public opinion throughout Europe was towards a reform of existing abuses . The effort of the powerful men , who , from their superior talents and activity , stood forward as the organs and representatives of this opinion , was to extend the sphere of individual liberty , and remove as far as possible all the restraints , political , civil and religious , which had been imposed upon it . The impulse given to the mass of society by these efforts , had a tendency , like every other vigorous movement , to go too far ; and we must expect to meet in the writings and proceedings of the leading men of this period the errors and excesses , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally accompany a strong developement of the principle of individual liberty . We find , accordingly , that all the master-spirits to whom we have alluded , paid their tribute to the still mightier spirit of the times . Montesquieu , Voltaire and Rousseau , // with a crowd of other writers of inferior note , are all obnoxious in greater or less degree , and in different ways , to the objection of having , in their zeal for reform and liberty , depreciated the importance and utility of the opposite principles of order , prescription , and law . The illustrious author of the Wealth of Nations belongs , in this respect , to the same category . We know , as well from the history of his life , as from the internal evidence afforded by the style and substance of his work , that lie was a perfectly sincere and single-hearted man ; but it is evident to any one who reads him without prejudice , and with the light that has been thrown upon his theories by the course of subsequent events , that in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurried into the adoption of some theories , which , if practised upon , would relax the bands of wholesome authority , and reduce society to a state of complete dissolution . With him , government , instead of being , as it is , one of the two great constituent elements of social order ,  --  a principle as high and holy in its origin , and as beneficial in its influence , when kept within its proper sphere , as liberty ,  --  is a positive evil , which is only to be tolerated to a certain extent as a means of counteracting individual excess . The tone of the work corresponds , in this respect , with the substance . Instead of approaching the subject of religion and government with the deep feeling of respect , which a sense of their importance nattirally creates in the minds of all reflecting men , he generally handles them with the air of levity and sarcasm which distinguished the Gontemporary French school . When he has occasion to mention the lawgivers and political representatives of nations , he tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' There have no doubt been , and still are , many statesmen to whom this description might be applied with great justice ; as there are among the clergy runny of the round , fat , oily men of God , ' described by Thomson ; at the bar many lawyers , who realize the legulcius quidamauceps **25;443;TOOLONG of Cicero ; and we may add , many closet philosophers , who are no better than ingenious sophists . But is this the way in which the personal representatives of the principles of order and law are to be spoken of in a serious work , which pretends to compare and estimate the influence that belongs to the different elements that enter into the composition of the great fabric of society ? The clergy are ireated in the same sneering and contemptuous tone . All the // evil that we suffer , results from the action of governments , corporations , universities , classes of men ; and all the good that we enjoy is the effect of the spontaneous , unbiassed , undirected action of individuals . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat the subject here at large ,  --  that this proposition , taken in general , is completely false . While it is certain , that the good of all is best promoted by allowing the largest scope to individual action , which is consistent with the attainment of other really valuable objects , it is equally certain , that the influence of the social principle , when kept in like rna*ner under proper regulation , is , to say the least , not less beneficial than that of the selfish one . It would be strange indeed if the conduct of men were always virtuous and judicious , when they are acting each separately for himself , and always vicious and unwise , when they are acting together for the common good . While we make due allowance for the natural influence of ' a strong current of contemporary opinion upon the mind of a writer , whose natural dispositions were evidently of the purest and most amiable cast ; - while we rather regret than blame the false and unfortunate tone of thinking and feeling to which we have alluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away by it ourselves , and to distinguish , in studying the Wealth of Nations , between the great truths which render it a work of permanent value , and the accidental errors which are a mere reflection of the popular opinions of the time at which it was written . In applying his general principle to the subject particularly before us , it is affirmed by Adam Smith that every individual , if left to himself , will give his labor the direction most beneficial to himself , and of course to the general good . Let him alone , and he will take better care of himself than any body else can take of him . Every branch of industry which it is really desirable for any particular community to possess , will naturally grow up there , and if it do not naturally grow up , the fact proves that it is not desirable that it should be established . Whatever is , is right . Now all this , when interpreted by the aid of the circumstances of the times when Adam Smith wrote , means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at that time incumbered in England , and generally in all Europe , with a multitude of useless and harassing restrictions , which it was very desirable to remove . To conclude , from this state of things , that all legislative regulation of mdi // vidual industry is injurious , was natural enough according to the common mode of reasonino ; but is , after all , nothing more than the ordinary sophism of arguing from the abuse of a thing against its utility . The principle that an individual , if left to himself , will always give his labor the direction most likely to promote his own interest , will not bear the slightest examination . It is infinitely more important to the interest of an individual , not to give his labor the direction of forging bank notes , or robbing on the highway , than it is , that he should pursue this or that particular one among the reputable professions ; and yet many individuals do give their labor this direction , notwithstanding the evident impolicy of so doing , and all civilized *overnrnents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrors of the penal code . The arguments which are habitually *rged against legislative l ) rotection of domestic industry , apply with precisely the same force against a legislative protection of our property and persons from the arm of the pickpocket and the assassin . It is the law of our nature to live in society and , instead of having it in our power , if left to ourselves , to give our labor the direction in every respect the most favorable to our own interest , it would be impossible for an individual , under such circumstances , to labor at all or even to exist . And so far is it from being true that economical matters are , as such , a particularly unsuitable subject for legislation , that they are , in fact , in all countries , the principal and ordinary one . Property itself is a mere creation of society , and the regulation of the tenure and transfer of it , is the great business of legislative bodies and courts of law . All this , on the theory of Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange his own economical concerns , and take care of his property infinitely better than governments and courts of law can do it for him . In short , the principle in question , when pursued into its consequences , strikes at the root of society , and brings us back to the chimerical doctrine of an original state of nature anterior to the existence of any social union , which was the leading heresy of the political sophists of the last century . And yet it is simply on the basis of this wholly untenable theoretical proposition , that Adam Smith and his followers rest their doctrine of the impolicy of affording a legislative protection to domestic industry . Indeed , this doctrine , as stated by those who hold it , is generally accompanied with admissions , which would in a great degree prevent its application to practice , and reduce it to a // mere abstract theory . Even in the Wealth of Nations it is clogged with important exceptions ; and in this country its in-. telligent advocates generally allow , that a legislative protection may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the danger of foreign competition the infant period of such manufacturing establishments as are suited to the state of the country , but require at the same time a large outlay of capital , and a good deal of experience , before they can be brought to perfection . Now , the persons who make this admission , concede the whole question in dispute . It is not contended by any one , that protection should be given to manufactures , which are not suited to the state of the country , and all manufactures require protection in their infancy . This is the precise ground upon which the principle of protection is sustained . And to admit its application thus far , is to allow it in practice to the full extent , to which it has eVer been claimed in theory . We would gladly copy ,  --  did our limits permit , . -. -. the whole of Mr. Phillips 's remarks upon this subject . They are of permanent value , and are particularly interesting at the present moment , when a violent effort is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we are indebted for our present , and on which we must depend for our future prosperity . In revising the work for another edition , which will doubtless be called for at no distant period , we would respectfully recommend to Mr. Phillips a reconsideration of some of his principles , to which we have particularly alluded above , and a rather more methodical disposition of his materials . The imperfections which we have noticed are , however , of minor importance , and we conclude , as we began , by recommending the work to our readers as one of the most valuable of the recent treatises on the subject , with which we are acquainted . It should be purchased and perused with attention by every student of political economy , and by every gentleman of liberal accomplishments , who wishes to understand ,  --  even if he do not take an active part in ,  --  the conduct of the public affairs of the country.
