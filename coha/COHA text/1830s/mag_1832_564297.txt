txt WHETHER the following story is literally consistent with truth , or founded partly on fact and partly on fiction , or merely a production of fancy , I pretend not to decide . It is not inconsistent with the nature of things to suppose , that it may be either of the three . If the reader can be satisfied with nothing below the standard of the superlative productions of Irving or Scott , he will do well to lay this aside immediately . If he can be gratified , in some good degree , with a " plain unvarnished tale , " he is modestly invited to proceed to the perusal of it . The indefatigable , and , in many instances , successful labors of the apostolic Eliot , in civilizing and christianizing the Indians of Massachusetts , are very generally known and highly appreciated . He , in fact , adopted the only rational method for the accomplishing of his purpose . It was a favorite maxim with him , that " the savages must be in a good degree civilized , before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first with the sincere milk of the word , instead of such strong meat , as the most metaphysical mind can with difficulty digest . By collecting together a number of families in permanent habitations , hy teaching them how to construct more comfortable dwellings , than those to which they had been accustomed , by instructing them in agriculture , orcharding , and some of the most important of the mechanic arts , and by inducing them to understand and obey the more plain and practical precepts of the gospel , he made them feel that godliness is // profitable as it respects the life that now is , as well as in regard to the hope which it inspires of a happier life to come . By these means , under Divine Providence , in the course of a few years he had the satisfaction of seeing a number of " praying towns , " inhabited by the children of the forest . The principal of these was Natick . Here the rude wigwam was succeeded by the decent framed house ; the apple-tree took place of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , where , iiot long before , stood a wilderness impervious to his beams , and domestic flocks and herds grazed in the open pastures , where but lately the wild beasts of the forest alone were wont to prowl for prey . A school for instruction in reading , writing , and arithmetic was founded on the spot , where ignorance and indolence had recently reposed . Prayer , praise and thanksgiving were heard to ascend to the Father of all good , in the spirit of joyful hope , where , erewbile , the diabolical powow was howled forth to the imaginary father of evil , through a servile and soul-degrading fear . In the sacred though lowly chapel , the duties of Christianity were taught , and its holy rites administered , and many of the red men walked in its commandments and ordinances blameless . Such was the condition of this settlement , when a respectable English family moved into it and fixed their residence among the aborigines . The father and his sons were competently skilled in the trade of the carpenter , mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in knitting , spinning , we ving , and m*king garments . In addition to these employments , this family cultivated a farm and managed a dairy . They were of essential service in assisting the devout and philanthropic Eliot , not only by exhibiting before their red neighbors examples of piety , virtue , industry and economy , but by ininstructing them in the most necessary and useful arts . In church , in school , and in their daily occupations , they mingled with the natives on the footing of perfect equality . At this time there resided at this place a native , but little past the age of twenty years , whose form was of that manly beauty , for which the aboriginal Americans were so justly celebrated . lie had been for a considerable time a pupil of Eliot and an inmate of his family . He had adopted the English costume and manners . In his person and dress he was remarkably neat and tasteful , and in his deportment graceful and prepossessing . He had studied , with considerable success , several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doctrines and duties of Christianity , and , as he gave abundant evidence that lie had embraced this religion with his whole heart , Eliot was now employing him as a schoolmaster and occasional preacher among the lost sheep of his tribe . Civilization had not rendered him effeminate ; for he retained all his native vigor , and might justly be said to have ained the true object of education , that is , " the possession of a sound mind in a sound body . " In addition to his other qualifications he was skillful in the use of all the simples , known in his nation to be efficacious in the cure of diseases ; and was not unfrequently called upon as a physician , by the white people in the neighboring towns , as well as by those of his own color in the place of his nativity . Feeling unbounded gratitude towards Eliot , his spiritual guide and father , his friendship was very naturally extended to all the white // people , with whom he became acquainted . He very naturally felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , whom he frequently visited ; and , in process of time , he very naturally felt for their eldest daughter , Lydia , about his own age , a somewhat more powerful passion than friendship . Nor is it wholly unnatural to suppose that Lydia , who seldom saw any young men of her own complexion , should at least respect the good qualities of one , whose skin was some shades darker than her own . In reality , both felt a growing attachment to each other , though both were sensible of the inexpediency , if not impropriety , of cberishing it . Tbe increasing mutual fondness of these young persons could not long escape the penetrating eye of Lydia 's anxious mother , who , together with her father , reprimanded her severely , and took measures entirely to prevent in future the visits of Bran , which was the name of our hero . 1-us parents also felt that natural aversion to intermarriages , which is in a great degree prevalent among all nations , even of the same color ; and they used their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a more suitable object . What were the feelings , on this occasion , of the two lovers , ( for so 1 may as well denominate them at once , ) I leave the reader to imagine ; or , if he or she insists on a description of them , one may be found in almost any play , novel or romance , that is worth a perusal . I proceed with my narrative . In a few days Lydia was taken ill with a fever . An English physician was sent for , who came and prescribed , but without effect . Another was called in for consultation . Still she grew worse , and at length was declared past recovery . At this solemn period , the parents were advised to consult Bran , who had been frequently successful in difhicult cases . In that state of desperation , in which a drowning man catches at a straw , her parents consented . He came and prescribed ; the fever speedily left her ; and she gradually recovered her former state of health , strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company and conversation of the physician , or the simples , which he prescribed as medicine , I will not undertake to determine . Certain it is , that , during his visits he found an opportunity to declare his strong and unalterable affection far his patient , and she to declare that , as she owed her life to him , the remainder of it should be devoted to the promotion of his happiness . At this time King Philip 's war was raging , and the English inhabitants , being jealous that the " praying Indians " would join their enemies , barbarously seized them , and hurried them down to an island in the harbor of Boston , where they were closely confined and carefully guarded . Bran , with a very few others , was permitted to remain at home , and assist in guarding the garrison of Lydia 's father ; but her parents still persisting in their opposition to her tender regard for hini , immediately on the restoration of her health , sent her to Medfield , to reside with her uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by uniting with those of her own nation only , her unhappy predilection would be overcome . Here her friends made use of every expedient they could devise , to induce her to transfer her affections . At one time they assailed her with the most serious expostulations ; at another // attacked her with sarcastic raillery . Among other things , such doggrel as the following was handed round among her young associates Fair Lydia thinks it right , Most closely to unite The red rose and the white . " " Sure Lydia would live on the cheapest plan , She asks nothing more than Indian Bran . " But all these exertions drew nothing from the unfortunate girl but sighs and tears . But a few days elapsed , ore another kind of trouble fell upon her and the rest of the inhabitants of that ill-fated town , in which she resided . At day-break they were roused from their slumbers by the tremendous war-whoop of the savage enemy ; most of their buildings were reduced to ashes ; a large number of the people were slaughtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the latter were Lydia and her uncle and aunt . The news of this disaster reached Bran and his associates , in the course of the day , and he instantly resolved to rescue his beloved Lydia , or perish in the attempt . lie disappeared from the garrison ; exchanged his English dress for the costume of the savage warrior ; painted his face in the most terrific style ; supplied himself with the best of arms and ammunition ; and filled his pack with a plenty of provision , not forgetting a purse of money and a large flask of occapee , the Indian name for rum , well knowing the power of both , either in savage or civilized society . Thus provided , he steered immediately for the Wachuset , having learned from spies , some weeks before , that the general rendezvous of the enemy was in the neighborhood of that mountain . By rapid traveling the whole of the succeeding night , and till late in the afternoon of the following day , most of the way through a pathless wilderness , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , as enabled him to overlook the surrounding country to a considerable extent , he halted to take a survey ; and immediately discovered , at the distance of two or three miles , the smoke , high curling from the Indian encampment . He here seated himself upon a log , resolving to take some rest and refreshment , of which till now he had scarcely thought , since the commencement of his expedition . He watched and listened with intense anxiety . In less than half an hour he heard , at the distance of a mile or more from the camp , a most dismal funereal howl of hundreds of human voices , which was responded by an innumerable multitude stationed in the reverberating forest . This arose from the party just returned from Medfield , and was repeated s m* ny time* as they had lost warriors in the assault . To these horrible howlings succeeded the triumphant yells of the savages , according to the numbers they had butchered and brought away captive ; and these , too , were echoed from the rendezvous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsided , night overspread the dense forest , and no objects were visible , excepting the gloomy light of the watch-fires , which dimly shone among the towering cvergreens . A feast was speedily prepared with the spoils they had taken , and a large portion of the iiight was m He hideous with noisy // riot and reveling . Bran now matured his plan of operation for the morning . He determined to use that treachery , which , by savages , is called stratagem , and , by civilized nations , policy in war . He resolved to appear among the enemy at sunrise , to declare himself a deadly foe to the white men , to enlist with those who desired their extermination , and to watch a favorable opportunity to desert with the object of his fondest affection . At dawn of day he moved towards the camp , and at sunrise presented himself before it . The first object , that met his eye , was a lovely white female tied to a stake , surrounded with dry combustibles . At a short distance stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heart-broken captives . Around , in smaller and larger circles , the savages were dancing and shouting with the frenzied ferocity of demons . At the sight of Bran all became instantly still and silent . A chief approached and conducted him within the inmost circle of warriors , in the centre of which the wretched victim was hound to the stake , ready to he sacrificed by lingering tortures to relentless cruelty . The victim was Lydia . Bran instantly knew her ; but he was so disguised by dress and painting , that it was impossible for her to recognize him . As far as in his power he concealed and suppressed his agonizing sensations , and addressed the warrior chiefs , in their own language , to the following effect BaoTnaas-I have been deceived . I thought the white men the children of the great and good spirit ; but I have found them to be the spawn of Hobomok . Their religion is made of good words and bad deeds . They say they love Indians ; but they only covet the lands of Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ; we are now their foes . The white men have made prisoners of my father , mother , brothers , sisters , friends . I hunger after revenge . I thirst for white men 's blood . I take hold of the same tomahawk with you . Brothers-I know that young woman at the stake . Give her up to me . Let me be her torturer . Let her blood in part allay the burning thirst , that is consuming my vitals . I know some of the other captives . Let me torture them . It will increase their torment to know that it is inflicted by me . Brothers-I have done . My heart is yours already . Will you accept my hand to help you to annihilate the white men ? This talk was received with loud shouts of approbation , and Braii was adopted as a chief . Lydia was given up to his disposal . While lie was releasing her from the stake , he informed her who he was , what was his object , and how she must conduct herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity , in presence of the Indians , and that she must quietly submit , the better to conceal their intention to desert . Having unbound her , he carried her fainting to a wigwam , which was appropriated to his us , spread his blanket on the ground , placed her upon it and administered cordials and other refreshments , which he had brought with him , and which soon revived her . He now learned that the cause of her sentence to the torture was her endeavoring to escape from captivity ; and that the rest of the prisoners were forced to be spectators of the sacrifice , to deter them from a sirnilar attempt . Bran 's next object was to get Lydia 's uncle and aunt into his possession . For this purpose , he invited to his wigwam the three Indians , who captured Lydia and her relatives , and consequently claimed them as their property . here , after telling them , in her hearing , how lie meant to torture her and her relations , if he could gain possession of // them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ster , and the still more grateful donation of a generous dram of occapee ; offering , at the same time , to trade with the other two on the same conditions . His proposal was eagerly accepted , and the captives delivered into his custody . He would gladly have purchased more of them , but feared that , by attempting too much , he should meet with a disastrous disappointment . The three Indians having retired , well satisfied with his treatment of themselves and the prisoners , he gave the latter brief directions how to behave , and then invited the principal chiefs to a council of war . He told them , that the white men knew where they were , and that on the next day a numerous and powerful army would attack them . lie advised them , therefore , to send off , towards Connecticut river , the old men , women , and children , and that the stout and brave warriors should remain where they now were , to give the Englishmen battle . His plan was approved , and preparations immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that small guards should be placed on all sides of the camp , and that the main body should sleep on their arms . As Bran 's wigwam was one of the outermost , and barricaded with logs , it was designated as one of the guard-houses , and his company was appointed as one of the guards . At dark , Bran planted his sentinels , in a line with the guard-house , on each side of it , at a considerable distance from it and from each other , promising to relieve them at midnight , by those , who were to sleep at his quarters till that time . A death-like silence now prevailed throughout the camp , when Bran drew forth his flask of occapee , having previously infused into it a strong decoction of soporific herbs , and treated his joyous soldiers to a dram , which speedily laid them asleep for the night . They might now have easily destroyed the sleeping foemen ; but , knowing that their death would be avenged by the destruction of at least an equal number of their captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired hour of escape had now arrived . No time was lost . Bran slung his pack , replenished with provisions , and seized his trusty rifle . The uncle did the same with the best supplied pack and the best rifle and accoutrements , belonging to the Indians . The aunt and niece took each a brace of pistols and suitable ammunition , which the Indians had recently plundered from the English . Bran moved forward , Lydia and her aunt followed rank entire , and her uncle brought up the rear . Their homeward march was rapid , being quickened by the most animating hope and most appalling fear . Daylight found them among the ruins of Lancaster . Here they secreted themselves among the rubbish in the cellar of a house , that had been demolished , with most of the buildings in that town , hut a few weeks before . As it happened , however , their fear of being pursued was groundless ; for so soon as the Indians discovered that Bran had deserted with his white associates , and that their companions in arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouse them , they were struck with a panic . They concluded that he was a sorcerer , and that it would be vain to pursue him . Fearing also that an English army might be on the way to meet them , they hastily decamped , bay // ing the sleeping guard , should they ever chance to wake , to follow them and explain the mystery of their enchantment . Bran and his companions lay concealed the whole of the day , and at night set forward with renewed vigor and alacrity . They traveled all night ; and the next morning the sun rose upon them in the hospitahle township of Concord . The worthy inhabitants of this place welcomed them with hearty congratulations , and furnished them with horses and an escort for the remainder of their journey . About noon the parents of Lydia had the inexpressible happiness of embracing their daughter , and brother and sister , and of most heartily thanking their deliverer ; who , having scoured the paint from his countenance appeared about as light-colored and comely , in their eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded the release of the " praying Indians " from their cruel confinement , declaring that they were all as ready as himself to be serviceable to the English ; and by the kind co-operation of Eliot and Gookin , they were soon restored to their former dwellings . The reader , especially the youthful reader , is , no doubt , anxious to know if this second Othcllo was finally married to the Desdemona , whom he had twice rescued from the very jaws of death . He wasand by " that holy man of God , the apostle Eliot ; " and , in so far as my information extends , they lived and died as virtuously , piously and happily , as most married couples , whose complexion is the same .

I have a passion for botany , and am wont , in the spring , to plant flower-seeds in all the land I can call my own ,  --  a possession which may easily be measured with a yard-stick . This year , my seeds rotted in the ground . " Bless your heart , " cried a neighbor , to whom I mentioned the circumstance , " how could you expect warm weather when a comet is coming 2 " He had hardly done speaking , when up came another neighbor , and desired to purchase a privilege in my tomb . He was anxious to provide himself a place of sepulchre forthwith , before the comet should have raised the price of the article .

Expecting to find an acceptance of the terms I had foolishly offered , I opened the epistle , and , to my great relief , read as follows , verbatim .

The next moTning my little Tom returned , weeping , from his outward-bound voyage to school . Aunt Croaker , he said , had told him that there was a fellow round the corner with fiery horns , and a prodigious tail . This dangerous fellow 's name was Comet . I was obliged to convey the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at night he spoke of Mr. Comet in his dreams . When I accused my milk-man of watering his milk , he threw the blame on the comet . My butcher sold me a tough steak , and pleaded in excuse that the " hairy meteor " had put back the grass , so that good beef could not reasonably be expected . These arguments were not to he disputed , so that I have since lived chiefly on fishes , and paid clean silver for dirty water . Two or three of my acquaintances have insured their lives , and a reat *a any have made their wills . I have been advised to do the same ; but I do not feel disposed to do so . It is my firm resolution to rely on Providence , as I have always done . Moreover , I am told by some who are better acquainted with astronomy than myself that the eccentric spheroid will come no nigher to us than some hundreds of millions of miles . They say , too , that the worst it can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horns , and that its consistence is not thicker than hasty-pudding . Therefore , though the comet is said to be scalding hot , I do not think that the steam can reach us ; and as for the bull , I care not what happens to him . I have had a mortal aversion to all bulls , ever since I was chased by one in my eleventh year . There is small reason , as the press is now conducted , to give credence to what the newspapers say . However , when they all agree in // stating any particular fact , I think we may believe them . At the time I write , ( July 3d ) they concur in affirming that the Union is in dan* ger . A friend of mine , who has hut lately returned from the south* tells me that the mob tore the coat from his back , because it had paid duties . They told him that they were resolved to nullify , and would " hoe their own row " in spite of all the Yankee pedlars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would ever be caught eating a salted fish . This happened somewhere in South-Carolina . So it seems that there is a popular excitement at the south , too . Still I do not believe that the Southrons will ever nullify . They are aware that Bunker 's Hill stands just where it did sixty years ago . Nevertheless , their threats have created no small anxiety . Then came a report of bloody war on the frontier of Illinois . The Saques and Foxes had broken a treaty , and fallen upon the borderers , eight thousand strong , though the two united tribes can not muster over a thousand effective men , and it is not pretended that more than half of them have taken up arms . I speak advisedly . Two thousand friendly Menomenies , it is said , are ready to join the United States troops against the Saques and Foxes . Now , the Menomenies can not muster more than two hundred warriors , and , therefore , can not lend us two thousand . Moreover , the treaty which the hostile Saques and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsion : ergo , they are not much in the wrong . No fair treaty has been made with Indians , for lands , since the administration of Washington ; and it is time that we should find that we can not always trample on the weak with impunity . However , the Saques and Foxes will be put down , ultimately ; but , my life on it , it will be found that the eight thousand stated to be in the field , will be found to be no more than five hundred , if so many . So much for the western popular excitement . Then came the Philadelphia Fencibles . Their visit was announced a month beforehand . One of our Boston companies had set the example of a grand unmilitary " spunging expedition , " as Johnston calls it , and the Philadelphians had a right to hospitality in return . So far , was so good ; but our southern invincibles were received with as much pomp and parade , as if they had come to deliver us from the burthens of the " accursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came as far as Roxbury by steam-boat and stage-coach , as soldiers should do , and thence strolled , ( I can not conscientiously say that they marched ) into the city on foot .

Even the brigadier-general and his suite joined the escort . Then did babes and women shed tears of delight . Then did shopkeepers and the apprentices of shopkeepers , and eke all the friends of that " great arm of our national defence , " the militia , stare and gape . My son played truant , for which I " tickled his catastrophe ; " and my shop-boy deserted his post behind the counter , leaving the door open , to see the frolic . Some " clever fellow , " or fellows , took advantage of his delinquency to examine and empty the till . I forgive him or them , for he or they was or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife dragged me forth to see the show . The crowd , and heat , and dust , made my head ache , and I believe that I should have fainted // under the rays of military glory , had I not had the good fortune to secure a place in a second story . I saw the procession- " visions of Folly , spare my aching sight ! " I served in my youth , and can therefore speak of this matter understandingly . Infantry on horseback , with side arms , or at least , the sheaths ! Those on foot , that is , the Philadelphia company , and that in " bran new " uniform , marched well enough , but for the rest-what will the militia come to ! Each cavaher demonstrated his bodily vigor before the ladies , by an incessant flapping of the elbows . I expected every moment to hear the officers at least crow . Each held his body bent to a semicircle ; some reached desperately at their stirrups ; the knees of others threatened bloody war with their chins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells to their caps . It made my heart sick to see how ridiculous , good , sober citizens could make themselves . If they had separated in pairs , and knuckled down at marbles on the side-walks , they would have less stirred my pity . I could have forgiven little children for playing sojer ; but men ! I can not trust myself to say any thing more . For a week , boys could hardly be gotten to school , or apprentices to work . It has been computed that this popular militia exciteinent cost the city fifty thousand dollars worth of time and labor . Cheap , as a broom ! But the CHOLERA  --  the Cholera-O the Cholera ! Every one has his brain , and his abdomen , and his mouth full of cholera . The cholera is about to decimate us . Every one inquires , What we shall do to be saved from the cholera ? Reason replies , in the words of inspiration , " Do thyself no harm " by anticipations of trouble and evil , which may never come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guide your steps . Live soberly , temperately , cleanly . Be charitable to the poor , and attentive to the sick . Hope all things , endure all things , and leave the result to Providence . Undoubtedly this dreadful and dreaded spirit is on its way towards us ; but we may accelerate its arrival . The faculty agree that terror lends it wings . It will not , probably , visit us with even its usual severity . Boston is peculiarly happy in its airy location , and the circumstances and habits of her citizens . New-York , it is hikely* , will suffer more . Her population are more closely packed , she has more absolutely wretched denizens ; and , in a panic similar to that which now prevails , she , last year , mercilessly destroyed her scavengers , the dogs . These animals , so superior in usefulness , in intelligence , and in all the moral virtues to the ruffians who butchered them , would have saved hundreds , by removing the filth which will now generate cholera . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three persons unto death . By killing them , New-York has struck a balance against herself . I am heartily glad to find that buildings have been set apart for hospitals in different parts of the city . There were some , who , when sanative measures were first suggested , would have had but one , which they would have placed in the most remote part of South-Boston . Luckily , this opinion did not prevail . According to the best authorities , the crisis of cholera arrives very soon after its access ; in most instances , within an hour . If , therefore , there were but one remote hospital , nine patients out of ten would die before they could be conveyed // to it . Such a regulation would have been a sentence of death to the poor . Especially do I hope , that , if the cholera reaches us , the city authorities will not permit the water to be drained from the Back bay , in any case . To open the flood-gates would he to expose the south part of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bad enough already . I live near the Back bay . There are a great many boys in my neighborhood , whose supreme delight it has long been to witness the aquatic spasmodic convulsions *of drowning cats and dogs . A score of these animals are at this moment anchored within a hundred yards of my house , and when the water is out , the breeze by no means resembles an " air from heaven . " Our health officers would do well to nose this nuisance , and keep the water in . The body of it is too large to admit of stagnation . Would it not be well to erect pillories for the punishment of such editors as fill their columns with unfounded rumors of pestilence , thereby killing some with fright , and making others wish for death ? Would it not be well to compel every quack , whether in petticoats or inexpressibies , to swallow every dose he or she may prescribe to others ? There be many opinions respecting cholera . Peter Plum has heard and believes , that it only attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no value . He , therefore , eats turtle soup , and is confident that he shall escape . Tim Tipple has heard that brandy is the " sovereir thing on earth " in spasmodic disorders . He likes the idea passing well . He was formerly wont to drink five drains per diem , but now he swallows fifteen . Many have great faith in humiliation and fasting , though cholera is said to effect immediate entrance into empty stomachs . Schoolmasters and schoolboys are generally of this belief . Apothecaries , who have a stock of camphor and opium on hand , generally consider the cholera a dispensation of Providence , which ought to be thankfully received . Our board of physicians have recommended a clear conscience as a preventive . Some who do not know the meaning of the word , and others who have disposed of the thing , laugh at the prescription . Many , who think that Africa is the native country of Americanborn blacks , hope that the cholera will effect their favorite project of removing the above-named people . Doubtless it would save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes are horn heirs to suffering , and , therefore , their wishes are in accordance with humanity . Philip Pauper is a strenuous advocate for the CC Social System . " He hopes that a great deal of property will soon be without an owner , and that he shall get a share . Frank Fidget declares , that if the cholera passes Boston without calling , he shall be grievously disappointed . He will , in that case , he says , have fretted himself almost to death for nothing . It almost broke his heart to hear that the tariff bill had passed the House of Representatives , for he has been prophesying a dissolution of the union any time in the last fifteen years . My maiden aunt Prue believes that the cholera will never be such an atheist as to attack the clergy . She even cherishes the hope that // the order of sanctity will protect all females who belong to the church . As for the men , she cares not what becomes of them , for they have neglected her . Many children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have disagreeable partners , think that the prospects of our country were never so brilliant as now . To conclude seriously , the fiend is not so insatiable as he is generally supposed to be . There was , indeed , a great mortality in Quebec . The papers tell us the reason . We have it on good authority , that five thousand emigrants landed in that city in one week , destitute , and almost naked . They lodged on the bare ground , and ate little . New potato whisky was their drink , and their food , if they had any , was mean and scanty . Was it wonderful that many perished ? Opiates are prescribed in all spasmodic disorders , and especially in cases of cholera . Physicians vary the doses according to the constitution of the patient . I have seen a robust man swallow a hundred and eighty drops of laudanum , without relief , in a case of ordinary cholic . When the like happens , the doses are repeated till the pain ceases , or the patient can bear no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our excellent physicians , ( may Heaven preserve them ! ) did wisely in prescribing but fifty drops of laudanum , as a general rule . After all , no person of regular habits has much cause for alarm . Steel and gunpowder destroyed more lives in the battle of Bridgewater , than the cholera has done in the city of Europe , where its ravages were greatest , the number of persons exposed in each case being considered . Few men quail at the prospect of a battle-why should they fear the cholera more ? X.@@183068310.txt FOR a short time after the execution of Toopunkah Zeze and his accomplice the Indian country remained quiet . The Dahcotahs avoi ' *led all intercourse with the whites . They were angry at the death of their fellows , indeed , and spoke of vengeance among themselves ; but they either were convinced of the justice of what had been done , or knew the superior force of the whites too well to think of taking any active measures . However , they resolved to make cats ' paws of the Winnebagoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided character than themselves . This tribe , as their traditions say , were driven from Mexico by the companions of Cortez , or their successors . The tradition is probably correct in point of fact ; for they state that they resisted all attempts to expel them from their native land till the white invaders hunted them with dogs of uncommon size and ferocity ; probably , these were the bloodhounds since employed to subdue the Maroons in Jamaica . The Dahcotahs have a similar tradition . Be that as it may , the Winnebagoes retained an inveterate antipathy to the Mexican Spaniards , till very lately . They have now transferred it to the people of the United States . Some old men among them yet remember the excursions they were wont to make in their youth to the borders of Mexico , whence they brought horses , captives , &amp;c . These people have more courage and more national character than any tribe of the northwest . Drunkenness is not so common among them as among other tribes , and they are not so fond of mixing blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good many of them joined the confederacy of Tecumseh , and sixty of their best and bravest warriors were killed at Tippecanoe . Several years since , when the fifth United States regiment of infantry ascended the Mississippi , they halted at Prairie du Chien , where they were visited by a great many Winnebagoes . An aged warrior accosted Captain Gooding , as he landed on the beach , and offered him his hand . " I think , " said the Winnebago , " that I could tell what ails your neck , that you should have such a great scar upon it . " " Probably you could , " replied the Captain , " you may have reason to know that there ' is a Winnebago bullet in my flesh . " " Ay , " ' returned the savage , " and I could tell you who put it in . But you are a brave man , and we are all friends now . " Apparently the old man considered this reminiscence an excellent jest ; for he laughed heartily . No tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was their ancient custom to take five lives for one , and it is notorious on the frontier , that no blood of theirs has been shed , even in modern days , that has not been fully avenged . They used , too , to wear some part of the body of a slain enemy about them as a testimonial of prowess . We well remember a grim Winnebago , who was wont to present himself before the whites , who passed the portage of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers , with a human hand hanging on his breast . He had taken it from a Yankee soldier at Tippecanoc. it was not difficult to stir up such a people to hostility , and , moreover , circumstances favored the design of the Dahcotahs . There is , or was , a village of Winnebagoes on the Black river , not far from the Dahcotah town , of which Wawpah-ha-Shah is chief . The two tribes are descended from the same stock , as their languages abundantly prove , and the claims of common origin have been strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time when Toopunkah Zeze was put to death at Fort Snelling , the Red Bird was absent from his Winnebago village , on an expedition against the Chippewas . He returned unsuccessful , and consequently , sullen and malecontent . Till this time , he had been noted among his tribe for his friendly disposition toward the " men with hats , " as Indians call the whites , and among the traders , for his scrupulous honesty . However , this man , from whom no white person beyond the frontier would have anticipated injury , was easily induced to commit a bloody and unprovoked outrage . Certain Dahcotah ambassadors arrived at the Red Bird 's village , with a lie in their mouths . " You have become a by-word of reproach among us , " said they . " You have just given the Chippeways reason to laugh at you , and the Big Knives also laugh at you . Lo while they were among you , they dared not offend you , but now they have caused Wamandoosgarra-Ha and his companion to be put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bigger than the // *pots in a bead garter . " The tale was believed , and a cry for vengeance arose throu bout the village . It was decided that something must be done , and the Dahcotah envoys promised to lend a helpin* hand . A few days before , two keel-boats had ascended the river , laden with provisions for the troops at Fort Snelling . They passed the mouth of Black river with a full sheet , so that a few Winnebagoes , who were there encamped , had some difficulty in reaching them with their canoes . They might have taken both boats , for there were but three firelocks on board ; nevertheless , they offered no injury . They sold fish and venison to the boatmen , on amicable terms , and suffered them to pursue their journey unmolested . We mention this trifling circumstance , merely because it was afterwards reported in the St. Louis papers , that the crews of the boats had abused these Winnebagoes shamefully , which assuredly was not the case . The wind died away before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated on the right bank of the Mississippi , twelve or fifteen miles above the mouth of Black river . Here the Dahcotahs peremptorily commanded them to put ashore , which they did . No reason was assigned for the order . Upwards of five hundred warriors immediately crowded on board . A passenrer , who was well acquainted with the Dahcotahs , observed that they brought no women with them , as was usual ; that they were painted black ( which signifies either grief or hostility ; ) that they refused to shake hands with the boatmen , and that their speech was brief and sullen . He instantly communicated his observations to Mr. Lindsay , who commanded the boats , and advised him to push on , before the savages should have discovered that the party were wholly unarmed . Lindsay , a bold-hearted Kentuckian , assumed the tone of command , and peremptorily ordered the Dahcotahs ashore . They , probably , thought that big words would be seco ded with hard blows , and complied . The boats pushed on . Several Indians pursued them along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defiance ; but they offered no farther molestation . The Dahcotah villages higher up showed much ill will , but no disposition , or rather no courage , to attack . Altogether , appearances were so tlireatenin * , that on his arrival at Fort Snelling , Mr. Lindsay communicated what he had seen to the commanding officer , and asked that his crew should he furnished with arms and ammunition . The request was granted ; his thirty-two men were provided with thirty-two muskets , and a barrel of hall-cartridges . Thus secured against attack , the boats commenced the descent of the river . In the mean while , the Red Bird had cogitated upon what he had heard , every tittle of which he believed , and had come to the conclusion that the honor of his race required the blood of two Americans at least . He therefore got into his canoe with Wekaw , or The Sun , and two others , and paddled to Prairie du Chien . XVhen he got there , he waited upon Mr. Boilevin in the most friendly manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of the Americans . The venerable agent admitted his claims , but absolutely refused to give him any whisky . The Winnebago chief then applied to a trader in the town , who , relying on his general good character , did not hesitate to furnish him with an eight gallon keg of spirits , the value of which was to be paid , in furs , in the succeeding autumn . There was an old colored woman in the village , whose five sons had never heard that they were inferior beings , either from the Indians or the Canadian French . Therefore , having never considered themselves degraded , they were not degraded . On the contrary , they ranked with the most respectable inhabitants of the place . We knew them well . One of them was the village blacksmith ; the others were substantial farmers . Their father was a Frenchman , and their name was Gagnier . One of these men owned a farm three miles from Prairie du Chien , where he lived with his wife , ( a white woman ) two children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Bird repaired with his three companions , sure of a fair reception ; for Regis Gagnier had always been noted for his humanity to the poor , especially the Indians . Regis Gagnier invited his savage visiters to enter , hung the kettle over the fire , gave them to eat , and smoked the pipe of peace with them . The Red Bird was the last man on earth whom he would have feared ; for they were well acquainted with each other , and bad reciprocated good offices . The Indians remained several bours under Gagnier 's hospitable roof . At last , when the // Life beyond the Frontier . farmer least expected it , the Winnebago chief leveled his gun and shot him down dead on his own hearth-stone . Liepcap was slain at the same instant by Wekaw . Madame Gagnier turned to fly with her infant ( of eighteen months . ) As she was about to leap through the window , the child was torn from her arms by Wekaw , stabbed , scalped , and thrown violently on the floor , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave way when she snatched up a gun that was leaning against the wall , and presented it to his breast . She then effected her escape . Her eldest son , a boy of ten years , also shunned the murderers , and they both arrived in the village at about the same time . The alarm was soon given ; but when the avengers of blood arrived at poor Regis Gagnier 's house , they found in it nothing living but his mangled infant . It was carried to the village , and , strange as it may seem , recovered . The Red Bird and his companions immediately proceeded from the scene of their crime to the rendezvous of their band . During their absence , thirty-seven of the warriors , who acknowledged the authority ef the Red Bird , had assembled , with their wives and children , near the month of Bad Axe river . They received the murderers with exceeding great joy , and loud approbation of their exploit . The keg of liquor was immediately set abroach , the red men began to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they had already done and intended to do . Two days did tbey continue to revel ; and , on the third , the source of their excitement gave out . They were , at about four in the afternoon , dissipating the last fumes of their excitement in the scalp dance , when they descried one of the keel-boats before mentioned , approaching . Forthwith , a proposal to take her and massacre the crew , was made and carried by acclamation . They counted upon doing this witbont risk ; for they had examined her on her way up , and supposed that there were no arms on board . Mr. Lindsay 's boats had descended the river together as far as the village of Wapaha-Sha , where they expected an attack . The Dahcotahs on shore were dancing the war dance , and hailed their approach with insults and menaces ; but did not , nevertheless , offer to obstruct their passage . The whites now supposed the dancer over , and a strong wind at that moment beginning to blow up stream , the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the advantage of the under current , and , of course , gained several miles in advance of the other . So strong was the wind , that all the force of sweeps could scarcely stem it , and , by the time the foremost boat was near the encampment , at the mouth of the Bad Axe , the crew were very willing to stop and rest . One or two Frenchmen , or half-breeds , who were on board , observed the hostile appearances on shore , and advised the rest to keep the middle of the stream ; but their counsel was disregarded . Most of the crew were Americans , who , as is usual with our countrymen , combined a profound ignorance of Indian character with a thorough contempt for Indian prowess . They urged the boat directly toward the camp , with all the force of the sweeps . There were sixteen men on deck . It may be well to observe here , that this , like all keel-boats used in the Mississippi valley , was built almost exactly on the model of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their French companions on their apprehensions , and the boat was within thirty yards of the shore , when suddenly , the trees and rocks ran* with the blood-chilling , ear-piercing tones of the war-whoop , and a volley of rifle-balls rained upon the deck . Happily , the Winnebagoes had not yet recovered from the effects of their debauch , and their arms were not steady . One man only fell by their fire . He was a little negro , named Peter . His leg was dreadfully shattered , and he afterwards died of the wound . The rest immediately made the best of their waybelow . Then Peter began to curse and to swear , d-g his fellows for leaving him to be shot at like a Christmas turkey ; but finding that his reproaches had none effect , he also managed to drag himself below . All this passed in as little time as it will take to read this paragraph . Presently , a voice hailed the boat , in the Saque tongue , demanding to know if the crew were English . A half-breed Saque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , " said the querist , " come on shore , and we will do you no harm , for we are your brethren , the Saques . " " Dog , " replied Beanchamp , " no Saques would attack us thus cowardly . If you want us on shore , you must come and fetch us . " With that , a second volley came from the shore ; but as the men were now lying prone in the bottom of the boat , below the water line , they all escaped , but one . One man , an American , named Stewart , fell . He Imad risen to return the first fire , and the muzzle of his musket protruding through a loop-hole , showed // some Winnebago where to aim . The bullet struck him under the left arm , and passed directly through his heart . He fell dead , with his finger on the trigger of his undischarged gun . It was a hot day , and before the fight was over , the scent of the gunpowder could not overpower the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , encouraged by the non-resistance , now rushed to their canoes , with intent to board . One venerable old man endeavored to dissuade them . He laid hold on one of the canoes , and would , perhaps , have succeeded in retaining it ; but in the heat of his argument , a ball from the boat hit him on the middle finger of the peace-making hand . Very naturally enraged at such unkind treatment from his friends , he loosed the canoe , hurried to his wigwam for his gun , and took an active part in the remainder of the action . In the mean while , the white men had recovered from their first panic , *nd seized their arms . The boarders were received with a very severe discharge . In one canoe , two savages were killed with the same bullet . Their dying struggles upset the canoe , and the rest were obliged to swim on shore , where it was some time before they could restore their arms to fighting order . Several more were wounded , and those who remained unhurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best mode of attack . Two , however , persevered . They were together in one canoe , and approached the boat astern , where there was no hole through which the whites could fire upon them . They soon leaped on board . One seized the long steering oar , oi rudder . The other jumped upon deck , where he halted , and discharged five muskets , which had been left there when the crew fled below , through the deck and bottom of the boat . In this manner , he wounded one man very severely . After this exploit , he hurried to the bow , where he seized a long pole , and , with the assistance of the steersman , succeeded in grounding the boat on a sand bar , and fixing her fast under the fire of his people . The two Winnebago boatmen then began to load and fire , to the no small annoyance of the crew . He , at the stern , was soon despatched . One of the whites observed his position through a crack , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he struggled to get overboard , probably to save his scalp . But his struggles were feeble , and a second bullet terminated them before he could effect his object . After the fight was over , the man who slew him took his scalp . The bow of the boat was open , and the warrior there still kept his station , out of sight , excepting when he stooped to fire , which he did five times . His third shot broke the arm and passed through the lungs of the brave Beauchamp . At this sight , one or two began to speak of surrender . " No friends , " cried the dying man , " you will not save your lives so . Fight to the last ; for they will show no mercy . If they get the better of you , for Gods sake , throw me overboard . Do not let them get my hair . " He continued to exhort them to resistance , as long as his breath lasted , and died with the words , " fight on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his slayer had also taken his leave of life . A sailor , named Jack Mandeville , shot him through the head , and he fell overboard , carrying his gun with him . From that moment , Mandeville assumed the command of the boat . A few had resolved to take the skiff and leave the rest to their fate . They had already cast off the rope . Jack interposed , swearine that he would shoot the first and bayonet the second , who should persevere . They submitted . Two more had hidden themselves in the bow of the boat , out of sight , but not out of danger . After a while , the old tar missed them , sought them , and compelled them by threats of instant death , enforced by pricks of his bayonet , to leave their hiding-place , and take share in the business in hand . Afterwards they fought like bull-dogs . It was well for them that Mandeville acted as he did ; for they had scarely risen , when a score of balls , at least , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two or three first volleys , the fire had slackened ; but it was not , therefore , the less dangerous . The Indians had the advantage of superior numbers , and could shift their postures at pleasure . The whites were compelled to lie in the bottom of the boat , below the water-mark , for its sides were no bulwark . Every bullet passed through and through . It was only at intervals , and very warily , that they could rise to fire ; for the flash of every gun showed the position of the marksman , and was instantly followed by the reports of two or three Indian rifles . On the other band , they were not seen , and being thinly scattered over a large boat , the Winnebagoes could but guess their positions . The fire , was , therefore , slow ; for none on either side , cared to waste ammunitionThus , for upwards of three hours , the hoatmen lay in blood and bilge w. ter* deprived of the free use of their limbs , and wholly unable to extricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , Mandeville came to the conclusion that darkness would render the guns of his own party wholly useless , while it would not render the aim of the Winnebagoes a jot less certain . He , therefore , as soon as it was dark , stoutly called for assistance , and sprang into the water . Four more followed him . The halls rained round them , passing through their clothes ; hut they persisted , and the boat was soon afloat . Seeing their prey escaping , the Winnebagoes raised a yell of mingled rage and despair , and gave the whites a farewell volley . It was returned , with three hearty cheers , and ere a gun could he re-loaded , the boat had floated out of shot . For half the night , a wailing voice , apparently that of an old man , was heard , following the boat ; at a safe distance , however . It was conjectured that it was the father of him whose body the boat was hearing away . Subsequent inquiry proved this supposition to be correct . Thirty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed and fourteen were wounded . They managed to put six hundred and ninety three balls into and through the boat . Two of the crew were killed outright , two mortally and two slightly wounded . Jack Mandeville 's courage and presence of mind , undoubtedly , saved the rest , as well as the boat ; but we have never heard that he was rewarded in any way or shape . Mr. Lindsay 's boat reached the mouth of the Bad Axe about midnight . The Indians opened a fire upon her , which was promptly returned . There was a light on board , at which the first gun was probably aimed , for that ball only hit the boat . All the rest passed over harmless in the darkness . Great was the alarm at Prairie du Chien when the boats arrived there . The people left their houses and far , and crowded into the dilapidated fort . Nevertheless , they showed much spirit , and speedily established a very effective discipline . An express was immediately sent to G lena , and another to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hundred volunteers soon arrived from Galena , and the minds of the habitants were quieted . In a few days , four imperfect companies of the fifth infantry arrived from Fort Snelling . The commanding officer ordered a march upon the Red Bird 's village ; but as the volunteers re*used to obey , and determined to return home , he was obliged to countermand it . The consternation of the people of the lead mines was great . Full half of them fled frons the country . Shortly after , however , when General Atkinson arrived with a full regiment , a considerable body of volunteers joined him from Galena , and accompanied him to the portage of the Wisconsin , to fight with , or receive the submission of theWinnebagoes . The Red Bird there appeared , in all the paraphernalia of an Indian chief and warrior , and surrendered himself to justice , together with his cdmpanions in the murder of Gagnier , and one of his band , who had taken an active part in the attack on the boats . They were incarcerated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this time , and he died in prison . He knew that his death was certain , and did not shrink from it . In the course of the year , the people of the lead mines increased in number and strength , and encroached upon the Winnebago lands . The Winnebagoes complained in vain . Next spring , the murderers of Methode , and the other Indian prison rs , were tried , convicted , and sentenced to death . A deputation of the tribe went to Washington to solicit their pardon . President Adams granted it , en the implied condition that the tribe would cede the lands , then in possession of the miners . The Winnebagoes have kept their word  --  the land has been ceded , and Madame Ga , nier has been compensated for the loss of her husband , and the mutilation of her infant . We believe that she received , after waiting for justice two years , the magnificent sum of two thousand dollars ! We will close this tin account of Life beyond the Frontier , with an anecdote which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing already related . The militia of Prairie do Chien , immediately after the affair of the boats , seized the old chief Descorrie ; the same who has already been mentioned . He was told that if the Red Bird should not be given up within a certain time , be was to die in his stead . This he steadfastly believed . inding that confinement injured his health , he requested to be permitted to range the country on his parole . The demand was granted . He as bidden to go whither he pleased dun the day , but at sunset ho was required to return to the fort , on pain of being conidored an old woman . He observed the condition religiously . At the first tap of the retreat , Descorrie was sure to present himself at the gate , a. d this * he continued to do till General Atkinson set him at liberty.
