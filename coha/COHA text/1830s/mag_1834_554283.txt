txt IT is a subject of no small degree of surprise that the science of Physiology has received so little attention , except from those to whom it is a necessary part of professional education . It might have been thought , that the structure and functions of the human body furnish sufficient matter for the curiosity and investigation of the general inquirer after knowledge , no less than for him to whom the study is of immediate practical necessity . Surely we are fearfully and wonderfully made . ' Where else shall we look for such a specimen of mechanism , fitted with such matchless skill , for the accomplishment of an endless variety of purposes ? To say nothing of the inscrutable apparatus , designed both as the residence and the instrument of the immortal mind . And yet , curious and interesting as are these subjects , and fruitful as they are of most useful results , there are few persons among us , with the exception of medical men , whose curiosity is excited to study them . Of the wonders of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the unlearned , are alike , or nearly alike , ignorant . If we sometimes , and it is rarely that we do , hear the preacher or the orator refer to a physiological phenomenon by way of ornament or illustration , the antiquity of the allusion is often betrayed by the reference to an old and discarded theory ; the classic origin of the figure shows the sources of the author 's information . There is perhaps no branch of science , in regard to which such crude and incorrect notions so generally prevail . Aside from the medical profession , all are in the dark in respect to many wonderful phenomena , exhihited in the commonest functions of every-day life . The common explanation , or rather apology for this state of general ignorance is , that the subject is involved in phraseology so technical , as to forbid the researches of those who do not make it the business of their lives to pursue it . It is true , that when followed out in all its details , medical science // includes the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which names must be given ; and thus a language is created , as peculiar as the knowledge of which it is the instrument . But the general knowledge of physiology , of which we are speaking , demands no such intimate acquaintance with details . In point of fact , most of the physiological works published in modern times , although written for the profession without any especial care to avoid technical phraseology , may be read with facility hy any man of ordinary intelligence ; and require less use of a glossary than the speculations of phrenology , which have at times excited so much popular curiosity . A better reason for the inattention to physiology is , in our view , the want of a work on the subject , well suited to the habits and tastes of general readers . Those works designed for the medical profession , treating of the whole subject of human and comparative physiology , contain discussions not adapted to parlor reading ; and therefore the more suitable topics are disregarded or thrown out of favor , by the company in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which should present a comprehensive description of the general functions of the human body , while it should leave out of view such topics , as are necessary only to the physician . Such precisely is the work before us . Its purpose is well stated by the author . This work is intended for those who are unacquainted with the structure of the human body . It is an attempt to explain to them the uses of its most important parts , in familiar and popular language . It differs , therefore , in this respect , from most works on physiology , which suppose some knowledge of anatomy in those who read them ; and it does not treat of those topics , which , though highly important to professional students , could not with propriety be introduced into the studies of the young . The author was induced to undertake it , in the hope that it might be useful to the young ; and his object will be effected , if it should open to them a new and interesting branch of knowledge . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he felt confident , that they could not fail to see , in the structure and functions of their own bodies , the clearest evidence of wonderful contrivance and beneficent wisdom . -P reface. // The work is intended primarily for the instruction of the young ; we believe there are few , of any age , however , who have not made physiology a study , but will find in it a large amount of interesting and useful information ; and to the physician , who has not recently renewed his application to this branch of knowledge , it furnishes a valuable condensed view of the different explanations and theories , as they are modified or illustrated by the more recent improvements in general science . It is designed for the use of the higher classes in common schools . ' Yet we are not to infer that our author had any expectation or wish of making it a common school-book for little boys and girls , who should be studying their accidence and their grammars , instead of prying into the wonders of their own bodies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is included in this designation , who , having already acquired the more elementary branches of knowledge , may be allowed and encouraged , before they leave school , to lay in some stores of information in the more particular de* partments of learning . We fear that in our common schools , speaking literally , few classes will be found of scholars , who are properly qualified for thus entering advantageously upon studies of this sort . Some such there are , however , and for them this book is well adapted to be useful . It might be hoped that a work like this , teaching the true principles of sound physiology , explaining the manner in which the great functions of human life are carried on , would he the means of correcting some of the errors of the prevailing systems of education . A little knowledge of the delicate structure of some of the organs most essential to life , and ot their easy susceptibility , especially in childhood , to impressions unfavorable to health , should seem to be enough to show the danger of confining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session , daily , for years , on an uneasy bench , in a constrained posture , and often with such rigor , that to stoop and pick up a pin is marked as a misdemeanor , which counts , at the end of the year , in the estimate of character ,  --  and exerts an influence in the annual distribution of prizes .

The successive developments of the different powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than perception and memory are fully developed in the young mind , exercises arc required , which can be properly performed only by calling into action the riper faculties of a much later period of life . Infants almost , and sometimes even in Sunday schools , are taught to reason , and to write their reasonings , when they should he storing up facts for future use ; and the sciences are taught to babes , who scarcely know their alphabet . It is true , that most of these only learn to borrow the reasonings of others , while they are supposed to learn thus prematurely to think , and to substitute high-sounding names of technical science for the unpretending words of every-day life. * Still the evil is the same . To the many , indeed , only self-conceit is taught instead of real knowledge ; and this is comparatively a small matter . A few years more of life may correct it , and give them a juster view of the extent and value of their acquirements . But the few ,  --  had they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , they would in the coming generation have taken the lead in whatever is excellent in our institutions , and have raised the standard of meritorious attainment in them : the few , who really enter into the spirit of these precocious exercises , are often stimulated into disease and death . The premature exercise and excitement of faculties , which are yet in their infancy , either exhaust the powers of the mind , and leave the child in subsequent mediocrity or inferiority , or else they become the cause of inflammation or dropsy in the brain . That delicate organ can not hear a long-continued and over-strained excitement , without great danger of permanent injury : and this injury may he exhihited either in impaired faculties of mind , or in the early death of its victim . * Grandpapa , ' said a bright little fellow , of three years old , who had studied his alphabet and geometry a few weeks at an infant school of science , and had learned the scientific name for a post , Grandpapa , what do you have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a subject of great importance , but we can not farther pursue it here . We shall greatly rejoice , if the slight notice we have taken of it shall excite the attention of some , whose office it is to influence the public mind on matters of this sort . We have said , that even a slight knowledge of physiology might correct these evils , and teach a better mode of education ; yet we have little hope that it will do so . And it is not altogether the fault of teachers that it will not . If parents are more solicitous of seeing their children prodigies , than reasonable beings , well endowed with sound learning , there is no alternative left to the teacher but to yield to the craving . He must select the most active and aspiring pupils , and press them forward into studies beyond their age , while the mass follow on in a round of lessons beyond their competency ; - or he will fail of the degree of *clat , that is necessary to secure him the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many mothers have mourned over the loveliest of their daughters , whose ingenuous spirits were thus stimulated into excessive and fatal action , cut off in their first opening into mature life ! The remembrance of an unwonted proficiency is now the balm for the wounds of affliction the glory of unnatural attainments becomes the victim 's wreath , and reconciles her xveeping friends to the sacrifice . We have already said , that the work before us is not designed to foster this destructive passion for precocious learning . We would fain hope it may do something to counteract it . Althou*h we have spoken so discouragingly of the prospect of a speedy correction of an evil , which we certainly regard as a most serious one , we are not wholly without the hope , that a juster state of feeling may gradually be introduced into our community by the diffusion of information : and we know not where that information may better begin , than with some knowledge of the healthy ftinctions of those bodies , which are so constantly exposed to injury . There are some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissemination of physiological information might be supposed to exert a favorable influence . The mother , who understands the essential importance of a free action of the chest , to a proper performance of the functions both of the heart and the lungs , might perhaps be less disposed to bind down the ribs of her daughters , in immovable casements of whalebone. // But we are not so sanguine as to expect , that the dicta of fashion can ever be reversed by science . And happily there is less in the habits of dress of the present day , than in some of the days gone by , to call forth either the admonition , or the unavailing lamentations of the severe guardians of the public health . A still more direct influence might he anticipated , in the discouragement and diminution of quackery . The man , who knows something of the wonderful powers of steam , would feel more of apprehension in following a locomotive engine , conducted by an ignorant enbineer , than he who had seen nothing but the outward form of the curious apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance of the complicated structure and curious performances of the several parts of the human body , that prompts so many to trust the management of its disorders to the hands of those whose knowledge , both of its healthy and its diseased functions , is as limited as their own . After all , however , the chief ground of confidence of the usefulness of this little book is the great principle , that all knowledge is useful . It is essential only that the knowledge disseminated be accurate , and it must , sooner or later , do good . In this respect we have great pleasure in speaking of the work before us . Although wholly unpretending in its character and claims to notice , it has obviously been prepared with great care , and a scrupulous attention to accuracy in all its parts . We could wish that scientific works , designed for general readers , were always prepared with equal ability and care . There is much , indeed , in the science of physology , in which our knowledge is still imperfect . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , there are many parts of the human body , whose modes of action are still hut very imperfectly understood . It becomes peculiarly important , therefore , in a work of this sort , that a careful discrimination be made between what is known , and that which rests upon theoretical speculation merely . This we are happy to say is faithfully done in the work before us . The reader is no where misled by opinions advanced as facts . The results of accurate observation are stated ; and the theories in explanation of the several phenomena are given as deductions from these observations . Wherever , as is often the case , the results of careful observation are inconclusive , the // reader is not palmed off with a theory confidently proposed , by way of substitute ; but is honestly informed of the deficiency of our knowledge in regard to the particular point . Some of the best explanations which have been attempted by different phvsiologists are then given , with the reasons in favor of them , and the reader is left to draw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases of this kind , that he will come to no conclusion at all . And this is just what it ought to be : since , if the evidence is such as to leave the best physiologists in doubt , it is not to he expected that those who are less instructed in the matter will understand it more clear ly . All that they can here require is , that they shall be taught the full extent of the solid grounds which the several opinions have to rest upon , and a full demarcation of the line at which hypothesis begins . To the casual reader , it may seem that so much is left unsettled , that little can be truly known ; and there have not been wanting those who ' have reproached medical science generally , as made up more of conjectures than of accurate knowledge . Nay , some have gone so far as to prefer the medical skill of those who discard all pretensions to knowledge , as if those . who are the boldest in their conjectures , are the most to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter . In the first place , most of the questions , in re aard to which the greatest uncertainty prevails , relate to the manner in which a particular function is performed , the modus operandi , rather than to the character of the function itself . *fl action itself has been carefully observed and is well understood , but the means by which that action is carried on and directed , are involved in mystery . For example , it is perfectly well known that some impression must be communicated hy a nerve to a muscle , to enable it to contract ; for if the nerves of any part are destroyed or divided , the muscles of that i ) art wholly cease to act . But of the nature of the influence thus communicated , we are entirely ignorant . In a practical point of view , however , the facts which we know , are of incomparably more importance , than the explanation of those facts , which still remains hidden . Throughout the whole circle of human physiology , the functions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those functions in a state of health , and also the changes of structure and of action which the same // parts undergo in disease , have been and still are the subjects of careful observation and study . The attention of medical men , especially at the present time , is directed to the observation of facts , rather than to framing theories . Doubtless much remains to be learned . But we may well ask , in the second place ,  --  supposing that there still is much of ignorance in the profession ,  --  which is the safest guide through this ignorance , he who has learned something of its extent , and has done something to surmount it , and who has at least learned some caution in regard to what is unknown , by the difficulties by which he has acquired what is known ; or he who has learned nothing , and who leaps confidently in the dark , because he sees none of the pitfalls in the darkness by which he is surrounded ? The arrangement of this work is simple and natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the textures , or systems , which make up the composition of the human body , the author treats of the various functions ; and those are first examined , which are connected with the growth and nourishment of the individual being , and afterwards those which connect him with external objects . The animal body is composed of fluids and solids . The former constitute a much greater part of the whole than the latter ; being in the proportion of six to one , according to Richerand , and of nine to one , according to Chaussier , in an adult subject . ' These fluids are divided into four classes 1st , those which form the blood ; 2d , the blood itself ; 3d , those that are formed from the blood ; and 4th , those that are returned to the blood from the various parts of the body . The solids are formed from the fluids by a process called secretion , which will be treated of in a subsequent part of this work . Much labor and research have been bestowed on attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs of the body . Some have supposed that all the solids are formed from three elementary ones , viz. : the cellular , the nervous , and the muscular : and to these , others have added the osseous and membranous . It is believed that all the organs , however various they may appear , in their structure and composition , can be ultimately reduced to these five . These simple textures or tissues , as they are called , being united in various proportions , form the compound tissues or systems . There are eleven of these systems , according to the arrangement of Dupuytren and Richerand ; these are // 1 . The Cellular . 2 . The Mucous . 3 . The Serous. 4 . The Muscular . 5 . The Osseous. 6 . The Vascular. 7 . The Nervous . S. The Fibrous. 9 . The Erectile. 10 . The Horny , as the Nails and Hair . 11 . The Parenchymatous , as the Glands . ' rrhe function first to be described , under this arrangement , is , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function , the teeth and tongue , the parotid gland , and the stomach , are succinctly described . Then , after a short notice of the more important of the exploded theories of digestion , we have an explanation of the process , as follows . The opinion that is now most generally received respecting the mode in which the stomach acts on the food that is taken into it , is , that a peculiar liquor secreted by the stomach , and called gastric juice , has a solvent power , which enables it to reduce the food to an uniform mass . The introduction of food into the stomach , produces an increased secretion of the gastric liquor , which is poured out in such abundance in health , as to surround every particle of it . When this is accomplished , an alternate contraction and expansion of the stomach take place , and continue till the whole alimentary mass is converted into chyme . This motion is produced by the muscular coat of the stomach , which is formed , as has been before stated , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been ascertained , that in a healthy stomach , the food , if easy of digestion , is converted into chyme , in four or five hours , and that before this change has taken place , it is prevented from passing into the intestine , by a sort of valve situated at the pyloric orifice of the stomach , called pylorus , or door-keepe&lt;* It has been supposed by some , that this valve has the property oF " determining when the aliment was sufficiently changed to allowC .. it to pass , that it gives free exit to chyme , and contracts when undigested substances attempt to enter the duodenum . The food is not all converted into chyme at the same time ; but as fast as it is changed , it passes into the intestine , only two or three ounces collecting in the pyloric extremity at once . The change which the alimentary mass undergoes in the first intestine or duodenum , as it is called , is as great and important as the one which is effected in it in the stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the process is called chymification : in the intestine , it undergoes what is called chylification ; in which it is brought into such a state , that a peculiar fluid , called chyle , can be extracted from it by the absorbent vessels , whose mouths open in great abundance into this intestine . This // chyle is a thin milky fluid , and these absorbents are thence called lacteals . The chyme passes slowly through the duodenum , and in its passage it becomes intimately mixed with the liquor secreted by the pancreas or sweetbread , and the bile which is formed by the liver . These fluids sometimes pass through separate tubes , and at others enter by a common canal . The inner coat of the first intestine is covered with folds of its lining membraue , which answer the purpose in some measure of valves , retarding to some extent the passage of the chyme , and preventing , under ordinary circumstances , its regurgitation . In this way , the absorbents have an opportunity of separating from it the chyle , the fluid which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourishinent of the body . The chyle has frequently been examined , with a view of ascertaining its nature and properties . It has no inconsiderable resemblance to cream in appearance , and when removed from the body and suffered to stand , it undergoes a species of spontaneous coagulation . It separates into three parts , a transparent and colorless fluid , a firm and white coaguluin , and a thin pellicle of fatty matter , which floats on the surface ; a process not unlike that , which will be hereafter spoken og as taking place in the blood when removed from the body . ' Another extract will show the purposes which the chyle , thus formed , accomplishes in the animal system . The process by which the body increases in size , and the waste of its organs is repaired , is called nutrition . Its agents are supposed to be those minute vessels , that are situated between the termination of the arteries , and the commencement of the veins , and which are known by the name of capillaries . These vessels are distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of separating from the blood particles identical in character with those of which the various organs of the system are composed . It has been before remarked , that a species of composition and decomposition is constantly going on in the body during life . The first of these is effected by the blood-vessels , and the latter by the absorbents . By digestion , nutritive fluid , called chyle , is extracted from the food taken into the stomach ; the lacteals convey this into the blood , and partially assimilate it to that fluid ; but it is not yet fit for the purposes of life . It is carried by a distinct set of vessels into the lungs , where it parts with some of the noxious principles it derived from digestion , and it also receives others from the air , which , as it were , imparts to ii // vivifying properties . In this state it is returned to the heart , and this organ sends it through numberless vessels to every part , for their growth and nourishment . But the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of it must be left in each of the organs to supply the waste , and this is probably done by the minute capillary vessels of the part . Under ordinary circumstances , these vessels can not be seen by the eye , even when aided by the microscope they are so minute as to elude all examination in their natural state . But , small as they are , they are agents whose functions can not be dispensed with in the animal economy . One set performs an important office in the lungs , as has been already noticed , and the other , spread throughout the system , is carrying nourishment to all the organs . The latter have received the name of the nutritive arteries . The nutritive process is a sort of secretion , by which different substances are separated from a common fluid , the blood . Thus , one set of these vessels deposits the fibrin to form the muscles , and another , the earthy and animal parts of the bone . We are wholly ignorant how this is accomplished ; but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the body are continually , during life , subjected to this process ; the old particles are taken up by the absorbent vessels , and new ones are deposited in their place by the nutritive arteries . The hair , the nails , the outer covering of the teeth , the coloring matter of the skin , and perhaps the cuticle , form almost , if not the only exceptions . ' Tbis circumstance of the continual change of the matter of our bodies , has given rise to an amusing question in regard to the evidence of personal identity . When it is announced that the materials of our bodies are incessantly changing , metaphysicians ask , in some perplexity , how know we that we are the same individuals that we were a year ago ? Since within that time all the portions of matter , of which our bodies were then composed , have been exchanged for others , how are we assured that our persons have not been exchanged also ,  --  that we really are ourselves , and not somebody else ; - like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread of the original article remained , and no one could ever tell whether it was the same stocking or another ? It is true , every body feels that there is no real difficulty in this case , except as a matter of theory . In reference to himself no man needs to reason about it . He feels within himself that he is the same individual that he ever was . And VOL. xxxix. - No. 86. // 406 Hayward 's Physiology of Man . this circumstance has given rise to the theory , that it is this very consciousness which constitutes the proof of identity . A better explanation , perhaps , may be found in the manner in which the changes of substance in the animal body are effected . These changes take place only particle by particle ; and the change has respect to the individual particles , rather than to the body of which they form the several parts . Each new portion of matter , as it becomes assimilated , assumes the character of that whose place it supplies . As the sentinel who goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmits them to his successor , so each successive particle , incorporated into the animal system , receives its impressions from those that preceded it . In this manner , not only the form and powers of the body , but the habits of the constitution , and its tendencies to disease , or its exemption from a particular disease , are transmitted through successive changes of matter , with nearly , or quite as much certainty , as if every particle of the body were perpetual and unchanging . The individual is identically the same , therefore , because the character of his physical constitution , as well as his intellectual and moral character , is the same . Although the matter which supplies the nutrition of the body is received into the blood by the process of digestion , it is not however so immediately fitted for this its ultimate pur .. pose . We must therefore return with our author , ( for we have anticipated his course of arrangement , ) and take a short notice of some of the intermediate processes . The most important of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no part of Physiology , to the improvement of which the discoveries of modern science have been so successfully applied , as to the explanation of the phenomena of Respiration . The ancients were ignorant of the true course of the circulation of the blood : and even long after that problem had been solved by the investigations of the immortal Hervey , physiologists were wholly at a loss to account for the circulation through the lungs . They saw that every portion of the whole mass of blood , as fast as it had completed its tour of duty over the general system , before it set out again to repeat the same course over the body , was sent into the lungs , and there brought under the influence of the air in Respiration . But so utterly uncertain were they of the nature of this influence , // that while some said that the purpose was to cool the blood , others thought that it was to supply heat ; some , to supply , others to abstract moisture . It was reserved for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reciprocal changes , which the blood and the air undergo in this remarkable process . The quantity of oxygen is diminished by respiration , and that of carbonic acid gas is increased . Expired air , instead of containing twenty-one parts of oxygen , like atmospheric air , has but eighteen parts , and contains four parts of carbonic acid gas , instead of one . Some physiologists are of opinion , that all the oxygen that has disappeared , may be accounted for by the carbonic acid gas that is formed , while others believe that a portion has united with the blood . This point may perhaps be considered as still unsettled . We shall say more of it when treating of the changes produced in the blood by respiration . The next point of view in which the important process of respiration is to be considered , is as to the effects which it produces on the blood that is sent to the lungs . It has been before explained , that the blood which is derived from digestion , and that which is returned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right side of the heart . It is of a dark color , and unfit for the purposes of life . It is sent by the contraction of the right ventricle to the lungs ; it passes through numberless vessels of the smallest size , and is carried to the left side of the heart , of a bright scarlet color . How is this effected ? We have seen above , that the quantity of carbonic acid is greater in expired , than in atmospheric air . But the oxygen , contained in the carbonic acid gas , does not account for all the oxygen that is lost . Some have supposed that a portion of it unites with hydrogen , and thus forms the watery vapor that is thrown from the lungs . This is not , however , the prevailing opinion . The fact seems to be , that in respiration , both the air and the blood part with something , and receive something from each other . The air loses a portion of its oxygen , part of which goes to the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ; the blood also parts with some of its carbon , which unites with the oxygen taken into the lungs , and is then thrown out in the form of carbonic acid ; and another part of the oxygen is absorbed by the blood . Thus it appears that the blood parts with a portion of its carbon , and at the same time gains some oxygen . This change in the blood in respiration has been called the oxygenation of the blood , by those who explained it on the supposition , that oxygen united with the blood in its passage though // the lungs . It has also been called the decarbonization of the blood , by those physiologists who believe that the change is produced by the discharge of carbon . The truth seems to be , that the blood is bot.h oxygenated and decarbonized by respiration ; that is , that a portion of the oxygen taken into the lungs unites withit , and at the same time the blood throws off carbon in a volatile state , which unites with another portion of oxygen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some oxygen and receives some carbon , and thus forms carbonic acid c*as ' To whatever circumstance this change may be owing , it is certain , that it is one essential to life . If it were compl tely suspended , even for a moment , death would follow . The black blood , or the blood of the veins , or venous blood , as it is called , can not support the animal functions ; they require the stimulus of the red arterial blood . If respiration be suspended , the heart will for a time continue to throw the blood to the lungs ; but whei* all the air is exhausted in these organs , so that they return purple blood to the left side of the heart , death immediately follows . This is owing , in great measure , to the circumstance that black blood is now of course thrown into the coronary arteries , the nourishing arteries of the heart ; and this organ ceases to act , when not excited by arterial blood . The action of the brain , too , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxygenated blood , and all the organs of the body are dependent on the brain and nervous system for their power of action . ' It should not be inferred , as it sometimes has been , from the statement of these facts , that the presence of carbon in the blood is necessarily poisonous , under all circumstances or that all the oxygen is withdrawn from venous blood . Both these substances exist in large quantities both in arterial and venous blood , and in every other animal product . It is a difference of l ) ropoltions merely , in the two kinds of blood and this difference is so small as scarcely , if at all , to be detected by direct analysis . Onr knowledge of it is derived more from the effects on the air respired , than from experiinents , made on the blood itself . It may seem strange , that*a chan , e of proportions so slight as to be appreciable only by inference , should be so important in its effects . But here is our limit between observation and conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respiration is essential to life , which every body has always known , but also that the chemical changes produced in respiration are equally indispensable . It is worthy of remark , too , that these changes // are essentially the same , in all living bodies , and are equally indispensable to all , from the highest animal , to the lowest vegetable . Connected with Respiration , are the remarkable phenomena of animal heat . The human body is capable of preserving a uniform temperature , for an indefinite length of time , through all the changes of a climate , whose extremes are more than a hundred degrees asunder ; and for a limited period the power is much greater . It is manifest that to keep up such an equilibrium , especially in a medium , as in our climate , many degrees colder than the body , must demand a great power of producing heat . It might have been supposed that such a manufactory might easily be discovered , yet physiologists have not been able to point out satisfactorily its true sources . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) e air undergoes in respiration are entirely similar to the effects produced upon the same fluid by combustion , it was but natural to infer that heat is in like manner derived from the process . Consequently , physiologists have been constantly looking to this process for an explanation of the production of animal heat , ever since the true composition of the atmosphere was made known . It was objected , that the lungs are no hotter than other parts of the body , as it might be expected they would be , if they manufacture the heat for all the other parts . But Dr. Crawford brought forward an explanation of the manner in which animal heat is generated , that was for a time adopted by most physiologists . He agreed in opinion with Dr. Black , that heat was generated in respiration , as in combustion , by the conversion of oxygen and carbon into carbonic acid gas ; and the reason , which he assigns for the fact that the lungs have not a much greater degree of heat than the other parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater capacity for caloric than the venous blood , and that a part of the heat formed in the lungs is absorbed by the arterial blood , and remains in it in that state which is known by the name of latent heat . When the 1 ) lOOd is conveyed to the various parts of the body , the heat is given out whenever the arterial blood is converted into venous , as it is in the various processes of nutrition . ' This is so simple and beautiful a theory , that it is a pity it is not true . But the animal system never works so entirely by physical laws . Dr. Crawford indeed details a long course of // experiments , to establish the truth of his opinion . He calculated very carefully the capacity for heat , not only of the inspired and expired air , and the arterial and venous blood , but also that of the various articles of food , and found every thing favorable to this theory . The result to which he came was , that the change of capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a demand for 207 degrees of heat , to remain latent in the arterial blood , so as to cause no actual change of temperature . The corresponding change in the air he found sufficient to set free 4,650 degrees of heat . It only remained to bring these two results together , to form a perfect test of their correctness . But this he omitted to do . It is obvious that the increase of temperature , caused by a given qnantity of heat , other things being equal , is inversely as the quantity of matter . A pint of hot water , added to a hundred pints a hundred degrees colder , will raise the temperature of the hundred just one degree . Now if Dr. Crawford 's positions are true , the quantity of matter , in that portion of air which is changed in respiration , must correspond exactly with the quantity of matter in the portion of blood which it supplies with latent heat . These quantities can not indeed be ascertained with entire exactness ; but something is known in regard to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the quantity of oxygen consumed in each respiration , its actual weight does not amount to one grain ; while at least seven ounces , or 3,360 grains of blood , are presented to the action of the air in each respiration . One grain , heated 4,650 degrees , would raise 3,360 grains a little more than one degree ; whereas Dr. Crawford 's positions require *207 degrees , besides the quantity of heat lost in raising the temperature of the remaining portion of respired air , and in various other ways . This difficulty , however , in regard to animal heat , is scarcely greater , than that of explaining the production of heat in ordinary combustion , from which the analogy is drawn . The ordinary explanation of the process of combustion , with which most chemists appear to be satisfied , attributes the production of heat , in the same manner to a change of capacity for heat , effected during the process . Upon this hypothesis , according to . all the known laws of heat , the burning of gunpowder should be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oxygen , are in a state of comparatively small capacity , and // by the combination in burning they pass into states requiring immense proportions of latent heat . The truth is , many of the laws of heat are too imperfectly known to render it safe to found any confident opinions upon them , even in regard to physical science ; still less in their application to the operations of organized , living beings . After all , it is not easy to escape altogether the impression , that animal heat is in some way dependent upon or connected with respiration . Direct experiments on animals , designed to ascertain this point , have repeatedly been tried ; but their results are contradictory . Mr. Brodie inferred from his experiments , that no heat is produced by respiration , while Dr. Wilson Philip , M. Legallois , and others , have come to a different conclusion . The truth probably is , that artificial respiration in animals keeps up the animal heat , just in proportion to the extent to which it preserves the other vital actions . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ; and in some modes of death , certain of these functions are retained in action much longer than when death takes place in other ways . Animal heat is one of these functions ; and it is preserved to a certain extent by artificial respiration , whenever that respiration is so managed as to prolong the powers of life . The same result may be produced without artificial respiration . If two animals of the same character and size are killed , in different ways , so as in one to destroy suddenly all the functions , while in the other the entire death of all the parts follows more slowly , although both animals are , in the ordinary sense of the term , equally dead from the same moment , the first will cool much more rapidly than the last . It is not impossible , although we see little evidence of it , that the chemical effects of respiration have something to do with the production of heat ; and it is no proof against this hypothesis , that we are not able to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , as we have just observed , we are equally ignorant in regard to the origin of the heat produced in combustion . These , and other experiments of a similar character , ( the experiments of Dr. Philip and M. Legallois , ) have induced most physiologists of the present day to adopt what is usually called the chemical theory of the generation of animal heat . It must be confessed , however , that it is not without its difficulties* // but at the same time it can not but be acknowledged , that it is embarrassed with fewer than any other that has ever been proposed . Though it is called a chemical theory , it is so only in a limited sense , the laws of chemistry being , as in all the other operations , that go on in the living body , modified and controlled by the laws of vitality . The brain and nervous system no doubt perform an important part , if not in the generation , at least in the evolution of animal heat . There is one fact worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an intimate connexion between respiration and animal heat ; and that is , that in those animals whose respiratory apparatus is the most extended , the temperature is uniformly highest . Birds , whose organs of breathing extend over a large part of the body , and who consequently require a great quantity of air , have a higher degree of temperature than other animals : it is twelve degrees above that of man ; while in coldblooded animals , as fishes , whose temperature is not much greater than that of the medium in which they live , but a very small quantity of blood at any one time is subjected to the effects of respiration . ' We have not room to prolong our remarks , and notice the other subjects of interest discussed in this little volume . Nor is it necessary . Enough we trust has been said , to exhibit something of the character of the work , and of the able and faithful manner in which the author has executed his purpose . We would hope that the publisher will put a portion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . There is something in the air of a school-book , which does not always carry pleasant associations with it into the parlor . However useful this book may be for the higher classes in schools ( and highly useful to them , we are persuaded it will be , ) we believe it will be even more valuable to those whose school days have gone by . Those who have before studied Physiology as a science , will find in it a convenient and agreeable summary of the best modern opinions on the different subjects . Those to whom the whole subject is new , will find it filled with important instruction , conveyed in an intelligible and pleasant manner.
