txt LETTER ON THE CHANTING CHERUBS . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW-ENGLAND MAGAZINE . You may marvel at my boldness in selecting the subject I have , for I know about as much of sculpture as Lucius Mummius did of painting ; and if you have any friends who are connoisseurs in such maters , I beg of you , on no account , to let them see this letter ; but , being an admirer of beauty in all its forms , and wishing to encourage native production , whether it come in the shape of a statue or an improved toasting-fork , I took an early opportunity of paying my respects to the group of Chanting Cherubs , not only to feed my eyes with a beautiful sight , but to indulge an honest ( I trust the word will not be quarreled with ) pride , in viewing the work of a Bostonian . The celestial yet infantile beauty of these exquisite statues made a deep impression on me , and led me into a train of reflections , which I must needs put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited with ideas , he must make the most of them when they do come . That group 15 the point I start from in my remarks , and if I should wander to what appears an unreasonable distance , I can only say that my letter shall have as much connexion with its subject , as many a good sermon has with its text . I have always been an admirer of sculpture . It seems to me a higher art than painting , one in which it is more difficult to produce a perfect specimen , and which , in its most successful results , fills the mind with thoughts of sublimer power and more subduing beauty . The contrast is so great between the inflexibility of the material , and the rounded outlines , the delicate blendings , the undulating grace of life and the airy flow of drapery , that nothing short of a magician 's wand would seem to be capable of combining them both . How a " dull cold " block of marble is ever converted into a statue , that makes generations " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination of the uninitiated . In the sister art , there appears to be a regular and perceptible gradation of excellence , from the boy , who draws figures on his slate , which it would not be literal idolatry to worship , since they are not the likenesses of any thing in heaven , earth or sea , up to the great historical painter ; but a great sculptor " dwells apart like a star , " in solitary and isolated glory . He floats above us like a cloud , which rests upon no mountain 's breast , but is borne up by the lightness of its ethereal beauty . It is easy enough to conceive the unborn image stamped upon the heated brain of the artist , and even projected , so as to be visible to his outward senses , like Macbeth 's air-drawn dagger ; but to give shape and consistence to the haunting shadow , to make visible to the outward eye , what he sees so clearly with the inner , this is the rub . Let us step into the artist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes sparklhfg and hands trembling with the vividness of his emotions , he takes up his hammer and chisel and begins to chip off the edges of the shapeless mass , that lies cold and hard before him . How little does he seem to us to be approaching the perfect result , and we imagine that the material has a resisting power that mocks his painful efforts . By degrees , we begin to discern a rude approach to the human form , a sort of twilight glimmering of the // bright dawwof beauty . Here a new source of anxiety arises . In our ignorance , we tremble lest some untoward accident should blast the artist 's hopes ; lest , in his impatience , he should spoil all by a rash sliver ; or , by devoting too much labor to one portion , destroy the symmetry and proportion of the whole . At last we witness the triumph of art in the unspeakable beauty of the completed work , with its perfect proportions , with the light of life hovering over it like a veil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , that look as if they must speak . And with all this , how little do we know of the state of the artist 's mind  --  the anxious vigils and the haunted slumbers , each o'ermastered by the fiery rule of his tyrant idea ; and then , his sad forebodings , his aching fears , his thrilling hopes , his disappointment as he compares what is with what ought to be , his efforts still baffled and still renewed-how little does the crowd , that sees only the result , dream of all this ! And as little can they realize the deep and full tide of delight , with which he contemplates his intellectual offspring , dearer to him for the mingled joy and suffering , with which he had watched its growth . I have said that Sculpture was a higher art than Painting ; facts show it to be a more difficult one . Since the revival of the arts , how few works of great merit have been executed in that art , compared with the great number of paintings , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly a great name from Michael Angelo to Canova . The reason of this is , not that the imagination of the sculptor teems less with beautiful forms , but because the poetic power is so seldom found combined with the manual dexterity and accuracy of eye Which the execution requires . There is hardly a great work of sculpture in our country ; ( for busts and statues of individuals , however excellent in their kind , do not belong to the highest department of the art ; ) but there are in every city several specimens of painting of great merit . We are obliged to form our ideas of a statue from its cast , which is about the same as forming an idea of a living flower by a dried specimen in an herbarium , or of a handsome man by his shadow on the wall . But let any man walk into the Athenmnum and seat himself before the cast of the Apollo and obverve its divine beauty , the airy grace of its perfect limbs , the uprising lightness of the whole figure , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful expression of the nostril and upper lip , and if he have an ounce of honest blood in his body , it will rush to his heart in a hurry of delight . If there be a man who can contemplate this cast unmoved , he deserves to hear nothing but anti-masonic orations and read nothing but Cabinet correspondence , for the rest of his life . Sculpture seems to bear the same relation to Painting that moonlight does to sunshine , if I may be allowed so fantastic a comparison . Its beauty is more ethereal , more dream-like , and approaches nearer to the perfect communication of thought by speaking and writing . The cold and serene loveliness of a marble statue reminds one of a disembodied spirit , which , if it have lost the flush and glow of earthly beauty is cleansed of the pollutions of humanity and made " white as snow . " A statue has the repose and the dignity of death without its ghastliness . It lifts one 's thoughts to heaven and fills our minds with images of joy too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and golden harps , // of snowy robes and the lustre of angelic faces . Painting is a more perfect representation of common life , and for that reason further removed from the ideal . In painting there is scope for the exhibition of all the complicated passions which make up the web of humanity . There is the flush of joy , the paleness of despair , the leer of envy and the scowl of hatred . And in the same piece there may be more than one action , and a boundless variety may be given to the expression of passion . In a few square feet of canvass may be seen a mimic world , crowded with all the grave and gay shapes that act the motley masque of life . In this respect it bears a strong analogy to comedy , which " holds the mirror up " to the visible and actual world , and draws its materials from the boundless resources presented by the common heart and the common mind . Practical jokes , the blunders of clowns , the coarse Doric of the market-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of comedy , while at the same time , it leaves room for the display of the beautiful and the noble , for love , honor and bravery . But it is not so with sculpture ; its walk , like that of tragedy , is higher and more limited . Its aim is to spiritualize and refine , to erect upon the foundation of the actual , the ideal , which shall hide what it rests upon . It arrests the floating elements of beauty and gives them that perfect form which they never assume in this " working- , day " world . Its legitimate office is the delineation of life in repose , when the smooth surface of the feelings is ruffled by no storm of emotion , and the face and figure are moulded into a placid and almost expressionless calm . It may be said that the Apollo is an exception to this remark , for it represents godlike beauty flushed with the light of mortal triumph , but it is not the least merit of this wonderful statue that it combines so successfully the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . Nothing short of the most transcendant genius could have accomplished this . But it will be said , " There is the Laocoon , a statue of the intensest action and in which the form is swallowed up and lost in the expression of heart-dissolving fear . " But let it be borne in mind that the character of that group is one of suffering , of passion , and that of the most awful kind , for the physical efforts of the main figure are the mere convulsive spasms of o'ermastered humanity . This sublime work , too , is a proof of the daring , as well as the genius of its author , and it may be considered as the extreme limit of sculpture , beyond which one can not go without violating the true principles of the art . Sculpture also , embodies what are called abstract ideas , but in these it is confined , for the most part , to those in which the leading idea is repose , such as Night , Sleep , Death , &amp;c. and seldom attempts those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The superiority of Night to Morning , in the bas-reliefs exhibited in the same room with the Chanting Cherubs , must have been obvious to every man of taste . Sculpture is a rigid exacter of unity . There may be modifications of the same passion or action , but there can not be two distinct ones . There may be several figures in a group , but there must be a central and presiding idea . Fault has been found with the Laocoon , because the father seems to be absorbed with the thoughts of his own agony and peril and indifferent to that of his children , while they , on their part , appear to suffer most because they are deprived of his wonted // aid and protection . I reply , that it would have been impossible for the artist to have done otherwise , without violating the principles , not only of his art , but of nature . In the fearful moment the sculptor has chosen , the supernatural horror of his resistless fate has chilled to death every portion of humanity but its root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The father is swallowed up in the man . Laocoon hears nothing but the maddening hiss of the serpents and feels nothing but their cold and slimy folds . All the various passions , the yearning affections which inhabited his heart , are swept away . Nothing remains but the original and primal instinct of self-preservation , the first feeling that lives and the last that dies . Poor humanity is stripped of all its coverings and husks and stands bare and shivering , naked as it was born . But the children feel not the full bitterness of their fate , and know not that an insulted god has sent the serpents on their errand of death . They are overcome with a vague terror . Their faces and minds are turned to their father for explanation as well as aid . They cling closer to him and look up with more beseeching eyes as they feel the fatal knots'drawn into a tighter and more suffocating grasp . It may be a presumptuous remark , but I will venture it nevertheless , that the group would have been unnatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and not the father . A mother never forgets her children while she lives ; the last throb of her heart is for them and not for herself . To have engrafted upon the expression of the Laocoon , that of agonized maternal affection , it is not too much to say , would have been beyond the power of any artist . In sculpture we always crave the ideal . The representation of the the forms , the dress and the shapes of actual life in a substance of such spiritual beauty as marble , would be either shocking or laughable . A statue in a cravat and small-clothes would be as ludicrous an object as can well be imagined . A very promising young sculptor in Scotland has executed lately two statues , one of Tam o'Shanter and the other of his " drouthy crony , " souter Johnny ; but with the true tact of genius he has selected for his material , a fine-grained , indigenous , grayish-colored stone , which bears about the same relation to Parian marble , that Burns 's hero does to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerate the expression of any low , sordid or weak passion in marble . A statue , with the leer of envy or the distortion of malice upon its face , would strike us at once as unnatural and disgusting . How little do all our speculations on the nature of the arts help us to explain the mysterious influence they exert over our minds ! Why is it that , in beholding a beautiful statue or picture , we are constrained almost to hold our breath from the intensity and fullness of our emotions ? Why do we feel our eyes wet with unbidden tears and our hearts beat thick and fast with the deep sense of beauty ? It is but a block of marble cut into the shape of a human figure or a yard of canvass daubed over with colors . It is not alone to the universal and instinctive love of beauty that the artist appeals ; the finest cords of the spirit vibrate to his touch . Beauty , breathing from the marble or burning upon the canvass , goes to the mind 's core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hoarded treasures , and unfolds the web of our lives with its half-forgotten figures of joy and sorrowits sable and silver embroidery . All that we have suffered , all that we // have loved , all that we have lost , comes back to us , and the waste places of the heart again bloom . The mind is stirred up from its inmost depths and images chase each other through it , swift as the waves of a stormy night and bright as their foamy crests . Tell me , ye philosophers , who weigh thought , sensatiQns and impulses in a balance , who lay out the inner world according to your own systems of intellectual surveying , the secret of all this ' ? Are these emotions to be referred to the bodily organization , to sets of delicate nerves irritated by the presence of an exciting object ? Can you explain it by vibrations , by sensible species , by the agitation of the animal spirits ? Or is it something more than this , and must we go for an explanation , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have but penetrated ' ? Is it the mind of the artist communing with our own , through the medium of the work of his hands , in a voiceless interchange of thought , such as we believe that spirits use ? It is one of the mysteries of life , of which the infant knows as much as the gray-haired sage , and with regard to which , he is the wisest who is most ready to confess the depth of his ignorance . But it is high time for me to say something upon that , which purports to be the subject of my letter , especially as it is a subject , upon which one may be even extravagant , with a very good conscience . As I suppose every one , who reads this letter , has seen and admired the Chanting Cherubs , a minute description of them is altogether unnecessary , and , if it were otherwise , it would make no difference , for no language ( or at least none of mine ) could convey any idea of them to one who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , holding a scroll , towards which one of them is bending , apparently reading the words , while the other stands erect , with a calm and confident expression , as if nothing were wanting but the unclosing of his lips to give utterance to the tide of music and praise that is swelling within him . Considering that the artist was required to execute two cherubs , ( where any great variety is out of the question ) he has shown great skill in the different characters he has given to the figures . The attitude of the one is more firm and erect ; his baby breast seems to swell with the consciousness of immortal energies , while that of the other , though inimitably graceful , has a slight expression of timidity . The hair of the former is thick and curling , his forehead broader and his cheek fuller , while the forehead of the other is higher , his face less round and his hair disposed in sunny and wavelike folds . There is also a difference of expression about the mouth , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the room , are most struck with the taller figure , but the other is generally their favorite before they leave it . He has a more intellectual face than his brother . There is an expression about his superb brow worth all the regular beauty of the other . By his position also , the light is thrown upon the upper part of his face , while the lower is thrown into shade , which is always the best view of a countenance . The direction of the head gives a lifelike expression to his eyes , as the iris is nearly concealed by the lid , and the appearance is exactly that of a person reading when viewed from before . But it is an idle task to assign the palm of beauty to one or the other , very much like that of settling which of two stars has // the brighter glory . They are both beautiful as dreams , with their celestial purity unstained by the smoke of earth . They seem like good spirits sent down from heaven , wandering , hand in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they go . They bring before us the peace , the joy , the sunshine and the bloom of that undying world " where the weary are at rest and the wicked cease from troubling . " The artist has succeeded entirely in blending the charm of infantile beauty with the power and brightness of an immortal nature . The spirit of a seraph is shining through those round limbs and animating those fairy features . As I am not an artist , I am unable to point out their beauties and defects , as a work of art , and on that account , I am probably not able to give their author half his due , as I can not appreciate the nature of the difficulties to be overcome . I looked at them very hard to see if I could detect any fault , and I confess I was unable to ; perhaps sharper eyes than mine have been more successful . The flesh has all the firmness , roundness and smoothness characteristic of a healthy infant , and the fidelity with which he has copied all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , shows him to have industry and accuracy of observation as well as genius , and to be deficient in no quality necessary to obtain the very highest place in his profession . Any one who has ever noticed the creases in the back part of the infant 's leg ( I am a plain-spoken man ) will be amazed to see how true to nature those of the statues are . The artist seems never to have become tired of his work , nor to have hurried through it in a fever of impatience , and the minutest portions are carved with a finish and accuracy rivalling that of nature itself . Look , for instance , at the hair of the shorter figure ; how exquisitely it is executed and how much like life . It seems as if the hand of a mother had just smoothed it down , and that the next breeze would ruffle its silky evenness . The group is full of minute beauties , which it would be tedious to enumerate , and which not more than one half the world will ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenough must be content to share in common with all men of genius , whatever be their department . To him , the perfect success , which has crowned his first efforts , is not much , one way or another . He , who has been so long silently studying the works of the " dead kings " of beauty , and measuring himself with them , needs not the approbation of the world to teach him how much he was capable of . Genius seldom makes a wrong estimate of its own powers , and the applause of the world is but an echo of the voice that speaks within . The young and nameless artist , when he takes his chisel in hand , and , with throbbing heart , begins his first work , is as well aware of the eminence he shall attain , and knows as well the extent of his powers , as when his name is pronounced in the language of every civilized nation , and men make pilgrimages to bow before the beauty , which his potent spell has conjured into marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a great deal . It proves to us that our young townsman is of the stuff out of which the true artist is made . We knew that he had genius some five or six years ago , but we did not know then what we now do , that he had the patience , the industry and the sense of responsibility arising from the possession of great powers , without which genius is no better than the flash of a 4 // rocket or the wing of a flying-fish . We hope that our liberal and wealthy community will exercise a generous spirit of patronage , so that Mr. Greenough need not be obliged to choose between one of two evils ,  --  a perpetual exile from his native land or the romantic fate of starvation . It is true that genius is its own great reward , and if a man could live upon applause , or clothe himself with praise , in their literal senses , he would do very well in the world ; but even sculptors and poets require some of the substantial goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if carried to the length , which some of its advocates advise , would make life as bare and as cold as the topmost rock of the Andes . We hope that , in this case , that kind of folly may be exerted , which we should call wisdom , and a creator of mere beauty go not unrewarded . The " heart of a nation " comes as well from poetry , sculpture and painting , from all that warms the blood , that makes the past and the future predominate over the present , and that lifts the thoughts above the smoke and dust of earth , as from the deductions of reason , the inventions of science , the discoveries of philosophy and the exercise of the practical arts . He , who would strip life of all that ornaments and embellishes , that smooths its rough edges , that exists only in the imagination and gratifies that airy essence called taste , and bring us down to the bare and hard surface of utility , shews himself to be a poor patriot , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom of the Creator , who made the world beautiful as well as good , and dressed the wildflower in robes such as kings never wore . A man , who has been reared in a prison or a cloister , will be neither so wise nor so good as one , who has drank from childhood the beauty of the universe ; so a nation , whose citizens are wholly occupied with the body and its concerns , will be less great and truly glorious , than one , in which the people , not neglecting these things , yet feed with proper food the appetite for the unseen , the ideal and the beautiful , and give a roseate hue to the dusky shapes of reality . We hope that our rich men will think of these things and suffer a gifted countrymen to glean a few ears of that golden harvest , of which foreigners have often reaped the ripe luxuriance .
