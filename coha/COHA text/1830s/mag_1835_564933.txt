txt FORTY years had elapsed since Knowles , when a boy , de. * parted from his native city . In the spring of 1834 , an engagement having been offered him by his friend , Mr. Seymour , then lessee of the George 's Street theatre ; about the commencement of May , his natal month , Mr. Knoxvles embarked at Bristol , and after a very smooth and quick passage arrived in Cork . His two sons , Brinsley and George , accompanied him . lie had contemplated the visit with all the freshness of boyhood 's feelings - kept under check , however , by the experience of maturity . Disappointment , as we have heard him say , had been his familiar acquaintance so long , that her face never took him by surprise - he had learned to smile at seeing it . Accordingly , he had kept the adage - a prophet , ' &amp;c. - continually in his mind . He stood upon what must be admitted to be a proud and enviable eminence . His merits , as a dramatist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding the success of Virginius , Gracchus , Tell , and Alfred-had been at last set at rest by the production of the Hunchback . The palm was now conceded to him by all . Diurnals and periodicals vied with one another in their encomiums . The first place among the dramatists of his age was awarded him . He had proved himself an actor too , as well as an author . How would his native city receive her long absent son ? It was fortunate for him , that he had endeavored to moderate his expectations on this head . Cork is not an affluent city . His visit was made at a very unfavorable time - at a season when there is hardly any traffic going on between the country and the town - the dead time of the year , when business is almost entirely at a stand , and money , consequently , scarce . Although supported by Miss Jarman , a very accomplished and interesting actress , as well as a young lady of the most amiable private character , he fulfilled an engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the night of his first appearance , the theatre was little more than one fourth full ; and even at his benefit , notwithstanding the activity of several warm-hearted young fellows , who formed themselves into a committee for the occasion , the receipts fell considerably short of what the house would contain . But let it be recorded of the aristocratic gentry of Cork - let it be recorded to the credit of that class , that they stood consistently aloof . Not an individual among them but one vouchsafed a visit to their townsman . The door of his lodgings and the door of the theatre , were alike unsaluted by the compliment of // their footsteps . And why should it have been otherwise ? They or their fathers had persecuted the elder Knowles . How could the son look for a welcome from them ? Forty-two years before was the father of the dramatist the head of the most flourishing seminary in Cork . He dared to think as his cousin , the late R. B. Sheridan - as Fox and Grey did , upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The tories of Cork - the bigoted - the intolerant - the unsparing - and , unfortunately , the influential-united , heart and voice , in denouncing him as a man unfit to be entrusted with the education of youth . In a week , every form in his school was stripped . His ruin was irretrievable in his native land he was compelled to quit that land and go with his wife and three children to England - there to begin the world anexv But the dramatist had that within him , which made his first visit to his native city , after so long an absence from it , a sufficiently interesting one . Every street was an old play-fellow to him , whose face he knew the moment he looked upon it . He had forgotten nothing - he required no guide . His grandfather 's house - the house in which his father lived - the houses of several of his father 's friends were perfectly familiar to him . He knew at a glance , coming unexpectedly upon it , the chapel to which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul of the Queen of France . It was the same with a church , to which he was allowed to go one evening , when his sister 's music-master took her , and a party of young ladies , to hear the organ . To find out the cottage in which he had been nursed - it stood in a row with several others , exactly of the same appearance - would have been an easy thing , had not a large stone , which stood at the door , been removed . He went into the garden and saw the stump of an old tree , which had been cut down . Ah ! ' cried he , There is the old elder tree Is it not ? It was the remains of it . His memory , or rather his heart , was full of the pictures of his boyhood . But it was not streets and roads and houses and trees alone , that he remembered . The woman , that watched o'er his childhood , ' was still living . To her care and tenderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , until he was six years old , was an object of the greatest doubt and solicitude - so delicate was his constitution . Upon her was his first call ; not because - as it is stated in a memoir recently circulated in this country - not because he did not remember any one else in Cork , but be*ause she was worth all Cork to him . Her name was Carey . He found her comfortably situated in a kind and worthy family , by whom , out of respect for her fidelity , as a drynurse , she was treated as a friend - even sittin* at table with them . Another high gratification awaited him , in renewing his // acquaintance with his old writing-master , a gentleman of the name of Mitchell , then in his ninety-fifth year - as straight as a lath , with an eye still bright and glancing . He enjoyed , also , the satisfaction of meeting with an old friend of his family - . a Dr. Mann - an excellent hearted man , as he says , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , too , of the name of Trayers , who had been intimate with his father , was extemely attentive to him . 1'fr . Knowles had forgotten to provide himself with letters of introduction . A friend , however , more thoughtful of him than he was of himself , made up for the omission , and immediately sent a packet of them after him . By means of these letters , he made the acquaintance of one of the first mercantile gentlemen in Cork - a Mr. Murphy ; as well as that of several of the Roman Catholic pastors of that City . This , we have heard him say , was a source of great gratification to him , both on account of the hospitality with which he was treated , and of the opportunity with which it furnished him of denouncing , from personal knowledge , the calumnies , which the enemies of civil and religious freedom so industriously circulated to the prejudice of the clergymen of the native Irish church - of which establishment , Mr. Knowles , it must be remarked , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monastery , where he enjoyed the delightful spectacle of several hundreds of poor boys , occupied in receiving gratuitous instruction from the Friars - men , as he describes , of meek and modest deportment . The schools were conducted on the Lancastrian principle - only the course was more extensive than what is usually adopted in the parent seminary and its branches . Several of the boys were far advanced in the classics and in mathematics . They all looked healthy and happy . There were bare feet enough to be sure , as well as variegated coats ; but not a hand or a face that was not as clean as a new sixpence . ' But what made the greatest impression upon him , was his visit to the Ursuline Convent ; which , he says , he no sooner entered than instead of the gloom and stillness which he anticipated , he saw nothing but cheerfulness - certainly sedate - and the bustle of business . The fair recluses were engaged in superintending the education of a number of young persons of their own sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracefully entering the world , was taught there . He saw the most creditable specimens of drawing ; witnessed performances , both vocal and instrumental , of the very best description ; and was delighted at the proficiency of the pupils in geography , history , &amp;c. &amp;c . And there were little faces , fresh and clear with the satisfaction of healthful occupation , pleasingly conducted - anything but the // care and fag and weariness , which he had frequently remarked in the inmates of the lay boarding-school . Two of the sisterhood conducted him and his friends over the building - two unaffected , talented , and well-educated women . Nothing of the sombre about them , except the convent dress . Placid , polite , communicative - speaking and moving with the tongue and foot of life ! - the serenity of consummate satisfaction ! Nothing that indicated the feeling of a profession forced - an obligation regretted - a loss - a sacrifice ! Upon taking leave , one of the ladies , with whom Mr. Knowles more particularly conversed , remarked to him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to have extracts from one of them - William Tell - recited at the approaching examination of their pupils . She understood , she said , that he was on the point of embarking for America . She wished him all prosperity , and would pray for his safety ; and for his happiness , both temporal and eternal . She hoped he would not forget his native city - and that , when he thought of it , he would also give a thought to the Ursuline Convent - and to the Recluse of the Rock ! Mr. Knowles had every reason to be grateful to his clerical friends . He found them as hospitable as they were liberal and enlightened . He spent a great deal of his time with them , and often threatens to denounce Doctors O'Connor , Fleming , Sullivan , Daly , and O'Shea , to the Pope , for keeping company with a play-wright - a play-actor , and a heretic ! By the last named gentleman , he was flattered in a manner singularly gratifying to his feelings . No sooner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. O'Shea 's , to deliver his letter of introduction , than the face of the Doctor colored up with satisfaction . He advanced , and grasping him by both hands , told him that there was not a man in the United Kingdom whom he should be more proud and happy to see - and then , taking a case from his waistcoat pocket , presented to him a card , addressed to the dramatist , and which he had just prepared with a view of making him a call . He had read , he assured him , all his plays except the last- The Beggar of Bethnall Green- and , only a day or two before , he had been the mover of an order for the procuring of that comedy for a literary society , of which he was a member . In his native city , Mr. Knowles had a taste too , of true old Irish hospitality , in the instance of a family of the name of Barry , with whom he became intimate through a slight acquaintance with some of its members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the country as well as in the town , and finally laid an embargo upon his two sons , which was not taken off until , having finished engagements in Limerick and // Clonmell , Mr. Knowles wrote to Cork , entreating that the boys might he allowed to join him Dublin , preparatory to his embarking for Liverpool . In short , though disappointed in some respects , Mr. Knowles speaks of his return to his native city as a thing to be treasured among his sweetest recollections.
