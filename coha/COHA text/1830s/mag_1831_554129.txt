txt There is no feeling in our nature stronger or more universal than that which insists upon r*spect for the dead . It is found in every age and nation . The savage shows a kindness and reverence to the dead , which , he never pays the living ; and enlightened man ranks it among the most sacred of his duties , to offer the last sacrifice of affection at the grave . If the belief prevailed now , as in ancient days , that the spirits of the unburied suffered for the neglect of their friends , this feeling might be more easily accounted for ; hut it does not seem to partake of superstition ; it is rather sentiment , enlightened , just , and manly sentiment , influencing not only the intelligent , but many heside , who in general seem to he strangers to strong and delicate feeling . The light-hearted soldier , at the grave of his comrade , feels a heaviness which makes him a better man for the time ; the rough seaman leans thoughtfully over the side of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse has broken , are calm and unconscious again . At every village funeral , when the dead lies in the midst of the living , with a fixed and calm serenity on his brow ,  --  with an unsearchahie depth of meaning in his features , which no mortal eye may read ,  --  if it be only a child perishing in the daybreak of its existence , whose loss will he as little felt in the world at large as the withering of a garden-flower ,  --  still he is for the time invested with the commanding majesty of death ; children join their hands and look timidly around them ; old men lean upon their staves and ponder ; though among them , he seems no longer of them ; the air of gentle and firm reserve on his countenance gives the impression that he sees what we can not see , hears what we can not hear , and is already acquainted with those mysteries of the future , which the living desire and yet tremble to know . Neither does this interest in the dead cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the grave , and makes us regard as sacred the place where we have laid them . The hurial-place is the retreat of the thoughtful ; the shoes of care and passion are put off hy those who enter the lonely ground . // It has a good effect upon the feelings ; it makes the unfortunate more reconciled to this world , and the gay more thoughtful of another . The cold ghastliness of the sculptured marble ,  --  the grey stone sinking , as if weary of bearing its unregarded legends of the ancient dead ; the various inscriptions showing , sometimes , what the dead were , but still oftener what they ought to have been , subdue the heart to sadness , though not to gloom . And what a lion in the path is the public feeling , to all who would disturb the repose of the tomb ! It is easier to rifle the mansion of the living , than the narrow house of the dead ; for the living can protect themselves , and therefore are less regarded , while the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms to resent an insult offered to the dead . This feeling may be excessive ,  --  perhaps it is ,  --  but no one can deny that it is energetic and strong . We do not condemn nor defend it ; but the thirsty vengeance with which it pursues offenders , shows how deep is the reverence of the living for the dead . One reason why the home of the dead is thus sacred , is , that this is the place where we lose them . Up to this place we follow them through the changes of life and death ; but at the gates of the tomb , they are taken and we are left . We are forcibly driven back , and the mind loses itself in earnest con* jectures respecting their destiny ,  --  *-what it may be , now it is thus widely separated from ours . The most striking view we ever saw of the great cataract of our country , represented simply the waters above , and the long line where they lean to dash below ; the rest was left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound impression of the grandeur of the scene , than representation or description by measure could possibly have given . Thus it is with the surface of the ground where the dead are laid ; hitherto we come , but no further ; we see not how nor where they are gone ; this is the boundary , beyond which the living can not go nor the dead return ; and it arrests and chains the imagination , like the place in the ocean where some gallant wreck went down . This will account for the universal interest which the cities of the dead inspire ; but not for all the tenderness with which the dead are regarded . This is owing to what Adam Smith calls our sympathy with the dead . Where and what they are now we do not know ; we therefore still represent them to our minds with feelings like our own . It seems to us as if they // must be conscious when the light step of affection moves above , as if the stranger , rudely trampling above them , might disturb their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunbeam on the green roof of their narrow mansion , as if it could light up the darkness below ; and if we see a tree or a flower planted above them , we feel as if they must revive and rejoice in the pledge that their memory is still treasured by some who loved them . We feel bound to remember them , as we would wish ourselves to be remembered , after we have gone in that narrow way where there are no traces of returning feet . Allow that all this is imagination . Still it is universal ; it must and will be regarded . The man will lose the respect of the living , who does not venerate the dead . However much we disdain these feelings and fancies of our nature , we must submit to them , or the great verdict of mankind will be against us . If a stranger enter a village , he judges the character of its inhabitants by the aspect of their burial-ground ; and if he see a place abandoned to decay , surrounded by a coarse enclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her verdure and flowers luxuriantly , as if uphraiding the cold neglect of mau ,  --  his most natural feeling is contempt for the living , and compassion for the dead . So too in our cities , where we see the place of death upon the busy street , where the sounds of life are brought into rude contrast with the silence of the grave , where towering mansions overlook the field , as if waiting impatiently for the elements to waste the marble of the tombs , that they may usurp the inheritance of the dead , it gives us a double feeling of regret , that the founders of the city had not foreseen it , and that the present inhabitants do not bring trees and flowers to take away the desolation of the spot , while they resolve to place the dead in future beyond the possible reach of violation . It is interesting to observe the effect of this reverence for the dead in different ages of the world . How many mansions of death remain , when ancient houses of the living are gone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ca*sars ; the Egyptian . tomb of the kings remains perfect , when the pyramids are nameless ruins . Even in this country , the moss-grown stone outlasts the most durable habitations of our fathers . It would seem as if man desired to re-assure him .. self , in the presence of death , that he is not all frailty , by raising monuments , which long after he is gone , may resist the waste // of time . Generally , the place selected for the repose of the dead has been chosen , in consistency with the sympathy of which we have spoken ; in places lonely , but not deserted , where the beauty of nature is heightened by the care of man , where the gloom of death can not sadden the hearts of the living , nor the labor of life stand in too close contrast to the stillness of the dead . We find in the earliest authentic history of the human race , that Abraham , when Sarah died , buried her in a place of this description . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of Heth on this occasion . In their respect for his excellence and greatness , they besought him to take any of their sepulchres , but he declined the pro-. posal . When he had signified what spot of ground he desired to have , the owner entreated him to accept it as a gift ; but this also he declined ; and the proprietor consented to accept four hundred pieces of silver for the field , and all the trees that were within its limits and on its borders . This circumstance , thought worthy of being noticed in a history so general , shows that he had some regard to the beauty of the place ; and with a similar taste , groves and gardens seem to have been chosen as the burial-places of all the Hebrews , who were rich enough to possess them . When Jacob was dying in Egypt , he could not bear the thought of being committed to the earth in the A*Lance and solitude of a foreign land , and he charged his children to secure to him the privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacted a similar promise from his children . Doubtless , this earnestness was in part inspired by associations connected with the place of death . It is not improbable that the Israelites learned this reverence for the dead in Egypt , which Abraham had visited in his earlier days . It is certain that they borrowed the practice of embalming , in which the Egyptians excelled all other nations . This singular practice , doubtless , originated in a desire to preserve the features of the departed for the satisfaction of their descendants , and may have been serviceable in keeping up the memory and example of virtue . It is said , that the mummies were sometimes introduced at their festivals . Doubtless the bodily presence of those who were distinguished in their day , must have exerted a powerful influence on those who saw them ; but the thought of death must be presented in such a manner as makes it welcome ; if it come when unbidden or // unsuited to the place and time , it does more injury than good . And this is a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and luxuriance of nature , from which the soul is always ready to look to the grand and solemn vision of death . The great Egyptian Cemetery was in a place of this description . It was on the farther shore of the lake Acherusia , near Meniphis , ornamented with trees and water-courses , and answering to the Elysian fields of later times . On the nearer side of the lake was assembled the celebrated court , which sat in judgment on the dead . The more wealthy Egyptians sacrificed this true taste for nature to their ambition of splendor ; their mumrDies were gathered in catacombs , whence , after an immortality of three thousand years , they are stolen as curiosities or plundered of their aromatic gums . The tomb of the kings , discovered by Belzoni , ahounded in magnificence , and the plastering on its walls was so fresh and brilliant , that his richest colors were pale beside them . The pyramids do not seem to have been intended exclusively , if at all , as monuments of the dead . When Belzoni opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central chamber , which turned out to be those of a sacred animal , and not of man . What importance was attached to the rites of sepulture among the Hebrews , appears from the well known vision , in which Isaiah described the downfall of the Assyrian king ; prophesying , how he should sink in all his glory beneath the mightier arm of death . The prophet represents the whole earth as rejoicing in his overthrow , and saying , with its thousand voices , How hath the oppressor fallen ! the golden city fallen ! The fir-trees , ( which were the chiefs of Israel , ) rejoice , saying , now thou art cut down , no destroyer will come tip against us . ' And where is he , whose ruin causes all this exultation ? His corpse is cast out hy the way-side , and thus visited with the deepest dishonor ; there , way-farers find him , and triumph over him , as he lies helpless before them . They gaze earnestly upon him , saying , Is this the man that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world a wilderness ? ' They taunt him with his heing thus cast out by the way-side like an accursed thing , and compare him with those whose remains enjoy the honors of the tomb . The kings of the earth , ' they say , lie in glory , every one with his sword under his head ; hut thou art cast out from the grave , because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people . ' // And when , in the continued vision , he arrives at the entrance of the vast cavern , in which the embalmed remains of his royal race were laid , the whole realm of death rises up to meet him ; chiefs and kings break the slumber of years ; they bend their stern brows on their degenerate son , the last and most unworthy of their mighty line , and say , in anger and scorn , Art thou become weak as we ? art thou become like unto us ? How art thou fallen from Heaven , bright morning-star ! ' That the Assyrian oppressor should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last vengeance of the Almighty . The worm is spread under thee , and the worms cover thee . ' The whole vision shows in an impressive manner , what a reproach and misfortune it was then considered , to lose the shelter of the grave . There is no doubt , then , of the importance attached by the Hebrews to the burial of the dead ; and this , as well as their patriotism , is a feeling which stands out in contrast to their usual hardness . In fact , the grave , in all countries and times , is the place where the best feelings are awakened ; the conflicts of passion cease there , and all other feelings are lost in sympathy and concern for those who sleep within its narrow bounds . Before Christianity came , it was all the world had to remind them , that all must be equal at last , and that the rich must come from his palace and the poor from his labor , to sleep side by side in death . And to their honor he it said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being reminded of their duties . But while all ancient nations united in doing the utmost honor to the departed , there was no uniformity in the selection of their places of rest . Among the Hebrews , the sepulchre was sometimes , like our Saviour 's , in a garden ; sometimes under a tree , and sometimes hewn from the sides of the rock . They were as various as the wealth and the ambition of the people ; but it seems clear , that where the ground would not admit of cultivation , they kept up a simple and expressive custom of strewing the grave with flowers . The Greeks and Romans , likewise , buried their dead in groves and gardens , sometimes by the borders of the public roads , where their names might be often brought to the remembrance of those who passed by . The Athenian Ceramicus , the cemetery which received those who had lived or died in the service of their country , was ornamented in such a manner as to make it a pleasant resort for all who wished to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all antiquity , we find the same evidence of the fact , that death carried with it a title of respect ; the king of terrors imparted something of his own majesty to all the victims of his power . The grave was the place where the living looked their last upon the dead ; and to surround it with proofs of the interest with which it inspired them , was thought the least that affection or esteem could do . On one point , the testimony of the ancient world seems to have been unanimous and decided we mean as to the propriety of removing the dead from the immediate vicinity of the living ; not that they apprehended injurious effects upon the health of their cities ; hut guided by sentiment and propriety alone , they agreed in the necessity of this separation . The rule seems to have been generally observed , except in case of those whose wealth and vanity enabled them to break through it , or of public men , who were thought to have earned a- right to sleep in the midst of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in churches is an invention of comparatively modern times . Constantine is said to have been the first , who ordered his sepulchre to be erected within the consecrated walls , and the superstition which * ttended the imperfect Christianity of the earlier ages , led ofhers to follow his example ; the church being regarded as a fortress , whose spiritual defences would keep off the evil spirits , which were always striving to break the rest of the dead . We can not speak confidently with respect to the danger to health which arises from such practices . It has probably been over-rated , if , indeed , it exist at all . But , apart from this , there are reasons of a different character , why the dead should be removed from the intrusive and engrossing neighborhood of the living , where their memory is sure to perish , and their remains , after being allowed to rest so long as friends can remember and defend them , are at last trampled under feet . We know there are those , who say it is of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care not what becomes of the body , when the soul has left it . But this philosophic contempt of such things is not a natural feeling . The least thing associated with the remembrance of a departed friend , is consecrated in every good mind ; and whoever treats such memorials with indifference , however he may boast his own freedom from prejudice , shocks the moral sense of mankind . If there are some , who reason themselves into indifference , with // many these thoughts are full of power . We know that Christianity has exalted the claims of the mind , and taught its disciples to deem lightly of the suffering and even the destruction of the body , compared with the welfare of the immortal part . But religion is never at war with nature ; and the same religion , which requires the sacrifice of every thing at the call of duty , allows the fullest indulgence to every natural and innocent feeling . There are examples in modern history , which show how important it is to guard and respect the quiet of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when their unmanly vengeance cast out Cromwell , Ireton and Bradshaw from their tombs ; it turned the moral feeling of the world against them . And we douht not that much of the interest which still attaches to the name of Napoleon , is owing to the circumstance of his lonely sepulchre in the heart of ' the seas , as if his remains were banished from the presence of men . Far better would it have been to let him rest in Pare-la- Gltctise , where the enthusiasm of his adorers could spend itself upon his grave . In his character , there was very little to admire or love ; but his imprisonment on a rock in the ocean had made many feel for him as an exile , who cared nothing for his glory . They feel , too , as if the dead who can offend no longer , might be permitted to sleep in the land which is still covered with the blaze of his renown . Such , if we may depend on an ancient history , was the judgment of Louis XL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . No one can believe that he was influenced by any generous feeling ; but when he was solicited to deface the monument of Bedford , the great Regent of France , he indignantly refused . What honor will it be to me , ' said he , to deface the sepulchre of a man , whom my fathers could not prevail against while he lived ; a man , whose wit and valor shame the proudest of us all ? I rather say , May God have mercy on his soul ! ' This accomplished hypocrite had wisdom enough to know , that policy and his own interest , setting aside generosity , required of him to respect the dead . The Report which has led us into these reflections , is signed by the President of the Horticultural Society , and it could not appear under better auspices ; this gentleman , and those associated with him , having secured the respect of many in every part of our community , by their liberality in giving all kinds of aid to those , whose pursuits are similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; it is to teach those who have wealth and leisure , how they may make themselves happy not only without injuring others , but with direct benefit to their fellow-men ; to show them that in order to secure enjoyment for themselves , there is no need of inventing new pleasures ; that they have only to learn to value those which are always under their eye ; and that Nature ,  --  ' this beautiful visible world , ' opens a never-failing paradise to those who are content to be iI ) nocent and well employed . The plan proposed to the community in this Report , comes naturally within the sphere of their liberal exertions . The design is , to teach the community to pay more respect to the dead . In this particular we are certainly behind other countries . In most nations of Europe there are at least a few public cemeteries , which a stranger can visit without feeling that the dead are neglected . We are told in the Report , that the Turks , half savage as they are , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of tombs . The modern cities of Europe have begun to feel , that it is not well that infidels should triumph over them in this respect . P4*rela-Chaise in Paris is now celebrated throughout the world . rhe impression which it makes on the mind of every traveller , is the best proof of the good taste which designed it . The larger cities of England are beginning to follow this good example . In our country , New-Haven has the merit of making the first approtich to this kind of improvement ; but the example was not followed . The burying-place continues to be the most neglected spot in all the region , distinguished from other fields only by its leaning stones and the meanness of its enclosure , without a tree or shrub to take from it the air of utter desolation . We can not but hope that the cemetery about to be established will put our cities arid villages to shame , and spread a better taste and feeling in this respect throughout the whole country . The place selected for the cemetery is Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and easily approached either by the road or the river which washes its borders . It affords every variety of soil and elevation , which trees or flowers would require , with streams and meadows , from which ponds may be made for plants which love the water . The plants of every climate may find there a suitable home . It might be thought that it would require many years to cover it with verdure ; but Nature h*rs anticipated this objec // tion ; it being already clothed with trees and shrubs of almost all descriptions , which grow in this part of the country . The most striking part of this tract is a conical hill of considerable height , which commands an extensive and beautiful prospect . This is reached by a gentle ascent , which winds like a road round the hill , with valleys on each side , and is so exact in its bearing , that it is difficult to persuade one's-self that man had no agency in forming it . The top of the height is an admirable place for a monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides will afford room for the resting-place of many generations . The whole country would not afford a better spot for the purpose than this . It is consecrated already by many delightful associations in the memory of most of those , who have left the University for many years past ; and the plan proposed , instead of breaking up this favorite resort , would only render it better suited to aid the inspirations of science , feeling , or imagination . There is something unpleasant to many , in the idea of cultivating the place of death . This may he owing to the old prejudice , which regards nature and art as opposed to each other . Nature , under all circumstances , was meant to be improved by human care ; it is unnatural to leave it to itself ; and the traces of art are never unwelcome , except when it defeats the purposes and refuses to follow the suggestions of nature . We trust that the public spirited authors of this design will consider themselves as diving a direction to the public taste ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disfigured with dungeon-like tombs , which are only suited to the cellars of churches and burying-places in cities , where the dead can not find room to lie dust to dust . The monuments also deserve regard . The stiff and ungainly head-stone should he banished to give place to the cippus , or some simple form suited to resist th' elements , and receive inscriptions . But the ornaments of the sepulchre should be trees and flowers . Let the monuments be found in the noble forests of our land ; let them not be such as the elements waste , but such as time only strengthens and repairs.
