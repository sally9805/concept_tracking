txt IN former numbers of this Magazine , ( vol. vi . p. 25 and 105 ; there are two articles , embracing some account of the first introduction of the organ into our Congregational churches , and of those individuals who commenced the building of organs in this part of the country . The perusal of those sketches induced a highly respectable gentleman , possessing a very extensive personal knowledge of the subject , and of the ecclesiastical occurrences , for nearly half a century past , connected with Boston and its vicinity , to commit to paper a few hasty notes , which he afterwards communicated to the writer of those articles , for his further information . Such corrections , facts , and anecdotes , as are deemed suitable for publication , have been selected , and will be found in the following pages . They will not only be interesting to the antiquary , but some of them may , perhaps , afford amusement to the general reader . In the Magazine , ( vol. vi . p. 36 ) it is intimated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present Catholic church in Franklin street was built . The writer was well aware , that a few Catholics had previously occupied an old meeting-house in School street , which they hired for some time ; but he did not consider this as really having a church . ' The remark , however , has given occasion for the relation of an anecdote connected with the old church , and for some account of the early history of the Catholics in Boston , which are here given , in the following extract from the notes that have been mentioned . There stood formerly , on the spot now occupied , in School street , Boston , by the Universalist church , ( Mr. Balion 's ) a small chapel , with one gallery in front , and another on the left side of the pulpit , which was semicircular , built by some of the Hugonots , who fled from France at the time of the repeal of the edict of Nantz , with their minister , Mr. La Massa ; and by them it was occupied for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate . One after another died ; and their children gave up their worship , and mixed with other societies . The doors were , of course , closed for a long time . At length , Mr. William Croswell , a blind man , ( whom I well recollect , and who has , at this moment , a son bearing the same name , and a daughter , likewise , residing in the same house with him , somewhere at the south part of the city ) who was called , in those days , a Xew-light preacher , was there for a long time within my remembrance . At length , there came along the late Mr. John Murray , the Universalist , ( Croswell being dead ) and he preached there , for a time , to any audience he could collect* He wa* // earnestly opposed by all the ministers in and about Boston , amongst whom , the Rev. Mr. Bacon , then minister of the Old South church , distinguished himselt* It having been given out , that Murray was to preach one evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his zeal , went to hear him , in order to answer him after his sermon . As soon as Murray had finished , Bacon stept up two or three stairs of the pulpit , and called out- All that Mr. Murray has said is a delusion . I beg the people to stop , and I will prove it to them . ' Among the audience , there were several of Mr. Bacon 's parish , who attended in order to hear him put down Murray . ' Murray instantly stept to the pulpit-door , opened it , and begged him to walk in , which he peremptorily declined ; not willing even to stand in the same desk with him . Murray , however , earnestly repeated his request , saying - The people can hear you much better , Mr. Bacon , from the pulpit , than they can from that stair . ' Bacon , however , still declined . After he had finished , Murray rejoined , and excited great laughter , ( for he was a great wit ) at Mr. Bacon s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply ; to which , Murray instantly rejoined , producing increased laughter at Bacon . Bacon 's friends were irritated , and ran to an old woman s huxter-shop - who occupied the next building - bought all her eggs , carried them into the church , and threw them at Murray , as he stood in the pulpit . He humorously replied - Well , my dear friends , these are moving arguments ; but , 1 must own , at the same time , II have never been so fully treated with Bacon and eggs before , in all my life . - . at the same time , retiring from the pulpit . This brought a roar of laughter on Mr. Bacon , who left the church , and never afterwards interfered with Mr. Murray . So went the story in my youthful days . Soon after this , there came along the Rev. Mr. Rausselett , a chaplain on board a French vessel , who commenced , for the first time , the Catholic worship , in that church . His character , I remember , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterie , another French Catholic ; then John Thayer , who was , or pretended to have been , converted* to the Catholic faith in Rome . He was formerly a Congregational preacher , but never ordained as such . He has relations now living in Boston . I knew him well ; considered a very eccentric man . He was ordained in Rome . After continuing a while in that church , he left it , and went south , where he died . After him , came IDr . Matignon ; and in 1794 , I think , or 1795 , came Mr. ( afterwards bishop ) Chevereux . Whilst they officiated in the old church , in School street , the Doctor applied to the writer of these notes to sell them a small organ , for their church , which he then had itt his possession , and had advertised for sale ; and the church were prevented from having it , merely by the // sudden death of the man who was to have played , whose name I can not at this moment recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person among them , who could play it as that man had proposed , gratuitously , and being too small in numbers , and too poor in pence , to hire an organist , the matter was altogether relinquished . Ahout the year 1805 , the present Catholic church was built , where it now stands , and the old one was sold to the Universalists , who built upon the ground the present hrick church , that is now there . It is said , in the Magazine , ( vol. vi . p. 37 ) speaking of the organ in Brattle street church- ' This was the first organ erected in any Congregational church in Boston , and was undoubtedly the only one then contained in any church , not Episcopal , in New-England . ' This , it appears , is not strictly correct . A small organ bad previously been used in the Old Brick church , that is now there . An account of the circumstances , attending its introduction , is thus related in the notes The first introduction of organs into our Congregational churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , is of recent date , and perfectly within my recollection . Our fathers thought they savored of Popery and Episcopacy , and therefore excluded them from their places of worship . They thought the same , likewise , of wearing the black gown and cassock ; and they were never worn , in any of our New-England churches , until they came into use , and were worn , for the first time , on the very same day , and in the very same house of worship , where the first organ had ever sounded in an American Congregational church . That church has long since been removed to Chauncy place , in Boston ; and the spot it occupied is converted into stores and offices . After the Old Brick meeting-house , as it was then called , had undergone very extensive alterations , internally , as well as repairs without , in the year 1785 - forty-nine years since , two of its most influential members , ( the late Dr. John Joy , and Joseph Woodward , who is still living at South Boston - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship in a higher church ) feeling a deep interest in the welfare , respect , ability , and success of the society , and desiring to render it more attractive , proposed an organ , and contributed generally to its purchase . They first placed a very small one , of two stops only , in the loft . This was , ten years since , in the possession of Mr. John Mycall , at Camhridgeport . It was a miserable instrument , and was removed the day or two after it was tried , but was never used there on any Sunday . The society then purchased , of Nathan IPrazer , senior , a large , English chamher-organ , which he had imported for his own use . This instrument remained in that church till the house was taken down , when it was sold to the Rev. Dr. Codman 's society , in // Dorchester , whence it has recently been transferred to the IDedbarn Episcopal church , where it now is . It has one row of keys , and contains eight stops , including sesquialter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in procuring the organ , presented both Dr. Chauncy and Mr. Clarke , from subscriptions of various persons , which they set on foot , a black gown and cassock each , with a request that they might be worn , on the day of their return to their newly-repaired church , when the organ would , also , for the first time , be played . The senior pastor , Dr. Chauncy , who had recently been engaged in a theological controversy with the late Bishop of Landoff , and some other distinguished clergymen of the Episcopal church in England , objected , saying- ' It looked too Episcopal . ' They repliedAll your people , sir , would be gratified by your doing so . ' What ! black gown and organ both ? ' said the old gentleman . Yes , sir , ' they rejoined . Well , ' he replied , I suppose , then , it will be well enough to let them have their own way . Children are always pleased with fine clothes and baubles and whistles , and so they shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon tired of them . ' The black gowns were worn accordingly , both by Dr. Chauncy and Mr. Clarke ; and the organ was played , for the first time , in the first Congregational society that was established in the town of Boston . This was seven years previous to the introduction of the organ into Brattle street church , in 1792 , at which church I was present on the Sunday immediately preceding the one on which it was first played . It was then putting up , but the work was not entirely finished . I was , ( continues the writer ) from my earliest recollection , extravagantly fond of music , particularly of sacred music ; and of the solemn , deep tones of the organ , above every other instrument . This led me to take a peculiar interest in such things , to notice , more particularly , the introduction and building of church organs , and to impress more strongly upon my memory the time and circumstances connected with their history in this part of the country . I always feared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest it might interfere with my duties , and with more important pursuits . But , to this hour , I hear no organ , without being immediately arrested in my walks ; and I find it difficult to quit the all-absorbing melody it emits . The order of time , in which organs were introduced into our Congregational churches , in Boston and the vicinity , was , as the writer of these notes well recollects , as follows . 1 . The Congregational church , in which an organ was first placed , was the Old Brick . Meeting-house , ' so called , then situated where Joy 's buildings ' now stand . This was in 1785 . The organ has been already described . 2 . An organ was next placed in the first Universalist church , at the north-end , about the year 1791 or // 1792 , where the Rev. John Murray was then , or soon afterwards , the settled minister . It was built by Dr. Leavitt , of Boston . 3 . The third organ was the fine English instrument , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was played by Hans Gram , a German , of some celebrity in his day . 4 . The fourth organ was placed in the Rev. Dr. Kirkland 's church , in Summer street , ( Church Green . ) It was stated in the Magazine , ( vol. vi . p. 38 ) on the authority of Monsieur Mallet , who was the first organist , that it was a very large chamber-organ , with two rows of keys . This is a mistake . It had but one row of keys , and only five stops , namely : stopt diapason , dulciana , principal , fifteenth , and flute . It was afterwards in the Episcopal church at South Boston . 5 . The fifth organ was introduced into the first congregational church in Charlestown , of which , the Rev. Dr. Morse was the minister . This was an English chainher-organ , imported by James Cutler , Esq . ( brother of the widow of the late Bishop Parker ) for his own use . It has recently been taken down , and disposed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a larger one ; and it has since been purchased of him for the mariners ' church , on Fort hill . Its tone is excellent . It has one row of keys , and six stops , namely : stopt diapason , dulciana , principal , fifteenth , flute , and hauthoy ; the latter in a swell . 6 . A small organ , of four stops , built by Dr. Leavitt , in 1799 , then living in Portland , was next introduced at the Rev. Dr. Gray 's church , Jamaica Plain , Roxhury . It was played by barrels , on which was set a large number of the psalm tunes then in use . Manual keys were afterwards added , and the bass extended . It was subsequently sold to an Episcopal church in Connecticut , where the proceeds of two concerts upon it paid its cost . 7 . An organ , built by Dr. Leavitt , was next placed in the old Congregational church , in Newburyport , of which , the Rev. Messrs . Carey and Andrews were then ministers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church of the Rev. Dr. John Prince , of Salem . 9 . A large organ , built by Geib , of New-York , was soon after erected in the late Dr. Barnard 's church , in Salem . Not long afterwards , organs were gradually introduced into a great number of our principal churches , of all denominations . The late James Swan , Esq. , who died in France some time since , offered , many years ago , an organ to the first Congregational church , in Dorchester , ( now Dr. Harris 's ) of which , the Rev. Moses Everett was then minister . The offer was refused . Either the present Nicholas Brown , Esq. , of Providence , or his father or uncle , ( I am uncertain which ) offered , likewise , an organ to the Baptist church , in Providence , which was also refused . The circumstances and incidents , which have been stated in these notes , are not mere heresay ; they are entirely within my // own personal knowledge . And hQxv soon are facts forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Cadets , from West-Point , had visited Boston , and encamped a day or two on the common , it was purposed to adopt a uniform dress for the students at the University at Cambridge . A gentleman , now living , ( one of the Overseers ) attended a meeting of the board , when a student was introduced , dressed in the uniform proposed . He alluded to the fact , of a former uniform worn at the college . Not a person present , except himself , had the least recollection of such a circumstance . It was doubted , even by the president himself , who was one of the earliest that wore it . The gentleman insisted on the fact , and described the uniform , in every particular . He was still doubted ; for , strange to tell , no one could recall the memory of a uniform , which he must have worn if it were true . Reference was made to the college laws , and in them was found a full confirmation of all that had been stated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress himself , and recollected it perfectly well ; yet , he could never meet one of his college mates , who remembered the existence of this uniform . So soon pass away the recollections of our youthful scenes and days !
