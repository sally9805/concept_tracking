Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : A DREAM OF THE SEA . from A dream of the sea ( 1830 ) I slept ; and lo ! upon my shrinking sight The melancholy waste of ocean rose ; Not with its glassy pictures of delight , When o'er its caves the glancing sunbeam throws The peerless glory of a deep repose ; But like a world of waters , sounding high , As when o'er Alps the rushing storm-clouds close ; Thus each roused foam-wreath whitened in the sky , And blending with their roar , came Terror 's funeral cry . Deep murmured unto deep ; the up-heaving tide Disclosed the skeleton , the diadem ; Once shrieks arose , to which no heart replied , When the waves made a sepulchre for them , As the storm-spirit heard the requiem , And fanned the dun clouds with his dusky wing ; Young , bounding hearts , that scarce the air could stem , To boundless depths were given , an offering , Faded , as buds will fade , cut off in early spring ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning went upon its hurried way ; Oh ! that a gift of eloquence were mine , That stirring scene of horror to portray , All mingled in one dark and dim array ! I stood upon the shore ; the lone gull near , As he swept onward through the troubled spray , Shook his stern pinions by my startled ear , Hastening , with screams of joy , upon his proud career ! I woke ! ' T was morning  --  in the infant year  --  Roused by the voices of the early spring , How danced my heart , as eloquent and clear The reckless wild birds chanted on the wing , Pouring their lays , a sinless offering ! While silver streams by meadow verdure wound Far through the pleasant landscape glistening , As buds bent humbly to the dewy ground , And steeped in golden light , the blue hills stretched around !
