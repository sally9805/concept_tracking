txt AFTER having described the hull-fights , I see no other way of following the admirable rule of the puppet-show - from the strong to the stronger - than by giving you the history of an execution . I have just seen one , and , if you have the courage to listen , will describe it to you . 1 will first explain to you how it happened that I became the witness of such a scene . In a strange country , one is expected to see everything ; and we are always afraid of losing , in a moment of weariness or ennui , some peculiar national traits . As the history of the criminal had interested me , I was desirous of seeing him , and was finally induced to try an experiment on my nerves . You shall have the story of my hanged gentleman ; ( I forgot to inquire his name . ) He was a native of the environs of Valencia , esteemed and feared for his bold and enterprising character . In his village , he was the cock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoit farther , or knew more old romances . He was not quarrelsome , but it was well known that but little was necessary to provoke him . If he attended travelers , with his carbine slung over his shoulders , no robber would dare to attack them , had their valises been filled with doubloons . It was really a pleasure to see the youth , in his vest of velvet , strutting through the roads with such an air of superiority . In a word , he was a majo , in all the expressiveness of that term . A majo is , at the same time , a dandy of the lower class , and exceedingly nice on the point of honor . The Valencians have a proverb against the Valencians , and a proverb , in my opinion , of utter falsity . It is as follows : At Valencia , the food is of grass ; the grass of water . The men are women , and women-nothing . ' My word for it , the cookery of Valencia is excellent , and the women exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . You will see what scrt of men they have there . A bull-fight was given . Our majo wished to see it , but he had not a rial in his purse . He counted on the kindness of a volunteer royalist - a friend of his , on guard that day - for admittance . He reckoned without his host . The volunteer was *nflexible . The majo insists - the volunteeer is obstinate ; and high words are given on both sides . To be brief , the volunteer repulses him rudely , with a punch in his stomach from the butt- * From the French of Prosper Merim*e , author of A Bull-Fight at Madrid , , ' translated in our October number . // end of his musket . The majo withdrew ; but the bystanders - who observed the paleness which overspread his features , his clenched fists , expanded nostrils , and the expression of his eyesanticipated some speedy and severe revenge . Fifteen days afterwards , the brutal volunteer was sent with a detachment in pursuit of some smugglers . He slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard calling the volunteer . Open , it is a messenger from your wife . ' The volunteer comes down , half dressed . Hardly had he opened the door , when the discharge of a blunderbuss lodged a dozen bullets in his breast . The murderer disappeared . Who was he ? No one could imagine . It was certainly not the inajo who killed him , for he found a dozen religious women and good loyalists , who would kiss their thumb and swear by the name of their saint , that they had seen the aforesaid gentleman , each one in her own village , at precisely the hour and minute when the crime was committed . And the majo appeared in public , with the open front and serene air of a man who had relieved himself of an irksome duty . It is thus at Paris , that an individual shows himself at Tortoni 's , on the evening of a duel , in which he has run some impertinent fellow through the arm . Observe in passing , that assassination is here the duel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with us , since it is usually followed by two deaths ; whilst in good society , people are better satisfied with scratching than killing . Everything went on swimmingly , till an over-zealous alguazileither because he was newly appointed to office , or because he was in love with a woman who preferred the majo to himselfintimated a disposition to arrest this amiable individual . While he confined himself to menaces , his rival only laughed ; but when he undertook to seize him by the collar , he made him swallow a neat 's tongue . It is an expression they have for a blow with a knife . Did the law of self-defence permit him thus to vacate the office of an alguazil ? The alguazils are much respected in Spain , almost as much as the constables in England . Misusing one of them is a hanging matter . So the majo was apprehended , thrown into prison , judged , and , after a very long process , condemned - for the forms of justice are even more tardy here than among us . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this man did not merit his fate ; that he was the victim of a sad fatality ; and that , without overloading their consciences , the judges could have restored him to the society of which , as the lawyers say , he was so distinguished an ornament . ' But the judges were unmoved by any of these elevated and poetical considerations ; they unanimously condemned him to death . // One evening , passing by chance through the market-place , I observed a number of workmen engaged by torch-light in raising the rafters of a gallows . A guard of soldiers around them repelled the approach of the inquisitive . The reason of this precaution is as follows . The gallows is raised by corve'e ; and the workmen put in requisition can not refuse the service , under the penalty of a condemnation for rehellion . By way of cornpensation , the authorities provide that they discharge their task. - which public opinion considers a disgraceful one - in secret . On this account , they work only at night , surrounded by a guard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen from being recognized . So they avoid the epithet of gallows-builders , ' on the morrow . At Valencia , there is an old Gothic tower , which answers the purposes of a prison . Its architecture is rather pretty , particularly in the front which faces the river . It is situated at an extremity of the city , and serves as a gate . They call it the Gate of the Mountaineers . ' From its platform , you can trace the course of the Guadalaviar , the five bridges which cross it , the promenades of Valencia , and the smiling country which surrounds it . It is but a sad pleasure to look upon green fields , when one is shut within four walls ; hut still it is a pleasure. - and the prisoner must needs thank the jailer , who permits him to ascend the platform . For the prisoner , the smallest pleasure has its value . It was from this prison that the condemned was to deliver himself , to cross the most populous streets of the city , mounted on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit the world . I found myself at an early hour before the Gate of the Mountaineers , ' with one of my Spanish friends , who was kind enough to accompany me . I expected to find a considerable crowd collected in the morning , but was deceived . The artizans were quietly occupied in their workshops ; the peasants left the city after they had sold their vegetables ; nothing indicated that any unusual scene was to be exhibited , except a dozen of dragoons ranged before the gate of the city . The little curiosity displayed by the Valencians to witness executions , ought not to be attributed , I think , to any excess of sensibility . I know not if I ought to think , with my guide , that they have been so blase 's with such exhibitions as to have lost all taste for them . Perhaps this indifference may arise from the laborious habits of the people of Valencia . Love of labor and gain distinguishes them , not merely among the people of Spain , but even among those of all Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened , and a numerous procession of Franciscans makes its appearance . It was preceded by a large crucifix borne by a penitant , escorted by two Acolytes , each one of whom carried a lantern fixed at the end of // a long wand , The crucifix , of full size , was of pasteboard , painted with great skill . The Spaniards , who labor to make religion terrible , excel in representing the wounds , the contusions , the marks of the tortures endured by their martyrs . On this crucifix , intended to figure at an execution , they had been very liberal of blood , gore , and livid tumors . It was the most hideous piece of anatomy that can be imagined . The bearer of this horrible figure stopped before the gate . The soldiers were drawn near together ; about a hundred spectators were grouped at a short distance behind , near enough to lose nothing of what was said and done , when the condemned appeared , accompanied by his confessor . I shall never forget the figure of this man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be about thirty years of age . His forehead was high , his hair thin , black as jet , and straight as the bristles of a brush . His eyes , large but sunken , shone like coals . He was barefoot , dressed in a long black robe , on which was painted a blue and red cross , just over the heart . It is the emblem of the brotherhood of the dying . The collar of his shirt , gathered in plaits , fell over his shoulders and his breast . A whitish cord , which was distinctly marked on the black stuff of his robe , was twisted many times about his body , and by complicated knots bound his arms and hands in the attitude of prayer . Between his hands he held a small crucifix , and an image of the Virgin . His confessor was short , fat , full-blooded , with the air of a good man , hut of a man long accustomed to this kind of business . Behind the condemned , was a man , pale , feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wore a brown vest , with black breeches and stockings . I should have taken him for a notary , or an alguazil in neglig* , if he had not worn on his head a broad-brimmed gray hat , such as the picadors wear at the bull-fights . At the sight of the crucifix , he doffed his hat with reverence , and I then observed a little ivory scale fixed on it like a cockade . He was the executioner . In putting his head from the gate , the condemned , who had been obliged to bend to pass under the postern , raised himself with great haut our , opened his eyes wide , cast a rapid glance about the crowd , and sighed profoundly . It seemed to me that be inhaled the air with pleasure , as if he had been for a long time pent up in a narrow and stifling cell . His expression was strange . It was not one of fear , but of inquietude . He seemed resigned . There was no disdain nor affectation of courage . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not desire to make a better appearance . The confessor told him to kneel before the crucifix ; he oheyed and kissed the feet of this hideous image . At this moment , all the assistants were affected , and preserved a profound silence . The confessor , perceiving it , raised his hands to disengage himself // from his long sleeves , which xvould have embarrassed him in his oratorical movements , and commenced the delivery of a discourse - which had probably served him more than once - in a strong and emphatic voice , rendered monotonous hy the regular repetition of the same intonations . He pronounced each word distinctly ; his accent was pure , and he expressed himself in good Castilian , which the condemned , perhaps , very imperfectly understood . lie commenced every sentence in a shrill tone of voice , and raised it to a falsetto , but ended uniformly in a grave , low tone . In substance , he said to the condemned - whom he called his brother- ' You have richly deserved death ; you ' have even been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallo**s , for your crimes are enormous . ' Here he introduced a word on the murders committed , hut expatiated at large on the irreligion in which he had passed his youth , and which had urged him to his destruction . Then , becoming more animated by degrees- ' But what is the justly merited punishment which you endure , compared with the unequaled sufferings which your divine Saviour has endured for you ? Look at this blood , these wounds , ' &amp;c . Then followed a long detail of the sorrows of the Passion , described with all the exaggeration which so well suits the Spanish language , and illustrated by means of the vile image , of which I have spoken . The peroration was better than the exordium . He said , but too diffusely , that the mercy of God was infinite , and that a true repentance would disarm his just indignation . The condemned raised himself , looked at the priest with a fierce expression , and exclaimed- ' Father , it was enough to tell me that I should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessor returned to the prison , very well satisfied with his discourse . Two Franciscans took his place by the side of the condemned , and were not to leave him till the last moment . They then extended him on a mat , which the hangman drew a little towards him , hut without violence , and as if by a tacit understanding between the sufferer and executioner . It is a mere ceremony , with the view of appearing to execute to the letter the sentence- ' Hanged , having been dragged on a hurdle . ' This done , the unhappy man was mounted on an ass , which the hangman led by the halter . By their side , marched the two Franciscans , preceded by two long files of monks , of that order , and by members of the brotherhood of Desamparados . The banners and crosses were not forgotten . Behind the ass came a notary and two alguazils , in black habits , breeches and stockings , a sword by their sides , and mounted on very sorry nags very badly harnessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procession was advancing very slowly , the monks // chanted the litany in hollow voices , and men in cloaks went about the train in attendance , extending silver plates to the spectators and asking alms for the unfortunate wretch . This money is expended in masses for the repose of his soul ; and to a good Catholic , on the point of being hung , it must have been a great consolation to see the plates so rapidly filling with coppers . Everybody gave something . Wicked as I was , I gave my offering with a sentiment of respect . In truth , I love these Catholic ceremonies , and wish I could believe in them . On such an occasion , they have the advantage of striking the multitude infinitely more than our hangman 's cart , our gens d armes , and that vile and miserable retinue that , in France , attends public executions . Besides  --  and it is for this that I like these processions and this display of crosses-they contribute much to soothe the last moments of the condemned . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die within us . Then the monks , whom he has reverenced from his infancy , and who pray for him , the songs , the voices of men in quest of the means to say masses for his soul - all this confuses , distracts , and prevents him from reflecting on the lot which awaits him . If he turn his head to the right , the Franciscan on that side discourses to him of the infinite mercy of God ; to the left , another Franciscan is all ready to descant on the powerful Intercession of the most worshipful St. Francis . He is borne to his punishment , like a coward between two officers , who watch and encourage him . He has not a moment of rest , says the philosopher . So much the better . The perpetual excitement in which he is kept , saves him from the company of his own thoughts , which would only torment him . I have now learned why the monks , and especially those of the mendicant orders , exercise so much influence over the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , from their cradle to their grave . What a horrible task , for example , must this be - to converse for three days with a man who is to suffer death ! I believe if I should have the misfortune to be hung , I should not he sorry to have two Franciscans to entertain me . The route which the procession followed , was very winding , in order that it might pass through the principal streets . I took , with my guide , a more direct road , that I might once more intercept the path of the condemned . I observed that , in the period which had elapsed between leaving the prison and his arrival in the street where I again saw him , his form had been considerably bent . He became gradually feeble ; his head fell upon his breast , as if it were sustained only by the skin of his neck . He gazed fixedly on the image clasped in his hands ; and if he turned his eyes , it was only to fasten them on the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I would willingly at that time have retired ; but they urged me to enter the great square , and make my way to the shop of a tradesman , where I could either witness the execution from the height of a balcony , or withdraw from the spectacle to an inner apartment . I accordingly went . The square was far from being full . The stalls of the fruit and vegetable sellers were not disturbed . You could make your way about with no difficulty . The gallows , surmounted with the arms of Arragon , was placed in front of an elegant Moorish edifice-the Silk Exchange . ' The market-place is long ; the houses which surround it are small , though high ; and every row of windows has its iron balcony . From a distance , they resemble large cages . Many of these balconies were empty . On that where I took my post , I found two young ladies , sixteen or eighteen years old , comfortably seated on chairs , and waiting for the ceremony with the easiest air in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robes of black silk , their satin slippers and mantillas bordered with lace , I inferred that they were the daughters of some wealthy commoner . I was confirmed in this opinion , because , though they conversed together in the Valencia dialect , they understood and spoke Spanish with accuracy . In a corner of the market-place , stood a little chapel . This chapel and the gallows , which was not far distant , had been enclosed in a great square , formed by volunteer royalists and troops of the line . The soldiers having opened their ranks to receive the procession , the condemned was taken from the ass and led to the altar I have just mentioned . The monks surrounded him ; he was upon his knees , and often kissed the steps of the altar . I know not what they said to him . Meanwhile , the hangman examined his cord and his ladder ; this done , he approached the still prostrate sufferer , put his hand on his shoulders , and exclaimed , after the usual custom , Brother , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception , had left him , and the hangman , as it seemed , had been put in possession of his victim . In conducting him towards the ladder , ( or rather the steps of plank ) he took pains , by holding before his eyes the large hat which he carried , to shut out a view of the scaffold ; but the condemned seemed to try to push aside the hat , in order to show that he possessed the courage to look upon the instrument of his punishment . It was noon when the hangman mounted the fatal steps , drawing after him the condemned , who ascended with difficulty , because walking backwards . The flight of steps is broad , and has a balustrade only on one side . The monk was on the side of the balustrade ; the executioner and the condemned ascended // the other . The monk talked incessantly , with a multitude of gestures . Having reached the top of the stairs , whilst the executioner was adjusting the cord of the sufferer with great alacrity , they told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising his voice , he exclaimed , My brothers , join your prayers to those of this miserahle sinner . ' I heard a sweet voice whisper , by my side , with emotion , . Jlmen ! ' I turned my head , and saw one of my pretty Valencia girls , whose cheeks were a little flushed , and who was industriously plying her fan . She was gazing intently towards the gallows . I turned my eyes in the same direction ; the monk was descending the steps , and the condemned was suspended in the air - the hangman upon his shoulders , and his assistant pulling by the feet.
