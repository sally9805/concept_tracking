txt WE have not selected the works whose titles are placed at the head of this article , because they are recent , or unknown // to our readers , but in order to enable us to direct the public attention to the subject of which they treat . There is no more universal characteristic of human nature , than a disposition to find fault with our present condition , whatever it may be . Every body praises the age that has gone by , and looks forward to a future day as one which shall bring relief to all present inconveniences . It is this propensity to discontent , on which modern reformers are so ready to seize for the purpose of disseminating their peculiar doctrines . They assume the existence of acknowledged evils , and thence endeavor to draw the conclusion that the cause of these evils is what they would pretend to reform . They depict the horrors of poverty , the pride and luxurious indolence of the rich , and forthwith preach up a crusade against wealth , and the laws by which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily made upon our own institutions and laws ; and as their conclusions are apparently drawn from acknowledged facts , honest minds are often deceived , and discontent is excited , when no cause of complaint in fact exists . There is no more common mode of attempting to mislead the public sentiment , than by describing a state of things existing in other countries , and assuming that it exists also in our own . Men talk very correctly of the evils of an established aristocracy , with its hereditary wealth , its vices and its power ; and having done so , they stamp the picture with an American name , in order to excite jealousies among our own citizens ; when , in fact , the description is no more a delineation of American manners and institutions , than a Norwegian landscape reserubles the vine-clad hills of France or Italy . It is thus that the outcry about the rights of the " working men** has been raised so loudly in our country . We are told of the condition of these classes in England ; of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crowded with healthy laborers , destitute of the ordinary necessaries of life ; and in the same breath an appeal is made to the mechanic and manufacturer here , to subvert the laws , which grind down the laboring classes to the dust ; as if there were some real analogy between our condition and that of England , in respect to the laws which regulate property , the means of subsistence , or the rewards of industry . So many appeals have been made of late to the prejudices of the people , and so much misconstruction and misrep .. // resentation have been resorted to , with the view of exciting discontent in the community , that we have been induced to compare the condition of the laboring classes in the United States , with that of similar classes in some of the European nations . In pursuing this investigation we have had particular reference to the rate of wages , the burden of taxation , the means of subsistence , the facilities for acquiring education , and the share , if any , which these classes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been gathered are , among others , books of travels , statistical tables , the leading English reviews , reports of Parliament , speeches delivered before that body , and other works which appeared to be of an authentic character . Our notice of several of the European nations , however , must be exceedingly brief , because the picture of the life of their peasants is too uniform to admit of much detail . Poverty , degradation , and toil , from generation to generation , form the epitome of their personal and political existence . In most of the Northern nations , in particular , the laboring classes are alike strangers to what an American calls liberty , and to what are here regarded as the essential comforts of life . In Norway , farms are cultivated by a class of laborers , called " house-men , " who receive from the landlord a house and a quantity of land , and in return work for him at a low , fixed price , whenever he demands their labor . The ordinary food of the peasantry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an occasional intermixture of dried fish . Meat is a luxury which they rarely enjoy . In Sweden , the peasantry are comparatively well educated ; that is , most of them can read and write . Their dress is prescribed by law . Their food consists of hard bread , dried fish and gruel , without meat . In some districts their houses are mere log-cabins , covered with bark or turf ; and , we believe , throughout the kingdom they are in general little , if at all , superior to the rude structures , which the settler rears in our western wilds . In Denmark , the peasantry are still held in bondage , and are bought and sold together with the land on which they labor . Their food and dwelling houses are similar to those which we have just described . In Russia , the bondage of the peasantry is even more complete , than it is in Denmark . There are , properly , but two // native classes ; the noble , and the peasant , or serf . The intermediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial business of her cities , are principally foreigners , not permanently resident in the country . All the land in the empire is owned by the nobles , and whenever any portion of it is sold , the peasantry who reside upon it are transferred with the estate . These have generally about half the time at their own disposal ; but are at all times liable to be called upon to labor for their masters . The better class of the peasants live iii cottages , with stables or barns attached to them , but a great majority have only cottages , one portion of which is occupied by the family , while the other is appropriated to domestic animals . Few , if any , have beds , but sleep upon bare boards , or upon parts of the immense stoves by which their houses are warmed . Their food consists of black bread , cabbage , and other vegetables , without the luxury of animal food , or even the addition of butter . During some seasons of the year the women are employed in the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Poland , the condition of the serfs or laboring classes is , if possible , more degraded than in Russia . The nobles are the proprietors of the land , and the peasants are slaves . If a plebeian strike a noble , his punishment is death . We quote in this connexion the language of a recent traveller : " I travelled in every direction , and never saw a wheaten loaf to the eastward of the Rhine , in any part of Northern Germany , Poland , or Denmark . " Another writer , describing Poland in 18*6 , says , " the peasants live in wooden huts , covered with thatch or shingles , consisting of one room with a stove , around which the inhabitants and their cattle crowd together , and where the most disgusting kinds of filthiness are to be seen . Their common food is cabbage , potatoes , sometimes , but not generally , peas , black bread and soup , or rather gruel , without the addition of butter or meat , and the chief drink is water or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be remembered , are not the paupers of the country , supported at the public charge , and fed by the labor of others . They are the working men ; the only class that engage in honest industry and toil . They can not rise from their state of degradation ; this is alike forbidden by the long established customs of these countries , and by harsh and oppressive laws . In two of the countries we have mentioned , Norway and // Sweden , the peasantry are represented in the diet , and of course , possess sonic influence in the management of the affairs of government ; while in Denmark , Poland , and Russia , they must obey the will of others , and are subject to the scarcely limited control of their hereditary masters . Germany comprises a large number of separate states , in which the condition of the laboring classes varies according to the character of their respective laws . In some , they are comparatively free and well educated ; in others , the feudal burdens are still imposed upon the cultivators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , notwithstanding the despotic character of the government , the people are more intelligent and free than in many of the German states , a common citizen was not , till the year 1807 , permitted to purchase the estate of a noble . Nor were the nobles , prior to the year 1810 , subject to any tax upon their lands . In general , the inhabitants of the protestant states of Germany are more free and better educated , than they are in those where the catholic religion is the established one . In Austria , the most powerful of the states , the nobles are the proprietors of the land , and the peasants are compelled to work for their masters during every day of the week , excepting Sunday . The cultivators of the soil are in a state of bondage . In Hungary , their condition is , if possible , still worse . There is no intermediate class between the noble and the slave . The whole population exceeds eight millions , while there are only sixty thousand noble families . The nobles own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The laboring classes are obliged to repair all the highways and bridges , are liable at any time to have soldiers quartered upon them , and are compelled to pay one tenth of the produce of their labor to the church , and one ninth to the lord whose land they occupy . They are also subject to various other duties and impositions . The following anecdote , which is related by a recent traveller , * will illustrate the condition of the laboring classes in Hungary . He spent a few weeks at the residence of one of the most respectable Hungarian noblemen . Taking a walk one afternoon with the count over part of the grounds , they came upon some peasants who were enjoying their own rustic amusements . The count imagined that one of them did not notice him , as he passed , with // suffioient humility . He immediately sent to his house for some servants , and ordered them to seize , bind and lash the poor man . His orders were instantly executed . The visitor entreated the count to put an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it were one at all . The answer was , " What ! do you intercede for such a hrute ? He is no nobleman . That these people may not think any body cares for them , give him twenty lashes more . " And they were accordingly administered . We might also state various facts , to shew the depressed state of manufactures in some of those states , and the almost starving condition of many of the artizans ; but our limits will not permit us to enter into this detail . In many of the German states , the means of education are extremely limited . In Austria the press is under a severe censorship , and nothing finds its way to the public eye , excepting what the cabinet may choose to publish . The reply of the emperor , during the session of the congress at Laybach , to the teacher of a public seminary , has often been quoted . " 1 want no learned men , I need no learned men , I want men who will do as I bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whole villages , not an individual can read or write ; and that , of the inhabitants of Hungary , Transylvania and Croatia , all of which are within the Austrian dominions , twelve millions are entirely ignorant and uninstructed . These remarks will present a view of the condition of the laboring classes in the states and kingdoms to which we have referred . It would be little better than mere repetition , to enlarge upon the state of the idle nobles and beggars of Italy , the priest-ridden people of Spain , or the unemployed and impoverished tradesmen and artizans of holland or Belgium . We shall , therefore , pass at once to France . Although our intercourse with that kingdom in the way of trade and commerce is so frequent , we know comparatively little of the actual condition of the great mass of her population . Her past history is in a measure familiar to all , but it is not so easy to determine or describe , with precise accuracy , the civil rights which are enjoyed by the people at the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of society and property . In 1820 , about one half of the whole population were landed proprietors . About two thirds of them are now engaged in agricultural pursuits , and of // these , about five millions are not proprietors . Of the manufacturing population , between four and five millions of laborers are destitute of property . We have not room to enter into detail as to the condition of the manufacturing classes in France , hut if we can credit the statements of travellers , it is more wretched than even that of the same classes in England , to which we propose to allude more particularly , before we close . We may , however , remark here , that we have good authority for saying , that the highest wages of a cotton manufacturer in France are not more than five shillings and sixpence a week . Even these are higher than the wages of similar manufacturers in other countries on the continent . In Switzerland and Austria , they are four shillings , in the Tyrol , three shillings and ninepence , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two shillings and sixpence . The wages of cotton manufacturers on the continent of Europe , may be considered as varying from fifty cents to one dollar and twentyfive cents , weekly . The population of France may be stated at thirty-two millions . Of these , seven and a half millions receive less than twenty dollars a year for their support ; and nearly twentythree millions of the inhabitants are compelled to procure the necessaries of life with from five to eight sous , ( about the same number of cents , ) daily . To an American , this statement seems to be hardly credible . Such a pittance would be insufficient to supply the meat , bread , and tea , or coffee , with their usual accompaniments , which are daily found on the tables of all classes of our citizens . The French are , consequently , compelled to live with proportionate frugality , in order to live at all ; and we are informed , that seven and a half millions of the people do not eat meat , or wheaten bread . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few potatoes , and their drink is water . In 1820 , more than one hundred thousand , - . one seventh part of all the inhabitants of Paris ,  --  received support from the public charity ; and one third of the inhabitants who died during the year , died in hospitals . We have no means of comparing the present state of that city with its condition at that period ; but we are not aware of any material improvement in these respects . The consequence of this general poverty of the laboring classes is , that they are compelled to work incessantly for the means of daily sustenance . During certain seasons of the // year , the women are employed in field labors . The ordinary implements of French husbandry are ill adapted to aid the farmer in his toil , and cows and asses , oxen and horses , are often seen yoked together to the same plough . It is stated by Simond , a late accurate and intelligent traveller , that the common wages of a hired laborer upon a farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred for women . This would give to the man in our ceuntry thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents , and to the woman eighteen dollars and seventy-five cents , annually . But he adds , that in consequence of short seasons , laborers were at that time very willing to work for their bread only . The poverty of these classes , however , does not protect them from taxation . We have seen that a large proportion of the whole people are proprietors of the soil , either as owners or lessees ; and we can , therefore , form an idea of the extent of taxation in France , when we learn that the taxes upon the lands are equal to one fifth of its net produce . So that a man , who should rent his farm for one hundred dollars a year , would be compelled to pay twenty dollars of that amount into the public treasury for taxes . This burden would , of course , fall upon the laboring classes , - the tillers of the soil . The condition of the people of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the northern and eastern portions of the 1*ingdom , the people are better educated than in the central and western sections . In the northern provinces , fifty-two out of a hundred of the population can read and write ; in the eastern , fifty-five out of a hundred ; while in the western and central parts , from twenty-seven to twenty-five only in a hundred are able to read . This statement will serve to indicate the difference which exists between the condition of the lahoring classes in France , afid that of the same classes in Massachusetts , for instance , where scarcely one native citizen in a thousand is destitute of the rudiments of a school education . We can not dismiss this portion of our subject , without briefly inquiring how far the people of France are permitted to take part in the affairs of government . The members of the Chamber of Deputies , the popular branch of the government , are chosen by the people ; hut the qualifications of candidates for office , as well as of the electors , are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , far from having any important influence in // the election of the deputies , and in making the laws . No man can be an elector , who dOts not pay a ( IiI'ect tax of two hundred francs . ( thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents ; ) and when we remember the proportion of those , whose whole income does not exceed that amount , we perceive , at once , how small a number are qualified to vote . Thus , of more than thirtytwo millions of inhabitants , far more than twice the amount of the population of the United States , less than one hundred and seventy thousand are qualified to vote in elections ; so that , with all our restrictions , we have more than half as many electors in Massachusetts as there are in France , although her population is more than fifty tiriies as great as ours . But even this boon , confined as it is to the rich , and wholly denied to the laboring classes , is of comparatively little value to the people . Every officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state to the petty constable of the village , is appointed by the crown , which has in its disposal more than one hundred thousand offices . The consequence is , as might be cxl ) ected , that the government controls the elections , and a great majority of the deputies of the people are , in fact , but the creatures of the crown . We ought not entirely to overlook the church establishments upon the continent , which , whatever be their form , must , in the end , depend for support upon the industry of the laboring classes . In France , all religions are nominally tolerated , but the catholic is the national faith . The clergy exceed forty thousand in number , and cost the country , exclusive of fees , gifts , and other allowances from parishes , communes and departments , thirty-three million and nine hundred and eighteen francs annually . In Spain , also , the burden of the church establishment is felt with great severity . There are in this church eight archbishops ; forty-four bishops ; one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular priests fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirty-four inferior clergy ; three thousand and six monasteries and convents ; seventy-one thousand five hundred and eighty-five monks and nuns. * * A singular mistake upon this subject is made by the writer of an article in the fifty-fourth volume of the Edinburgh Review . He says , " that the Spanish church rejoices in 58 archbishops ; 684 bishops ; 11,400 abbots ; 936 chapters ; 127,000 parishes ; 7000 hospitals ; 23,000 fraternities ; 46,000 // The archbishop of Toledo has a revenue of six hundred thousand dollars , and the incomes of the other ecclesiastical digiiitaries , though smaller in amount , are very large . Vast masses of property are locked up in the possession of the church . We have been detained so Ion0 upon the continent , that we must hasten to what was once our father-land . With a common origin , a common lan0uage , and , to a certain extent , a community of laws and institutions , we are enabled more accurately to brin0 the true condition of our own citizens to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of any other people . it is her boast , that her citizens are the most free of any in Europe , and we are , therefore , led to examine , somewhat minutely , into the extent of those rights and privile0es , which form their precious birth-right. the first consideration that strikes us in this investigation , is the entirely artificial state of society in England . Everything is regulated by law . The tenure of property , as well as the constitution of government , the gradations of society , the commerce and trade of the country , the prices of agricultural produce , the value of rents , and a thousand other things , which bear more or less directly upon every class in the community , are either controlled by statute regulation , or what is equally imperative , by ancient usage . Every citizen , high or low , from his cradle to the grave , is hedged in and bound by rules and regulations , altogether arbitrary and artificial . Whatever progress reform may have made , it has wrought but little change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can not pass by Ireland in our inquiries , though we are aware that any picture we might borrow from the numerous accounts which are given of that wretched people , would seem to be hi0hly colored and exaggerated . To one born and educated in New England , it is well nigh incredible , that human natui'e can sustain the sufferings and privations which the laboring classes of some districts in Ireland have long endored . It is not our purpose to speak of the causes of this state of things , monasteries ; 135,000 convents ; 3i2,000 secular priests ; 200000 inferior clergy ; 400,000 monks and nuns . " The account which we have given , is derived from Count Atexandre de Laborde 's Iritin*raire descript*f de L ' E*pagrte , published in iSO9 , a work of unquestionable authority . We are not aware that any material change has taken place since that period , tending to affect the accuracy of his representation . // 358 The Laboring Classes in Eurojpe. but only to present some facts in relation to that unfortunate people , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own blessings . The population of Ireland is about eight millions . In 1791 , when it was about half as numerous as it now is , an enumeration was made of all the dwelling houses on the island . They amounted to seven hundred thousand . From the charader of these houses , we may infer , in some measure , the condition of the inhabitants at the time . About one hundred and thirteen thousand of these dwellin* , houses were occupied by paupers . More than five hundred thousand had only one hearth in them , leaving a very small proportion which were so constructed as to accommodate their inmates with more than a single fire . The number of dwelling houses has probably doubled since that time , but we are not aware that the ratio of poverty has decreased . The soil of Ireland is owned by comparatively few individuals . these let out their lands in large tracts to jobbers or " middle men , " who , in their turn , underlet them to cottiers , - a class of peasants who occupy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , or on the continent , and the cottiers , or cultivators , form the bulk of the Irish peasantry . Each of these occupies a cabin , and from a quarter of an acre to four or five acres of land . Their cabins are described as " four mud walls , with one entrance , and frequently without windows or chimneys . " " Numbers have not a bed , or even a bed frame , sleeping upon straw or heath upon their clay floors . " We might suppose this to be an exaggerated account , if we had not seen enough of Irish modes of living along the routes of the railways in our country , to confirm the truth of the description . The rents paid by the cultivators for their lands vary in different counties , and according to the quality of the lands . But as the proprietor must live- in luxury , and the jobber must be well paid by his speculations , and all this must come from the rents of the land , and as , moreover , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for land is created , the occupier is compelled to pay , in rent and tithes , the utmost farthing in his power . The Irish acre is nearly twice as large as ours , and the highest rent paid is ten guineas an acre . It varies from that sum down to four guineas . In some districts rents are from six to nine pounds , and in others , from four to seven pounds , per acre ; so that , by our mode of // The Laboring Glasses in Europe . computation , the rents vary from eight or nine dollars up to twenty-four dollars the acre . Whatever the amount may be , " it is , " says a writer , " as nearly as can he calculated , fully and literally the whole produce of the soil , saving the small reserve of potatoes necessary for the subsistence of himself and family . " And in addition to all this , his personal services must be rendered to his landlord whenever they are required . While he is compelled to pay a rent so onorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he labors for a wealthier farmer , are proportionately low . They vary from fourpence to tenpence daily , making an average of from fivepence to sixpence through the year , or , in our currency , from nine and a half to eleven cents . Even the manufacturers fare little better , as respects wages , than the laborers upon the soil . A writer in the Westminster Review states , that the wages of linen weavers around Belfast , in 1825 , were one shilling per day ; that in many instances , after laboring twelve hours in a day , only two shillings and sixpence were realized in a week ; and that , in Down , the wages of weavers were as low as fivepence or sixpence a day . With such scanty means of livelihood , the Irish peasantry are obliged to subsist upon the cheapest food . Potatoes are their chief support , and to these is sometimes added milk or buttermilk , and occasionally bread . But a cottier can rarely indulge in the luxury of meat . Everything that he can raise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to the priest for tithes , and when the potatoe crop fails , beggary or starvation is his only alternative . Nothing has heretofore ground the industry of Ireland like her church establishment . Although five sixths of her population are catholics , the church of England is the established one , and her clergy are supported out of the tithes of the lands . Some changes have been recently made in the constitution of this church , by a prospective reduction of the number of the archbishops and bishops , from twenty-two to twelve , and of course of the amount of their aggregate revenues , and by the removal of some serious impositions ; but we are not yet able to ascertain the extent of the relief , which will be thus afforded . For ess than one sixth of the people , there are seventeen hundred clergymen , whose aggregate income is one million three hundred thousand pounds , or more than five and a half millions of dollars . This , it will be remembered , does 359 // not include wbat the catholics pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' *yterians pay their clergy . The salaries of the latter , however , do not exceed one or two hundred pounds by the year . Who can wonder , then , to hear complaints from the Irish of their church and tithe system , drawn , as the tithes must be , from the very life blood of the laboring classes ? " I have seen , " says a writer who is quoted in the Edinburgh Review , " the favorite cow driven away , accom panied by the sighs , the tears , and the imprecations of a whole family , who were paddling alono throuQh the wet and dirt , to take their last affectionate farewell of this their only friend and benefactor , at the pound gate . " It would seem as if the Irish paid enough in church rates and other taxes , to entitle them to receive in return the means of educating their children . Even these are but partially enjoyed . In 1825 , two hundred and fifty thousand Irish children were destitute of any means of education , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfect , and often almost worse than none . In passing from Ireland , we can only glance at the hardy and industrious Scotch , so proverbial for intelligence and thrift . The population of Scotland is between two and three millions . The mode of living among the laboring classes , where meat , except on Sundays , is rarely used , would hardly satisfy the appetite of a New England working man , who , from his childhood , never knows the want of the necessaries or many of the luxuries of life . In the Lowlands , almost every individual is taught to read and write , but in the Highlands , education is very much neglected . In some parts of them not more than three out of ten are able to read . The first great division of the population of England to which we shall advert , is into nobles and commoners . The titles of the nobility to their rank are either hereditary , or by gift from the crown . In whatever way acquired , their possessors form , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another marked distinction between classes in England is that between those who are proprietors , and those who are not . Only one sixth part of her immense population are proprietors of the soil , although one third part of the people are en gaged in agricultural pursuits . Yet for this small fraction of the population , most of her important laws seem to have been made . The real political power is in the hands of the landowners , while the interests of the ten or eleven millions of // manufacturers , traders and laborers , must yield to those of the proprietors of the soil . It is principally for these considerations that the " corn laws , " so oppressive upon the laboring classes , were made and are continued . The object of thus forcing up the price of grain , is to enable the tenant who hires and tills the land to sell his produce so high , that he can afford to pay his landlord a high rent for his land . Thus , in effect , the laboring and industrious classes are severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealthy land-holder . Another consequence of this distinction between land and other property , is the law of primogeniture , by which alone estates can he kept together in masses , like those in England . The great division of the laboring classes in England , with the exception of those engaged in commerce , is into the agricultural and manufacturing departments . The wages of laborers upon farms depend very much upon the number of the poor in the district , where the labor is to he performed . We shall have occasion to say more upon the subject of the English poor laws ; but we may here state that , as it is an object for overseers to keep the poor employed , wherever they are numerous their labor must come in competition with that of other laborers , and thus reduce it oftentimes to the very lowest point at which the workman can subsist upon his earnin* , s . By a statement made in 1854 , which is before us , the wages of laborers upon farms in Kent , Essex , Bedford , Suffolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixpence a day . In other counties , the highest wages were mne shillings ( two dollars ) per week , while in some of the northern counties , wages fluctuated from twelve to fifteen shillings ( two dollars and sixty-six cents to three dollars and thirtythree cents , ) per week . From a very recent report of a committee of Parliament , we have many further details as to the prices paid for agricultural labor , and the effect of the system of poor laws upon the laboring classes . From that report , it would seem that the wages of laborers in the immediate neighborhood of London , are about three shillings a day ; though within twenty miles of the metropolis , many laborers did not receive more than half that amount . In the season of harvesting , great numbers of the Irish come over to England to labor in the fields , and in some districts they receive from two to four shillings a day , and in others not so much . In one parish , // where there was not a surplus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness examined before the committee , were about ten shillings a week . But even in the adjacent parishes , there was a surplus of laborers , which , of course , reduced the xvages in them to a much lower sum . We can not stop to explain the reason of this difference , except to remark that , as the poor in England are supported in their respective parishes , they can not , or will not leave them to seek employment elsewhere , even when they are assured of high wages and constant employment . We have enumerated but a part of the embarrassments to which the English laborer is subject , and in view even of these , we may readily credit the statement of a writer in the London Quarterly Review , when he says , that " in the road in which the English laborer must travel , the poor-house is the last stage on his way to the grave. * ' We are not able to fix the ratio between the wages of agricultural and manufacturing laborers , but we are not aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered , than those of the tillers of the soil . One thing is certain , that , as soon as any considerable stagnation in business is felt , the workmen in the manufacturing towns are thrown into distress , and sometimes reduced almost to starvation . A constant struggle appears to be maintained by the employers against those whom they hire , to reduce wages to the very lowest point at which life can be sustained , and very melancholy scenes of suffering and distress in the manufacturing districts are described in the reports and debates of Parliament . A part of these abuses , so far as relates to the over-working of children in factories , have been , we believe , partially corrected by acts of Parliament , and we therefore pass them over . It was stated in 1819 , by the member of Parliament for Coventry , that there were in that - town five classes of manufacturers , each working sixteen hours in a day . The first class earned ten shillings , the second , five shillings and sixpence , the third three shillings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sixpence , per week . Many other laborers worked fifteen or sixteen hours in a day , and could not earn more than seven shillings per week . The wages of manufacturers , therefore , as will be perceived , varied from thirty-three cents weekly , to two dollars and twenty-five cents . A writer in the Edinburgh Review states , that in the year // 1819 , a weaver 's wages in Glasgow were five shillings and sixpence or six shillings a week ; and that in Lancashire , wages varied from six to twelve shillings a week , for fifteen hours ' labor in a day . The Nottingham stocking-weavers , as stated by them in a public address , after working from fourteen to sixteen hours in a day , only earned from four to seven shillings a week , and were obliged to subsist upon bread and water , or potatoes and salt . We have no data at hand , from which to learn the present wages of manufacturers in England , nor how those of weavers among manufacturers , or field labors among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population to be fed , and the frequently depressed state of manufactures there , we may , it would seem , safely assume , that wages are now , as they have long been , at the lowest point at which the laborer can sustain himself and family . The consequence of this state of things is , that the working classes must content themselves with a meagre diet , and with few comforts , and have little time or opportunity for the enlargeinent and cultivation of their minds . All these privations , however , might probably he borne with comparative ease , if theirs was the common lot . There is truth and philosophy in the adage , that " misery loves company , " and where the poor man " Sees no contiguous palace rear its head , To shame the meanness of his humble shed , " he is content with his lot , however hard it may be . But in England , the poverty of the laboring classes is felt amidst palaces of surpassing splendor , and individual wealth almost beyond computation , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys it , but heaped up and transmitted from sire to son under the unchangeable laws of primogeniture . The annual incomes of some of these families are from one hundred and fifty thousand to even more than three hundred thousand pounds ; and thus , while the hard toil of one man is rewarded with an income of a hundred dollars , the birth and title of another ensure him an income of a million . But this is not all . Such a state of things is not only oppressive to the poorer classes , but often becomes utterly ruinous in its effects . Their downward progress is only stopped by the poor-house , and thus a new weight is added to the burden , which is pressing down the industry of the nation . // The number and expense of the poor in England are almost beyond belief . in Scotland and Ireland there are no poor rates , nor were there any in England until the time of Queen Elizabeth . Now the number of paupers has so increased , that the poor rate assessed upon some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many estates have been abandoned by their owners . We state this upon the authority of a very recent parliamentary report , in which the names of many parishes are given , where the l ) OO* rates are depopulating the district ; - . as no man can affor4 to take an estate , rent free , if he must pay the poor-tax which is assessed upon it . We can not state precisely the aggregate of the poor rates in England . in 1826 , it amounted to more than seven million pounds , ( exceeding thirty-one million dollars , ) and we have no reason to believe that it has fallen in amount since that time . This would make the expense of supporting the poor alone , in England , nearly , if not quite , twice as great as the whole current expenditure of the government of the United States . This tax would of itself seem to be somewhat burdensome upon the industry of Great Britain , but it forms only a single item of the current international expenses of the government , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edinburgh Review states the amount of tithes annually paid for the support of the regular church establishment in England and Wales , not , of course , including catholics and dissenters , at five million six hundred thousand pounds , about twenty-five millions of dollars . The average salaries paid to the bishops and archbishops exceed twenty-five thousand dollars a year , and some of them receive as much as a hundred thousand dollars ; while a numerous class of the clergy , the laboring clergy too , are obliged to content themselves with a scanty subsistence . So unequal is the distribution of property , power and right . Besides the burdens already mentioned , the people of England pay for the interest and management of their national debt , more than a hundred millions of dollars annually , to say nothing of a nearly equal amount of direct and indirect taxes , which are raised to sustain the contingent expenses of the crown . Look at England in whatever light you will , she is an exti-aordinary nation . Everything is in extremes . Splendid enterprises , splendid cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike us whenever we contemplate her past history or her present condition ; but behind these , we find a people ground to the dust with // poverty and taxes , toiling for a scanty subsistence , or sustained by the hand of public charity . Everything is unnatural and arbitrary , nor can we wonder if the working-men there cry out against oppression , or feel a hostility towards their lordly masters . It may he asked why these evils are not corrected , why the people do not equalize their burdens and their privileges ? It is true , the English government is called free ; it is true also , that it is nominally a representative one , and that the civil power is in reality in the hands of the commons . So it has been for years , and we will now see who these representatives of the people have been . The House of Commons consists of six hundred and fifty-eight members , arid of the Parliament which was dissolved in 1831 , three hundred and fifty-four members were returned by the peers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their friends . Boroughs , without an inhabitant , , returned in some instances two members each , and cities , with thousands of inhabitants sent none , or at most a single member to the House . Since that time the much talked of reform has taken place . But to show how far , even now , the people have any voice in the election of members of Parliament , we need only state , that a country member , in order to be eligible to a seat in that body , must possess real estate , the income of which exceeds twenty-five hundred dollars by the year ; and no man can be a voter who does not , if in a city or borough , . rent a building of the annual value of ten pounds , or if in the country , occupy a freehold estate of the same yearly value* The consequence of this is , that only a small fraction of the people can vote. , and a far smaller portion can be eligible to Parliament . Thus in some boroughs , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are not more than thirteen or fourteen voters . In Carlisle , for instance , with twenty thousand inhabitants , there are but about seven hundred and fifty voters ; and in Liverpool , with one hundred and ei0hty-nine thousand people , only a little upwards of three thousand are qualified to vote . Such is the condition of a considerable portion of the laboring classes in the leading states of Europe . It would be well worth the care of those , who have turned their attention to these subjects in America , to contrast the state of things described* // with that which prevails in this country . But this is a subject too important to be despatched in a summary manner , and in the brief space remaining at the close of our article.
