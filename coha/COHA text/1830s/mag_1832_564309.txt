txt United States Bank . The bill tomodify and extend the charter of the United States bank , having passed both Houses of Congress and been sent to the President for his signature , was , on the 10th of July , returned by the President to the Senate , the House in which it originated , accompanied by a message , stating the reasons which had operated to induce him to place his veto on the bill . The National Intelligencer gave the following epitome of the arguments in the message , which may be relied on as a faithful abstract " The message sets out with a declaration that the President devoted the Fourth of July to an examination of the bill , considering the case as one peculiarly suitable to the day , and that he had come to the conclusion that it ought not to become a law , and therefore returned it to the Senate with his objections . " The convenience of the Bank , in many points of view , is admitted ; but the assertion follows that it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hence arose all the objections which he had repeatedly expressed to the renewal of its charter ; and that in the modifications of the original charter , which the new bill contained , he saw nothing which could have the effect of making the Bank more consss*ent with the genius of our country , and the true interests of the people . The present bank , the President says , has been in existence nearly twenty years , in which time it has obtained an entire monopoly of the Domestic Exchange ; and by the elevation of its stock greatly beyond its par value , it has thrown many millions into the hands of a few individuals holding the stock of this bank . The bill proposes an additional gratuity to these same individuals of seven or eight millions7 since , as the President reasons , the passage of the law continuing the charter must have the effect of increasing the value of the stock at least one fourth beyond what it now is . This gratuity is not given to American citizens alone - above eight millions of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , extended to them . " The message then goes into a view of the character and effect of monopolies in general , and contends against the constitutionality and the expediency of granting the money monopoly to the same persons , who are exclusively of the wealthy , to the exclusion of all other citizens of the United States , some of whom had offered to establish a bank on more favorable terms to the people . The justice of this distinction , the message says , is not apparent . If favors are to be distributed , all ought to be participators . " It had been alleged , the message goes on to say , that the calling in of the loans of the bank would be productive of great distress . In case the management of the bank had been wise , the message insists , that no distress could ensue from the calling in of the loans ; and if distress does ensue , the inference is drawn that this fact would be proof of mismanagement in the administration of the bank . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the institution be brought to a close with less distress to the country than at this time . " In the modifications which had been adopted , it is contended that a few trifling changes only , had been made , while all the odious features of the original charter had been retained . In particular , the message objects to the section which gives state banks a preference over individuals , in the payment of branch notes in liquidation of debts due to the bank , as forming a bond of // union among the state banks , erecting them into a dangerous monopoly . The message also takes exception to the section which compels the President and Directors of the bank to furnish , at the call of a state , a list of the stockholders resident in that state , for the purpose of taxation . It complains of this as aiding in the imposition of a tax of one per cent . on the stock of citizens , while the foreigner holds his stock free from this tax , and his stock is thus rendered more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message then goes on to argue that a great portion of the capital of the country was annually drawn off to pay the dividends to foreigners ; and that , while this system was continued , the country could not be safe in war , or prosperous in peace . It regards this money power , resting in the hands of aliens , as more dangerous to the country than military kostility . The stock , it says , ought to be purely in the hands of Americans ; and it is asserted th t two hundred millions could be obtained at once among American citizens as a subscription to a bank , such as ought to be established . There is no occasion , it contends , to send abroad in search of capital . " The arguments in favor of the bank which have reference to precedents , the message repudiates , regarding precedents as unsafe rules of legislation . One Congress refuses to charter a bank , and another grants a charter . Here the precedents are equal . And as to state banks , the message assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in favor of the present bank . The independence of the co-ordinate branch of the government , the Executive , is asserted ; it is treated as having the same amount of independence as Congress possess in reference to the Supreme Court . The Executive is maintained to be equally free from dependence , either on Congress , or the Supreme Court . " From these views , the message goes into an argument on the unconstitutionality of the bank . It is further asserted , that the existing bank is not necessary for the riurposes of the government . The old bank , with a capital of ten millions , answered all its purposes , and therefore the present bank , having a capital of thirty-five millions , is invested with an influence to the amount of twenty-five millions more than was necessary . " Some further views are thro*vn out , as to the right of the states to tax , in which it is insisted that the branches of the United States Bank has no more claim to exemption than state banks . " It is further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excite discussion , and to elicit new light from the people . A new Congress will be elected , and a more equal representation of the people be obtained , before the expiration of the term of the present charter . It is also held up as an unconstitutional act for this Congress to bind up the hands of its successors . " The message adverts to the suspicions afloat as to the mal-administration of the bank , and to the opinion of a majority of the committee in favor of a postponement of the question . The bank , it is asserted , ought to have so much regard to its own honor , as to have come forward , of its own motion , withdrawn its memorial , and thus passed the measure over to another session . " The conclusion , is merely a reference to the distinctions created among men , by education , learning , virtue , and industry ; and it is declared that every effort of government , to introduce other distinctions , is injurious ; and that government should only be felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , it is said , consists in leaving individuals and states to themselves . " Having done his duty in stating these objections , the President says , if he should be sustained by the voice of his fellow-citizens , he shall feel grateful and happy . if not , he should look for consolation to his own motives , where he would find sufficient to support him in the views which he had thrown out . " On the day following , when the message came up for consideration , Mr. Webster took the floor , and in a speech of something more than an hour in length , examined and commented upon the contents of the message . We obtain from the source before mentioned , the following sketch of his speech Mr. Webster said , it appeared to him that we are now approaching a crisis , not only equally dangerous , but equally likely to be embarrassing , disastrous , and distressing , as any that has occurred under this government . It was now certain , that , with out a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States would be suffered to expire , by its own limitation . Within three years and nine months , ( the remainder of its term ) arrangements would have to be made for calling in its debts , withdrawing its 16Q // notes from circulation , and ceasing its operations . All this would have to be done within that period ; for , although , by its charter , provision was made for allowing it further time for the collection of its debts , &amp;c. yet , after the expiration of its term , it can issue no new paper , nor answer any of the purposes of a bank of discount . He said it behooved all who were interested in public affairs , without exaggeration on the one side , or delusion on the other , to prepare themselves to meet the crisis . He then went on to show the great importance of the present question , more especially to the states connected with the waters of the Mississippi , within whose limits , thirty millions of active capital had been furnished for business by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to flow from all this facility being withdrawn within four years , and of the deep distress which must inevitably follow its withdrawal . To the people of the United States , he said , it was now plainly put , whether in one way , and in one way only , ( for the message left no alternative ) this evil was to be avoided . Mr. Webster then proceeded with some remarks upon the President 's objections to the bill . The first which he adverted to , was the objection to the application of the bank for the renewal of its charter , on the ground that it was premature . So far from this objection being a just one , he said that the time of the application was the latest day at which the Bank could , with any justice to the public , or any regard to the interest of the stockholders , come forward , if the question , whether its charter was to be renewed or not , was at all doubtful . After adverting to the undoubted right of Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would act upon this subject , he said it was neither Congress nor the bank that had first agitated the question ; for that the Executive had not only once , but twice and thrice , called on Congress to act upon the subject . He argued that it could not be premature , in 1835 , to do that which the President had invited them to do as far back as December , 1829 , &amp;c . There was another point of view , in which , he said , this remark might have been spared ; he meant in reference to those states of the Union extremely interested in this measure , and which had instructed , unanimously , their representatives , not only to vote for the renewal of the charter of the bank , but to vote for it now , at this present session . But , he added , why disguise the fact ? This was a question on which it was very interesting to all the people to know what were the opinions of the public servants . The time had come , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , from the highest to the lowest , intended to act upon this matter . It was , therefore , proper that the subject should be acted upon at the present session . The result proved it . No one could doubt , after reading this message , that the question had been agitated not a moment too early . The election of a Chief Magistrate was about to take place ; a doubt had existed as to what was the opinion of the present Chief Magistrate upon this subject : was it not fit , proper , and expedient , that that doubt should be resolved ? In this view , the message , he said , so far from proving the application of the bank at this session to have been premature , carried on its face the proof of its being indispensable . The very fact of the constitutional objections of the President to the bank , and that , under his auspices , no such bank could ever be re-chartered or created , demonstrated the necessity of action upon it at the present session . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the prematurity of the application ; which was , that it would be the fault of the bank if its affairs were not wound up within the period of its charter . This , he said , would be impossible , unless the bank were governed by angels instead of men . If the interest paid by the people of the western states was as heavy a drain upon them as represented by the message , how much heavier a drain , he argued , would that be , which , within four years , would draw from them , not only this interest , but the principal upon which the interest was paid ? He enlarged upon the circumstances of the western country , which made money more valuable there than in the Atlantic states , and on the distress which would be produced by withdrawing from them seven and a half millions of dollars a year , for which they were now paying but six per cent . interest to the Bank of the United States , upon the substitute for which capital they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Webster then proceeded to review the objections of a constitutional nature contained in the message ; the different parts of which , he intimated , were evidently from different hands // He entered into an argment on the several points made in the message , to show that they were either unfounded , unsound , or untenable . In this constitutional disquisition , some things were respectable , and some were new . Those which were respectable , he said , were not new ; and those that were new , he left it to be inferred that he considered not very respectable . He examined and refuted the argument drawn from precedent , which he maintained was decidedly on the side of the bank , instead of being against it . He protested against the doctrines of the message , on the subject of the independence claimed for different branches of the Government , pronouncing , without reservation , that , if you take away the power of the Supreme Court , to . decide whether a law of Congress , brought before them , is according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you take away the last guard  --  the last rampart of defence of your political and civil rights ; the legislative discretion stands unrestrained and unrestricted . You are brought within the predicament which Mr. Jefferson so much deprecated ; you have got ridof unrestrained legislation abroad , to have it fastened upon you at home , &amp;c . In regard to the bank question , the whole action of the Government , of the Executive , under every President till now , of every Congress , and of the Supreme Court , had recognized the constitutionality of the charter of this , as well as of the old bank , &amp;c . Mr. Webster then dwelt at some length , on other positions of the message , which he considered untenable ; such , for instance , as that one Congress can not bind its successors , and that every thing contained in any bill passed by Congress , that was not absolutely necessary , as some features of the bank charter was said not to be , was unconstitutional . The absurdity of this last notion , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by Congress under the general power to establish post-offices and post-roads ; under which , capital punishments were authorized , which might have been dispensed with , by substituting other punishments for them , and which , therefore , not being necessary , would be , under the doctrines of the message , unconstitutional . There was no power , indeed , in the bank charter , he argued , which might not be substituted by some other of equivalent effect , and which was not , therefore , according to the sense of the message , unconstitutional . Mr. Webster next examined the objections , so often repeated , to the present bank , on the ground of its being a monopoly , and showed that it could not , in any sense of the term , be properly so called . He then went into an argument to show the fallacy of the other objection which had been made , to foreigners being stockholders in the bank ; which , he said , instead of putting us in their power , so far as it goes , puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stock of the bank , so far as it had any effect , ( small , indeed , it must be ) was a hostage in our hands , favorable to our peace and prosperity . He then very seriously deprecated the effect of this denunciation , from such high authority , of the holding by foreigners of stock in American funds . He adverted to the canal stocks of several of the states-of Ohio , of Pennsylvania , of New-York , the prices of which were every day quoted on the London Exchange , and which might be seriously affected , to the injury of the interests of these states , by this sweeping denunciation , if not counteracted . He ridiculed the idea of such investments of their funds in our stocks by foreigners , being " dangerous to liberty , " which he regarded as mere declamation , &amp;c . After adverting to some other parts of the message , he dwelt , with great force and some severity , upon that part of the message which states , as an objection to the bank on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of present action , nor upon the provisions of this act , was the Executive consulted . If Congress had not consulted the Executive , he said , the Executive had consulted them ; for the President had called their attention , three years ago , in most emphatic terms , to the subject of the renewal of the charter of the bank , and afterwards recommended to them to establish a bank , of which the prominent features were , that it was to have neither property , debt , loans , nor credit ! After touching on some other points , Mr. Webster said the time had come , when we tread on the very edge of a precipice of disaster , general distrust , want of sound and safe currency ; when the day was advancing which this bank had put , once put an end to , and which he had hoped never to see again . It was time that the people should awake to their danger , to a Politics and &amp;atistics. // aense of which he thought this last warning would not fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied to Mr. Webster , and vindicated the course of the President . The debate was continued occasionally , by Messrs . Clay , Holmes , and others , until Friday the 13th , when the question was put , " whether the bill should become a law , the President 's objections to the contrary notwithstanding ?

The annexed facts are abridged from a speech of Mr. Reed of Massachusetts , made in the House of Representatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on salt from ten to five cents a bushel . In July , 1776 , in the continental Congress , a committee of thirteen , one from each state , was instructed to inquire , in the recess of Congress , into the easiest and cheapest method of making salt in these colonies . Dec. 29 , 1776 , It was Resolved , That it be earnestly recommended to the several Assemblies or Conventions , immediately to promote , by sufficient public encouragement , the making salt in their respective colonies . June 3d , 1777 , Resolved , That a committee of three be appointed to de vise ways and means for supplying the United States with salt . June 13 , 1777 , Resolved , That it be recommended to the several states , to erect and encourage , in the most liberal and effectual manner , proper works for the making of salt . The country suffered severely for the want of salt during the revolution . The national debt was greatly enhanced by the extravagant and unavoidable price paid for salt during the war , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed , one of the first acts of taxation laid a duty on salt . It has , with the exception of a few years , been ever since centinued . The manufactures have commenced and grown up under the solicitations and encouragement of our Government . On the sea board about $2,000,000 capital has been invested in manufacturing salt of sea water , by solar evaporation , and about 600,000 bushels of best alum salt is yearly manufactured in more than 1500 establishments , owned by as many persons . In the interior , salt is still more easily manufactured from the springs . At the present time salt-is manufactured in twenty-two states . We manufactured , the last season , - 4,38*7,510 bushels . We manufactured-more than we imported . These numerous manufactories on the sea-board and in the interior , distributed through the country , furnishing more than half the salt used , are competitors with eacla other , and competitors with the importers of foreign salt . This competition is certain to secure the country against odious monopolies , which were justly complained of in former times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different States and Territories of the United States , during the calendar year 1829 , furnished from the Treasury Department .
