txt We remember to have seen an amusing tale , which represented Cicero , who had in some unexplained way returned to earth , as lost in wonder at the various inventions and improvements of the Germans ; and if the perturbed spirit of the venerable ancestor of Mr. Oldbuck , the rival of the fame of Faust and Caxton , could be made visible to us , he would be scarcely less astonished , on learning what advances have been made in his own Important art . This art has not unjustly been regarded as the mother of all subsequent reform ; but its charity has not been forgetful of its own claims * and it is itself perhaps the best example of the general superiority of modern arts over those of former times* All this is well ; it is fortunate that typography can thus adapt itself to the demands of luxury ; for there are many at the present day who would hardly be induced to read at all , excepting by the magic of a beautiful edition : and if Mr. Irving 's Sketch-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those which formerly adorned the primer , it would have found but a cold welcome in the fashionable world . The author of Waverley intimates a doubt , whether such appliances are proper in order to induce people by their attractions to do , what they would not do from a sense of duty ; but it is certainly better , that duty should be done from an inferior motive , than not performed at all . Men may be allured to the study of natural history by beautiful forms and golden plumage , rather than the deep things of comparative anatomy ; hut it is well if in any way , they can become conversant with nature . The beautiful fictions of Sir Walter Scott have attracted many to the study of history , who , but for them , would have cared very little for the past . In this point of view , independently of other merit , the annuals of the last few years are not without their value ; but there is another , in which they assume a character of more importance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperous community : like many other luxuries , if they // have not the transparent atmosphere and brilliant sun to bring them to perfection , they must be quickened into life by the artificial heat of the conservatory . Painters and sculptors find no encouragement to fix their residence on the Arkansas or the Yellow Stone ; and even near the Hudson and the Charles , the ordinary demands of the publisher would by no means ammate the engraver to the highest efforts of his art . No one doubts the importance of these arts in giving a grace and ornament to life ; it is even believed that they aid society in its progress to liberality of feeling and refinement , by making men familiar with the beautiful . Whatever tends to introduce them where they might not otherwise have appeared , at least so early ; whatever aids their progress to perfection , ought certainly to be regarded with an eye of public favor . It would be difficult to enumerate the modes of industry , exhibited in works like these : the reason why so few have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those modes with the requisite degree of skill . A publisher must first be found , who is willing to risk large sums on the doubtful venture of the public taste ; an editor , apt to perceive the shiftings of the fashionable gale , and skilful to trim his sail , so as to float gallantly before it . The brilliant creations of the painter must not be wanting , nor the laborious talent of the engraver , with his slow and patient toil ; and when to these we add the separate tasks of the printer , the binder , and a host of others , each endeavoring in his own vocation to surpass all those who have gone before him , we shall have an illustration of the division of labor , superior to those of Say and Adam Smith . The art of the engraver , in particular , required in this country some such encouragement as this . Before the publication of these annuals was begun , a marvellous change had been accomplished , as any one who remembers the finest prints of forty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which most works are of necessity issued from the press , and the importance of rendering them as cheap as possible , there were no means of urging the engraver to the highest efforts of his art , or of recompensing him for making them . His calling is not that of a copyist merely ; it combines some of the highest qualities of that of the painter ; and the difficulty of succeeding in it is apparent from the smallness of the number of engravers , who have risen to // distinguished eminence . The work before us has been the means of encouraging the efforts of a promising young artist , Cheney , whose beautiful prints have ornamented its successive volumes , and who is now pursuing his studies abroad . Various ether deserving artists have been incited to excel by the liberal compensation , which the publisher of works like these is able to offer . If no other benefit be derived from them , this , at least , . may be justly mentioned to their praise . The literary character of these annuals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and whoever is disposed to speak with harshness of our own in this respect , will do well to remember , that it is no extravagant compliment to say , that those of England are not at all before them . The object of publishers has too often been , to adorn their table of contents with distinguished names ; when , in nine cases out of ten , the articles attached to them are poor enough . In works , consisting of so many articles by many different hands , there must of necessity he much diversity in point of merit ; but so far as we have observed* the Token has had no undue proportion of bad ones , and a fair proportion of the good . As far as names of literary distinction go , it has probably been richer than any other in the country ; or if the Atlantic Souvenir has formed an exception to the remark , it could probably claim no superiority . It was , however , principally with a view to the ornamental part of the execution of these annuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ; and certainly in this re* spect they have- been very creditable to the country , notwithstanding some great disadvantages under which the publishers have labored . Several of them have , in fact , been discontinued in consequence of these disadvantages ; among others , the Talisman , which acquired much reputation in New York , the Western Souvenir , published a few years since in the city of Cincinnati , whose site was forty years ago a desert , and another , which was issued in the Territory of Michigan . The Atlantic Souvenir and Token are the only very prominent ones which yet survive , and they have been at length united . The extent of public patronage will not probably admit of so liberal expenditures in the preparation of these ornamental publications here , as in England : there is not the same privilege of selecting engravers , or the finest subjects for engraving , nor is there the same facility in executing the finest specimens of typography : but , with all these circumstances of dis // couragement , these works have been executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority of foreign ones to ours may recollect , that if they would encourage the latter as liberally as they do the former , the distinction would soon be removed . In point of beauty of typography , and of binding , the difference is very slight ; as respects the prints , there are some in the work before us which foreign artists can not easily excel : we refer particularly to those entitled Guardian Angels , ' and the Portrait . ' It is not unreasonable to suppose that it has been enabled to retain that place in the public favor , which others have lost , by the superiority of its execution , and the labor which has been devoted to it , in order to render it generally acceptable.
