txt I OBJECT to the system of emulation , which is enforced in most of our literary institutions . It does not increase habits of industry ; it is a fertile source of ill feelings% jealousies and animosities ; it creates a burning thirst for present distinction , and unfits the mind for great undertakings ; it fosters an inordinate ambition to seem great ; it is unequal and unjust in its operation . It does not encourage industrious habits . Perhaps a few , who find themselves able to take a front stand in the ranks are encouraged to make greater efforts , and to be more persevering in their exertions . But are colleges established , and their rules adopted , solely with referenne to a few of the more talented , who may resort to them ? Or are they established for the purpose of giving , to as many as possible , a sound and useful education ; for the purpose of sending out annually as large a number as possible of young men , whose minds have been so disciplined , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable members of the community ? They are , indeed , intended as schools for those , who are to dazzle the world by the splendor of their genius . in them , the luxuriance of youthful talent is to be pursued , its energies to be called forth , and its first efforts to be encouraged , cherished and directed . But colleges were not founded for this purpose alone . They also have reference to a much more numerous class of men of moderate abilities , who are to have a more direct and important influence upon the minds and happiness of the people . Of these , are the lawyers , who secure their neighbors in the quiet possession of their rights ; the teachers , who form the habits and mature the faculties of the youthful mind ; the physicians , who disarm disease of // half his terrors , and wage an almost doubtful contest with the king of terrors himself ; and , of these too , are those heavenly messengers , those divine physicians , who proclaim the glad tidings of another life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out healthy prescriptions of morality and religion , who cheer the desolate heart , give lustre to the dying eye , and , when all other aid is useless , smooth the path to heaven . No one can deny that such men are among the greatest benefactors of the human family , that they pursue " the noiseless tenor of their way " unknown to " the trumpet that speaks of fame , " and almost unheard of beyond the precincts of the humble villages , in which a kind Providence has fixed their lot . College geniuses and college witsthose butterflies of a summer 's day-may affect to despise their humdrum faculties ; yet they would be found wofully wanting , if weighed against them in an equitable balance . But useful as they are , they have but an indifferent place assigned them on the bills of the faculty . And what is the consequence ? In a place where ambition is constantly appealed to as an honorable principle of action , and where an arbitrary scale of apparent proficiency in a few studies is confidently and publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a place , and under such circumstances , they find a low seat allotted them . What is to be done ? They are conscious of having done their duty , of having well and faithfully improved their time . They can not increase their efforts . They can not amend their condition . But , where distinction alone is looked to , they must be content to pass undistinguished , and to see their more brilliant associates showed off to the public , and to their friends as important personages , while they are constrained to figure in insignificant parts , or altogether " hide their diminished heads " amid the effulgent blaze of their superiors . What effect will this public degradation have upon them ? Will it not dishearten them ? Will it not damp their spirits , sour their minds , stagger their resolutions ? Few , I am persuaded , have reflected upon the utter wretchedness thus occasioned to the sensitive mind , the bitter misanthropy which it has produced , the idleness and dissipation to which it has led the way . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college ? Because it is unnecessary . It would certainly be a happy circumstance , if governments could be so framed as to administer them selves without any forced exaltation of one individual over another . But this is impossible . The interests of society require that there should be different grades ; that one must depend solely upon his own talents and industry , while another has , in addition to these a factitious influence produced by office , and is , for the time , thus elevated above his fellows . In college no necessity of this kind exists . Again , distinctions in the world are less invidious . Office is not given to reward merit , but for the public good . There is no grave tribunal to weigh each man 's worth by ounces , and penny-weights , and grains . Nor are men crowded together as in college , and in the pursuit of the same object . But young collegians , however different their characters , habits and desires , are thrown together , and made to act from the same motive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling passion . A number of shining balls are rolled before them , and they all scramble for them . He who gets the largest , be it by fair // means or by foul , is hailed with immense applause , while the unlucky wights who get none are allowed to pass off unnoticed and unknown . A few are gratified , but the greater number disappointed , and , therefore , the system is bad . But do not all enter the contest ? Are not all benefited by the exercise ? All , indeed , enter the contest , but few continue their efforts . For , when " progress is reported , " high expectations are blasted . Hope , zeal and industry are succeeded by disappointment , disgust and indolence . Some are not affected at all , others despise the system because persuaded that it acts unequally and unjustly ; while a third class are grieved and discouraged , and a fourth and smaller class are stimulated to greater efforts . The only persons then , upon whom college honors have a beneficial effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , are the few of this fourth and small class , who are induced by them to study , and who would not study without them . I can not say how far literary institutions , in framing laws , should have reference to these high-minded young men , who must be coaxed forward every step of their course by means of little baits , just as turkeys , and geese and hens , the silliest of brute creatures , are coaxed to their coops , or their slaughter houses , by means of kernels of grain , strewed along the way ; but it seems to me that collegiate honors are given solely for their benefit , to the direct disadvantage of most of those connected with them . But have these honors really so little influence ? The experiment has been tried . There are female academies in our vicinity , in which nothing of the kind is 6ffliiied , and their instructers bear ready testimony to the success of the experiment . And surely it is paying but a sorry compliment to our own sex , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its importance , while young men must every now and then , like little Charles , and George , and Billy , receive from mamatheir Alma Mater  --  a nice sweet cake , or some other trifle as little connected with the great object of learning . There are male academies , in our vicinity , long distinguished for the zeal and industry of their pupils , which offer no rewards for excellence , other than those naturally flowing from it . And surely college students would not thank us for the compliment , should we admit that academi , boys will study from a sense of its importance , while they must be enticed forward by glittering lures . I know that the way of the student is long , and often times dark and difficult ; that a languid body , an aching head , and an aching heart , are but too often his only companions ; that obscurity may surround , poverty oppress , discouragements beset him ; but I could no more hope to make him a scholar by the excitements of a little present applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to make him a Christian by representing to him that a virtuous life alone would keep his pockets stocked with money . The true student , like the true Christian , has that before him and within him , which makes him despise all difficulties , look down all obstacles . The wizzard 's song of " toil and trouble " has no terrors for him . What though difficulties are in the way ? Though rivers , oceans , mountains and deserts are to be crossed ; though forests are to be explored , stables cleansed , Hydras // slain , and even , the black jaws of Erebus to be robbed of their snarling sentinel ? All this he feels is better than " To eat and be despised and die , Even as the beasts that perish , save that he Has a more splendid trough and wider stye ; " better , than to live " an animated mass of putrefaction , " with a soul groveling in filth and assimilated to the meanest reptile that crawls on the face of the earth . He feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beauties which it discloses , and he is satisfied . He wants no other motive . Quintilian , in his dissertation upon public and private education , mentions , among the greatest advantages of the former , that it cements friendships , which are of great importance during life ; and Washington , in recommending the establishment of a national university , had special reference to the friendships , which would there be formed between students from remote sections of the country . But the flames of emulation , so studiously fanned in our literary institutions , speedily consume the cords intended to hind together the susceptible hearts of youth . Distrust , envy and hatred force themselves into souls formed for better feelings , while those , who are naturally jealous and suspicious , with whom all pains should be taken to destroy their fiend-like propensities , and to pour into their breasts something of the " milk of human kindness , " are made tenfold more the children of darkness . And how can it be otherwise , when they are every day brought together , and taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as rivals ? The same love of power and desire of distinction , which have in by-gone ages withered and blasted the fair flowers of natural affection , and prompted to deeds of blood , that disgrace the annals of our race , still have their effect , though on a small scale , upon the character of those in whom they are fostered ; and , if they do not hurst out in similar acts of atrocity , it is only because they are are repressed by fear of the laws , the customs of the time , and the unseen influence of our religion . From themad spirit of ambition our country has more to fear than from all other causes united . In a despotism it may be pardoned , but here it is fatal . What has such an influence in arraying the north against the south , and the east against the west ? What kindles and blows the flames of party rage , until they threaten to consume the very fabric of our government ? What is perpetually bringing into collission , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discordant elements of political strife , as if for no other purpose than to witness the crash which they may produce ? We call it party spirit ; but it is nothing else than ambition ,  --  a spirit which would " ride the whirlwind and direct the storm , " solely for the purpose of showing its own power ,  - -  a spirit which hopes to be thrown upon the surface , like the lowest dregs of the ocean , and to acquire an influence in troublesome and stormy times , which can never be conceded in times of general quiet and repose-.a spirit , which hopes to batten upon the carnage of war , like wolves and vultures , though ever lean and famished in times of peace . In short , it is the spirit , which so much pains is taken to // cherish in our colleges , and from which such beneficial results are expected . Were I reclining under the leaning tower of Pisa , I certainly should not be foolish enough to apprehend immediate danger from a flea 's perching upon its summit , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much exposed to the influence of ambitious men , it is , therefore , to fall a prey to the system of emulation in our colleges . But when I consider the almost universal prevalence of the system , and that every man , who may have an important part in the affairs of state , must be exposed to its inflammatory vapors , I confess that I have fears , and that 1 can not think them unfounded . If other more harmless principles of our natui*e can be appealed to with equal force , as to the practical purposes of education , why should they not be appealed to ? I have all along supposed that college bills represent what they are intended for . Is this true ? They are meant to encourage industry . What is their effect ? One student of moderate abilities studies two hours , and gets for his pains a low mark . A class-mate , gifted with more rapid powers of acquisition , studies half an hour on the same lesson , and gets the highest mark . Is this encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How is the fact ? A young man of good talents and industrious habits gets a perfect understanding of his lesson ; but he-has a poor faculty of communicating his knowledge , and is set down for a blockhead . A class-mate , with a plausible manner , great fluency of speech , and an abundance of brass , just glances at his lesson-perhaps , while in the recitation room  --  and passes for an excellent scholar . Is this encouraging sound learning ? Is it not rather encouraging them to reverse the maxim of Cato , and make it their great aim to appear good , rather than to be so ? I do not object to emulation . Where no forced rivaiships are encouraged , no arbitrary distinctions established the natural feelings are acted upon in a natural manner , and , in this , as in other things , the order of nature is a beautiful order , leading to her results , it may be , not by the most direct , but by the most sure and harmonious means . But when men undertake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she meant should operate silently and imperceptibly , they limit the influence of those distinctions , turn them aside from their original purpose , and open the way to a brood of evil propensities , and ungovernable passions . One word more , before I close . Let it not be supposed that these remarks are intended for the encouragement of those idle profligates , who are glad to screen their mental nakedness behind any shriveled fig-leaf , which chance may throw within their reach . Sic nos non vobis . " Lay not the flattering unction to your souls . " The foxes have holes , the birds of the air have nests ; for every swimming , every creeping thing a place has been provided ; but in the whole economy of nature , no mansion has been prepared for you . You will not study for college honors . Very well . We shall not quarrel here . But if not for college honors , at least study for the sake of your friends , whose souls are bound up in your success ; for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of improvement , for // the sake of your university , whose honor and usefulness depend upon those of her children ; for the sake of your coujitry , who stands in need of all the knowledge , all the ability , all the virtue , which can be generated and perfected by her various resources ; for the sake of your own selves , your own reputation , usefulness and happiness . H.@@183068149.txt HAVING flOW arranged my domestic affairs in some degree to my satisfaction , it *eemed on the whole right and proper that , according to the custom of our country and the laws of our religion , I should go up to Jerusalem , to celebrate the Feast of the Passover , the great anniversary of the deliverance of our nation , when the destroying angel , passed by the doors of the humble and persecuted bondsmen in a strange land , and brought dismay and desolation into the habitatiens of their lordly oppressors , smiting the first born of the country , from the heir of the haughty Pharaoh upon his throne , to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the effect of what I had heard and seen of the doctrines of the new Teacher , and of his wonderful gifts and powers , had made a strong impression upon my mind , but though I had at times thought much and deeply upon the subject , yet the current of my reflections had been so often and strongly broken by the events that 1 have just been relating , and my attention had been so powerfully engaged by objects and occurrences of primary importance in my wordly concerns , that I had , as yet , been able to come to no definite conclusion on the subject , nor even to arrange my desultory reflections in any distinct form . I felt indeed , that the subject was one of vast importance as it regarded my future welfare , but I felt it but vaguely , and by no means realized how much more essential it was to me , than the affairs upon which I had been engaged . To yon , who have known me only in later years , when my mind and heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of that , which then seemed like innovation , and , at the best , a matter of doubt and uncertainty , requiring painful reflection and careful consideration , to you it may appear a matter of surprise , that I should ever have been thus indifferent , thus insensible to the supremacy of the concerns of the soul over the transient goods or ills , that appertain but to its shortlived fleshly tenement . But though I tremble to think what might have been the consequences of neglected time and opportunities , had I then been called to my final account , yet I caiinot admit that there was aught in my conduct that might not find a ready explanation in the circumstances of the case , and the situation of the times ; I erred indeed in my negligence in seeking after the truth , and I acknowledge my fault , but that I did err was not a matter affording just cause for astonishment . I had been brought up , as I have before observed , in the utmost reverence of the law delivered to Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and early was I taught to feel a pride in the circumstance , that of all the nations of the world , our own was the only one thus signally favored by Him with direct communication , and in being guided by his express will and immediate authority . In the rites and ceremonies of that law , I could perceive typifications of the great events of the past , and dim shadowings forth of those that were yet to come . I could perceive a moral meaning , fraught with important truths , and a harmony with all that we knew of the will and works of the Deity , which it was vain to seek in the worship of the Heathens . Among them I had wandered and sojourned for several years ; I had heard the doctrines of the Egyptian Priests in Alexandria and Memphis . I had listened to the teachings of the Portico and the Academy in Athens , and the reiteration of them by the philosophers of Rome . I had seen the maddening rites cf Bacchus , and the disgusting worship of Cybele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenets and ceremonies , marking but // the degradation of man and his ignorance of his Maker . I had indeed found precepts , and feelings , and actions worthy of a more enlightened source , and of purer and more virtuous associations ; but the effect of the whole was , that whle I was rendered less bigoted and intolerant with regard to the personal worth of those professing and practising a different religion , I was also confirmed in the belief of the divine origin and excellence of our own , by seeing how far it exceeded in simplicity , beauty , purity , and consistency , the most perfect creeds and systems produced by those acknowledged to be the master minds of the world . So that , in short , while I was less inclined to reject as worthless , without examination , aught in the way of religious belief or worship , that should offer itself to my notice , I was also less disposed to be satisfied by a partial examination , however favorable might be its results , that any thing was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and important leading truths , but they might be more than counterbalanced by a preponderating weight of error , which more accurate and extensive information and acquaintance would make apparent . Besides , too , I had the highest possible sanction and authority for my dependence upon the faith of my fathers , and my adherence to it . That the same sanction and authority should be given to something totally at variance with some part of that worship , something that should overthrow and supersede it , and erect a purer fabric upon its ruins , was not lightly to be credited , however plausible and weighty might be the evidence first presented on its behalf . It seemed , at least , as if there could be no sin in pausing for examination , and no hazard in holding to the belief in what was once true , even if true no longer , till it should be ascertained that this was the case . Nor amid the pressure of cares and anxieties concerning things in which a man , not under the dominion of conviction as to something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbing interest , did it seem materially objectionable , to postpone for attention to them , and while waiting for calmer times of reflection and more abundant evidence , the consideration of these conflicting claims to faith , the decision between which might have so extensive an influence over the future circumstances and conduct of these very affairs . It was in this frame of mind that I made my preparations for going up to the Feast of the Passover , a feast which , whether I retained my adherence to the old religion , or ultimately became a convert to the new , seemed worthy of reverence and observance , as commemorating one of the most signal mercies and acts of deliverance of the Most High , the common and supreme object of adoration in both . I moreover felt now at leisure to investigate , fully and satisfactorily , the doctrines and actions of this wonderful man , whose word , as my own senses bore witness , had power to break the slumbers of the grave , and to restore its tenants to a second enjoyment of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opportunities for this investigation . It was my purpose to take up my abode , during my stay , with my kinsman Lazarus and his sisters , as the village of Bethany was at so short a distance from Jerusalem , that , for all the purposes I had in view , it was equally convenient with a residence in the city itself , and in a great degree free from the bustle and crowd unavoidable in the latter , from the great in* ux of strangers from all parts of Judea coming up to celebrate the feast . From these friends , I knew that I could obtain ample information on all the points untouched during my brief and hurried stay , at the time I witnessed the stupendous miracle that recalled Lazarus again to the world ; and I felt not much disposed to question the sincerity of their testimony , after the ample confirmation his own living presence would give to the truth of all he could possibly say . Besides , I had no doubt , from what I then saw and heard of the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharisees and Priests , but that I should have from their malignant zeal , at least enough of adverse testimony , though my kinsman and his sisters should be carried ever so far away by the current of their zeal and affection . I accordingly set out , pursuing the same route that I had taken on my former journey , and traveling leisurely on account of the heat , now beginning to be oppressive at noon , and the somewhat heavy lading of my mules . I arrived on the evening before the day of the Passover , at my kinsman 's house . But very different was the reception I now met with , from that I had experienced on my last visit . The sounds of cheerful voices greeted my ear , as I rode into the court , lights gleamed gaily through the lattices , and two or three domestics were seen busily passing to and fro , as if engaged in active preparation for the reception // and entertainment of guests . One of them immediately came forward , with a respectful but cheerful salutation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I alighted , and scarcely was my foot out of the stirrup , before I was received in the warm and affectionate embrace of my cousin , now vigorous in the perfect enjoyment of health . Giving the domestic directions for the care of my mules and baggage , he immediately conducted me to an inner apartment , where I changed my raiment and washed off the dust of the road , and thence he led me to another room where I found his sisters , in company with several other friends , most of whom , like myself , had come from a distance to be present at the celebration of the feast . After a short interval , passed in mutual greetings , we were summoned to supper , which had been prepared in an inner apartment . When the keenness of hunger , excited by travel , had been allayed , conversation , which had languished for a while , was again resumed , and maintained with much interest , as we prolonged our stay over the festive board for two or three hours , while partaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines . As might naturally be expected , the conversation soon turned upon the new Teacher and his doctrines , which I found formed a subject of general interest , from his having come up to the feast , accompanied by his disciples , a few days before , and made a sort of triumphal entry into Jerusalem , in lowly guise , indeed , sitting upon an ass 's colt , with no other equipments than the hempen halter , with which the beast had been tied , and two or three of the outer mantles , or tunics , of some of his disciples thrown over the animal 's back , instead of a saddle or riding-cloth . The lowliness of this equipage was however compensated by the zeal of his followers , and of many of the multitude who soon assembled , part of whom spread their cloaks upon the way for the colt to tread upon , while others strewed the path and decorated their own persons with branches of palms plucked by the way side , and from the neighboring fields . The whole was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladness from the multitude , who made the air resound with " Hosanna ! now is salvation ! blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord Most of those present I found were favorably inclined to the Teacher and his doctrines , and seemed to regard with much pleasure this decided manifestation towards him of popular favor . One or two , less sanguine than the rest , seemed to apprehend that evil consequences might come of it , since it would afford a hold for the malice of his enemies , to accuse him of exciting tumult and disturbance among the people , and might render him obnoxious to the displeasure of the Roman rulers , as the title of King , bestowed upon him by the multitude , even without any assumption of it on his own part , might , with very little stretch of ingenuity , be framed into something like an aiming at supreme temporal power , **68;659;TOOLONG , which resolutely and unrelentingly crushed every exhibition of authority or popularity , that might interfere with their own control over the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so ,  --  with regard to the peculiar customs , manners , and religious rites , of their conquered provinces . Even if those more immediately interested , the Governor of Judea and his nearest inferiors in command , should be otherwise willing to let the thing pass unnoticed , viewing the expressions used as the mere ebullition of excited popular feeling , and implying no offence against their rule , or any attempt to subvert it , yet it was argued that it would hardly be safe for them to act according to this opinion , however sincere and honest it might be , since the jealous and tyrannical disposition of the Emperor Tiberius , as is well known , and also the intrigues of the Roman court , where some unprincipled and ambitious aspirant to power would not fail to represent such conduct on the part of these great functionaries as wanting in respect for the person of the Emperor , and in zeal for his service , if not as proof of positive disaffection and rebellious disposition ,  --  the least of which things , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , if not his life also . The proceedings of the Teacher , they continued , after his entrance into Jerusalem , would give weight to such accusations , and they then mentioned , that he had gone into the temple and driven out those who had established themselves there as sellers of doves , for the purpose of supplying offerings according to the law to those who came to worship , and those also who acted as changers of money , ostensibly for the convenience of strangers , who , from the variety of coins in circulation through the country , and in different parts of it , might not , on coming to the city , be supplied with that kind of money , which its usages rendered most necessary or advantageous . // 115 These sorts of traffic , as all seemed willing to allow , were an infringement upon the sanctity of the place and the respect due to it , even if carried on with perfect fairness , which , however , several said , was by no means the case ; but that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud , practised upon the ignorant and unwary ,  --  so that the practice was indeed worthy of the quotation said to have been used by the Teacher , while thus expelling those engaged in it , which was , " My house shall be called the house of prayer , but ye have made it a den of thieves . " There appeared to me to be much force and probability in these arguments , to which , as to the rest of the conversation , I was almost entirely a listener , seldom speaking except to ask a question , or to make some little remark , that might serve to procure for me farther information or elucidation on a subject in which my mind was so much engaged . I was particularly struck , however , with the account of the triumphal entrance into Jerusalem , especially that part of it which described the Teacher as sitting upon an ass 's foal . It immediately struck me , that among some of our ancient and sacred writings , I had met with*ome passage expressing a similar thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found , nor its immediate application . The effect , however , was strong , and the circumstance kept perpetually recurring to my mind Could it be , that it was among the prophecies pointing out the great deliverer of Israel , who was one day to arise from the race of David , and to rescue my fallen and afflicted country from the grasp and oppression of her enemies ! If so , here indeed seemed one to whom it might apply , and who , as far as pessonal gifts were concerned , might bear the application worthily . But how was this man to become such a deliverer , and what and whence were his means of restoring the departed power and glories of the chosen people , for so many ages a prey to the conquerors of the earth ! Openly hated or affectedly despised by a greater part of the higher classes of the nation , wandering about the country with a few followers , ( sincere and zealous , but simple hearted men , without professions and without influence , or even the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destitute , as he had emphatically said , of a place where to lay his head , to break the iron bands of foreign dominion , to overthrow those invincible legions , whose stern and disciplined valor had shaken the thrones of the most powerful kingdoms of the earth , and reduced even our former conquerors to submission and vassalage ! How was he even to surmount the power , the jealousy , and the hatred of the princes and nobles of his own country , and how to evade the crafty councils of an ambitious and powerful priesthood , to whom the very simplicity of his life and doctrines was a perpetual and goading reproach , made more bitter by his severe animadversions upon their profligacy , their hypocrisy , and their avarh* ! It is true , that our annals contained in their records of wonderful deliverances wrought by the power of the Most High , through feeble and in the estimation of man altogether insufficient means , against those , who afflicted with their persecutions the children of Israel ; but never while those children were thus divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of power and knowledge beyond even the most eminent of our former prophets . At his bidding , sight came to the eyeballs of the blind , and strength to withered limbs ; deadly disease vanished at his touch , and even the grave at his call gave up those there deposited , as was thought , forever . The very powers of the material world obeyed his voice , of which the simple mandate stilled the fury of the wind and the tossing of the waves , till the wings of the tempest were closed in slumber , and calmness brooded in the lately troubled air , and upon the now glassy sea . Here were evidences of a power , which , if exerted to that object , seemed capable of overcoming all opposition that merely human efforts could offer , however wide and various their sources , and however close their concentration , of overcoming all but the pertinacity of the mind bent upon evil , and the gratification of its own malignant passions and misdirected ambition . Would , however , this power be thus exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction , since no ordinary discomfiture or loss could ever make the Roman eagle forego a prey , on which his eye had once fixed ; much less make him unclose his talons when they had already clutched it in their grasp . Nothing short of the ruin of the force of that empire , embracing directly or indirectly nearly the whole of the habitable world , seemed sufficient to obtain our freedom and security . Such was the lesson written in characters of blood on many a page of history , and established by the ineffectual struggles of many a warlike nation , long the conqueror of others , but destined // in its turn to submit to the military supremacy of Rome . To overthrow this supremacy was to rend and convulse the world , to open wide the flood-gates of slaughter and devastation , and to make the earth indeed drunk with blood . Yet the power that might do this , and which alone seemed capable of doing it , was in the possession of one , as described by those who knew him best , meek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors and wealth , and used his great endowments but for the purpose of relieving those afflicted with the diseases and privations incident to human nature , thereby to establish the truth of his selfdenying mission and doctrines ; who openly declared , that his kingdom was not of this world , and inculcated upon his followers nought but peace and good will to their fellows . From all that I had heard and seen , it seemed worse than idle to expect , that from this source was to spring the deliverance of Judea from thraldom , and her restoration to the glory she possessed under Solomon . Sooner might the Ethiop change his skin and the leopard his spots , than the mild Jesus of Nazareth become a shedder of blood and a leader of armies , a king and a conqueror , and his humble fishermen a band of sanguinary heroes , the successors and emulators of Joab and Abner , or the Maccabees . Yet to what end then was the coming of the Teacher , and to what purpose were the doctrines that he taught ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I heard , corroborated as it was by what I had seen , and if on investigation I should find reason to give credence to the divine authority of his coming , and the divine truth of his doctrines , it seemed as if I must give up the hope , so dear to every Jewish heart , of the future glory and dominion of the land of my fathers ; for as the world seemed to be constituted , nothing was more opposite to the indulgence of such a hope , than the example and teaching of this Nazarene . I was lost and bewildered in the maze of my own reflections , and knew not where to turn for some stable point on which to rest my thoughts ; though even then some vague surmises flashed across my mind , that the glory promised to Israel , like the kingdom of the Teacher , might not be of this world , and the yoke of sin might be that from which she was to find deliverance ; and who seemed so fit to lead her to these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom my friends were then conversing , I should have said , for in truth I had become so entirely absorbed in the meditations above related , that for a number of minutes I had entirely forgotten where I was , and had ceased altogether to notice aught that was passing . I was roused from my reverie by the voice of my kinsman , speaking with more than usual earnestness , and on looking up , I found his remarks were addressed to a small man , who had not before taken any part in the conversation , but whom I had casually noticed as being much engaged with the viands on the table , which he seemed to enjoy with a peculiar zest and air of satisfaction ; not that arising from merely appeasing the cravings of hunger , but wearing the appearance of habitual attention to what was relishing and savory in the way of meat and drink . In short , from my cursory observation , I had , intuitively , as it were , set him down as one who was more of a worshiper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world , or for the hopes and blessings of a future state of existence . Nor was my hasty conclusion incorrect ; for I soon found by the tenor of my kinsman 's remarks , that this man was of the sect of Sadducees , who deny that there is any resurrection after death , and who seemed to me , from what little I knew of their tenets , to bear considerable resemblance , in many of their notions , to the followers of Epicurus , among the self-styled philosophers of Greece and Rome . In conformity to the leading principles of his sect , he had been opposing some of the doctrines of the Teacher , particularly that of the resurrection and future life , accompanied with rewards or punishment , according to the virtues or vices practised in this world . Lazarus was now endeavoring to confute his remarks and arguments at considerable length , both by general reasoning upon the distribution of happiness and sorrow here , and the fitness and necessity of some future state to bring things to their just balance , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and for particular illustrations . With regard to the future resurrection , he argued from the instances recorded of a return to life , of those who had been dead , as of the son of the widow of Nain , &amp;. c. ; ending finally with an appeal to the miracle not long before exhibited in his own person . The following , as nearly as I recollect it , was the concluding strain of his remarks upon this subject . " If* ' said he , " death be indeed strictly the conclusion and final consummation of life ; if , after the grave has closed upon what was man , there be nothing to hope for and nothing to fear ; if the existence of intellect and // the energies of the mind , as well as the form , the properties , and powers of the body , be indeed extinguished forever , to own no revivifying power , but to be to endless futurity as though they had not been ; to what purpose do we live , gathering up wisdom by painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and suffering ? To what end is this wisdom , and of what avail this knowledge ? If , indeed , we obtained it by the arrival of a certain period of life , and thence lived on in the enjoyment and use of it to a certain definite farther period ; and if the comforts and enjoyments , the influence and power , of this world , considered as such merely in the common acceptance of terms , were consequent on these attainments of wisdom and knowledge , then indeed an end and a purpose would be visible ; but , as I have already pointed out , these things are not so . Our wisdom and our knowledge are progressive , as long as our faculties are unimpaired or capable of acting with effect , till the very moment , even in the longest life , when we be g in to descend to the tomb , so that for that they seem a preparation , and not for the world . Death , moreover , comes at any period , and interrupts the progress of these acquisitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rapid advance . The honors , the power , the riches , the means of enjoyment afforded by the world , are more often the attendants upon craft , intrigue , wickedness of every kind , and even mere chance , in the way of inheritance , than upon the discipline of the mind to righteousness and the practice of virtue , and to the attainment of learning and wisdom . " If , as I understand your doctrines , what we call the soul of man , whether merely his consciousness , his intellect and mental powers , or some still more fine and subtle essence , the nature of which we can not comprehend ; if this be dependent on the living body , and so indissolubly linked with it , that the death of the latter must be the death also of the former , and there can be no reason to think that it can survive or appear in another existence , how is it that when once death has taken place , both soul and body can be restored to this life , and pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept . Life has departed and returned , and with it has returned all that constituted the man . Such instances I have pointed out in the records of our nation , and , as a final appeal , I gratefully and reverently offer myself as another . I was dead and entombed , yet now am alive . This Teacher , Jesus of Nazareth , who proclaims the doctrine of the resurrection , and of future life and of judgement to come , favored with the powers of the Most High , as he has abundantly evinced at other times and in other manners , has in this thing been pleased to visit even me with this great exertion of his gifts and of his love , and recalled me to life even after I had lain four days in the grave . Having power to do this , then , how can we doubt that he has power to do it to all or any , or how can we hesitate to believe , when he assures us , that all are to become the subjects of a final resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been abundantly shown , and has established the truth of his words , claiming to be commissioned by the Most High , and with this testimony of his truth , how can we think , that his knowledge is not commensurate to his power , or that his words , that stand in this thing , shall fail in other things ? " A short and solemn pause of silence followed these remarks , and Joash , for so the little man was called , seemed for a moment disconcerted and unable to reply . Quickly recovering himself , however , he abruptly asked ,  --  " But were you indeed dead ? " A look of astonishment from all the guests was turned upon him at this query , mixed with which I noticed in one or two of the younger ones , a suppressed smile of wonder at his pertinacious and uncourteous obstinacy . A flush of displeasure clouded the brow of Lazarus ; and he appeared laboring to subdue some internal and unpleasant emotion . Joash remarked the feeling that his interrogation had called forth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerity or truth , and pray you to forgive me , if I have hurt your feelings by the unguarded manner of my question ; but we have often heard accounts of many , that , being sick , have fallen into a trance , and , having lain therein many days , have at length resumed the use of their faculties and been restored to health . This , I thought , might possibly have been the case with yourself , and the Teacher , from some information or other , suspecting or knowing this , has thus been able to perform this seeming miracle , which , if so , would be nothing but a delusion . The countenance of Lazarus had by this time become serene , but was more than usually grave , as , after a few minutes deliberation on his part , and of anxious expectation on mine , he slowly and solemnly answered . // " What proof a man may be expected to give to the living , to convince them that he has actually been dead , is difficult to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil , that mortal hands may not draw aside , to reveal the secrets of futurity . Presumptuous as would be the attempt , it would be equally vain and idle , could it be carried into effect . Such revelations would be but the assertions of an individual , and as likely to be the unsubstantial phantoms of a dreaming trance , as of aught more real , as far as the minds of his fellow men could judge of them . They could therefore have no deserved effect , for they could have no corroboration . The simple assertion of the fact amounts to all that the individual himself can offer , and the opinions of those around him at the time is all the evidence , by which that assertion can be supported . That my sisters and friends believed me dead , no one will dispute , and for myself I can but solemnly assert the same , invoking as the witness of my truth , the sacred and tremendous name of Jehovah . The Teacher was present neither at my sickness nor at my burial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till four days after the latter event ; and to believe that he thought me in a trance , and that he knew it would end just at the time that on that supposition it did , and that just at that time he should be there , and call to me to come forth , and that I should not only hear him , but be able to obey him ; to believe , I say , all these improbable coincident circumstances , implies a readiness of belief , a very credulity , that might be convinced by less direct testimony than that of my friends , and much less solemn asseveration , than that which I have just given . " To this Joash had no reply , or no courage to make it , as he was then situated ; and the subject was dropped . As might naturally be expected from the tone of the latter part of it , our feelings were not in train for entering upon any new and less engrossing topic of conversation , and after exchanging mutual greetings , we retired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyelids ; weary as I was with the fatigues of the day , my thoughts were far too much excited , and too busily employed in meditation on what had passed , to let me sink into forgetfulness , till the first crowing of the cock had announced the approach of morning.
