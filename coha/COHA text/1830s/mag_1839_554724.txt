txt WE can not believe , that it is possible to translate the writings of Kant , in a way that will make them intelligible to the English reader , however conversant he may be with ordinary metaphysical speculations , and little apt to be discouraged by the first sight of abstruse doctrine and uncouth phraseology . A compend , or general exposition of his system , may be attempted with some chance of success ; but a literal version would probably be ten times more enigmatical than the original . The fact is , that Kant needs to be translated before he can be understood by the vast majority of his own countrymen ; and though the eminent thinkers , who have stooped to this repulsive task in Germany , have succeeded in disentangling the main points of his system , and presenting to the popular view something like a connected whole , yet in the subsidiary portions , the filling up of the theory , a comparison of their respective works displays a mass of various and irreconcilable opinions . Kant aspired to invent a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . Each is explicable only through the other ; and the student is , consequently , presented at the outset with an alternative of difficulties . The system can be comprehended only by one who is acquainted with its technical vocabulary , and a knowledge of the terms employed can be derived only from a previous familiarity with the principal doctrines and divisions of the theory itself . The case , therefore , is very nearly as had as that of the Egyptian hieroglyphics , - the unknown writing of an unknown tongue . Fichte seems to have had this fact in view , when he affirmed , that the works of his predecessor must be wholly unintelligible to those who did not know beforehand what they contained . Other obstacles to the easy comprehension of Kantian metaphysics arise from defects of style , and the writer 's inability , acknowledged by himself , to facilitate the study of his opinions by the clearness of their expression . The rambling and involved sentences , running on from page to page , and stuffed with repetitions and parenthetical matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at // the very threshold of his endeavour . Kant was an acute logician , a systematic , profound , and original thinker ; but his power of argument and conception wholly outran his command over the resources of language , and he was reduced to the use of words as symbols , in which his opinions were rather darkly implied , than openly enunciated . The very extent of his innovations in the vocabulary of science showed his inability to make a proper use of the ancient stores of his native tongue . The coining of new terms is the unfailing expedient of those , who can not make a right application of old ones . The difficulties thus thrown in the student 's way , are still further enhanced by the absolute dryness of the speculations , and the want of any relief from ingenious illustrations , or excursions into the flowery regions of eloquence and imagination . His genius never unbends . The flowers , with which other philosophers have strewed the path of their inquiries , were either beyond his reach , or he disdained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of abstract discussions , from which the taste instinctively recoils . Not one oasis blooms , not a single floweret springs , beside the path of the traveller , through this African desert of metaphysics . In this respect , how unlike the rich and fervid genius of Bacon , whose solemn and weighty teachings derive half their effect from the play of imagination , and brilliancy of wit , in which they are enveloped Before the system of Kant can become generally known , or rightly appreciated , out of the small circle of scholars , who , in France and Germany , have resolutely grappled with its difficulties , the same service must be performed for him , which the generous and clear-headed Dumont afforded to his English contemporary , Bentham . It is not enough merely to translate ; the order of subjects must be changed , the course of argument and illustration arranged anew , and the whole work rewritten . The success of previous attempts at a close interpretation has not been such as to tenipt further endeavour . The Latin version of Born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not half so intelligible as the original , indeed , the limited vocabulary of the Latin language formed an insuperable obstacle to the undertaking , though a vigorous attempt was made to conquer the difficulty by the introduction of barbarisms , that would have made " Quinctilian stare and gasp . " Should another scholar meditate a version into // one of the ancient languages , we recommend to him to try the Greek , feeling quite confident , that , in such a case , he will at least equal in perspicuity some of the renowned fathers of Grecian philosophy . Futile as was this attempt to give universal reputation to the writings of Kant by translating them into the language of the learned world , the few writers , who , in France and England , have endeavoured to make the same works known in their vernacular tongue , have met , if possible , with still less success . In the latter country , indeed , little has been tried , and nothing effected . Among the countrymen of Locke , Hume , and Reid , the taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not foster a philosophy of native growth , there was little chance of obtaining favor for an importation from Germany . Willich , a respectable German scholar , published a volume , entitled " Elements of the Critical Philosophy ' * but it hardly deserved the name of an introduction to these elements . A few pages of the work on " Pure Reason " are literall ) r translated , and an unsuccessful effort is made to explain a few of the most difficult terms in the Kantian vocabulary . Wirgman , in some essays published in the " Encyclop*dia Londinensis , " made greater pretensions , but supported them with far less ability . T he introductory portion of the " Critique* ' is rendered into English with tolerable fidelity ; but the original matter in the " Essays " only shows , that the writer was a weak and vain man , wholly unfitted for the task of comment and exposition . Before printing his work , he submitted it to Dugald Stewart , with the amiable intention of preventing that philosopher from wasting further labor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he had been entirely forestalled by his German rival . When the Scottish sage returned the manuscript , with a coldly polite refusal of the proffered assistance , 2l*Tirgman , as if eager with Dogherry to write himself down an ass , had the folly to publish the correspondence . His lamentations upon such blind perversity on the part of Stewart and others make up the larger portion of the trash , with which be has enveloped his imperfect and jejune translation . They order these matters better in France . " Of all living writers , perhaps , Cousin is best qualified for the task of interpreting and making available to common minds the dark sayings of the philosopher of K6nigsberg . His thorough acquaintance with the subject , attested by a copious infusion // of Kantianism into his own philosophical system , - the candor , learning , and ability , with which he has reviewed the labors of others , - and the admirable clearness of his style , are qualities , that would insure him a great measure of success in the undertaking . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we would gladly see the pledge redeemed , though at the expense of sacrificing some of the fruits of his original speculations . The necessity for such a work is not removed by the labors of some of his countrymen , who have preceded him in the same field , though they have done much to elucidate the subject , and to give a new direction to their own philosophical inquiries . The publication of Villers is the most important , in which , giving up all attempts at a literal version , he goes over the ground in his own way with great distinctness , though he sometimes unwittingly engrafts his own opinions upon those which he seeks to interpret . In an admirable sketch , published in the Biographie Universelle , Stapfer has given a lucid and succinct account of the Kantian system , leaving nothing to be desired by those , who wish only for a general view of its scope and leading peculiarities . Those , who think the difficulties of the German language are the only obstacle to the right comprehension of Kant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title stands at the head of our article . The great work , containing the whole system of the Critical Philosophy , is here faithfully translated , sentence for sentence , and , - as far as the different nature of the two languages would permit , - word for word . The writer of it has thus ably executed the only task that he proposed to himself . The violations of English idiom are frequent , it is true , but no more so than was absolutely necessary in order to preserve the strictness of the original plan . And , while the object was merely to translate , not to rewrite and interpret , we are not sure , but that the wisest course was to follow this method in all its severity . A freer version might give false notions of the original , while the only fault of the present volume must be , that , for the most part , it gives no notions at all . A false light is worse than utter darkness . A dreary task must the translator have had of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , than in that of the student , who , without further aid than this work affords , should attempt to // master the thorny system of Kantian metaphysics . The hook presents a more accurate image of its prototype , than it would do , if executed on a more liberal plan , and with greater attention to rhetorical embellishment . The English style , harsh , awkward , and involved as it appears , is a fair picture of the original diction ; though the former is necessarily the more obscure , because , in German , far more frequently than in English , the composition of the technical terms indicates the precise shade of meaning attached to them . We have noticed a few wrong translations ; but they are unimportant , and do not lessen the credit due to the translator for having executed a most repulsive work with remarkable care , patience , and fidelity . But the question will surely be asked , Why spend so much labor on the interpretation of opinions , which the author has not cared , or has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no practical application is possible ? What hidden wisdom is there in the writings of Kant , to extract which the learned world must toil as painfully , as they have done in deciphering the hieroglyphics of Egypt , and perhaps to as little purpose ? Why not leave his system in that obscurity , in which his uncouth style and barbarous nomenclature first enveloped it ? We can not be satisfied with the answer of the men who maintain , that the difficulties of this metaphysical theory do not arise from any defects in the exposition of it , but are fairly attributable to the ignorance , the want of acuteness , or the defective power of abstraction of those , who have tried in vain to comprehend it . The reproach is an infrequent one in the history of the higher philosophy . Why have not other writers on the same subject been exposed to it in an equal degree ? The difficulty of reading a work on the higher mathematics is a different thing , for we know precisely in what it consists . No one complains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few would attempt to peruse it in its primitive form with much chance of success . None but a mathematician of very respectable attainments would ever dream of such a task . It is well known , that La Place , addressing himself to a small circle of scientific men , xvrote with the conciseness , which the comprehensiveness of his subject demanded , and that the difficulty of understanding his work proceeds mainly from this cause , and may be in great part removed by such a commentary as that furnished by our // distinguished countryman . But there is no intrinsic difficulty in the subject of metaphysics , to be removed only by a regular course of previous training and information . Except the recent German metaphysicians , who have xvilfully " walked in darkness " by borrowing the phraseology of Kant , and we are ac ( luainted with no work in the whole round of the science , which a person of ordinary capacity may not understand , if he chooses . He will meet with many abstract and wearisome discussions , with very unattractive reading ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be understood . This fact is stated in the most unequivocal terms by iD'Alembert . " Every thing we learn from a good hook on mental science is only a sort of reminiscence of what the mind previously knew . Accordingly , we may apply to good authors in this department what has been said of those who excel in the art of writing ; that , in reading them , every one is apt to imagine , that he himself could have written in the same manner . " We are not sure , that the obscurity of Kant 's writings has not been cne great cause of their celebrity . The oracular utterances of the sage of Kdnigsberg were eagerly caught up by a class of scholars , very numerous in Germany , whom no prospect of intellectual toil could appal , while their vanity was gratified by forming an esoteric school of philosophy , and possessing doctrines incommunicable to the world at large . No country was ever visited with such a plethora of learned industry . When the stores of ancient erudition were exhausted , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Oriental literature was thoroughly elucidated , and no difficulty in the Sanscrit and Japanese languages remained to he overcome , the crowd of philologists , critics , and commentators pounced with eagerness on a publication in their own land , which promised them an inexhaustible field of labor for all time to come . The stores of transcendental wisdom must be precious , indeed , when so many difficulties obstructed the attainment of them . Forthwith , dictionaries , manuals , refutations , replies , and rejoinders were multiplied without end . The number and loquacity of the initiated daily increased , all busily employed , and jabbering in a dialect , that astounded the common people , while it reduced time neophytes well-nigh to despair . A good-sized library might now be formed entirely of works written in // Kantianese , and devoted more or less directly to commenting on the " Critical Philosophy . " We treat this matter lightly , though fully aware , that the extraordinary influence of Kant 's writings can not he explained from the single cause above mentioned . In truth , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive the workings of no ordinary mind . Uniting great learning to a vigorous and comprehensive intellect , delighting in the boldest and most original speculations , and especially distinguished for a systematizing spirit , which gave a formal unity and entireness to the mass of his opinions , he stands high among the small hand of men , whose works have given a new impulse and direction to science , and whose lives form the great turning points in the history of philosophy . Fully aware of the greatness of his proposed task and his own abilities , he put forward his claims with a freedom and decision , which in other men would have savoured of arrogance , but in him marked only the self-reliance of genius . Occupying a new position in speculative inquiry , he declared , that the method of his predecessors was fundamentally wrong , that their conclusions were unfounded and contradictory , and that his own theory was not merely the only safe , but the only possible , foundation for all future systems of metaphysics . To adopt his own language , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until they shall have satisfactorily answered the question , " on which , in his opinion , the possibility of their science depends . His own great work is not so much a new theory of the science itself , as an investigation of the grounds and nature of the problem proposed , and a scrutiny into the means and method to be adopted for its solution . All minds were naturally captivated by the boldness of pretension in these proposals . They felt the charms of a system , which promised to confute dogmatism on the one hand , and rebuke skepticism on the other , and to rescue the highest of all sciences from its previous uncertainties , waverings , and contradictions , and provide for it a sure method of future progress . The cumbersome apparatus , and the consequent tax on the patience of the learners , seemed pardonable , when they considered the difficulty of the problern and the magnitude of the end in view . In any other country than Germany , the work would probably have fallen still-born from the press ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierce through the tough and knotty envelope of the system , to ascertain how far it redeemed its magnificent promises . Even there , it was unnoticed for two years after its publication , and the bookseller was on the point of using the impression for waste paper , wheo the attention of the public was directed toward it by some articles in a leading journal , and the edition was eagerly bought up . From that time , its influence has been well-nigh unbounded . Some were attached to it , perhaps , from the very labor it had cost them to comprehend it , and because they were unwilling to confess , even to themselves , that they had lost their toil . Others , who were disgiuisted with the endless doubts , inconsistencies , and retrocessions of all former metaphysics , were attracted to this system by its formal and technical appearance and vast pretensions , which seemed to insure for the object of their pursuit a reality and stable foundation , like that enjoyed by the kindred sciences of logic and mathematics . Kant was thoroughly German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well adapted to the national prejudices , - if we may call them such without offence , - and to the tendencies of the times . They fell in with the current of thought that marked the age , and their influence consequently was not confined to their proper subject , but covered the whole range of speculation , - not more apparent in metaphysics , than in morals , taste , and literary criticism . The nomenclature was widely adopted , and the spirit of the " Critical Philosophy " soon colored the whole web of German literature . And , when the prodigious literary activity of the nation began to attract the attention of foreigners , and the " Chinese wall , " which bad isolated them from the rest of Europe , was broken down , the phenomenon of this man 's extraordinary power , so xvidely manifested , did not fail to excite curiosity in foreign countries . Madame de Stahl , in her work , that may be said almost to have introduced the German literati to the European world , devoted several chapters to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that the people thus recently made known to us bid fair to affect French and English letters more widely and deeply than any foreign causes have done for ages , it becomes doubly important to gain correct notions of the philosophical theory , which is ingrained in their thoughts and language . We have said , that much of the popularity of this system // at borne was owing to its consonancy with the train of national opinions . We do not allude merely to the aliment , which its operose machinery afforded to the German appetite for toil . It was the state of religious opinions , with which the new philosophy harmonized in the greatest degree . More than fifty years ago , religious belief was dying out as rapidly in Germany as in France . Enthusiasm of faith had passed away with the theological wars , to which it had given rise . The Encyclop*dists made converts to infidelity among the French , and Frederick of Prussia sought to extend their influence to his countrymen . He failed , because the characters of the two nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same scheme of unbelief were not fitted for both . French skepticism , airy , shallow , and sensual , was not suited to the sobriety and thoughtfulness of the Germans . Equally or more prone than their neighbours to speculate on the highest topics , they could not do without a creed of some kind , hut they wished for one of their own construction , - not dependent on revelation and the authority of Scripture , but worked out by their own minds , - curiously complex and elaborately wrought , - mystical in expression , though skeptical in tendency , - and more a subject of contemplation and argument , than belief . Their skepticism was to be arrayed in all the panoply of positive doctrine , - to be an elaborate scheme , not of doubt , but of absolute denial , - guarded by all the resources of reasoning , and appealing to the pride of human intellect , with all the pomp of demonstration and certainty . Indeed , it is a curious fact , that peculiarities of national character are often more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , matters of taste , forms of government , or domestic customs . Speculative theories result from the aggregate of character , and embcdy the whole mind of the people among whom they rise . From the extent and comparative vagueness of the subject , a greater scope is given for the expression of peculiar traits , which may appear either in the outward garb , the exterior accompaniment , of thought , or in the prevailing tendency of theories towards a certain point , or in the general fashion and arrangement of remark and argument . It is not that human nature , the great object of the study , differs in various countries , for the groundwork , of course , is everywhere the same . But it takes a different developement , has various and often // opposite tendencies , and produces very dissimilar results . We understand perfectly what is meant at the present day by the French , the German , and the English schools of philosophy ; for no translation from the language of one into that of another can be so perfect as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a tang of the cask . There is a vein of truth in the quaint saying , which gives to the English the dominion of the sea , to the French that of the earth , and to the Germans that of the clouds and the air . No matter whether Leibnitz , Kant , or Schelling be taken as the representative of the Teutonic race in speculation . There is a subtilty and over-refinement of thought , a boldness of hypothesis , an excessive display of learning , and haziness of expression , common to them all . Equally apparent in all the English school , in Hobbes , Locke , Hartley , and Reid , are plain common sense , sturdy resistance to all authority in matters of thought , and a disposition to espouse the popular belief , and to reconcile speculation with practice . France boasts of two great names , whose reputation belongs to the earlier period of her scientific history . But the life and situation of Descartes and Malebranche were in many respects peculiar . Individual influences operated upon them , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in common with their countrymen . The remarkable self-education of the former , his foreign travel and various experience of men , and the devotion of far the greater part of his life to physical science , - and the connexion of the latter with the priesthood , together with his enthusiastic religious faith , - prevented either from manifesting , in any great degree , the bias of national thought . Condillac is a far better representative of French philosophy . He has numerous points in common with those of his countrymen and successors , whose philosophical creed differs most widely from his own , and whose habits of thought even appear , at first sight , wholly unlike those of the great master of the Sensualist school . Cousin may be taken as an eminent instance . He is an Eclectic by profession . He has drunk deep at all fountains , - Greek , Scholastic , German , English , - mingling all the different waters for a single draught . Condillac , on the other hand , acknowledges no other master than Locke , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is not a more thorough Frenchman than the great Eclectic . He does not bring out // more strongly , more vividly , the national character . We find in the works of each the same transparency of diction united with real confusion of thought , the same dashing and brilliant , though shallow manner , generalizations equally bold and sweeping , and the same easy and confident tone of expression . The writings of Kant gave utterance to the philosophical tendencies of his country and age , and the speculatists who succeeded him owe much of their success to a similar adoption of the prevailing sentiments of the thinking public into their respective systems . Under the guise of a new faith , they created a philosophy of unbelief ; under a dogmatical mask , they proclaimed what was , at least in reference to revelation , a theory of total skepticism . This fact , though commonly admitted , so far as it relates to the opinions of Fichte , Schelling , and Hegel , is denied in respect to the creator of the transcendental philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of his own country , his system is understood . The speculations of Hume , as he repeatedly admits , gave the first hint for the formation of his new scheme of belief ; " they first interrupted my dogmatical slumber , and gave a wholly different direction to my inquiries in the field of speculative philosophy . " Though commonly understood as aiming at the refutation of his predecessor , he extended , in fact , the sphere of Hume 's skeptical arguments , generalizing them so far that they covered the whole field of knowledge . " I first inquired , whether the objection of Hume might not be universal , and soon found , that the idea of the connexion between cause and effect is far from being the only one by which the understanding , a priori , thinks of the union of things ; but rather , that metaphysics are entirely made up of such conceptions . I endeavoured to ascertain their number , and when , guided by a single principle , I had succeeded in the attempt , I proceeded to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now more than ever convinced , that they were not drawn from experience , as Hume had supposed , but that they came from the pure understanding . " - Prolegomena zu emncr jeden kiinfiigen Met aphysik . Vorrede , p. 13 . That this expansion of Hume 's principles , though conducted on a different method , leads to the same skeptical conclusions that he deduced from them , will be more clearly // seen in the developement of the theory . The impression , that it led to very different results , is founded on the arrogant pretensions of the new school , and the difficulty of analyzing the system far enough to detect its real character . The name of Transcendentalism seems to imply , that it is the scheme of a higher philosophy , rising above the objects of sense , and over-leaping the narrow limits within which the exercise of our faculties had formerly been confined ; when , in fact , its leading doctrine is , that our knowledge is necessarily restricted to objects within the domain of experience , - that all super-sensual ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to cognize them the reason is involved in endless contradictions . We do not state this fact as in itself a reproach upon the speculations of Kant , but only to correct the unfounded notions , which most persons among us entertain , of their character and tendency . All innovations in the theory of science , all new views in philosophy , must stand or fall on their logical and intrinsic merits . There may be a presumption against them from the de* r ading conception which they offer of human nature ; but this is insufficient to justify their immediate rejection . Of two hypotheses , the more ennobling is not necessarily the true one , and too great advantage is given to the skeptic , by a hasty preference awarded to it , before the grounds on which it rests are satisfactorily determined . Our business is with argument , and not with declamation . We obtain a clue to the labyrinth of Kantian metaphysics , as soon as we rightly perceive the point of departure selected for the system , and the new method on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences , logic , mathematics , and metaphysics , distinguished from others by their purely intellectual origin and nature , have advanced with very unequal success . The first came nearly in a perfect form from the hands of its inventor , Aristotle , subsequent inquirers having done little but to pare off its redundancies and improve the modes of its application . The second , rising from small beginnings , has gone steadily on , every step being one of progress , till it now covers an immense domain , while we can hardly imagine any bounds to its future advancement . But the fate of the third of these sciences has been directly the reverse . Though older than the others , it has , from the earliest period of its history , presented little more than an // arena for endless contests , where philosophers might exercise their powers in mock engagements , but where no one could ever gain the least ground , or found a permanent possession upon his victory . For all this ill success , Kant supposed that the method of inquiry was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that sensible things , outward objects , were known to us in all their relations ; - that the nature of mind was unknown , and must be studied through the effects produced within it by impressions from without . Kant reversed this process , and from the centre of the mind itself observed the action of our cognitive faculties on surrounding things . He looked upon the outward world as modified by our own mental constitution , and upon the mind as projecting , so to speak , its own modes of being upon the extcrnal creation . " It sounds strange indeed , at first , but it is not the less certain , when I say , in respect to the original laws of the understanding , that it does not derive them from nature , but imposes them upon nature . " From effecting this change in the mode of inquiry , he compares himself to Copernicus , who , when he found that he could not explain the motions of the heavenly bodies by supposing the firmament to turn round the spectator , tried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stars to be at rest . The obvious consequence of this hypothesis is , that all our knowledge is subjective , that we can never know things as they are , hut only as they appear to us when viewed through a false and deceptive medium . There is a deep gulf between the two sciences of psychology and ontology , and no human efforts can bridge over the chasm . Though the problem which Kant proposes should be solved , - though by a finer analysis we should separate the qualities really belonging to an object from those superadded by our manner of looking at it , - still we could never imagine how it would appear to us , if deprived of these subjective elements . Now our idea of truth is , the conformity of our representations with their archetypes ; and , as confidence in our perceptive faculties is the only way of assuring ourselves that such coincidence exists , the thcory in question is certainly based on the most comprehensive skepticism . It declares , that truth is not only unattamed , but unattainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a web spun by our own fancies on few and thin filaments of absolute being ; take away the imaginary warp , // and the texture can not hold together . ri7he world of things in themselves is incognizable and inconceivable . " - We receive but what we give , And in our life alone does Nature live , Ours is her wedding garment , ours her shroud . " By a full survey of the cognitive faculty of man , Kant sought to ascertain the number and character of those primitive elements of thought , which , being united with , or imposed upon , the impressions received from sense , constitute knowledge , or make experience possible . In this way he sought to finish the work commenced by Locke , - to discover the grounds and origin of human knowledge , and thence to deduce the conditions of its use , and to determine its extent and boundaries . Perhaps we may gain more accurate notions of the execution of this task , by going back for a time to the theory of his predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading doctrine of Locke with the opinions of those philoso* phers , who have most distinguished themselves by the virulence of their attacks upon his system . The proposition , as he states it , that all our knowledge proceeds from sensation and reflection , as it implies that we are not to go behind these faculties in accounting for its origin , is faulty in itself , and at variance with his subsequent assertions . Had he asserted , that all truth is perceived through these faculties , or first known on Gccasion of their exercise , he would not merely have avoided misapprehensions and unfounded complaints , but have stated an undeniable fact , which not the most illiberal of his opponents could ever dream of controverting . The two worlds of matter and mind are the only possible objects of human cognition . We can know the one only through the functions of sense , and the other through the exercise of that faculty , - call it reflection , consciousness , or what you please , - by which we cognize objects of pure thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given idea to sensation or reflection , we leave the matter short ; we have not fully accounted for its origin . An impression is made on the senses , and a perception of the understanding imrnediatcly follows . Is there not an element in it , which is purely intellectual , and as such not caused by the action on the nerves , though this action may mark the occasion , on which it rises ? The eye // gives us a perception of distance , though the impression on the optic nerve certainly transmits to the mind nothing but a sensation of various colors . The judgment immediately adds an estimate of the distance , at which the visible object is placed ; and does this , from long practice , with such facility and quickness , that we confound the act with the sensation , and imagine that we see the separation of bodies in space . Thus we falsely attribute to the sensation more knowledge than really proceeds from it . Still , this is an instance not of original mental action , hut of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is noti ' *ed by Locke , as perfectly consistent with his hypothesis . But are there not other instances , where the tendency to add something to the sensible impression is original , instinctive , and acts with irresistible force ; and where the addition made , or the suhjective element as the Germans call it , is wholly unlike any quality existing in the outward thing , and can in no way be traced to its influence ? To answer this question , we take an example most familiar to metaphysicians . Two events happen in close connexion , and we immediately connect them by the supposed relation of cause and effect . The hand is held near the fire , and the sensation of pain follows . Heat is abstracted from water , and the fluid immediately congeals . Certain solid suhstances are thrown into water , and they straightway dissolve , the fluid remaining transparent as ever ; other substances in powder are thrown in , the medium remains turbid for a time , and then the foreign matter sinks unchanged to the bottom . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose , that the first event is an efficient agent , and of its own power or force produces the second . But the senses tell us nothing of such a connexion . They only inform us of the two events themselves , and that they are contiguous in place and time . Nor can the judgment be attributed to reasoning , or a power of tracing the relations between ideas . For what resemblance is there between the ideas of heat and pain , between those of cold and solidity , between pounded sugar and transparency in water , or pounded alabaster and insolubility ? None at all . Naturally and easily as we make the transition now from one of these related ideas to the other , had we no previous experience , - had we never seen the experiment or heard of its being tried , - we should no more have thought of connecting the two notions , than of tracing // an analogy between a thing a yard long and one that is red . The two ideas are wholly dissimilar . The whole matter may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of two events happening in direct succession , we immediately connect with them the idea of power , or efficient agency . Whence comes this idea ? Certainly not from sensation . We do not perceive the power of fire to melt lead or consume paper , just as we perceive its light and the flickering of its flame , merely by looking at it . We perceive the fact , indeed , that the lead is melted and the paper is dissipated ; but the supposition , that the fire causes this result , goes beyond the perception , is extraneous to it , and , so far as the senses are concerned , is entirely gratuitous . Does it come from reflection then ? This faculty denotes nothing but attention to the subjects of our consciousness , and we surely are not conscious of the powers of material things . Consciousness informs us , indeed , that the idea exists in the mind , but tells us nothing about its origin ; nor can we trace any intellectual process , or train of thought , which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power , therefore , is a fair instance of an element of knowledge , in itself universal and of primary importance , the origin of which can not be ascribed either to external or internal experience . iNow , this instinctive yoking together of two events as cause and effect , or rather the universal judgment closely related to it , " that every thing , which happens must have a cause , " is termed , in the elegant language of Kant , " a synthetical judgment a priori . " Propositions are called analytical or synthetical , according as they are either merely explanatory , and add nothing to the sum of our knowledge , or as they have an amplifying effect , and actually enlarge the given cognition . In other words , the predicate of an analytical judgment affirms nothing but what was already contained in the idea of the subject . This is the nature of a complete or partial definition . Facts which we learn from experience are instances of synthetical judgments , the predicate going beyond the subject , and thus making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition we have been considering at such length is evidently synthetical , for there is nothing in the very conception or idea of one event to create a necessity of its being preceded or followed by another of a different character . It is also called a judgment // a priori , because , as we have seen , it is not , and it can not be , derived from experience . Then what is its real origin ? How do we obtain it ? This is Hume*s problem . Make the question universal , state it in the broadest possible form , and we have the great problem of the transcendental philosophy " How are synthetical judgments a priori possible ? " The expression is not remarkable for perspicuity , but the meaning is this ; How is it , that , independent of experience , we are able to know any thing with absolute certainty ? To the consideration of this question , the " Critique of Pure Reason is exclusively devoted . We first seek for a criterion , by which we may securely distinguish a priori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds such a test in the characteristics of universality and strict necessity , neither of which can be attached to any propositions of empirical origin . Human experience is never complete , - never exhausts the possible variety of cases ; its judgments , therefore , are never universally true or demonstratively certain but , founded on an inductive process , they are valid so far as our observation has extended . The contrary is always possible and conceivable . Not so with all the propositions of mathematics , with some axioms in physics , and with many other truths , that are implied i1i all the forms of speculative knowledge . These carry their own evidence along with them , the denial of them involving a contradiction or absurdity , and no case being supposable where absolute and universal certainty would fail to attend them . Therefore they are not derived from experience , and the question recurs with regard to their origin , Whence does the mind obtain them ? Kant defies the world to give any other answer to this query , than that which we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are forms of the mind itself , - the colored medium through which we look out upon the universe of cognizable things . The material world is deaf and dumb to such truths . The mind does not derive them from without , but from its own stores , and by its own inborn energy imposes them as necessary and immutable laws upon the outward universe . Our perceptive faculties have a peculiar organization , and can act only within welldefined limits . Therefore we know a priori , that the information received through the senses must conform to this // organization , and receive certain changes from the passages , through which it is transmitted . In what manner ohjects would appear to beings of a different constitution and nature from ourselves , we can not even conjecture . But we know how they must appear to us , and therefore , prior to experience , we can determine some particulars in relation to them with absolute certainty . To inquire into the actual constitution of things , - their real nature , as distinct from the appearances which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - is a hopeless endeavour . It is seeking to know , without using the only means of knowledge . It is a gross error , though a natural one , to consider our own modes of knowing as the modes of being inherent in outward things ; to give objective validity to subjective laws . The theory is certainly ingenious and plausible , though it rests on a paradox . Empirical propositions , to which we give only a limited comprehension and a qualified assent , are not controverted . Universal and absolute convictions , in the reference which we instinctively make of them , are necessarily false . The non-existence of qualities is inferred from our inability to conceive of their non-existence ; they belong only to the mind , because we can not even imagine their annihilation as attributes of things without us . Without questioning the reality of any " anticipated " knowledge , we inquire only into the sufficiency of those criteria , by which Kant seeks to distinguish it from truths empirically known . That in the information received through the action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that can not be got rid of , is a fact which betrays rather the limitation of our capacities , than the existence of a different and higher source of knowledge . The necessity in question may be only of a negative character , and then the truth which it characterizes may be of empirical origin . Some objects can be known only under certain relations ; some qualities can not , in our conceptions , be abstracted from the substance in which they inhere . Enlarged means of experience , - the possession of an additional sense , for instance , - might do away with these impossibilities . The necessary character of the cognitions in such case , results rather from the limitations of experience , than from the existence of a higher faculty of knowing . But without insisting on the insufficiency of these tests , // we remark further a monstrous gap in the reasoning adopted by Kant . From the necessary and universal recognition of an object or quality , he infers , that it can not be objectively real . Thus he assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingent , limited , and relative knowledge , but that it is the only trustworthy means of cognition . Whatever is known a priori , on his system , must be illusive ; it is subjective , or derived only from our own modes of being and knowing , though always falsely referred to things as they exist . In this way it is maintained , without the slightest proof , and in contradiction to an irresistible impulse of belief , that there is no harmony between our laws of thought and the real constitution of objects . The consciousness of necessity , which accompanies certain judgments , is held to prove their origin a priori ; and from this last fact is inferred their entire want of foundation in the absolute nature of things . We may admit the justice of the first inference , but wholly deny that of the second , which would be more properly styled a mere conjecture . For the whole course of Kant 's arguments leads to the conclusion , that , from the constitution of a something in our conceptions , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something without us . Yet , in direct opposition to this canon , from the a priori origin of our knowledge of a quality , he deduces the non-existence of that quality in the outward world . That is , he admits the rule , when it xvorks in favor of his system , hut repudiates it , when it makes against him . It is a good principle , when it leads to skepticism ; it is invalid , when it tends to restore confrdence in the fidelity of our representative ideas . Few words will suffice to apply these principles of the Transcendental philosophy to an explanation of the intellectual processes in the acquisition of knowledge . It is apparent from what has already been said , that each cognitive faculty has two functions ; - the one , receptivity , or the power of receiving impressions from without , the other , spontaneity , or the power of reacting upon and modifying these impressions . The first of these faculties , that of sense ( sinnlichkeit ) , in which spontaneity exists in the lowest degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our knowledge . Two intuitions , those of space and time , are found to possess the marks of universality and necessity , and therefore have an a priori origin , and no objective reality , // or foundation in the real nature of things . Space is no empirical conception , derived from external experience , but the necessary prerequisite , or condition , of our ability to imagine any thing as existing out of our own minds . If from our conception of a material substance , we abstract every thing which is known empirically , as its color , hardness , weight , impenetrability , &amp;c. , still the space remains , which the body had occupied , as something that can not be left out . We can imagine a void space , or one in which 1 ) 0 substance is to be found , but we can form no idea of body as existing otherwise than in space . Again , space is an endless magnitude , no limits to it being conceivable ; and it is essentially one , for though we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one and the same all-comprehending extension . Similar arguments willbe found to be applicable to our idea of time . On the subjective character of these two intuitions depends the possibility of the whole science of mathematics ; our absolute conviction of geometrical truths resting on the pure representation of space , while arithmetic derives its certainty from the " anticipated " idea of time . We certainly have neither timnenor space to consider the argument more particularly , but only to inquire , how far the theory , as thus explained , tends to the refutation of skepticism . To the first bewildered apprehensions of the student , it xvould seem to be difficult to frame a system , which should strike more effectually at the foundations of all belief . By denying the reality of space , " the great globe itself , with all that it inherit , " passes away like a dream . By asserting that time does not exist out of our own fancies , memory appears a cheat , existence is contracted to a point , and the whole history of experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing is there to come , and nothing post ; But an eternal NOW does ever last " To assert , that these laws of thought have a subjective reality , sufficient for our purposes , and are rightly applicable to the phenomenal world , - the only one with which we are acquainted or have any concern , - is a contemptible evasion . The most audacious skeptic never denied , that we believe in the existence of matter and in the succession of events in time , or that this belief is imperative and necessary . At the same time , he maintains that it is illusive , and has no founda // tion in the real nature of things . To go farther than this , would be the part , not of an infidel , but of a madman . It is true , that Kant professes to repudiate Berkiejanism , and will not admit that his own system leads to any similar result . He maintains the existence of the outward world , though he denies the reality of that which , by his own principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The originality , at least , of a system , that couples the refutation of idealism with a denial of the objectivity of space , can not be disputed . External nature has a being independent of our ideas , though the manner of that being transcends the limits of all thought . Kant contented himself at first with a simple protest against the ideal theory ; but , when his opponents charged him with denying in words what was an unavoidable inference from his own system , in the second edition of the " Critique " he inserted a proof of the existence of matter . Of the validity of this proof , we say nothing , for we do not profess to understand it , and have great doubts whether the author understood it himself . It is an excrescence on the system , violating its unity , and contradicting what must be inferred from his doctrines as a whole . The intuitions of sense form the groundwork of our cognitions , but in themselves are unformed and incomplete . Before they constitute knowledge , they must become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that of sense , as its operations are independent of space and time . The latter represents the matter of things , as it is affected by them ; the former , exercising spontaneity in a higher degree , collects the variety of these materials into a whole . What the intuitions of space and time are to the functions of sense , the categories are to the understanding . They are forms of thought , under which intuitions are necessarily taken in , or subsumed , and thereby become conceptions , the legitimate products of the understanding . They are twelve in number , divided into four equal classes ; those of quantity , quality , relation , and modality . The nomenclature is obviously borrowed from that of the logician , and thus indicates the source of the theory , and the grounds on which it rests . Kant was early struck with the similarity between the first principles of logic and the necessary laws , to which , in an ontological point of view , all the objects of our perceptions appear to be subjected . Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical identity of the two classes ? Every act of reasoning , considered abstractly , takes place under certain forms or laws , which have undoubted authority , and the number and reality of which may be determined with the utmost precision . Might not these forms be identical with the laws , which we fancy are drawn from the observation of nature , but which , on this hypothesis , must he considered as imposed on nature by our own intellectual activity ? Kant answers this question in the affirmative , and , having remodelled and completed to his own satisfaction the table of categories , claims to have resolved by their means the problem respecting the possibility of a priori knowledge in the department of physics . To every conception or judgment that forms a part of our knowledge are applied at least four categories , taken respectively from the four classes into which these forms of thought have been divided . In other words , we must think of the object , in the first place , as being either one , many , or all ; secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as substance or accident , cause or effect , or as placed in reciprocity with something else by the law of action and reaction ; finally , as possible or impossible , existent or nonexistent , necessary or contingent . The categories are necessary conditions of thinking upon any object , but in themselves they do not enable us to know the object . To accomplish this purpose , real intuitions must be given , to which the categories may be referred ; and since all intuitions come from sense , the office of the understanding extends only to sensible things . Beyond the operations of the senses , or the territory of experience , nothing is cognizable . This remark applies even to our own nature . Pure consciousness gives us assurance , that we exist ; but , since there is no intuition of this fact , and it is thought upon only by the spontaneity of the understanding , so our own being can not be known in itself , but only the manner of that being . Empirical consciousness of changes in our internal condition must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , the functions of the understanding are empirical , and not transcendental ; they refer to objects as phenomena , and not as things in themselves . Notwithstanding this necessary limitation of our capacities to a knowledge of objects within the domain of experience , the mind constantly strives to rise above the sphere of the senses , // and , as in the metaphysical systems of the older philosophy , fashions for itself a science of things in themselves , which are supersensual and unconditioned . An analysis of our intellectual faculties is incomplete , if it does not account for this effort , if it does not develope some deep-seated cause , which constantly impels us to a search after what is absolute and unlimited , and gives to the supposed knowledge of it a deceptive appearance of validity . Kant finds such a cause in the third cognitive faculty of man , denominated par excellence the Reason , - spontaneity raised to the highest degree , - the chief function of which is to support this unceasing but vain endeavour . As the power of sense has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason has its ideas , created by adding to conceptions elaborated by the next lower faculty a notion of the infinite and the absolute . They are three in number ; the idea of the absolute unity of the thinking subject , which is the aim of rational psychology ; the idea of the absolute totality of phenomena , the universe , which forms the purpose of rational cosmology ; finally , the idea of absolute reality , the highest condition of all things , the first cause , which is the object of rational theology . In other words , by a necessary impulse of our nature we must assume the unity of the soul , the existence of the universe , and the reality of a first cause . But these ideas enter not the field of positive knowledge . They constitute the possibility of metaphysics as an idea , but not as actual science . No proof of their objective validity can be furnished , for it is their essence not to he referred to corresponding objects cognizable through sense ; they are derived subjectively from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they answer at least a regulative purpose . They urge our empirical inquiries onward to higher and nobler ends , than would otherwise be pursued ; and , though the objects themselves are unattainable , the effort serves to give greater comparative unity and completeness to our system of knowledge . The result of the theory may be given in Kant 's own words . " All knowledge of things derived solely from the pure understanding , or from pure reason , is nothing hut empty show ; and truth is to be found only through experience. ** He expressly denies the validity of the a priori argument for the freedom of the will , the immortality of the soul , arid the existence of a God ; and rebukes the arrogance of the schools // for assuming to themselves higher grounds of conviction than are open to the vulgar . His aim is , not merely to show the futility of the proofs already advanced in support of these great doctrines , but to demonstrate the absolute impracticability of the attempt to establish them under any circumstances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcend the limits of possible inquiry , erecting systems and almost in the same breath pulling them down again ; because urged on by an irresistible impulse , that prevents it from being taught wisdom by repeated failures , and from acknowledging that it has overtasked its powers and mistaken its prerogatives . The arguments relating to these sublime doctrines are summed up on either side , and found to be equally irrefutable , and therefore equally false . Then it is vain to argue either for or against them ; the supporter and the assailant alike are silenced . Such a result of metaphysical inquiry as this , reminds one of Madame de Stai*l 's remark on former skeptical systems that " they changed the light of knowledge into a devouring flame ; and Philosophy , like an enraged magician , fired the palace on which she had lavished all the prodigies of her skill . " It should be observed , however , that Kant himself , alarmed by the sweeping skepticism of these conclusions , in his " Critique of Practical Reason , " subsequently published , labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in our moral nature what the speculative reason can not afford , - a foundation for the belief in things unseen and eternal . The attempt forms a virtual acknowledgment of the necessity of those doctrines , which he had previously refused to legitimate ; they are introduced into the field of ethics as postulates , without which moral phenomena remain inexplicable . Our outline of this celebrated system is necessarily very imperfect , but it may serve to correct some unfounded notions of its character and tendency . The authority of Kant as a teacher of opinions , even in his nmttive country , has passed away ; and the result has come far short of justifying his boast , that he had given a new and sure basis to mental science , and fixed the principles and method of its progress . Speculation has broken the trammels , with which he would have limited its aberrations , and has pursued a course more erratic than ever . Opinions have varied as widely in the mass , and fluctuated as rapidly in the individual , as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding hesitancy and confusion , and placing metaphysics on the same stable foundation with the other abstract sciences . But the indirect influences of his writings may be distinctly traced in the works of nearly all the speculatists , who have succeeded him , not only in Germany , but in France and England . While his innovations in the nomenclature have changed the whole garb of philosophy , and rendered the study of systems more abstruse , fatiguing , and repulsive , it must be confessed , that they have also removed some causes of ambiguity and mistake , and have poiiited out the path for effecting a more systematic and beneficial reform . His example has also given a fresher impulse to the spirit of inquiry , increased the eagerness for the formation of new systems , and carried boldness of theorizing on all topics far beyond its ancient limits . His great demerit consists , in having effectually , though perhaps not intentionally , served the cause of infidelity , while professing to repair and extend the defences of belief . Had the real character of his doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good or evil , could not have reached so far . But his disciples groped about in the intricacies of a system , which they could not fully master , and embraced opinions , of the nature and tendency of which they had but a blind conception . Thus , they were fairly enlisted on the side of skepticism , before they had thought of quitting the banners of faith . Once engaged in the work , they felt only the desire of surpassing their instructer in dogmatism of manner , rashness in forming novel hypotheses , and general license of speculation on the most sacred subjects . As his theory extended over the whole territory of knowledge , almost every science has in turn been infected with the wild and crude imaginings of his followers . It is this general effervescence of thought and reasoning , which has brought a reproach on the very name of philosophy , and , through the mournful perversion of terms which it has occasioned , has given too good cause for regarding a system of philosophical radicalism as a mere cover for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for considering a philosophical religion as atheism itself . Under such circumstances , we can hardly wonder , that many reflecting persons have conceived a distrust of the consequences of such free inquiry , and do not suppress either alarm or contempt at the bare mention of German metaphysics.
