txt WE are glad to see the Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge turning their attention to subjects connected with the imagination an ( l the taste . One of the greatest evils of the Lyceum System has been , that science , subjects involving facts , experiments , and demonstrations , have been aftended to almost exclusively , from the very nature of the case . But the nature of the case nee ( l not always remain , as it was at first ; nor has it so remained . The public may have become tired of one class of subjects , and the lapse of time may have fitted them to receive another and higher class . The opposite character and subjects of the two courses of Lectures that will occupy the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge for the present season-we mean those of Professor Tickrior and Professor Farrar ,  --  without suggesting any comparison , may fbrnish the hint to a discussion of the intellectual tendencies of modern society . The intellectual signs of the times are not better illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those of Science . It becomes , therefore , a curious and interesting question , whether the l ) resent condition of Learning and of Society is favorable to the development of high poetic talent ? Are we to see no more Iliads or // Divina Comedias ? Are we to have no more Shakspeares , or Chaucers , or Miltons ? Will the great masters in the Italian never be equaled ? Whatever chances may be claimed for the spontaneous growth of genius in all ages , countries and states of society , it is pretty clear that this very diffusion of knowledge , together with the present condition and character of society , is far from being favorable to the development of high poetic talent . If we go back to those periods when the great poets of any country lived and wrote , we shall find , in every instance , the whole constitution and appearance of societ.y so entirely different from any thing , which we see in modern times , that , if it were not for some universal characteristics in our nature , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . In a comparatively rude and uncivilized state of society , every feeling and passion is in the full vigor of early development : the face of nature leaves upon the imagination impressions that are more vivid , in proportion as there are fewer thoughts and associations in the mind , to call off its attention in a thousand different directions . There is an . intermediate grade , between absolute barbarism and the refinements of civilized life , in which the senses and the intellect are more open to strong and active influences . Poetry , in. such a period , will at least be vigorous and striking in its imagery ; for it is a period when the great common mind seems , as it were , to wake out of a slumber , and not yet to be sated with the view of objects that meet the sight . Moreover , in such a transition state of society , traits of character are more strongly marked ; for the refinements of artificial society and the manners of social intercourse have not yet come in , to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to throw over all things . a uniform appearance , suppressing the bolder and more prominent features of the scene . In such ages , too , there is generally little learning and still less education ; but when the rare seed is sown , it falls upon a soil that is more luxuriant , in proportion as it has been hitherto uncultivated . But , in modern times , the a ( lvantages of learning are offered to all ; and it appears to be " the evident tendency of all literature , to generalize and to dissipate character , by giving to all men the same education and the same common stock of ideas . " The great Poets , , who lived in such states of society  --  and certainly all the greatest poets , the world has ever seen , appeared long before their respective nations had reached their present cultivation ,  --  enjoyed this keen perception of the beauties of nature , and of all that is powerful and captivating in the manifestations of character . They wrote , and in many cases entirely occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not their successors excite in us the same kind and degree of interest , when they write under the influence of muodermi feelings ? - for it would seem that they must conic home to us more nearly . One reason seems to be , that the works of a modern poet do not bear that freshness , vigor , and originality ; because we see that the Poet is a person of the same habi.ts and pursuits as our own ; that he is subject to the same influences and the same manners . He seems to bear the same relation to others , that we bear to our neighbors ; acting , thinking , and feeling precisely as we should expect . But are not the modern poets trtie to nature , as well as the great masters of the art ? IJn* VOL . V. // doubtedly in most cases they are . But the nature , to which the great poets are true , is that which embraces the deep , and powerful , and immutable , in the attributes of human character ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought and feeling . The modern poet may occasionally get a glimpse of this suhlime and universal nature , though very rarely ; and he is soon driven back from the height to which he has risen , by the withering influence of fashion , and custom , and prejudice , until his sentiments are often the mere echo of what is transitory and fluctuating . But why can he not divest himself of these trammels ? He can not do so entirely , hecause his whole education and all the generalizing influences of an extensive literature forbid it . Accordingly , it has been said by a critic that Shakspeare will be read as long as the English language shall endure ; while no one can predict that many modern poets will be remembered half a century longer ; for he is the poet of man 's essential and universal nature , while they are the poets of the nature of mere fashion . But where are Byron , and Scott , arid G6the , and all the other modern poets ? They have written what we are wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earlier and less civilized times ? Their poetry is inferior , in one sense ; and that is , as a part is inferior to the whole . By this , it is not meant to compare their respective bulks of poetry-for a single ode may contain more than whole volumes ; but that the poetry of modern writers , instead of being that great mirror , in which the universal traits of man are seen reflected , is but the portraiture of individual characteristics and passions . Byron , for instance , does not rise to that height whence he can look down on the whole human race . He is one who stands in the crowd , though aloof and alone  --  but yet among the crowd , if not of them  --  and pours , through the focus of some single passion , the burning and concentrated feelings of his own individual bosom . This is the character of almost all modern poetry . It is not universal feeling , embracing and embraced by the universal heart of man ; it is individual feeling , dwelling upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the character of the poet upon his works , than is needful or useful-more , that is , of his mere character as an individual  --  and overlooking , in this kind of " Selfish System " of poetry , the great and permanent characteristics of humanity . Gothe , indeed , has risen above a great deal of this , and has seemed to take hold of mighty attributes and principles . But then he is mystical , shadowy , and far from being level to universal comprehension ; so that his own countrymen do not always understand him , and when they do , we are not aware that they always believe him . Besides , we doubt if any one , German or foreigner , can claim for him that reaching insight into the spiritual depths of man 's nature , which is exhibited by Sophocles or by Shakspeare , and which is instantly felt by all mankind , to be unerringly true ; nor can he be said to have equaled the English poet in knowledge of man , as he is in the actual world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears to the universe , and which stretch far into the spiritual world , up to the throne of God . The poetic talent , then , if there is any truth in these observations , // is , in its highest function and chief excellence , becoming more and more rare in modern times , from the generalizing and equalizing influences of education and social refinement . But , why should there not arise ,  --  among some nation not yet civilized , but at the period of that transition state from barbarism to cultivation which has been supposed favorable to the devolopment of this talent in its highest form and vigor ,  --  a poet of equal power with the great masters of times past ? Such might be the case , if the circumstances were the same . But civilization and refinement do not now gradually spring up in barbarous countries , and gradually leaven the whole mass of society , as they did in the nations of antiquity , or during the middle ages of Europe . They come now to the shores of uncivilized countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colony is planted  --  the foreigner crowds upon the native  --  the old race disappears before the new ; and thus the whole people are changed , without that gradual development of peculiar and national characteristics , as well as of the greater attributes of human nature , during which materials for a high poetry are most abundant . But even if we are to have no more poets like those who have been , they are enough for one world ; they are enough for the countless generations who shall fill our places when we are gone , as they have been for all who preceded us ; and so long as the present or any thing like the present intellectual dynasty of the world shall remain , they will fill that void in man s na* ture , which is ever craving after the lofty , the sublime , and the beautiful . As Mr. Coleridge has said of Homer , they stand aloof and alone , each in his proper niche , " on the Hill of Parnassus , where perhaps it is not possible now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us turn now to the other illustration of the intellectual tendencies of the age ,  --  Science . How is it with this branch of human learning ? Has it , like poetry , started at once almost into the fulness , vigor , and beauty of maturity , and reached a point beyond which it is not likely to pass ? Is there reason to believe that the extension of civilization , and the multiplication of those relations , which bind men together in society , will be unfavorable to its further advancement ? These are questions , which , of course , are to be answered in the negative ; and which meet the reason for such an answer in the very nature of science itself . In the first place , as a branch of human learning , its cultivation depends upon the reasoning faculty ; and this faculty is always increasing in strength , in proportion to its exercise . In the second place , science has for its ultimate object the relief of the wants and the melioration of the physical condition of mankind . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely be left to rest ; since the wants of men will always continue to make demands upon it ; and , in proportion as the world becomes filled , and as men invent for themselves those constantly multiplying wants which are inseparable from human society , in the same proportion , the occasions for scientific research will be increased . Finally , science depends much , for its growth , on the lapse of time . Accordingly , as age after age passes away in the continued observation and study of nature , observations and experiments are multiplied ; new qualities are developed , new principles discovered ; old theories are rejected ; and , what is of great importance , the diffusion of knowledge increases the number of // those , who are able to test the claims of any new theory ; so that the concentrated light of thousands of minds is poured upon it , either to elicit new truths , or to expose its native errors . It is very true that many branches of discovery seem to be entirely filled up , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of the exact sciences . But we surely can not suppose that there are no more discoveries to be made , or that the physical condition of man has been improved as far as it may be . The tendency , then , of modern intellect , is to that class of ideas which are addressed to the reason ; while , as the increase of civilization and the diffusion of knowledge advance , the imagination loses its vigor and beauty . As the work of observation and discovery goes on , the materials for science are multiplied , while those for poetry are diminished ; because poetry , in all that regards or springs out of the natural world , is conversant with nature , as it is presented through the delusions of the senses , while science aims to ascertain its true characteristics , and to dispel all delusion whatsoever . On many accounts , we have doubtless reason to be thankful that subjects connected with science do occupy so large a portion of the aggregate attention of mankind ; for , undoubtedly , its perfection tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can carry our thoughts forward to the period when the world shall have become old and ripe , when every element in nature shall have undergone investigation , when all branches of natural science have been brought to perfection , and the great globe itself " has been thoroughly searched and known , we can readily conceive , from what has already been done , that poverty and disease , and the " thousand ills that flesh is heir to , " will have but a feeble dominion over man ; and that the generations of the earth will pass away , by the gradual cessation of the functions of life which is consequent upon old age , rather than by desolating pestilences or acute diseases . It is , also , in some measure , true , that the moral and physical conditions of society are intimately connected ; and we have reason to believe that they will continue to improve by a reciprocal action upon each other . But great and desirable as these things may be , still there are evils which may *grow out of this exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are allied to the imagination and the taste ; we may come to regard those branches of learning that are addressed to our moral and spiritual natures , as of secondary importance , when compared with those , which advance our physical condition . In such case , the moral and physical cultivations of society will no longer keep pace with each other . It is very true that the sciences have great influence in refining and sharpening the intellectual powers of those who cultivate them . But then they are and always will be regarded , by the mass of mankind , as being merely subservient to the purpose of increasing their physical comforts . " Utility " is their cry ; and , accordingly , the man of science makes utility the end of his studies and inquiries . The individual student , too , in this kind of knowledge , is apt to acquire a narrowness of mind , by dwelling too much on minute objects . He goes on , from day to day , searching out the nature of a mineral or the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried in the minutia3 of nature , he forgets that the system of // things has wider relations between its parts than those which he has made the objects of his study . The mind may thus become wedded to littleness , while great conceptions are beyond its grasp . This effect has been well described by a modern poet . Inquire of ancient wisdom ; go , demand Of mighty Nature , if t was ever meant That we should pry far off , yet be unraised ; That we should pore , and dwindle as we pore ; Viewing all objects unremittingly In disconnection , dead and spiritlessAnd , still dividing , and dividing still , Break down all grandeur ; still unsatisfied With the perverse attempt , while littleness May become more little ; waging thus An impious warfare with the very life Of our own souls. * We repeat , therefore , that we are glad to see other subjects brought before the public , belonging to the province of taste , by those who furnish these intellectual entertainments ; and we wish to say a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakspeare . Much as Shakspeare is read , and studied , and criticised , we can not help wishing that he were read more . Much as we value the current literature of the day , when we see the annuals that lie on the centre-tables , and the novels that are put up in the book-cases , we can not help wondering why parents do not oftener put Shakspeare into the hands of a son or a daughter , or have him oftener in their own . Do we want the delights of fiction , and its instructive delineations of character ? Where can they be found in such abundance and such variety as in Shakspeare ? As we approach the charmed circle , where he creates and multiplies around him the beings of that world of his , so perfect in itself so varying and yet so permanent , so full of all which we see around us in life , and of all which we do not see , but which we know to be there ,  --  how do they crowd upon us in all the distinctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hail them , as they sweep by us , as if they were not creations of the mind , but actual and living beings ! The old philosophy of the schools taught that all created things had their abstract corresponding types in the all-embracing mind of the Creator , each of which was the representative of all similar created things . In the relation of Shakspeare to human nature , this fanciful idea may be applied without fiction ; for the beings in the creating circle of his imagination are the types and ideas of all human kind . Within that charmed circle , is the gentle and devoted Juliet , and there is the human and inhuman monster , Caliban ; there are the Weird Sisters , ugly , revolting shapes , and the airy and graceful Fairies ; there is the tender and moralizing Hamlet , the youth of contemplation , and there is the bold and impatient Hotspur , the youth of high and daring action ; there is the sincere and faithful Horatio , and there is the hellishly false and hollow Jago . Wolsey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hurled into the depths that yawn beneath , is in bold contrast with the young monarch , Harry the fifth , with " the world all before him . " The crazed and // broken-hearted Ophelia stands beside the fortunate , the wise , and happy Portia . All passions that agitate the human breast , all feelings that stir within the human heart , have there a fit representation and portraiture . All men are there ; and there , too , as in a mirror reflecting creation as well as man , are the grandeur and the loveliness , the awful power and the gentle breathings of nature . Why did Shakspeare know how to exhihit man under such varieties , so accurately and consistently ? Why should he , above all other men , be so happy in representing the various characters produced by different climates , institutions , manners , and peculiar circumstances ? What has enabled him to transport us so entirely to those regions and those scenes , whither his imagination has taken her flight ? He never traveled into foreign countries ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms in which human nature reveals itself . He lived , for the greater part of his life , and all the while that he was writing his plays , in the heart of London ; closed up within the narrow walls and smoky atmosphere of a great city , where the exterior of things wears and always must wear a peculiar , uniform , and unbroken appearance. , save to him who looks upon it with an eye of more than ordinary penetration . Nor was Shakspeare a learned man ; that is , as other men are learned-in books . Where , then , did he get this wonderful knowledge of man ? The truth is , he received it from a source whence he drew all his other treasures . It made a part of his poetical inspiration ; it came to him by intuition ; it was breathed into his mind , by the spirit of wisdom itself . Undoubtedly , he observed such men as fell under his notice , with a keen and searching eye . But we can not suppose him to have relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth of his own spirit , that knowledge which other men acquire partially , by piece-meal , and through the tedious and costly means of learning and experience . His knowledge was accurate , it could not be mistaken , for it laid hold of and comprehended the first and eternal principles of man 's nature . G.@@183068578.txt To this repetition of a title-page , we add an explanatory sentence .. For the benefit of some , into whose hand our Magazine may fall , and who may not know the fact , it should be stated distinctly , that a weekly Lecture is held on Thursdays , at the First'Church in Boston , at which the ministers of the Boston Association officiate , ordinarily , in alphabetical succession . With the sermon before us , we can find but one fault , and that we can express in four words : - i* 55 TOO SHORT . When it is perceived , as it is by every reader , that the subject , in itself , without the too common aid of tiresome amplification , is pregnant with interesting historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also perceived that the text is one of the most poetical and appropriate that // can be found in the scriptures , to raise the spirit of eloquence , to inspire the imagination with thoughts unlimited even by the boundaries of the past , to " transport us beyond the ignorant present , " and make us " feel now the future in the instant , " - we can hardly pardon the delicate ,  --  we had almost said , the fastidious-brevity of the discourse . To make our readers sensible of the justness of this criticism , as well as to show our own thankfulness for whatever the author is induced to present to the public through the press , we shall offer no extract from his present production , but ( begging j ) ardon of the publisher for the liberty we use ) transfer it entire to our pages . here it is Jon iv . 13 . Then a spirit pasred before my face . What is the past , but a spirit , a shade , an image , like that which Eliphaz the Temanite saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , from which the life has departed . We call it up as from the dead . It flits before the fancy like one of those dim ghosts , that peopled the under-world both of Grecian and Hebre* ' poetry , arid that present themselves to us again in the melancholy mythology of the North , rohed in grey mists and faint meteors ; in either case possessing no part of their former strength , and uttering their speech in the sigh of the night-wind or a whisper out of the dust . My brethren of this association seem to have assie ned me the task of summoning forth such a shade , when they have hidden me go hack atmostto the time , when this land was first peopled hy Christian men ; and to describe the origin and fortune of a Lecture which was once thought of the utmost importance to the church and the state , hut which we are left to support with thankless pains , comforted indeed hy the sympathies of one another , hut little cheered hy the public at large . Two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut not into the utter forgetfulness , in which most of the generations of men lie buried ,  --  are required to gather a few of their faded recollections , a few semhlances of the great life that once thrilled through them , as if into an empty , air-drawn figure . We are to qoestion it , and it is to admonish us . And if the time that has elapsed since our lecture s founded glides before us like a spirit , when brought under the wand of historical invocation ,  --  what is the lecture itself , on the account of which I am hidden to invoke and interrogate it , hut a shadow of what it once was , a sort of spectral impersonation of former influence and honor One feels as if he were dealing with scarcely a real subject ; as if he were asking of one phantom to tell him of another ; as if he were surrounded hut hy aged recollections , and could he responded to hut by signs and echoes . He might wish to how his head silently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up ; or he ready to tremble like Job 's friend in the text , as the indistinct vision passes by him . He will he thought reasonable , at least , in regretting that he has not the necromantic skill of some , to bring the absent and forgotten before your eyes , and to speak to you as with a voice from the land where all past things are gathered darkly to their repose . For his own part , be has looked long and intently after what might be disclosed to him , but with so little success as to be almost ashamed to tell what he has *een . " It stood still , but he could not discern the form thereof . " There is an obscurity hanging over the early years of the Thursday Lectureor , the Fifth-day Lecture , as it was anciently called ,  --  which it is difficult to account for , and which the most diligent search that I could make has been unable to clear away . It is well known that the institution of it is dated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as teacher over the church , that was then the only one , in this town . The testimony to this point is of the most satisfactory kind . Governor Winthrop tells us , in his Journal that on the 17th of September , 1633 , " the Governor and Council met at Boston , and called the ministers and elders of all the churches to consider about Mr. Cotton his sitting down . He was desired to divers places , and those who came with him desired he might sit down where they might keep store of cattle ; hut it was agreed , by full consent , that the fittest place for him was Boston ; and that ( keeping a lecture ) he should have some maintenance out of the treasury . " The fittest place was indeed Boston , that appears to have received its name out of compliment to him ,  --  while he was yet preaching at Boston in Lincoloshire those doctrines , that brought him into question with the high commission court , and compelled him to fly for his safety , disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . He w // accounted the ablest man on this side of the sea , and his lecture rose at once into an object of deep and general concern . On the very first month of its establishment an order of court was passed , prescribing the hour at which it should be attended , one o'clock in the afternoon . The order , however , could not have remained long in force , and mid-day became the time , when this important service , by which the magistrates were instructed , and the churches advised , and the people warned , was performed . Its influence was felt in the conferences of ecclesiastics , and at the council board of state . It exerted its various power upon the customs and even the dress of that generation , upon the order of discipline , the tenets of faith , and the laws of the land . Such was the well-known efficiency of our Lecture , while it was yet young in its work , addressing itself to a community , that was growing indeed , hut still thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of its further celebrity and spread , I will ask you to stop for a moment , and look behind the facts that have been already mentioned and are generally understood , to consider a circumstance even earlier than any that has been named ; one that is on every account worthy to be mentioned in this connexion , and the rather as it wears an air of novelty . The Thursday Lecture does not only carry us back to the days of the first settlement of the country , hut to the native land of our forefathers . it is connected with the old world , as well as with old times . It was preached in the English Boston by the same fervent ministry that brought it toours . We can follow it from the fens of the Witham to the New-England coast . The grandson of Mr. Cotton assures us , that his famous ancestor kept " his ordinary Lecture every Thursday , " while he was under the directions of the Bishop of Lincoln , and in friendship with the noble Earl of the same title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the eloquent voice might have been heard many and many a time rolling among the stately Gothic arches of St. Butolph 's , which came here to fill a poor meeting-house , havi'ng nothing better than mud for its walls and straw for its roof ; and that under one of the loftiest cathedral towers in Europe , lifting itself up as the pride of the surrounding'country , and a landmark to them that are afar off on the sea , this very institution had its origin , which has long shown not even the vestiges of its ancient renown , but is dying , under our eyes and hands , a lingering death . I imagine it not only associating the'present with a remote age , but bringing together the opposite shores of the Ath ntic " Ocean . I hear the heavy bell calling John Cotton 's hearers together in prelatical England ; and the knell falls faintly around me of the intervening generations that have gone away , one after another , into silence . In returning from this digression , which some may think full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lecture among ourselves , the next fact that meets us is one that does not partake at all of the fanciful . it is the substantial reality of a market , set up now for the first time in this place . On the 4th of March , 1634 , as Governor Winthrop informs us , " By order of court a mercate was erected at Boston , to be kept upon Thursday the 5th day of the week , being the lecture day . " And shortly afterwards he adds , that " at the lecture at Boston , a question was propounded about veils . Mr. Cotton concluded , that where ( by the custom of the place ) they were not a sign of the woman 's subjection , they were not commanded by the apostle . Mr. Endicott opposed , and did maintain it by the general arguments brought by the apostle . After some debate , the Governor , perceiving it to grow to some earnestness , interposed , and so it brake off . ' * it is curious to compare these two mementos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public convenience , and the flimsy discussion on female attire between the austerest of governors ,  --  for a governor was disputant as well as umpire ,  --  and the gravest of divines . Both indicate the character of the time its deficiency in what seems to us indispensable , and its zealousness on what seems to us indifferent . They could neither of them be passed over in the sketch which is now presenting ; for there is but one more circumstance of similar antiquity to be mentioned . it is furnished by the unprinted records of this church , and relates in the most illegible of hands a fact of which it is impossible to mistake the interpretation ; that some exconimunicated person , whose name I will not be the first to disturb in its long sleep , was compelled to confess , among other misdemeanors , his " sometimes forsakinc the Lecture , " for the sake of indulging in his vices ; -  --  a simple allusion , but one that shows distinctly enough the reverence in which the service thus " forsaken " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it to be completed ; and a few words will describe the aspect which it now wore . it was a meeting of all that claimed // or deserved respect in the neighborhood . The magistrates were present , the Governor of the colony with his counsellors ; and after its appropriate offices were ended , it was followed by a convention of the people , at which municipal regulations were adopted , and questions of every kind were discussed that engaged the minds of the men of that day . " Whatever Mr. Cotton delivered , " says an historian , " was soon put into an order of court , if of a civil , or set up as a practice in the church , if of an ecclesiastical concernment . " The curtain of nearly half a century now drops before the scene . We see nothing and hear nothing behind it . It was the period , when the Lecture was steadily advancing to its highest point of show and popularity , and yet precisely that , which has left the least account of itself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love best to go on their way with a rejoicing quietness . I will butlift the screen , and exhibit to you , as on a stage , or in a picture , the appearance that it presented during this period . The thatched meeting-house has disappeared and given place to a more commodious and worthy structure ; and towards this , on every fifth morning of the week , there is a flowing together of the people from many a mile round . The villages send their yeomen and pastors . The walls of Harvard College , that have risen at Newtown , contribute of its few students and fellows to swell the train . All other instruction must cease , while the lips of the benignant old patriarch Wilson , of the eloquent and commanding Cotton , of the zealous Norton , of Oxenbridge the well beloved , who broke off his own preaching of this very Lecture to be carried to his death-bed , are dispensing diviner knowledge . The schools dismiss their pupils in the forenoon , and are kept no more that day , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege . The rough weather of a climate , yet sterner than it has since been , scarcely thins the assembly , that comes to warm itself with fervent words and the glow of a common interest and the breath of its own cro*vd , in a cold place . What an array is here of dignity , and sanctity , and comeliness What squares of scarlet cloaks ! What borders of white but artificial hair ! What living complexions-of a less shining whiteness , and less presumptuously red ,  --  upon many fair but solemn faces , which the arguments of Cotton have divested oftheir veils ! And lest any thing should be wanting to so important an occasion , and lest a single interesting association of life should be overlooked or unconnected with it , I hear the list of names repeated with a loud voice , of those who " intend , " as the good phrase still is , to make themselves the happiest of mortals . Thus the recreations of the young and the meditations of the old , the order of the churches and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have their remembrances bound together in this ancient service . In the year 167 ! ) it sustained an alteration , of too much consequence to be here passed by . The church of Boston was no lunger one . The thickening population at the North required another edifice for their accommodation , which had already existed for thirty years ; and religious dissensions ,  --  a less happy and a less honorable motive-had planted , somewhat violently , a third church at the South . Hitherto , the Lecture had been conducted by the pastors and teachers of the old congregation . But feebler hands than their predecessors were now bearing up its ark . The great names of the former time had become names and recollections merely ; and the question necessarily arose , whether there might not be some enlargement of the present practice . The question did arise ;  --  but in a shape that we should hardly have looked for . A singular record is found at this date in the books of the First Church . it seems that there was passed " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders of this towne might joyntly carry on the 5th day lecture . " An order from the magistrates ! And Cotton but a single generation in his grave ! Where was the old bond of alliance , between him who spoke from the sacred desk and him who sat in the state chair ? One would think that in that age of visions his angry spirit would have passed before their faces , making all their " bones to shake . " The times had changed , however , though a portion of their temper , in opposition at least , was still remaining . The reply was expressed in the following vote : " In answer to ye Honed Magistrates about the Lecture ; Tho as an injunction wee can not concurr with it , but doe humbly bare our witnesse against it , as apprehending it tending to ye infringement of Church Libertie : yett if the Lord incline the hearts of the other Teaching officers of this towne to accept of desire of our officers , to give yr assistance with those of this Church , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wee are willing to accept theire help therein . " It was nobly said ; - with a proper respect for themselves , and a reasonable jealousy of political interference // with religions offices . One can only lament , that with all the mixture of human feelings , there can he the slightest pretence to suspect them of any but the best . One can wish to forget that they w re yet unreconciled , though after a quarrel that had lasted as long as the siege of Troy , with their seceding brethren of the Old South ; who had from the beginning the best of the argument , and manifested throughout , perhaps , the better temper . But whatever our jud0ement may be ,  --  and it should certainly not do them a wrong and dishonor ,  --  the event was , that from that time forth , other ministers , as they were added to the Congregational name , bore their part in these exercises , and many new gifts and powers were brought in , to aid in a venerable work . There is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look again the scene is changed . " The world hasteth fast to pass away , says an apocryphal writer ; and how could the Thursday Lecture enjoy its immunities for ever ? We see it declining now from its high ascendency , though still preserving a certain dignity in its waning and its descent . Towards the close of the century , Dr. Cotton Mather " gave notice that the lecture was to begin at 11 o'clock instead of 12 ; reproved the town's-people that attended no better ; and declared that it would be an omen of their not enjoying it loin g , if they did not amend . " Our severe weather began now to act as a preventive , or to patronize an excuse . In the mid-winter of 1715 , during a violent snow-storm from the north-east , tha worshipers not only could be counted , but offered , by their unprecedented fewness , a temptation to count them ;  --  and a Chief Justice assures us that the audience , barricaded as it might have been by the driving tempest before the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred men . We may well pause , after such an instance of deterioration , and , unwilling to pursue any farther the course of neglect , take refuge iii a great public event , which sixty years afterwards shook the whole land , and ended in throwing over our withered Lecture a momentary glory ; - as the frost paints the dying leaves of the woods with more magnificent colors than when they flourished the freshest . During the siege of Boston , it was for a few melancholy months suspended ; and the deliverance of the town renewed it in the midst of universal acclamations . Individuals may be yet alive who beheld its crowded assembly that day ;  --  a day that was suited to remind men of the foundation of the colony , while celebrating its redemption and freedom ,  --  that saw one great era looking back to another , and battle and victory stretching out their mailed hands to greet all the ancient memories of peril and destitution , and " small " but unconquerable " things . " The officers of the army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of prayer ; and there was Washington himself ; that " Captain cf the Lord 's host " for a continent and for mankind . The Lecture might have closed its doors after this . it had had enough of honor . I will add nothing further to its history . The rest is told by our own recollections of the wise , and good , and eloquent , who have cast their words upon its deserted walls ; and whose voices-O , how gladly would we bring back , though it were but for a moment , from the lonelier chambers into which they have died away ! " A spirit passed before my face . " Let me return to the text , and end the discourse as it was begun . The spirit in the book of Job did not disappear till it had uttered its short word of admonition . " Shall mortal man be more just than God ? " The spirit which we have ventured to accost may have something else to tell besides its story of accidents and changes . Before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which we have summoned it . let us listen to its advice . It says to us ,  --  Have no regrets for what can not be called back . Make no complaints concerning what could not be otherwise . Utter no lamentations over the decay of observances , that can not for ever be observed ; nor over the decay of piety , as if it were indicated and expressed by any thing of this kind that is done or left undone . " Strengthen the things that remain , " and that you would not willingly let die ; butlay it not to heart too much , if you find that you can not reverse the decree of their mortality . Do not mistrust the present . Do not tremble for the future . The world that has been changing hitherto , will change more . Forms will give place to forms ; opinions will grow obsolete , usages be laid aside , and establishments fall ; but truth will gain , and improvement go on , and religion , that immortal one , healed of its hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . Reflect , that the institutions which have become less used , have become less required . A multitude of means , new and full of life , spring forward into // Literary Notices . the place of every one , which age has impaired , or circumstances have dispensed with . Rejoice , that whatever is lost by the wearing out of a single instrument , is made up a hundred fold by other facilities . Rejoice , that individual influence and authority have become less , that the strength of an enlightened public sense might become more . The most famous of all your divines professed that " he loved not to sleep , till he had sweetened his mouth with a piece of Calvin . " But that taste has altered . Some of you , like the fire-kings , profess to savor the drug , while it is only a cunning substitute that you swallow in its stead ; and others plainly say , that such sugar of lead was fit only for the palates of an iron generation . Be instructed in lessons of humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . Mourn for nothing . Despair of nothing . Be persevering and be content . " Shall mortal man be more just " than time and destiny , and the God who is over both ?
