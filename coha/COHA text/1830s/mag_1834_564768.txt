txt THERE is an account , in the Spectator , or somewhere else , of a good woman , who , at her trial before Rhadamanthus , being asked how she had employed the seventy years of her life , replied , that she had been so taken up with the faults of others , that no time was left for the improvement of her own character . Unless the world has since degenerated the judge was wrong to reject the excuse . I take no pains to search out follies . I dislike to come in contact with them . Yet they meet me at every turn . There is no avoiding them . They have no respect for times , persons , or places . In the market-place and senatechamber , on change and in the hovel , in highways and in by-ways , public houses and private houses , their silly faces are seen . My own room is no sanctuary . " Even Sunday shines no sabbath day to me . " At church , the prude before me , and the sleeper at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - with fans , and airs , and grimaces , in all quarters , are more than I can bear with perfect composure . In my dealings with the world all sorts of follies assail me . There is Pedantry : I do not like it . Yet how keep out of its reach ? R- , an impudent young man , of considerable talent , has just been reading Brown 's Philosophy . " I think , " says he , to the first friend he meets , " that Brown has done more for philosophy , than any man since Bacon . " ' " I have not examined the works of all who have written upon the subject since Bacon , " replies the friend , " and therefore can not decide . " The implied reproof was felt ; but did little to reform the young man 's character . " I think Descartes decidedly a greater man than La Place , " said he , pompously , while I was near him at a small party , shortly after the conversation just stated . The ladies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . Reader , did you ever feel an irresistible inclination to do a mischievous thing ? Such , I confess , was n*y feeling at that moment . I could not bear to see a young upstart decide in that way upon the merits of two such men ; and , turning to him , I quietly asked , whether he had read the Mecanique Celeste , in French , or in Bowditch 's translation ? It was a wicked question-he had never seen either ; but , foitunately , business at the other side of the room called him away before he could answer me . To this hour the offence is not forgiven . This species of fault is particularly common in young men just from their studies . Some , in the community , are ignorant enough to believe , that students , fresh from the seat of Minerva and the Muses , should know nearly every thinb ; and few are willing to lessen the respect in which they see themselves held by their friends at home . I was once sadly cau* , ht in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cautious since . Myself and companion-both students and about equally wise-were in a stage-coach , full of spirits , as students generally are when going home to see their friends , hear compliments , and show their learning . Not suspecting that any one present had half the knowledge , that we possessed , our opinions were given , in a decided , off-hand manner , upon any subject , whether in literature , religion , politics , or philosophy . After a time , I observed that almost every topic was suggested by an elderly gentleman , in the corner of the // coach , who , however , took no other part in the conversation than to ask , now and then , a question . For a while we dashed on , nothing daunted , though several times brought to a stand by his simple , yet pertinent inquiries . At last , he himself began to talk upon the same subjects on which we had been engaged , and , without the least assurnption or air of superiority , went through with questions and remarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , so unpretending a manner , that , while delighted with his spirit , clearness , and intelligence , I could not but feel that the extreme diffidence and forbearance , which characterized his manner , were a severe and intentional satire upon our own presumption ; and I could plainly see , that the same thought was running through the minds of our fellow-passengers . Yet not a word either of ridicule or asperity escaped him . What , then , must have been our mortification , when , in addition to this , we learned , that he was one of the ablest scholars in the nation ! It has been my fortune to meet him several times since ; but to this day I have not been able to summon courage enough to he introduced , lest , by some unlucky accident , he might be led to recognize in me the cidevant literary coxcomb of a stage-coach  --  a distinction which I covet not . Why is it , reader , that , for years after such an exposure , we can not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even crimes , if once confessed and thoroughly repented of , often cease , in time , to give great pain in the remembrance ? I do not lzke a mode of e torting Praise , which is not uncommon *n the world . Farmer B- has a better field of corn than any one else in the town . He wishes to hear it praised . Accordingly he contrives to take a neighbor , whose corn is very poor , through the field . " I do n't know how it is , " says he , in a complaining tone , " but my corn is miserable this year . " " Yes , I see it is , " carelessly replies the other , who , seeing through the trick , is determined to disappoint craving vanty . " Well , if it is miserable , " rejoins the first , in a passion , " it is better than any of my neighbors ' . " Paternus is an aged man , and verging upon second childhood . His foibles , therefore , are pardonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I respect even the failings of such an one . Thomas , a man of uncommon merit , is his favorite son ; and no incense can be offered so grateful to the father 's heart as encomiums upon the son . He is visited by an old friend . They had set out together upon the journey of life , and to , ether had breasted many a storm , at times when trials and dangers were something more than a name . " You , " says he , to his friend , " are fortunate in your children . Mine have all left me but Thomas , and he-I am full of fears-he is not what I could wish . He is an unpromising man . " " Yes , I understand that he is very much of a spendthrift . " " No , no. lie is no spendthrift . He has always been prudent . Say what you may of him in other respects , he is certainly not a spendthrift . " " But , if I mistake not , he is indolent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man as the town contains . " " It gave me great pain to learn that he was intemperate . " " Intemperate ! Who said so ? A more temperate man never lived . " " Now I remember that he is irre*ular in his habits . " " What , sir ! My son irregular ! Where have you been to hear such stories ? or what induced you to believe them ? lie has been with me from a child , and // I have never known him guilty of an irregular , vicious , or immoral act . No man has greater influence in the town , and no man more faithfully performs all the duties of life . " " Then I see not , my friend , why you should complain of him . " " Indeed , 1 was wrong , " says the father , as if awakening to a sudden consciousness of his situation , and of his son 's true character . This way of seeking praise is not a peculiarity of the aged . Do you see that young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room ? Note how careful he is , that no one of his own sex should hear him . What a look of modesty he puts on ! I will lay any wager , that he is striving to elicit their praise . He has just come from a public meeting , at which he made a very tolerable speech of some ten minutes . The ladies were there . The points , on which he plumes himself and in which he really excels , are a deep , full voice , and great distinctness of enunciation ; and in this speech he had taken considerable pains , not without success , to make a beautiful cadence at the close . Hear what they are saying . Miss A- . " We have had a delightful meeting . Much of the speaking was excellent . " Florio . " Yes , very good , except one thing . I am sorry that I took any part in it . I was not at all prepared . Yet no one else was disposed to speak , four persons started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , at such times , is worse than bad speaking . " Miss B " I must differ from you in that . An occasional silence gives to us ladies the privilege of exercising our tongues . But really , you need not regret your effort so much . You succeeded admirably . " Florio . " No . My voice was so high and shrill . " Miss A " Why , I thought your voice deeper and more clear than any other there . But , Mary , did you observe the gentleman who- " " I wish I could have had time to collect myself . My enunciation must have been bad . " Miss F- . " I was as far from you as any one , and yet heard every word . I wish I could find out who that " Did you not see how abruptly I ended ? " Miss B- . " You are certainly mistaken . It will not do for you to have so low an opinion of your own abilities . As 1 was coming from the house I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before going in , that I should have to - . " Shall we listen longer , or shall I reveal the secret ? " Mr. Florio , I think you succeeded much better in public , especially at the close of your speech , than when I heard you rehearsing in private . " his room is next to mine , and for three days he had done nothing else than rehearse , times without number , the extempore speech , which had been written down and committed to memory . If , reader , you should doubt the truth of this relation , listen to the conversation of almost any young man , whom you see disposed to talk in an under tone to ladies , after an exhibition which he has made in their presence . Or , if you remember the proverb , and fear the fate of a listener , keep an eye to your own conduct , and see if you detect nothing of the kind . It is by conversations of this kind , that so many youngmen , ofrespectabletalentsand attainments , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures we are in your hands ,  - -  how fond of compliments , and how easily puffed up by them . We confess to you , only that our confessions may be thrown back with encomiums . We are humble in your presence , only that our humility // may , by your approbation , be swollen into vanity . He , who appears before you a plain and sensible young man , may go away a conceited , intolerable fop . His studies or his business will be neglected , and the very qualities , which you have commended , will be swallowed up in an overweening , all-pervading conceit . We talk much of the love of approbation in ladies . But I have seen beautiful young ladies not quite spoiled by a succession and an array of compliments more than sufficient to ruin any ten young men in the land . This is no fancy sketch . I have known pious young men to be sadly injured by the encoiniums , which pious young ladies seriously bestowed upon their prayers . More than one young minister have I seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed too plainly that he was a favorite with the ladies . Men , at the bar , and in all the walks of life , might be named , if it were decorous , who have been made intolerable to their own sex by the attentions , which they have received from their female acquaintances . I am sorry to acknowledge our weakness , but a prudent regard to our safety requires it . I do not like men who deal in wholesale vituperations against particular pursuits , or sciences . We respect all classes and orders of men . From the judge , who purges society of its impurities , , to the miserable being , who purges chimneys of their soot ; from the magistrate who fills the highest chair of state , to the private individual , who fills the street-lamps , all are useful and honorable . All contain good men and bad men . But here is a man remarkable for his benevolence. lie would not , for the world , utter a syllable against a fellow , being . But he will tell yon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pursuit is to make men hard*hearted quibblers ; and that , from the nature of the calling , no man can practise law without being depraved in mind and heart . " Ah , " says a youth , to whom he has been talking in this strain , " What say you of your neighbor , on the other side of the way ? Is he - ? " " I beg your pardon . I said nothing about my neighbor . I made no allusion to him or to any man . I scorn personal calumny . But can we not discuss principles , and condemn abstract doctrines , and anathematize studies , without throwing any imputation upon persons ? " " I am no dialectician , " replies the youth , " and readily yield to your superior judgement . But when it is shown that certain principles are of such a character , that none but a knave or a fool can maintain them , the inference in my mind is , that , if your neighbor avows those principles , he is a knave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind , young man , is altogether wrong . There is a wide difference between what must be , and what is . General assertions can not be applied to particular persons . " A refinement this , which I have never been able to understand . A characteristic of these fault-finders is , that they usually know nothing about the subjects they calumniate . In academies and colleges , those who never get a lesson in Greek or Mathematics , are the scholars , who cry out against those studies . And , in manhood , those who are superlatively ignorant of a particular science , are loudest in their exclamations against it . I was lately reading a benevolent book - benevolent I suppose it was ; for its object was to praise every person by finding fault with every thing in which the person mentioned at // any one time did not excel . I have too much respect for the author to mention his name . As a sample of the work ; a good lady is praised for endowing a hospital for the poor ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she praised ? In language something like this . We quote from memory . " She had not studied Political Economy to learn that it was sinful to provide for her suffering fellow-creatures . She had not learned that nature 's table is full , ' and that he , who moves aside to make room for a new corner is only aggravating the misery of want . " Now I will venture to say , that this man never , in his life , read understandingly a single work on Political Economy , from the formidable quartoes of Stuart to the childish duodecimoes of Miss Martineau ; else he never would have used such language . lie may , in some vituperative review of Maithus , have seen something ahout nature 's table being full ; but he never read the work in which the phrase originally occurs , or he never would have made such an application of it . With some of the doctrines of Malthus I have no sympathy . But his works contain not a word against the judicious exercise of private charity , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly and eloquently recommended both . We find no fault with a treatise on farming , because it does not instruct the merchant in book-keeping ; and a dairy woman would be hooted at , if she were to condemn a tract on commerce , because it contained no directions about making butter . Yet it is a common thing to calumniate Political Economy , because it is not filled with charity sermons ; and no more acceptable way can be found to praise a ( listinguished friend of humanity , than by pouring out vials of wrath upon this important science . I like it not . The good may receive the rich reward of approbation , which they deserve , without ii poverishing those , who , in different spheres , have been as useful as themselves . Paul 's energy may be praised without decrying the mildness of John . Yet one half the eulogiums in the world , from the time when the daughters of Israel with singing hailed the return of Saul and David from the battle , to the funeral oration that was yesterday pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted more or less in decrying those , whose usefulness shone forth in other stations or employments . Hints I do not like . They are unerring marks of a dastardly mind , or a vulgar education . I once had an ungainly habit of shrugging up my shoulders , of which I was by no means conscious . An acquaintance wished me to know it , hut had not the manliness to tell me plainly . In order , however , to guide me into a knowledge of my ways , he would often make it the subject of remark , and ask me , if I did not think it a vile habit . For his own part , he would add , he knew of nothing that had a more awkward appearance . Every one would be laughin g at it . And yet he thought the habit might easily be cured . All this was Greek to me ; and it was matter of great astonishment , that , of all the subjects in the world , he should so often select this . It had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I had not seen for years , and almost his first words were , " How came you to get that vile trick of shrug*ing up your shoulders at such a rate ? " This was intelligible , and the habit was cured at once . // Mrs. Jameson 's children are brought up in a rational manner . By kind and judicious treatment the rod is rendered unnecessary . Mrs. Grimalkin has different notions of education , and thinks these little ones all going to ruin . She visits Mrs. Jameson , and , instead of openly avowing her object , gives a sly lecture over another 's shoulders . " My cousin has a pack of unruly children , and it is right enough they should be so . She is so mighty tender-hearted , that I do n't believe she ever struck one of them in her life .

" It is exceedingly warm , to-day , " says Miss C- , on a morning call , one cool day , while half suffocated by the close hot room , in which she found herself .

Farewell . IT . S.@@183068777.txt ThERE is no subject of inquiry , so deeply interesting to society , or one which has so completely baffled the efforts of statesmen and legislators , as the discovery of an efficient method of preventing crime , and what is the best disposition which can be made of offenders . From the time of Moses , until a very recent period , the only attempts , for abating the evils of vice , were by moral or physical inflictions ; not so much for the purpose of guarding against the recurrence of offences , by the terror of example , or for the reformation of the malefactor , who was compelled to suffer the horrors of remorse , the poignancy of degradation , or the agonies of torture , but as a retribution to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still more often , as an expiatory punishment ,  --  an atonement by blood ,  --  the offering up of a sacrifice , not on the altar of outraged justice , but of implacable vengeance . To punish , appears to have been deemed the chieg if not the only object , and province of judicial tribunals ; while the prevention of crime , and the reformation of offenders were scarcely considered , in forming codes of jurisprudeice , and when , in fact , they should constitute the very basis , on which all criminal legislation should be founded . The right to punish , is an attribute , which belongs exclusively to the Almighty ; and man can not exercise it , in any manner , in the true and emphatic meaning of the term ; for who shall presume to prejudge the deeds of his fellow-man , with the intention of demanding an atonement , and measure out the degree and duration of his suffering on earth , when he has to answer for all his transgressions , at the awful tribunal of the Most High . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delinquents in the most cruel and appalling manner ,  --  even unto death ,  --  which may be deemed impeccable by the God of our creation , and render the perpetrators of such dreadThl punishments rightfully obnoxious to his retributive justice . Punishment , as a technical term , has been wrongfully used , in our correctional laws ; for , when to maintain the peace of society and render all secure in their persons and their property , it becomes necessary to restrain the vicious , individuals must be deprived of their liberty , to a certain extent , and possibly of their lives ; but this should not be done as a punishment ; for so far as it may have that appearance or effect , such should not be the intention , but rather results , as an incident , from the impossibility of protecting private rights , and maintaining public tranquility , without abridging the freedom of those , who disregard the laws ; but even this corrective must be administered in mercy , and no greater suffering inflicted , than is indispensable , in precluding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of the state . It must , therefore , be constantly kept in mind , that the chief objects to be attained are , to place the vicious beyond the power of doing wrong , to attempt their future reformation , and to render the influence of example as salutary as is practicable , on the morals of the whole people , by inducing every citizen to be virtuous in conduct , at least , from an apprehension of being visited by the like degradation , into which the convicted felon has fallen . // Mercy is the most emphatic injunction of our religion , and yet how slight has been its beneficent influence on the conduct of governments . Instead of being actuated by those lofty precepts , and impressed with those touching illustrations of charity , which so richly embellish the histories of the evangelists , there has been evinced more of Pagan ferocity , than of Christian clemency , in the treatment of criminals . How different was the teaching and example of the Son of God . To the reviled and compunctious female , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thy sins are forgiven thee ; " when the woman was brought before him in the temple , for judgement , and whose offence , by the Jewish laws , was death , these were the cheering words to the trembling and forsaken culprit : " Neither do I condemn thee ,  --  go , and sin no more ; " to the beseeching appeal of the suffering malefactor , he kindly replied , . " To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise ; " and the last words lie uttered , was that memorable prayer , in behalf of those who had persecuted and crucified him ; " Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . " So far from being lnstructe ( l by such impressive lessons of mercy , they have scarcely been regarded by our jurists ; for their penalties for offences , have too generally been those of personal suffering , by stripes , incarceration , torture , mutilation , and death , in every variety , of the most revolting forms . The demons of revenge , cruelty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribunals of justice , as the sanguinary avengers of violated law . It was not sufficient that the wretched culprit was deprived of his freedom , or his life ; but , in either case , so horrible was the manner , that the last blow of death became an act of grace. * When the scourge and the dungeon , hunger and thirst , and fire , and the rack , had been successively applied to the miserable convict , that he should expire at last , under these prolonged and remorseless inflictions , was the only consolation in the midst of torments which convulsed every muscle , and thrilled in every nerve . With these views , it is obvious that the chief inquiry of legislators should be directed , to ascertain the cause of crime , what can be done to preserve the morals of the people , to render life and property secure , and to reclaim the vicious . The occurrence of crime being the result of ignorance and immorality , it can only be prevented by the universal inculcation of education and virtuous principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisprudence should be erected . Here must commence the work of regeneration , and it is the sacred duty of governments to illustrate this fundamental principle in the most extensive and efficient manner . The means of instruction roust be so ample , as to embrace every child in the Union , and as touch attention devoted to the improvement of the morals , as the development of intellect . To accomplish this , no expense is to be spared ; for on it depends the happiness of millions , here and hereafter . The experiment has never been thoroughly made in any age or country ; but , whenever and wherever it has been attempted , the results have uniformly demonstrated the correctness of the theory . The statistical investigations of the philan * when criminals were tortured , after all their limbs had heen troken by an iron bar , they were at last despatched by a blow on the breact , ant , as it ended their torroetits , it was called the Coup de Grace . // thropic , in Europe and this country , exhibit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent of education . It is less in England than in Ireland , less in Scotland than in England , and less in the United States than in Scotland , hearing the same relative proportion to the whole population , as ignorance does to instruction . But even in this country , not one of the states has done its duty , in the establish ment of primary schools , and other indispensable seminaries of learning ; and , what is most deplorable , the national government has done nothing , for the advancement of literature , science , or the arts . If the citizens of the United States have done much to advance the the principles of civil and religious liberty , they have been grossly negligent in providing the requisite means for insuring their expansion and perpetuity ; and unless the most liberal and energetic measures are adopted , for thoroughly instructing the whole people , there can be no hope of stability , in our free institutions of government . A republic is the glorious achievement of an exalted civilization ,  --  the triumphant exposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servitude , and can only exist , where intelligence is universally disseminated . Education and morality are the brazen pillars of our political temple . It must never be forgotten , that the child is the parent of the virtues and vices of the adult ; and that reformation , in man or woman is of rare occurrence . The exceptions are so few , that they only tend to confirm the lamentable fact , that when there has once been a departure from the path of rectitude , all hope of a return is desperate , if not futile . With infancy , then , must commence the means of preventing crime by giving to the mind that instruction , that elevated perception of virtue , that Christian beneficence , and that honorable direction , which can alone insure propriety of conduct , through adolesence , to the evening of protracted age . Having provided adequate means for accomplishing these primary and all-important objects , the next consideration , is how to dispose of offenders ; and it having been assumed , that punishment , as such , is unwarrantable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of society , as to be incapable of disturbing its peace and serenity , while they are subjected to the leait possible moral or physical suffering ; and , at the same time , are in a condition best calculated to induce reformation . Imprisonment has been thoroughly tried , in every variety of form , which either humanity or cruelty could suggest , and presents many insuperable objections . It has been fully shown , that it is ineffectual both for the prevention of crime , and the reclamation of the vicious , besides being the most barbarous of all the inflictions , which can be imposed upon man , when rendered solitary , inactive , silent , and interminable . It is being entombed alive ,  --  a living death ,  --  a horrible realization of the dreadful dream of Clarence . The first great movement , for effecting a radical change in criminal law , was made in this country , by that philanthropic and most exemplary association , which claims the illustrious Penn as its great apostle in the western hemisphere . This was the substitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the corrupting idleness of the jail , and the awful vengeance of death . humanity hailed the development of this benignant and imposing theory , with enthusiasm ; // and , under the sanctions of that holy religion , whose characteristic teachings are repentance and mercy , the commendable experiment was prosecuted with a zeal , commensurate with the momentous objects , which it was so desirable to accomplish . It was expected that crime would be prevented , from an apprehension of the inevitable consequences of detection ,  --  and offenders reformed , by the influence of a discipline , which was to unite moral instruction with profitable labor ; and thus , after a lapse of years , the delinquent would be restored to liberty , and the full enjoyment of all his civil rights , entirely divested of the least propensity to vice , and enabled , by an acquired trade , and habits of industry , to earn an honest subsistence . In many of the states vast expenditures have been made , under the direction of the most enlightened and sanguine advocates of this penitentiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so complete has been the failure , that all hopes of satisfactory results must be abandoned . Instead of that beneficial change in the habits of the malefactors , which was so confidently promised , those vast structures , which have been erected for their improvement , are but so many seminaries of vice , from whence are daily coming forth , the more accomplished , hardened , and reckless depredator , instead of the compunctious an.d reclaimed citizen . This is so notorious , that , however unexpected and unwelcome the fact , it must be accredited , and the scheme abandoned , as utterly inefficient , for the purposes intended to be accomplished . BANIShMENT , then , is the only mode of disposing of malefactors ; but the manner of this banishment should be so attempered by mercy , as to partake ofthe character of an adventurous enterprise ,  --  of a voluntary expatriation , with the cheering hope , that , in other climes , and under more auspicious prospects , a new and brighter career can be commenced ; - where the means of obtaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , at the same time , preclude every inducement to error ; - where an honorable ambition will gladden the heart , and elevate the soul , from the encouraging reflection , that they are the pioneers of a prosperous colony , and will thus be enabled to make an atonement for their various transgressions , in laying the foundations of a new republic ,  --  in establishing a nation , which may ultimately become as illustrious for its enterprise , intelligence , happiness , freedom , and glory , as that from whence they emigrated . It is the hope of reward , rather than the fear of punishment , which induces man to put forth his moral and physical energies . From the morn of prattling childhood , to the twilight of old age , from the private soldier to the commander of armies , from the humblest individual to the most exalted , the plaudits , . the honors , the distinctions , the rewards for virtuous deeds and glorious achievements , are the chief if not the only incentives , by which he is actuated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment , is so deeply implanted in the mind , , and so animates the heart , that the most renowned sages , jurists , arid heroes , . have appealed to it , as the grand principle , on which all human conduct was to be reguiate ( 1 . It is the anticipated beatitudes of heaven , rather than the terrors of divine wrath ,  --  the grateful aroma of public approbation , rather than the withering breath // of scorn and reproach ,  --  the reguerdon of valorous deeds , rather than the humiliations of delinquency ,  --  and the distinction of place , rather than the apprehension of ignominious degradation , which rouse the noblest faculties of the soul , give confidence to purpose , vigor to action , and develop the most resplendent attributes of genius , talent , and intelligence . It is such inspiring conceptions , which prompt the mightiest efforts of man , and elevate him to the highest attainable summit of moral grandeur . In adopting means for the diminution of offences , this view of the character of man , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tomb , should not be neglected ; it should be the governing theory , in the organization and management of our schools , and in forming codes of correctional laws . The radical error of nearly all writers on jurisprudence , has originated from pursuing an opposite course ; they sought to prevent crime by the dread of punishment , and considered it indispensable , that conviction should be followed by the most terrible inflictions . If they had studied human nature , rather than precedents , and been more governed by the instructions of history , than the influence of custom , they would have been convinced , that a fear of the fatal consequences has never restrained the vicious ; that offences were as frequent , under the most cruel and sanguinary laws of the feudal age , as since the establishment of less barbarous codes . Were heretical opinions obliterated , by those ferocious judgements , which have rendered the ecclesiastical courts of Europe forever infamous ? Was religion rendered venerable , by such horrible decrees , as that , which condemned the youthful De Ia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand amputated , and his body consumed by a slow fire , for having , in a boyish frolic , ridiculed the priests in a song ? Was the monarch of France rendered more secure on his throne , after Damien was sacrificed , for an assault on Louis XV . by having his flesh torn from his bones , with red-hot pincers , molten lead poured into his wounds , and then his limbs dragged asunder by wild horses ? Were thefts , robberies , and murders less common , when evidence was extorted from the accused by torture , and the galleys , perpetual imprisonment , and the gibbet , were the general chastisements ? Have the morals of the people been the most exemplary where the punishments were the most various and horrible ? So far from this being true , the vindictive character of national laws is conclusive testimony of general licentiousness , and of the limited progress of civilization , and of a decadence from a more exalted state of refinement . In proportion as intelligence and freedom have advanced in the western nations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the human mind has retrograded , crime has become more prevalent , and legislation more barbarous . The aged culprit is inhumanly impaled for offences , which might have been prevented , by youthful instruction , and the savage monarch rules in the terror of ignorant and degraded slaves , rather than in the respect and affections of an enlightened and prosperous people . Let an effort then be made to place our jurisprudence on a level with that advanced condition of society , which characterizes the age in which we live . Let a system of criminal law be presented , in which the benefiGent influence of instruction and mercy , shall be substituted // for the pretended correctional effects of exemplary chastisements , the awful atonements of outraged justice , and the agonies inflicted by a spirit of revenge . It may be urged by those , who still believe in the restraining influence of terror , that banishment is not sufficiently dreadful , and that transportation , will be considered rather an advantage , than a punishment ; but has it not been clearly proved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under every form of government , that the horror , of even the most diabolical penalties , has not withheld the hand of the unprincipled and desperate ; besides , punishment is not the object proposed , but the deliverance of the country from the presence of the malefactor , and that , too , in a manner which shall occasion him the least suffering ; and as it has been contended , that the inducement to crime , is only to be prevented , by youthful education ,  - -  by the universal diffusion of intelligence , the zealous inculcation of the principles of morality and religion , and a strict observance of the rules of temperance among all classes of children ; and it having been assumed as one of the reasons for adopting the proposed system , that the vicious are to be considered as irreclaimable , by penitentiary discipline , therefore all that remains to be done , in relation to culprits , is their exclusion from society ; and how can that be accomplished in any way so effectual and merciful , as by deportation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be in such a place of exile as has been contemplated . There every cause of vice will be precluded , for there will be no community to prey upon , or to hold them in contempt ,  --  which is of infinite importance , to render compunction salutary . Now , with what dreary prospects does the discharged convict go forth into the world . Disgraced in the estimation of those who once held him in endearing estimation ; without friends , or the means of existence ; feared , shunned , and despised by all , who look upon himdesperate and without hope , he has no alternative , but again to associate with the most abandoned and depraved , and replunge into those scenes of profligacy , which inevitably result in his irretrievable ruin ; while , among the transported , a perfect equality will exist ; there will be none to censure , where all are conscious of being obnoxious to rebuke ; and each having ample means of employment and support , a bright and encouraging prospect will beam upon them ; emulation will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , religion will breathe the soothing consolations of repentance and forgiveness , and declining age will be gilded with the radiance of that eternal salvation , which is the promised reward of contrite hearts . To carry the system of banishment into effect , the co-operation of the national government is requisite , as a general receptacle for the convicts of all the states must be provided ; and this could be done by the purchase of a fertile island , situated within the mild latitudes of the Pacific ocean , which should be laid out into counties , towns , and farm sections , and placed under the superintendence of an officer , vested with the powers of a civil and military governor , and who should be guided in his duties by a code of laws best calculated to insure subordination , to encourage industry , and to improve the morals and comfort of the convicts . Each convict to be furnished with a tract of land // for a farm , if agriculture is his occupation , or a lot in the capital seaport , if intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided in the erection of a temporary dwelling , supplied with provisions for one year at least , and with seeds and tools sufficient for commencing his labors . Cattle , horses , sheep , swine , and poultry , to he gradually introduced and distributed. ; places for public worship and schools founded ; a local legislature to be formed , by the convicts , for the enactment of municipal regulations , so far as may be found expedient , and the whole to be managed like a national colony , where all are to be encouraged to participate , in the duties and advantages of citizens of a rising empire , and no farther restrained in their liberties , than is indispensable , for the peace , security , and prosperity of the establishment . The chief town should be located , where the best harbor is to be found , and there a military post must be maintained , and the requisite public buildings erected . The necessary expenditures , may be either made out of the national treasury , or from the contributions of the several states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very important that conviction should follow detection , and deportation conviction , as speedily as possible , ships may be provided by the General Government , to sail from two , three , or more of the principal ports of the Union , every two or three months , or oftener if found expedient , in which , the convicts of the states , nearest the several ports of departure , may be shipped.
