txt THE CONVENTION-THE CANDIDATES . IT was time that something should be done to rescue the system of nominations , by the machinery of conventions , from the odium and contempt which were fast and deservedly gathering around it . The people of the United States had seen , for a long time , men coming together in every district of the country , self-elected , to control and overawe the minds of the people . They had seen them everywhere , with words of patriotism frothing on their lips , and purposes of treason festering in their hearts , setting up joint-stock companies for the manufacture of public opinion , and stunning the common ear , and paralyzing the common heart with great swelling words , whereof the burden was , like that of the prophet , only and for ever-Wo ! wo ! upon the land and all the inhabitants thereof . It had come to that pass , that these things called conventions were nothing better than councils of conspirators against the peace , happiness , and dignity of the country-schools of cursing , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landless resolutes " met together to spur on each other to brave devices and the glorious enterprise of destroying the Con 38 I // stitution , and dismembering the confederacy . A little more and the common-sense and common virtue of the people would have rebelled . A little more , and the very name of " Convention " would have stunk in the nostrils of all decent , Godfearing , and law-abiding citizens . It would have carried with it no idea but that of a traitorous assemblage of fools or fanatics - madly bent upon the destruction of every constitutional check and barrier which rose between them and the success of their frenzied schemes for the instant perfection of human government and human beings . It was happily reserved for the Democratic party to give a new and striking example of its purity and power , and to rescue from contempt a system admirable in itself ; and dangerous only when turned awry and perverted from its natural tendency and effect ; and to reinstate a national convention in its proper and legitimate place , by exhibiting it as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the United States . That man must be truly blind , or hopelessly obtuse who does not see and acknowledge that the Convention which met at Cincinatti on the second day of last June has afforded that example , and has reinstated that kind of assembly in the confidence and affection of the Democracy . It was our privilege to attend that Convention . We sat through its sessions . We mingled with its members . We enjoyed peculiar opportunities of forming a judgment of their character . And we say it honestly , with our hand upon our heart , that a nobler , more earnest , or more dignified body of men never assembled together in one place for a political purpose , in any country or at any time . It was evident at a glance , as you threw your eye over the assemblage , and marked the distinguished carriage , the strong , thoughtful heads , the quiet , determined eyes of its members , that few common or ordinary men had found a place upon that floor . It was not necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men before you wore names already famous in their country 's story . You read that by a single glance at their faces . We looked over that goodly company , and our heart throbbed with pride . God forgive us if the emotion was one of overweening confidence in the might of human strength or wisdom . But we felt that the same thought , the same sentiment which had , for many months , been working in our brain and heart , had animated also every mind and heart amongst the myriad numbers of the great Democratic family . They had felt , as we had , the magnitude of the interests about to be committed to their charge by the hands of their representatives . They had // felt that , in the inscrutable but all-wise providence of their heavenly Father , the land upon which his smile had so long rested , and which he had blessed more abundantly than any other under the face of the whole heaven , was falling , away , and like Israel of old waxing fat and tempting him by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come upon us-that one of those periods in the history of nations had arrived from which must be after-dated the story of national grandeur or decline . They had felt that it was no time for mean men ; no occasion for second-rate politicians and twopenny county court lawyers to month and flourish over . Chastened and sobered by this pervading and controlling sentiment , from every quarter of our mighty land the Democracy sent up its best and noblest-saying to them , Go , take counsel together , and choose ye from amongst us the right men . Lay aside every selfish feeling . Divest yourselves of every prej iidice ; abandon every sentiment of personal hostility , or sectional favor . Gas t away far from you every weight of interest , every local hindrance , every individual restraint ; and act as men to . whom the destinies of a great nation are intrusted , and the memory of whose deeds must be carried far down into the future as a blessing or a curse . Into your hands we commit the Republic . The trust is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye quit yourselves like men  --  and God defena the right ! is We pretend to no second-sight , no power of prophecy . It only an humble and it may be very fallible opinion which we give ; but it is very strong upon us , and we therefore say boldly , and without a thought of reservation , that the men of that Convention discharged their trust in the spirit of brave , wise , and earnest patriots ; and both in the nominees whom they have presented for the suifrages of their fellow-citizens , and the platform they have placed them on-hav*e done all which the sentiment of their constituencies and the exigencies of the time required at their hands . What name more illustrious , or linked with memories dearest to the Democracy , could they have offered than that of James Buchanan of Pennsylvania ? Born on the 23d day of April , 1791 , near Mercerberg , Franklin county , Pennsylvania , the son of an honest , industrious farmer , his childhood was passed under the most favorable auspices for the development of the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thriving man , for we find him entering Dickinson College at the usual age , and graduat // 524 July , ing from that institution in 1819 . He immediately enters upon the study of the law in the office of James Hopkins . After his admission to the Bar he rapidly attains to uncommon eminence in his profession . Five years after leaving college , and at the age of twenty-three , he is elected to the Legislature of Pennsylvania . He no sooner takes his seat in that body than , with a burning and patriotic zeal , he advocates the war we were then waging against Great Britain , and so lends aid and comfort to the Democratic administration which was conducting it . Tn 1821 the district , composed of the counties of Lancaster , Chester , and Delaware , elected him to Congress by a large majority . He was re*5lected for five consecutive terms . In 1824 he pronounced himself the friend and follower of Andrew Jackson , who was then a candidate for the Presidency . James Buchanan espoused his cause warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hero 's death he continued to be his devoted personal friend , and unwavering political supporter . Through all the stirring scenes of that eventful period he stood like a rock beside Jackson , and by his conduct and eloquence largely contributed to sustain his administration , and repel the bitter and malignant assaults directed against it by the enemies of the Democratic party and its Hero chief . flis reputation as an orator and a statesman increased daily during his congressional career , and he took high rank among that band of remarkable men who rallied to the support of Jackson , and before whose untiring zeal and courage the combined forces of Mammon , Secession , and their whole anti-Democratic kindred , finally retired broken and discomfited . Retiring from the House of Representatives in 1831 , he was allowed but a brief interval of rest from public duty , being appointed January 4th , 1832 , by Jackson , Minister to Russia . Here he gave a striking proof of h*is capacity as a diplomatist , and though he remained in the Russian Mission but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty subsisting between the two countries . It is worthy of remark that the entire efforts of our Government and its Ministers at that Court had been directed , without success , to the same end for more than twenty years preceding . On the 8th of December , 1834 , he took his seat in the Senate of the United States , and continued in that position until the year 1845 , having been re*dected by the unanimous vote of the Democratic members of the Assembly of Pennsylvania . In 1845 James K. Polk called him into his cabinet as its leader , and he continued to discharge the duties of Secretary // of State until the close cf that noble Democratic administration . In all these relationships his admirable manners , weight of character , and unsullied reputation gave him great influence with all parties . The Democratic party relied upon him as a champion always ready and able to do battle for it , careless whether his opponent were a Webster or a Clay , and secure in the justice of his quarrel . It will be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually pitted , and that he seldom left them to boast a victory . Indeed , his great qualities developed themselves at a very early period of his public career , for both Madisou and Monroe recognized them , and the latter offered him an important foreign mission so early as the year 1823 . At the opening of his administration Mr. Pierce called him from his temporary retirement to assume the responsible position of Minister to the Court of St. James . How ably he has represented American interests at that court , under circumstances the most trying , and at a period when questions big with the future of the two nations were daily to be considered and acted upon , is matter so recent and notorious that we need not dwell upon it . Its record is before the country , and their judgment upon it has already been partially pronounced . The 9th of November , 1856 , will , we doubt not , affix to that as well as the whole record of his life the seal of a nation 's gratitude and approbation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in the Democratic party as a candidate for the Presidency . The wish was , we believe , first formally expressed by the Lancaster County Convention , held in September , 1842 , in the following words : " The Hon. James Buchanan , whose merits , strength in the hearts of the people , well-tried and valuable public services , able statesmanship , true Democratic course and purity of character , unmistakably point to him as the prominent candidate to be presented to the next National Convention , etc. , etc . " In 1844 he peremptorily withdrew his name from the list of presidential candidates , although vehemently urged by his friends to adopt a different course . With that firmness , however , for which he is notorious , he refused their solicitations , and modestly replied that there were those already before the country whose claims were superior to his own , and he would not interfere with them . In 1848 and 1852 he was again prominently presented , and on the latter occasion the delegates from his native State clung to him for forty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that // success at that time was hopeless . A large majority of the Democratic States stood shoulder to shoulder with Pennsylvania in that contest of 1852 , proving that his fame was national , and the desire to reward his long and arduous services by no means confined to the Democracy of his native State . The year 1856 beholds him presented , by the unanimous voice of one of the most weighty , able , and dignified Conventions ever assembled in the United States , as the first choice of the Democratic party of the whole Union . What earthly monarch ever occupied as proud a place ? The accident of birth may set upon an idiot 's brow the round and top of sovereignty . The blood of thousands slain may bear , upon its gory tide , some brutal soldier-some heartless adventurer to a throne ; but as he treads over the necks of prostrate millions to his seat of power , who d'oes not see mingling with the proud pageantry which surrounds him , the sad faces of the widow and the orphan he has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victorious trumpet , the mournful wail and shriek of outraged and despairing humanity . But when after a long career of peaceful labor in his country 's cause-after the discharge of every duty which marks a man as the worthy servant of the best interests of his race and epoch ; after a calm and noble contest for the rights of man ; after a life spent in the service of truth and virtue - such an one as JAMES BUCHANAN is called to receive the suifrages of his fellow-countrymen for the highest office in their gift , as the reward of all these things , does it not place him upon such a pinnacle of moral grandeur and elevation , as to dwarf *blood-bolteredh eroes , " and monarchs " by the grace of God , " into the veriest pigmies beside him ? Young as he is , too , we can be equally proud of the gentleman placed upon the ticket beside him , for Vice-President of the United States . John C. Breckenridge , of Kentucky , is a man of extraordinary character and ability ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most convincing proof of the fact . In native genius and personal energy he has never been surpassed by any man in the country . Our space warns us that we must refuse ourselves , in this connection , the pleasure of tracing his private history , and that of his public life is so fresh in the minds of all as to render it unnecessary for us to repeat it . It is sufficient to remark that he has long been the pride and idol of his native State , and that his character and talents have gained such an ascendant in Kentucky as to conquer even the political // cal hatreds and antagonisms of party warfare , nowhere more violent than in that State . It is said that Henry Clay , himself voted for him when he ran first for Congress , and on the different occasions when his name has been presented he has beaten the two most popular Whigs in Kentucky . With such a record his success in November can not be doubtful . But were the men , thus presented , less illustrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enemies themselves being judges , they confessedly are , who can doubt for a moment their success , when they consider the platform upon which the Convention has placed them ? Let it be remembered also that that platform is simply the echo of the life-long opinions of the nominees . Not a principle put forth in it ; not a purpose declared by it but agrees perfectly with the entire record of their lives . It is not presented for their approval . It is riot submitted as a thing to be weighed , and pondered , and considered by them . It is a simple and concise rejiction and formalization of those grand fundamental Democratic rules and principles which have guided and controlled their lives , as they have that of the great and only aational party which has preferred them to the post of generals in this its ultimate campaign against every form of fanaticism , treason , and disunion . And with what a frank outspoken bravery that platform meets every issue tendered to the Democratic party by its opponents ? How gloriously it contrasts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abolitionists , Black Republicans , and Know-Nothings whose only common bond and tie is hatred of the great cardinal Democratic principle of the right and capacity of man for self-government I It seeks no shelter behind compromises or concessions . It evades nothing ; it conceals nothing ; it grants nothing to fanaticism or error . It stands like the Angel of the flaming sword at the portals of the Constitution , and waves away every foolish aggressor . Having reaffirmed the Baltimore platform of 1852 , it proceeds to brand with words of calm but fervid scorn the wicked folly of KnowNothingism , and resolves that it is an insult to America and a desecration of her name to apply it to a party " which bases its exclusive organization upon religious opinions and accidental birth-place . " It pronounces the principles of the Kansas-Nebraska act to be the fundamental principles of American Democracy , as in his speech at Baltimore , May 12th , Mr. Buchanan had already pronounced them " the elementary principle of a Democratic republic . " " I hold it , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people can long // continue to contest the elementary republican principles recognized in the territorial legislation of Congress . This is nothing more than the power possessed by the people of every free State since the world began . It is the foundation  --  the elementary principle of a Democratic iRepublic . " " Without a cheerful submission to the will of the majority no democratic government can exist . We have thus reached the end , or to use an expressive Americanism , the finality of our legislation on this subject . " The right of man to govern himself , and cheerful submission to the will of the majority-here rests the corner-stone of Democracy . And against this stone , this terrible rock of offense , surge and foam and roar the waves of the opposition . Call themselves by what name they may : invoke what deity soever they will to receive their worshipthe single principle animating and combining all the diverse and hetereogenous elements of the opposition is opposition to the will of the majority . They erect a certain rule and standard of right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions of men . Within its pale is safety ; beyond it hopeless damnation . Whoever accept it , are by that act constituted a species of elect people to govern all other people . Whoever reject it are to be given over straightway to the uncovenanted mercies . Thus their " higher law " rises not only above the Constitution , but superior to the will of the majority ; it not only offers a reward to treason , but clearly proposes to constitute the government of the United States on a new principle , and replace a general Democracy by a special anti-slavery oligarchy . Such , in few words , is the whole aim and purpose of all the various factions opposed to the Democracy . Can it be possible that the thinking men of the United States will remain any longer blind to these aims of a few daring and unscrupulous fanatics ? Here are the words of the platform : " Resolved , That we recognize the right of the people of all the territories , including Kansas and Nebraska , acting through the fairly-expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of their inhabitants justifies it , to form a Constitution , with or without domestic slavery , and be admitted into the Union upon terms of perfect equality with the other States . " In the name of reason , of justice , of every principle of free government and natural right , what other rule could be applied to an inchoate political association , organized upon territory of the United States ? What other prospect held out to a // potential State ? Is not the bare supposition of any other the very error of the moon ? Ought not all men who have opposed and traduced us , for very shame be silent henceforth and for ever ? For what have we asserted : to what pledged ourselves ? To nothing but to leave the decision to the people themselves , and to accept without a murmur the will of the majority . Our platform next recognizes the necessity of a safe and speedy means of communication between the Atlantic and Pacillc seaboards of the iRepublic . This , to our mind , is a necessity so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's eyes . With an imperfect and difficult means of communication , we might worry and struggle on in time of peace ; but the moment war declared itself between us and either of the great powers of the world , in how lame and wretched a position should we be placed ! The Isthmus blockaded , and a pathless desert lying between the eastern and western extremities of the Republic ; our internal trade cut off ; our harvest of gold unreaped ; our PacifIc empire exposed , and left to bear unsupported the weight of whatever attack might be directed against it by way of Mexico or the ocean which laves its shores . Words need not be multiplied on the subject . The necessity of the road contemplated by the resolution in the platform , is self-evident ; and it will be the appropriate work of the next Democratic administration and Congress to develop in action the self-evident proposition of the Democratic platform . Our platform next enunciates and enforces the great Democratic doctrine of State Rights , as the only sure guarantee of the continued and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief business , since we assumed the direction of this Review , to argue and present this great and holy principle with whatever force our ability enabled us to use . It is the sheet-anchor of the Republic , and the party which veers its cable to it must ultimately outride in safety every storm of popular violence and sectional fanaticism . This Review is pre&amp;minently a States Rights publication , and on that head the platform simply condenses into a paragraph the points at the illustration and enforcement of which it has long and ardently labored . God send that the American people may once more enforce them by such an overwhelming expression of opinion as shall leave their opponents without a rag of public favor , or public folly , to cover the nakedness of their falsehood to the Constitution and the best interests of the thirty-one sovereign and independent States confederated under it . Nor can the resolutions of the Convention with regard to the // foreign policy of the country , fail to elicit the warmest expression of approbation from every true Democrat and honest lover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for in them lies wrapped the destiny of America : " 1 . Resolved That the questions connected with the foreign policy of the country are inferior to no domestic question whatever . The time has come for the people of the United States to declare themselves in favor of free seas and progressive free trade throughout the world , and , by solemn manifestations , place their moral influence by the side of their successful example . " 2 . Resolved* That our geographical and political position in reference to other States on this continent , no less than the interest of our commerce , and the development of our growing power , requires that we hold sacred the principles involved in the Monroe doctrine , and their binding import , which admits of no misconstruction , and should be applied with unbending rigidity. " 3 . Resolved , That which the great highway of nature as well as the assent of the States most immediately interested in its maintenance has marked out for free communication between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , constitutes one of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unconquerable energy of our people-that result should be secured by timely , efficient exertion and control with the government of the States within whose dominions it lies . We can , under no circumstances , surrender our preponderance to the adjustment of all questions arising out of it . " 4 . Resolved , That in view of such commanding interest , the people of the United States can not but sympathize with the efforts which are being made by the people of Central America to regenerate that portion of the continent which covers a passage across the oceanic Isthmus . " 5 . Resolved , That the Democratic party will expect of the next administration that every effort be made to insure an ascendency. in the Gulf of Mexico  --  to maintain a permanent protection of the great outlets through which is emptied into its waters the products raised upon our soil , and the commodities created by the industry of the people in our Western valleys and the Union at large. ** Here is a plain , a significant declaration in favor of freedom of trade throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Monroe doctrine to this continent , and , if necessary , to compel all foreign powers to recognize and // 53* respect it ; of the necessity  --  the immediate and paramount necessity of our acquiring and maintaining the undivided possession and control of the transit across the Isthmus of Panama ; of honest and unequivocal sympathy with the people of Central America , in their efforts after regulated freedom ; and , finally , a direction to the next Democratic Administration to make the Gulf of Mexico what it should long since have been , and what hereafter it must be-let who will say nay ! - an American Lake ! Here , then , is our platform-bold , plain , comprehensive , national ! And upon it we have placed two of the foremost men of all the time and nation : men capable of carrying it out into successful action ; men determined to carry it out ; men whose yea is yea , and whose nay , nay ! and who , superior to fear or favor ; neither to be awed by danger , seduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on , and fearlessly discharge their duty to the whole country . Is there a sane man from Maine to San Francisco ; is there a lover of the Constitution of the United States ; is there one who has any stake in the country , who has any thing to lose by the disturbance of those happy relationships which now subsist between the different States ; is there one who reveres the wisdom and goodness of our fathers , the wise and patriotic framers of our system of Government-is there , in short , any good citizen who , in this crisis1 will refuse to vote for JAMES BUCHANAN and JOHN C. BRECKENRIDGE ? Every sentiment of our hearts , every conviction of our judgment forbid us to believe that any good man , and real patriot , can hesitate for an instant in his support of this , the only national and conservative ticket offered to the people of the United States .
