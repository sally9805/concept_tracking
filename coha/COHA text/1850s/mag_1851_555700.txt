ART . II . - The Seven Lamps of Architecture . By JOHN RUSKIN , Author of " Modern Painters . " With Illustrations drawn and etched by the Author . New York : John Wiley. 1849. l2mo. pp. 186 . LIKE the other fine arts , architecture is a spontaneous product of a cultivated mind ; one of the fruits of our spiritual nature , one of the privileges of our birthright . In the edifices which man builds for his own habitation , or for national uses , or for the ceremonies of religion , he aims at something beyond mere convenience and utility , even at the expression of ideas of beauty and grandeur , something that will contribute to his joy , will elevate and dignify him , and serve as a fit representative of his hopes and belief . Like the other arts , this attends the course of a nation 's power and intelligence , and forms ( as we shall see hereafter ) one of the most striking and important indications of its condition . In one view , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the comfort and convenience of man , and requiring the most practical skill in order to realize its ideas . In another , it is the most ideal , since it finds in nature few or no models , - in its ornaments even , borrowing from nature the elements rather than the perfect shape . In its grander forms , it is immeasurably more vast than the sister arts , and demands the aid of national resources to complete its designs ; but then it repays this aid by bearing most public and permanent witness to the liberality of its authors , defying for ages the power of the elements , and bearing down from one generation to another the name and fame of its builders , mysteriously uniting different centuries , ever awakening our profoundest meditations , and contributing ( how much ! ) to our moral sensibilities . Like the other arts , it has its schools and its orders . Considered as the representative of religious ideas , it has been divided into the two great classes of heathen and Christian ; or , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gothic . Sometimes it assumes a national nomenclature , as Egyptian , or Grecian , or Moorish , or Italian . These , too , are subdivided according to the peculiarities of some prominent member , as the column or the arch ; and we have the Doric order , with its short columns and // massive simplicity ; the Ionic , with lighter columns and the graceful volute of its capitals ; and the Corinthian , with pillars still more slender , crowned with the gorgeous acanthus . The Gothic , too , though not divided into orders , like the Grecian , still has its flat arch and its pointed arch , and many other peculiarities , by which the patient student determines when and by whom the structure was raised . Of . the different kinds of architecture , there are some general characteristics which may he easily recognized , even though the ideas which they express are not distinctly before the mind . Every nation whose architecture is living , has originated that which gives it peculiarity . To the Egyptian belongs the pyramid and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its vertical line of hieroglyphics , - the former , a vast pile , expressive , both by its shape and hulk , of simple weight and stability . Their temples suggest , as the most prominent ideas , permanence and mystery . Ohelisks , with their undeciphered hieroglyphics , and sphinxes , with their placid , eni*matic countenances , guard the sepulchral doors ; no window pierces the massive walls ; the whole is like a prison or a tomb . The Greek , though borrowing his arts as well as his letters from Egypt , knew how to endue them with a fresh and exquisite form , and hreathe into them the breath of a new life . Around the solid cell of the temple he raised the light and airy colonnade ; upon the pediment he erected statues of gods and heroes ; along the frieze he stretched the fabled Centaurs and LapithEe , and beneath it hung the shields of those who had returned victorious from battle . There was little of the seclusion and mystery of the Egyptian . Nothing that art could do , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present renown , or their love of the beautiful , or their religious instincts , was omitted to render the temple the centre of every affection , the emblem of the mind and heart of the nation . Every part of the Grecian edifice has a relation to the whole , and is instinct with life . Nothing is superfluous or unfit . The unbroken horizontal line of the long entablature at once catches the eye , and gives the impression of stability and weight , to which the abundant colunins are ever opposing their sufficient support ; so that it delights us with the tranquil harmony of its expression , so simple as to be easily comprehended , so perfect in beauty as // never to weary the eye , never grow old to the mind . Its workmen wrought with exquisite skill ; the stones were united with the most beautiful accuracy ; and even at this distance of time , a new principle is every now and then discovered to attest both the profound knowledge and the delicate practice of the marvellous builders . The Greek style was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south of France . At P*stum , a day 's jqurney south of Naples , was erected the magnificent temple to Neptune , which now , thousands of years since it was built , forms , in the solitude of the deserted campagna , one of the most impressive memorials which Italy contains . At Nismes , in the south of France , are carefully cherished , are even used , at this day , the temples and amphitheatres which Greeks and Romans built . The Romans were destitute of the requisite material in which Attica abounded ; there was no Pentelicus near Rome ; hence , had their genius equalled that of the Greeks , they could not easily have rivalled their structures . They built sometimes of brick , oftener of stone ; but their purposes were different from those of the Greeks , and they produced different effects . They needed not only the temple with its narrow adyium , hut the vaster enclosure , in which half the population of the city might , if necessary , congregate . Then rose their amphitheatre , with columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vanishing curves , and the vast oval of its interior , and its retreating circles of seats on which a hundred thousand could sit , and from which all could depart without jostling or delaying each other . Then rose the vast expanse of the Pantheon , whose beautiful dome now hangs over the statues of saints , as once it overhung the shrines of all the gods to whom Agrippa , twenty-seven years B. C. , devoted it . To show how well they built , with what a grand purpose too , with what an idea of the permanent nature of their work , it may be remembered that the original bronze doors still swing upon the hinges where they were hung one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven years ago , and every stone remains as the architect placed it , though Constantine II . carried its tiles of gilded bronze to Constantinople in 663 , and Pope Urban VIII. , in the seventeenth century , took 45,000 pounds of bronze from its portico . With the prevalence of Christianity and the changed condition // of society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be performed only within an enclosure entirely protected . The structure began to be emblematic of the faith ; the church expanded in the form of the cross , a form not only fit as an emblem , but admirably adapted to architectural effect , ( especially interior effects , which now came to be carefully considered , ) and equally fitted to the convenience of worship . The extended open space at the meeting of the arms of the cross naturally suggested , especially to people living much in the open air , the idea of an elevated expanse . " I will hang the dome of the Pantheon , " said M. Angelo , " in mid-heaven . " I3runelleschi , the architect of Santa Maria at Florence , had already done something like it . In obedience to the word , rose the dome of St. Peter , fretted and blazing within , like the vault of heaven , and shedding down , through the numerous windows in the dome , a flood of light upon the crowd beneath , the images of saints , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many places rose the campanile , a belfry tower , two of which especially , the leaning tower at Pisa and the campanile of Giotto at Florence , are famous as wonders of the world . Then , too , was sometimes added the baptistery , with its marble fonts . About the same time , the domestic and civil architecture assumed a permanent form . Palaces , dark , sombre , and froxvning , strong as fortresses , yet grand and magnificent as the residence of princes , adorned and dignified the cities , while the hills were crowned with castles . In the mean time , the northern countries , whose severer climate , by depriving their inhabitants of the free life of the south , made them more meditative , and cultivated their romantic tastes ; whose position , too , removed from the centres of the eastern and the western empires , made them more independent , and gave a chance for original products , gave birth to that complicated , vast , and various style of architecture which we generally term Gothic . Here are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no dark enclosed cell ; no clear daylight exterior , faultless in its simple proportions ; but a wonderful and intricate pile , shooting heavenward in countless pinnacles , its main spires risin0 to the utmost limit of architectural skill and daring , its exterior supported with solid or flying buttresses , to resist the horizontal pressure of the // massive roof , and ornamented with a profusion of pinnacles and statues , and grotesque figures , and delicate fret-work , - its interior open to the highest point of the roof . The " garish eye of day " shut out , and with it the noise of the outer world , a " dun religious light " streaming down from " stained windows richly dight " - every thing calling the mind to conteniplation , to reserve , to worship . " The cathedral , ' says an eloquent writer , is to be considered rather as a forethought than as a finished specimen . It exhibits the effort that has been made to embody those abstract ideas of solemnity and grandeur , which could not be fully realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not failed . Gothic architecture appeals to the imagination , and fancy half supplies the deficiencies of the material scene . A Gothic building has always the charm of mystery ; it always appears to be larger than its actual dimensions . The mouldings , the pillars , the arches , always create receding shadows ; and to the mind the idea of space arises from a succession of shadows , just as a conception of time results from the succession of ideas . In the earlier Gothic styles , the management of the aerial tints was studied with remarkable skill The Gothic style always us the eye , and conveys the notion of comprehension and capacity . Habitation , and converse , and congregational worship beneath its roof , are seen to be its intent . We are invited to enter into the cathedral . The portals expand , and in the long perspective which appears between the pillars of the porch , and ends in the distant choir , the light darts downwards through the lofty unseen windows , each marked by its slanting beam of luminous haze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translucent gloom . Gothic architecture is an organic whole , bearing within it a living , vegetating germ . Its parts and lines are linked and united ; they spring and grow out of each other . Its essence is the curve , which in the physical world is the token of life or organized matter , just as the straight line indicates death or inorganized matter . It is a combination of arches , whose circles may be infinitely folded , multiplied , and embraced . Hence the parts of a Gothic building maybe expanded indefinitely , without destroying its unity . however multiplied and combined , they still retain their relative bearing ; however repeated , they never encumber each other . All the arched openings , the tall mullioned windows , the recessed doors , are essential parts ; they do not pierce the walls of the structure ; on the contrary , they bind them together . The spire may rise aloft , the large and massy walls may lengthen along the soil ; but still the building preserves its consistency . // Richness of decorations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic style ; but the inventor chiefly relies upon his art and science . Gravitation , which could bring the stone to the ground . is the power which fixes it in the archivolt , and every pinnacle bears witness to the mastery which the architect has gained . Frequently the details are bad . Parts considered by themselves are often destitute of beauty ; but they are always relevant , and all minor faults are lost in the merits of the entirety . The history of the style accounts for its propriety , its chiefest merit . Gothic architecture , whatever its primitive elements may have been , was created in the northern parts of Europe ; it was there adapted to the wants of a more inclement sky . Its structures were destined for the religious worship of the people amongst whom it was matured . In a Gothic church , no idea can possibly arise save that of Christianity and of the rites of Christianity . We can not desecrate it even in thought . From its mode of construction , no convenience which we need , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every emblem or ornament which its use requires . " London Quarterly Review , July , 182* . No style of architecture is , therefore , so free as this ; none other admits of such elaborate and fanciful detail . The most luxuriant fancy of the architect had the fullest scope , the grand religious impression of the whole fearlessly authorizing accessaries the most various and peculiar . And who were the architects ? We do not know that there has come down to us the name of a single builder of any of the hundreds of churches which rise all over Germany , and the northern part of France , and Belgium , and England , in such variety , ( no two being alike , ) and with such indubitable evidence of the genius and skill of their authors . Perhaps they were conceived and planned by ecclesiastics , whose life was so swallowed up in that of the church they served , that their names and individual existence were thought of little consequence . They received their reward in the very processes and effects of their art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unfrequently , by the guilds of masons , which , we know , existed in almost every country during the middle ages , and who had their secret craft and enjoyed particular privileges . However that may be , they built with an amazing economy of time and expense , and a large exhibition of manual skill and mechanical knowledge . Still , centuries were sometimes re // quired for completing the works which they began in faith , and carried on in love . Many are yet unfinished . There was a fine sentiment , as it seems to us , in leaving , on the incomplete tower of the cathedral at Cologne , the crane with which the stones were raised , and renewing it when it decayed , that it might ever stand as a mute prophet of unfulfilled purpose . It is almost as impossible to exaggerate the beauty of many of these structures , as it is to conceive their various effects , viewed in all the conditions each one is capable of ; from below and above , when the sunlight of morning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , the spire ; or within , where great masses of light and of shade meet and mingle , and overwhelm the observer with a sense of vastness , and thought , and mysterious , solemn beauty . To erect a structure of lath and plaster , which becomes superannuated at fifty years , which every wind of heaven makes creak and shiver , is excusable for those who must build something , and can not afford to build any thing better ; but we can not expect the full effect of architecture in such an edifice , nor should we blame the art or judge it harshly , if we fail to receive from it the expected lesson . Yet we need not look for nor resort to any recondite argun-rent to show the power of this art . What traveller has not garnered up , among the most precious treasures of his memory , the hours when first he saw some of those grand relics of former labors ? - the hour when , entering the Porta Cavallegieri at midnight , a full moon throwing its silver light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself , all unawares , before the circling colonnade of St. Peter 's ? or when , wandering he knew not where , through the grass-grown streets of the silent city , he suddenly stood before the majestic front , beneath the frowning cornices , of the Farnese Palace ? or when for the first time he rested upon the upper seats of the Coliseum , or wandered through its vaulted passages ? or paused in the great quadrangle of the Ducal Palace at Venice ? or heard , at gray twilight , the receding echoes in the baptistery at Pisa ? or looked upon the dim old pictures in the Campo Santo ? Can he forget the hour , when , fresh from the new world , he stood before the vast and wonderful front of the cathedral at Rouen ? or , when , journeying homeward , sated // and wearied with a lengthened pilgrimage , having all day skirted the borders of the Black Forest , he saw from far the beautiful spire of the minster of Freyburg , and hastened to repose beneath the grateful shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he better have plodded and dug at home . History , for him , has no grandeur ; art , no glories . Perhaps no work of man awakens so strong a sympathy with the past - a sympathy with our race , indeed , and a wise meditation - as a building , which for hundreds of years has received the successive * , generation s of men ; has looked down on their business , their sufferings , their glory , and seen it all pass away . The earth is old , but its age does not affect us so strongly , for it shows few signs of age ; it renews itself every year , and is constantly changed by the active energy of man . Our eyes do not see the same world that our fathers looked on , or else it is so much the same that we . forget the time that has rolled away . Hence , too , of different buildings , one produces a stronger effect than another ; the ruins of the Parthenon , where art lavished her powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less touched by time , and less capable of indicating its ravages . We have sometimes thought that , in connection with any public institution , especially an institution for education , a really fine building , standin0 a0e after age , as a kind of visible representative of the spirit of the place , the religio loci , is a more valuable education of the finer sensibilities , and of temperate and just thought , than books or teachers . Especially would this power he felt , as a country grew older , and could look back to a long line of distinguished men ; and , every college would gather . up the name and fame of its alumni , as its choice treasures . To remember the great and good , who once walked along these aisles and toiled in those chambers , does something to fortify one against indolence , something to prompt him to good resolutions and earnest labor . Charles Lamb refers beautifully to this intangible , and somewhat indefinite , but strong effect , in his Recollections of Christ 's Hospital , when speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the antiquity and regality of the foundation to which he belongs ; by his old and awful cloisters , with their traditions ; by his spacious school-rooms ; by his stately dining hall , hung round with pictures by Verrio and Lely ; " by the 26 * // remembrances which went back to the very founder , " that godly and royal child , King Edward VI. , the flower of the Tudor name  --  the young flower that was untimely cropped , as it began to fill our land with its early odors - the boy-patron of boys - the serious and holy child , who walked with Cranmer and Ridley , fit associate , in those tender years , for the bishops and future martyrs of the church , to receive or ( as occasion sometimes proved ) to give instruction . " Should we not , therefore , look with more favor upon efforts for the construction of an edifice in connection with a public institution , where architectural skill and taste might find full scope , than upon the erection of plain , if not unsightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last are absolutely required ? Should we not build , too , upon the best plan and in the best way , so far as the means will allow , and then wait for a future day to complete the design ? Thus far , we have spoken rather loosely of the prominent styles and general effects of this earliest of the constructive arts . But the question arises , whether there are not certain laws derivable from the nature of the mind , from the very character of that intellectual delight and profit which the art affords , - certain principles , which must have lain in the minds of the great builders and given birth to their works , which will enable us to understand their merits , and which , when felt , will be the best assurance of excellent products in their art hereafter . To answer these questions , and to exhibit some of these " laws which are based upon man 's nature , not upon his knowledge , " is the object of the volume whose title we have placed at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has bound us with a spell too strong to be easily broken , and too delightful to be resisted . If it sometimes attenuates the thought beyond our power to follow it ; if it stretches a point to carry out a preconceived notion ; if even it occasionally substitutes imagination for fact , - to prove which , however , would require an observation as accurate and an affection as true as its author everywhere exhibits , but which certain unaccountable heresies in the " Modern Painters " might lead us to anticipate , - all is amply atoned for by the generous and noble thoughts , the delicacy , the beauty and truth , so elegantly exhibited and enforced , as well as by the glory thrown over the grand art itself by // speculations so subtle , yet so large . Whether its technical distinctions be true or false , its nomenclature philosophical or otherwise , matters little , compared with the refining and ele-. vating influence it must exercise upon the public taste . It has a worth beyond and above the power of technicalities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mullion , transept and apse , are little better than words of a barbarian ; many to whom , from want of opportunity or of study , the pages of minute and learned criticism will be of the least value or interest . And so far as our own country is concerned , we think it of much importance to give a wise direction to the awakening taste . One need not travel far to become convinced of the increasing interest taken in architecture , both public and domestic . In our quiet villages , there have risen many a tower and spire , such as , in spite of the frail material of which they are built , it does us good to look upon ; such as it is a joy and blessing even to pass near in our daily ways and walks ; such as it brings the light into the eyes to see from far , lifting their fair heights above the crowd of humble roofs . That there has been much that is extravagant , and fantastical , and in bad taste , we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are not slow to discover the germ of something better ; at least the aspiring mind , dissatisfied with the present , and earnest for the future , ready for instruction , and grateful for it when bestowed . It has been far enough from our purpose to give a dissertation on architecture . We would rather direct our readers to a brief analysis of the volume of Mr. Ruskin , although we are aware how dry and unsatisfactory is an abstract of a work in which the imagination plays a part so conspicuous . To exhibit the ideas of the author , it will fortunately be necessary to quote liberally from the book itself , and to use its phrases even where it would be difficult to acknowledge then ) . The first of these guiding principles , which are dignified by the attractive but obscure name of " Lamps of Architecture , " is the Spirit of Sacrifice . " Architecture , " says Mr. Ruskin , " is the art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by man , for whatsoever uses , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and pleasure . " It is distinguished from building , because that has reference merely to the convenience // and comfort of a structure , and its general fitness to the practical end for which it is designed . Architecture concerns those characteristics of an edifice which are above or beyond its common use . It may he arranged under five heads , according to the purposes to which buildings are devoted , - devotional , memorial , civil , military , and domestic . With respect to all these kinds , but particularly to devotional and memorial architecture , the spirit of sacrifice , ( to state the idea as strongly as possible , ) offers such things " as are precious simply because they are precious , not because they are useful or necessary . " " Of two marbles , for instance , equally beautiful and durable , it chooses the more costly , because it is so ; and of two kinds of decoration equally effective , it would choose the more elaborate , because it was so , in order that it might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " This is the opposite of the feeling , which , with true commercial sagacity , seeks to produce the most at the cheapest rate ; but it is the feeling which has prevailed whenever and wherever art has produced its noblest products , - a feeling similar to that which prompted David not to accept the threshing-floor and oxen of Araunah as a gift , but to buy it . " Neither will I offer bnrnt*offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing . " This idea the author finds developed and illustrated in the ancient Jewish services as ordained by God : in the blue and purple and scarlet hangings ; the brass and silver and gold of the tabernacle and the temple ; and this , notwithstanding the danger that a sensuous people would he led by this external splendor - certainly were in imminent danger ot being led - to idolatry . " Yet against this mortal danger provision was not made in one way , ( to maa 's thoughts the simplest , the most natural , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine Being whatever could delight the sense , or shape the imagination , or limit the idea of Deity to place . This one way God refused , demanding for himself such honors , and accepting for himself such local dwelling , as had been paid and dedicated to idol gods by heathen worshippers ; and for what reason ? Was the glory of the tabernacle necessary to set forth or image his divine glory to the minds of his people ? What ! purple or scarlet necessary to the people who had seen the great river of Egypt run scarlet to the sea , under his condemnation ? What ! golden lamp and // cherub necessary for those who had seen the fires of heaven falling like a mantle on Mount Sinai , and its golden courts opened to receive their mortal lawgiver ? What ! silver clasp and fillet necessary , when they had seen the silver waves of the Red Sea clasp in their arched hollows the corpses of the horse and his rider ? Nay - not so . There was but one reason , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with men was accompanied with some external sign of its continuance , and of his remembrance of it , so the acceptance of that covenant might be marked and signified by use , in some external sign of their love and obedience , and surrender of themselves and theirs to his will ; and that their gratitude to him , and continual remembrance of him , might have at once , their expression and their enduring testimony in the presentation to him , not only of the firstlings of the herd and fold , not only of the fruits of the earth and the tithe of time , but of all treasures of wisdom and beauty ; of the thought that invents , and the hand that labors ; of wealth of wood , and weight of stone ; of the strength of iron , and of the light of gold . " It was this spirit of ready and generous contribution , of patient and affectionate labor , which raised , in other days , structures whose costliness , however great , was but their smallest praise ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general love , and which received back the rich recompense of him who gives not grudgingly , hut cheerfully . " Do not think the feeling a folly , or the act itself useless . Of what use was that dearly bought water of the well of Bethlehem , with which the King of Israel slaked the dust of Adullarn ? Yet was not this better than if he had drunk it ? Of what use was that passionate act of Christian sacrifice , against which , first uttered by the false tongue , the very objection we would now conquer took a sullen tone forever ? " * Religion may not need the arts , hut the arts need the exalting influence of religion ; to its service , in order to flourish most , they must be devoted " by both architect and employer ; by the one , in scrupulous , earnest , affectionate design ; by the other , in expenditure at least more frank , less calculating , than that which he would admit in the indulgence of his own private feelings . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money merely , but of mind , of long thought , // of the fulness of intellectual strength ; not the spirit which lets itself out for hire , but which , without recompense , finds its chief joy irs the ideal perfection of its work ; the spirit of Michael Angelo , when he undertook the building of St. Peter 's for the honor of God , and with an express stipulation that he should receive no pay ; which made Haydn ( to draw an illustration from another art ) inscribe on the paper when he sat down to compose his greatest works , Soli Deo gloria ; which leads the workman on the cornice or the frieze , which not one eye in ten thousand will notice , to be as careful and conscientious as if every thing depended on him . This spirit evidently will secure the full power of the artist s mind upon the work . He will do his best ; he will not work beneath his strength . This it is which is so beautiful to see in the structures which excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresher , the more numerous , the more delicate , the more surprising the beauties which we detect . The wonderful exuberance of the carving ; the immense multiplication of the figures , not always done well , but done with a good will , with pains .. taking , with love ; the delicate lines carried up to the very top of the spire , beyond the reach of any eye but his who would climb to see them , - all attest the care that nothing should be slighted ; all show the faith and zeal of the times . " Those fair fronts of variegated mosaic , charged with wild fancies and dark hosts of imagery , thicker and quninter than ever filled the depth of midsummer dream ; those vaulted gates , trellised with close leaves ; those window.labyrinths of twisted tracery and starry light ; those misty masses of multitudinous pinnacles and diademed tower , are the only witnesses , perhaps , that remain to us of the faith and fear of nations . All else , for which the builders sacrificed , has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and achievements . We know not for what they labored , and we see no evidence of their reward , victory , wealth , authority , happiness ; - all have departed , though bought by many a bitter sacrifice . But of them and their life and their toil upon the earth , one reward , one evidence , is left to us in those gray heaps of deep.wrought stone . They have taken with them to the grave their powers , their honor , and their errors ; but they have left us their adoration . " p. 24 . From the Lamp of Sacrifice we pass to The Lamp of Truth . This principle requires the avoidance of all archi // tectural deceit . As moral truth lies at the foundation of every valuable character ; as , too , we feel the injury , not only of open falsehood , which we may detect and crush , but still more perhaps of the habit of careless untruthfulness , through which we gradually become indifferent to the beauty and glory of truth itself ; so in art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle is remembered or forgotten . Conscientiousness must be a quality of the artist as truly as any intellectual or mechanical skill ; and pretence , conceal .. ment , and deceit are to he as much avoided in building as in every thing else . Although this general rule will hold , there is , as a little reflection will show , considerable delicacy and difficulty in its application , the same appliances in different situations producing different effects . Nobody imagines the gilded picture-frame to be gold ; but a gilded ornament in jewelry at once offends as an imposition . Whitewash upon the walls shows what it is ; we understand its purposes ; but if wood by the side of the whitened stone he whitewashed so as to deceive us , it becomes , to a certain extent , offensive . A painted wall may be perfectly proper , indeed , indispensable to neatness and propriety ; but it may be a perpetual lie , forever mocking the eye , and as soon as detected , degrading the whole structure , taking away from what is real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved frame pleases us in proportion to the skill and beauty and difficulty of the work ; but a frame with moulded ornaments , a mere mechanical work , cheapens and vilifies every similar thing we set eyes on , whose honest and substantial excellence we can not at once detect . Diamonds themselves are cheapened by paste . The evil of architectural deceptions is considered by the author under three heads . 1 . " The suggestion of a mode of structure or support , other than the true one ; as in the pendants of late Gothic roofs . " 2 . " The painting of surfaces to represent some other material than that of which they actually consist , ( as in the marbling of wood , ) or the deceptive representation of sculptured ornament upon them . " 3 . " The use of cast or machine-made ornaments of any kind . Now it may be broadly stated , that architecture will be noble exactly in the degree in which all these false expedients are avoided . " Omitting the first of these heads , as less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second , - surface-deceits . The most reprehensible of these is the false representation of material , as of wood turned into marble or granite , and yet in a score of ways betraying the deception . Any such imitation of a precious or costly material may be tolerated , perhaps , in a cheap structure , where it is perfectly innocent of giving any higher impression than that of a tolerable or a vile imitation ; but introduce it into architecture of a high rank , a structure of cost and beauty , and how it dishonors the whole ! Especially is this painful in churches , where every thing ought to be true , above disguises , above falsehood . A plainly colored wall , whose mild tint will not dazzle the eye , is far to be preferred to the so-called fresco architectural paintings , which are forever puzzling us to detect what is true and what is false , or making us wonder at the singular freak of nature , which casts the shadows in the very face of the sun . We do hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our churches has had its day . Arches , and columns , and vistas behind the pulpit are bad on every account . As mere architectural drawings , they are false and painful to every eye but the one in the proper point of vision ; while to every just mind they appear generally as a glaring absurdity , and always as a perplexing and distracting deceit . But this may not be thought a matter of much consequence - " Perhaps not to religion ( though I can not but believe that there are many to whom , as to myself , such things are serious obstacles to the repose of mind and temper which should precede devotional exercises ) ; but to the general tone of our judgment and feeling - yes ; for assuredly we shall regard with tolerance , if not with affection , whatever forms of material things we have been in the habit of associating with our worship , and be little prepared to detect or blame hypocrisy , meanness , and disguise in other kinds of decoration , when we suffer objects belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a fashion so fictitious and unseemly. " p. 41 . And afterwards , on the subject of false ornament , the author goes on to say with a pardonable vehemence : - " Exactly as a woman of feeling would not wear false jewels , so would a builder of honor disdain false ornaments . The using of them is just as downright and inexcusable a lie . You use that which pretends to a worth it has not ; which pretends to have a // cost , and to be , what it did not , and is not ; it is an imposition , a vulgarity , an impertinence , and a sin . Down with it to the ground , grind it to powder , leave its ragged place upon the wall rather ; you have not paid for it , you have no business with it , you do not want it . Nobody wants ornaments in this world , but everybody wants integrity . All the fair devices that ever were fancied are not worth a lie . Leave your walls as bare as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or chopped straw , if need be ; but do not rough.cast them with falsehood. " p. 45 . There is not time to indicate here , how far the general principle is applicable to structures , which , instead of being thoroughly what they seem , are only veneerings of stone , the mass of the wall being of some cheaper material ; or which lift a bold front of stone , while the body of brick retreats and hides itself , as well as it can , from observation . Nor yet can another and broader application of the principle be more than noticed , - namely , that every order of architecture has its laws , and exhibits certain effects ; and when , for any reason , it forsakes these , it becomes untrue to itself and begins to decline . " So fell the great dynasty of the medieval architecture . It was because it had lost its own strength , and disobeyed its own laws , - because its order , and consistency , and organization had been broken through , so that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was not the robber , not the fanatic , not the blasphemer , who sealed the destruction that they had wrought ; the war , the wrath , the terror , might have worked their worst , and the strong walls would have risen , and the light pillars would have started again from under the hand of the destroyer . But they could not rise out of the ruins of their own violated truth . " pp. 55,56 . The Lamp of Power . This principle of architectural expression is the result of whatever quality in a building enables it to seize firm hold of the imagination , or rather of whatever quality is not included within the province of beauty . It may be the simple magnitude of the building , or the massiveness of separate stones , or its towering height , or its shape so ordered that the eye can easily take in the whole . The development of this idea , however , we are compelled to pass with this brief allusion . The Lamp of Beauty , too , the fourth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most prominent aims // of all architecture , that we might dismiss it with a word ; arid indeed this is almost necessary , unless we would discuss the topic to its utmost extent , for the subject is intimately connected with the whole consideration of beauty in the arts . lit is treated in this volume under the heads of Beauty of Ornament , Beauty of Design , and Beauty of Color . Some of the remarks on the place of beauty are worthy of much attention . Nature pleases us hy appealing at the same time to many of our senses , and by presenting to them at once a great variety of delightful objects . The architect can select from these hut a single subject , and represent it in a severe and inflexible material . " Now let us consider for an instant what would be the effect of continually repeating an expression of a beautiful thought to any other of the senses at times when the mind could not address that sense to the understanding of it . Suppose that in time of serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our ears continually some favorite passage of poetry , over and over again , all day long . We should not only soon be utterly sick and weary of the sound of it , but that sound would at the end of the day have so sunk into the habit of the ear , that the entire meaning of the passage would be dead to us , and it would ever thenceforward require some effort to fix and recover it . The music of it would not meanwhile have aided the business in hand , while its own delightfulness would thenceforward be in a measure destroyed . It is the same with every other form of definite thought . If you violently present its expression to the senses , at times when the mind is otherwise engaged , that expression will be ineffective at the time , and will have its sharpness and clearness destroyed for ever . Much more if you present it to the mind at times when it is painfully affected or disturbed , or if you associate the expression of pleasant thought with incongruous circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . " Apply this to expressions of thought received by the eye . Remember that the eye is at your mercy more than the ear . The eye , it can not choose but see . ' Its nerve is not so easily numbed as that of the ear , and it is often busied in tracing and watching forms when the ear is at rest . Now , if you present lovely forms to it when it can not call the mind to help it in its work , and among objects of vulgar use and unhappy position , you will neither please the eye nor elevate the vulgar object . But you will fill and weary the eye with the beautiful form , and you will infect that form itself with the vulgarity of the thing to which you // have violently attached it . It will never be of ' much use to you any more ; you have killed or defiled it ; its freshness and purity are gone . You will have to pass it through the fire of much thought before you will cleanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will revive . " Hence then a general law , of singular importance in the present day , a law of simple common sense , - not to decorate things belonging to purposes of active and occupied life . Wherever you can rest , there decorate ; where rest is forbidden , so is heauty . You must not mix ornament with business , any more than you may mix play . Work first , and then rest . Work first , and then gaze , but do not use golden ploughshares , nor bind ledgers in enamel . Do not thrash with sculptured flails ; nor put bas-reliefs on millstones . What ! it will be asked ; are we in the habit of doing so ? Even so ; always and everywhere . The most familiar position of Greek mouldings in these days is on shop fronts . There is not a tradesman 's sign , nor shelf , nor counter in all the streets of all our cities , which has not upon it ornaments which were invented to adorn temples and beautify kings ' palaces . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absolutely valueless - utterly without the power of giving pleasure , they only satiate the eye , and vulgarize their own forms . Many of these are in themselves thoroughly good copies of fine things , which things themselves we shall never , in consequence , enjoy any more . " pp. 97 , 98 . The Lamp of Lift . The principle next in order is that which requires in architecture the evidence of a measure of creative energy , a vivid expression of the intellectual life which has been concerned in its production . There is a deep truth in this , applicable to far other things than architecture , a truth which we can better feel than describe . In the discussion of it in the volume before us , one fact is so blended with another , and the whole so dependent on illustrations , that we can hardly find a passage brief enough for quotation , which will indicate the author 's course of thought . We will take , however , as coming nearest to our wishes , the closing remarks on the cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , respecting all ornament , is simply this : Was it done with enjoyment - was the carver happy while he was about it ? It may be the hardest work possible , and the harder because so much pleasure was taken in it ; but it must have been happy too , or it will not be living . How much of the stonemason 's toil this condition would exclude , I // hardly venture to consider , but the condition is absolute . There is a Gothic church , lately built near Rouen , vile enough , indeed , in its general composition , but excessively rich in detail ; many of the details are designed with taste , and all evidently by a man who has studied old work closely . But it is all as dead as leaves in December ; there is not one tender touch , not one warm stroke , on the whole facade . The men who did it hated it , and were thankful when it was done . And so long as they do so , they are merely loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlastings in Pdre in Chaise are more cheerful ornaments . You can not get the feeling by paying for it - money will not buy life . I am not sure even that you can get it by watching or waiting for it . It is true that here and there a workman may be found who has it in him , but he does not rest contented in the inferior work - he struggles forward into an Academician ; and from the mass of available handicraftsmen the power is gone - how recoverable I know not : this only I know , that all expense devoted to sculptural ornament , in the present condition of that power , comes literally under the head of sacrifice for the sacrifice 's sake , or worse . I believe the only manner of rich ornament that is open to us is the geometrical color-mosaic , and that much might result from our strenuously taking up this mode of design . But , at all events , one thing we have in our power - the doing without machine ornament and cast-iron work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation woods and bronzes , over the invention of which we hear daily exultation - all the short , and cheap , and easy ways of doing that whose difficulty is its honor - are just so many new obstacles in our already encumbered road . They will not make one of us happier or wiser - they will extend neither the pride of judgment nor the privilege of enjoyment . They will only make us shallower in our understandings , colder in our hearts , and feebler in our wits . And most justly . For we are not sent into this world to do any thing into which we can not put our hearts . We have certain work to do for our bread , and that is to be done strenuously ; other work to do for our delight , and that is to be done heartily : neither is to be done by halves or shifts , but with a will ; and what is not worth this effort is not to be done at all . Perhaps all that we have to do is meant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will , and is useless in itself ; but , at all events , the little use it has may well be spared , if it is not worth putting our hands and our strength to . It does not become our immortality to take an ease inconsistent with its authority , nor to suffer any instruments with which it can dispense , to come between it and the things it rules : and he who would form the creations of his own mind by any other instrument than his own hand , would also , if he might , give // grinding organs to Heaven 's angels , to make their music easier . There is dreaming enough , and earthiness enough , and sensuality enough in human existence , without our turning the few glowing moments of it into mechanism ; and since our life must at the best be but a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away , let it at least appear as a cloud in the height of heaven , not as the thick darkness that broods over the blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 144 , 145 . The Lamp of Memory . Between the scenery of a newly discovered country and of a country old and long known , there is always this great difference , that the former , however grand , however vast , however beautiful , has associated with it no human interest . The mountains rise awful and solitary , the lakes expand like crystal mirrors , the virgin fore*ts stretch from the rising to the setting sun ; but they have witnessed none of the struggles of men , neither the birth nor the dissolution of empires ; neither hero , nor sage , nor saint , nor martyr , has dignified or hallowed them by his footsteps . Nothing is so dear to us as close sympathy with our kind ; desert places become populous , heaps of rubbish eloquent , when we know them to have been connected with great achievements , with human glory or suffering . The sympathy is more intense , the imagination more strongly impressed , the moral lessons more weighty , when there are visible and tangible memorials of the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the historical truth and the visible monument . We look off from the pyramid with an interest increased a thousandfold , when we remember that perhaps from that very spot the eye of Plato was once , like ours , turned towards Memphis and old Thebes . Every pillar , every prostrate stone , of the Parthenon is eloquent of the glory , the refinement , the art of Greece . We have an idea of the life of the medkeval times , vivid beyond all former possibility , when we look upon the fortress-like palaces of Florence and Rome , - the dungeons where the Ugolinos perished with hunger , - the squares where the flames curled up around Savonarola the reformer , and Giordano Bruno the philosopher . Now this is one of the grandest results of architecture ; nor can the architect rise to the full effect of his noble art unless he has this purpose of it fully in mind . A thousand years after he is dead , his work proclaims to every * // passer-by , not his skill and toil alone , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a mighty current , have swept by this firm landmark , and left upon it in imperishable outlines the memorials of their thoughts and feelings and deeds . " How cold is all history , how lifeless all imagery , compared to that which the living nation writes , and the uncorrupted marble bears ! How many pages of doubtful record might we not often spare for a few stones left one upon another ! The ambition of the old Babel builders was well directed for this world ; there are hut two strong conquerors of the forgetfulness of men , poetry and architecture ; and the latter in some sort includes the former , and is mightier in its reality ; it is well to have , not only what men have thought and felt , but what their hands have handled and their strength wrought , and their eyes beheld all the days of their life . The age of Homer is surrounded with darkness , his very personality with doubt . Not so that of Pericles ; and the day is coming when we shall confess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbled fragments of her sculpture than even from her sweet singers or soldier historians . " It is this function of architecture , as a representative of age , that imparts to it its highest glory . " And this is a characteristic , " says Mr. Ruskin , " to my mind so essential , that I think a building can not be considered in its prime until four or five centuries have passed over it ; and that the entire choice and arrangement of its details should have reference to their appearance after that period , so that none should be admitted which would suffer material injury either by the weather , staining , or the mechanical degradation which the lapse of such a period would necessitate . " Therefore , when we build , let us think that we build forever . Let it not be for present delight , nor for present use alone ; let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for , and let us think , as we lay stone on stone , that a time is to come when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched them , and men will say , as they look upon the labor and wrought sub . ' stance of them , See ! this our fathers did for us . ' For indeed , the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones , or in its gold ; but in its age , . . . in its lasting witness against men ; in its quiet contrast with the transitional character of all things ; in the strength which , through the lapse of seasons and times , and the decline and birth of dynasties , and the changing of the face of // the earth , and of the limits of the sea , maintains its sculptured shapeliness for a time insuperable , connects forgotten and following ages with each other , and half constitutes the identity , as it concentrates the sympathy , of nations . It is in that golden stain of time , that we are to look for the real light and color and preciousness of architecture ; and it is not until a building has assumed this character , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deeds of men , till its walls have been witnesses of suffering , and its pillars rise out of the shadows of death , that its existence , more lasting as it is than that of the natural objects of the world around it , can be gifted with even so much as these possess of language and of life . " p. 155 . Of this series , the Lamp of Obedience is the last . Architecture , like the other arts , is no irregular or fantastic production , but , like them , must be obedient to the necessities of the times , and the spirit of the people , their polity , life , history , and religious faith , out of which it must grow ; it should not even be restless and anxious for the new , but eager for the beautiful , the grand , the fitting . So only can it be sure of a character , and rise to its grandest effects . There are , indeed , times when great changes are needed in art , and new schools are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and development , and not of a mechanical compulsion . There are times when the life of art is shown by its throwing off ancient limitations ; so there are in the life of an insect ; and these are times of great interest to both . " But as that would be both an uncomfortable and foolish caterpillar which , instead of being contented with a caterpillar 's life and feeding on caterpillar 's food , was always striving to turn itself into a chrysalis ; and as that would he an unhappy chrysalis , which should lie awake at night and roll restlessly in its cocoon in efforts to turn itself prematurely into a moth , so will that art be unhappy and unprosperous which , instead of supporting itself on the food , and contenting itself with the customs , which have been enough for the support and guidance of other arts before it and like it , is struggling and fretting under the natural limitations of its existence , and striving to become something other than it is. " p 169 . Not to weary our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closing one of the book , as indicating the serious , slightly sombre , and almost severe tinge of the writer s mind . // 316 April , " I could pursue this subject willingly , but I have some strange notions about it , which it is perhaps wiser not loosely to set down . I content myself with finally reasserting , what has been throughout the burden of the preceding pages , that whatever rank , or whatever importance , may be attributed or attached to their immediate subject , there is at least some value in the analogies with which its pursuit has presented us , and some instruction in the frequent reference of its commonest necessities to the mighty laws , in the sense and scope of which all men are builders , whom every hour sees laying the stubble or the stone . " I have paused , not once nor twice , as I wrote , and often have checked the course of what might otherwise have been importunate persuasion , as the thought has crossed me , how soon all architecture may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is something ominous in the light which has enabled us to look back with disdain upon the ages among whose lovely vestiges we have been wandering . I could smile when I hear the hopeful exultation of many , at the new reach of worldly science , and vigor of worldly effort ; as if we were again at the beginning of days . There is thunder on the horizon as well as dawn . The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. " p. 177 . We shall have answered our end , if we have , gratified a few by the thoughts here suggested , and still more , if we direct any of our readers to a work aboundin0 in close and exact illustration , which we have had no room so much ns to refer to , as well as in passages of exquisite beauty and vivid eloquence , of which we have culled only a few of the most prominent .                    @
