Cincinnati : Trueman &amp; Spofford , 1851. l2mo. , pp. 527 and 502 . A FEW weeks since , we took up these volmnes in a book-store , from mere curiosity , having been previonsly ignorant of the name and the history of Mr. Perkins . We had not turned over many pages before we discovered that the subject of the memoir had what is so rare to find , a character of his own , and that he was indeed a living and earnest man . After reading still further , we were constrained to present to our readers some account of a character so peculiar , and a history so full of interest . We regret that our limits are so narrow , for such a character can best speak for itself , by extended quotations from its own written records . We shall do the utmost in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Perkins was born at Boston , July 31 , 1810 , of a family of wealth and influence . The scenes and history of his boyhood are depicted at length , and with great interest by his biographer , his cousin and most intimate associate from the first , between whom and himself there was , from the beginning to the end , the most confiding friendship and earnest sympathy . His education was carefully attended to , and his mind and character were developed early . It would seem that from the first he was a boy of high spirit , of enthusiastic feelings , stern integrity , and chivalrous regard to truth , and high sense of personal honor . He must have been singularly free from that animalism and selfishness which break omit so often in the . " boy-nature , " and // cross the purposes and mortify the pride of teachers and friends . At the same time , he was alive to the active sports of boyhood , particularly to all those adventures for which a country life only furnishes the opportunity . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in liberty a Brookline and Th hant , his winters only at Boston , while entire years of his boyhood and youth were passed at Lancaster , Exeter and Northampton , at the best schools of the time . The school studies which he preferred , and in which he made great proficiency , were the modern laugnages and cert in branches of natural history . Above all , he early learned to appreciate and delight in the best English writers , in prose and poetry . His reading of , and his delight in , t&gt;ese writers were far before his years . His own powers of composition , both in prose and poetry , at and before the age of eighteen , evince an early development in correct and manly thought , in delicacy of feeling , and in a command of easy aud pure English , which is rarely attained at school , and rarely even by men who have received what is called a liberal education . Latin he never liked , and he confesses that it was disgust with Latin which prevented him from receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written at the age of seventeen , shows that he had already a character of his own . He had been speaking of the loss of favor among the boys , which he had incurred by his fondness for his master , and adds , " Then I apparently left the master and took to my playmates , for you can not serve God and mammon , ' you know . I made friends with those who persecuted me , and became in turn head of the persecutors . I gained my revenge , but I was feared . Before , when I was hated , I was weak ; now I was strong , and the strong were on my side . Still I was unhappy . Then I let all persecution drop ; treated everybody well , and appe red to love all . But by this time I had become disgusted . I could gain peace only by deceit , and deceit I loathed . So now I grew desirous of living alone . I could trust none , did trust none , and ceased to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsociability is my nature , my habit , my fancy , and I fear I shall never be cured . " At the age of eighteen , he entered the counting-house of his uncle , where he remained for two years , punctually discharging the duties of a clerk ; but the profession , though opening to him the most flattering prospects , did not suit his temperament and his tastes , which were averse to the formal ways of moneyed men , and offended by the absorbing passion for money making . It would seem also that his moral nature was displeased at much // that he witnessed . " That men , seemingly sound-hearted in the circles of family and friendship , and nowise devoid of moral and religious principle , confided in by fellow-citizens for wisdom , integrity , and public spirit , the ancient and honorable ' of the land , should , as a matter of course , cheat in trade , use superior information to outwit the unwary , avail themselves of the mischances of the poor , weave webs of speculation to control markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for the sake of a few dollars , filled him at first with dismay and then with disgust . " " But this question brought up others . What was the meaning of this tyranny of wealth , that led men to barter their very manhood for gain ? And , as for the first time he opened his eyes on conventional customs , the prevalence of ambition , and maneuvering , the cringing concessions of the needy , the ostentatious pride of the opulent , and the fawning flattery that vitiates to the core the courtesies of fashionable life , it can not be denied that a sad contempt took possession of his heart , and made him for a time a cynic . He grew plain to bluntness in his speech , careless to extreme in dress , utterly disregardful of etiquette , reserved , almost morose in manner , and solitary in his ways . " Our readers will bear in mind , that Mr. Channing is reputed to be somewhat of a leveler and radical in his views , and they are at liberty to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his description of the mental state of his friend into an " improvement " of " doctrine . " These were not the only conflicts which beset Mr. Perkins . Moral and religions doubts broke in upon him-doubts concerning God and man , concerning the benevolence of God and the duties of man . " Whence came prevalent inhumanity and injustice ? Was this Christian religion so pompously professed , yet practically so violated , a superstitious farce or a solemn reality ? " " In this mood he read all the philosophers , Christian or Infidel , whose works he could obtain , and found solace in the poems of Shelley . " He studied phrenology earnestly , but his wants were notsatisfied ; " thediseasesof the will " couldonlybecuredby* faith . " Then it was that James turned , as so many an inquiring spirit has done , to Coleridge , and not in vain . In the Friend , ' and yet more in the Aids to IReflection , ' he found glimpses of a new world , offering welcome from afar to the storm-driven and becalmed voyager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change of scene were needed to bring him to a haven . " It would seem from hints which we find , at a later period of the biography , that the earlier education of Mr. Perkins was not decidedly religious , that the Unitarian Christianity in which he // was educated did not lay a strong grasp upon his feelings , that it neither woke the energies of his soul , nor satisfied his struggling inquiries , nor gave peace to his mind when disturbed by conflicts of doubt . On the other hand , it must be confessed , that from the earliest childhood he exhibited great uprightness of spirit , and was animated with an earnest desire to know and act the truth . As a means of breaking up these morbid trains of feeling and rousing him to a healthier view of life , young Perkins was sent to England , and thence to the West Indies . The copious extracts which are given from his letters during this absence , reveal the actings of an earnest mind in the right direction . His opinions respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just in its judgments , that was genial in its love for what was innocent , and that was intensely moved with loathing at moral deformity . After his return , in 1831 , he informed his friends of his resolution to abandon the mercantile profession . He immediately turned his eyes to the West , and an extract from a letter to his former teacher , Timothy Walker , Esq. , at that time a resident of Cincinnati , will show the bent and resolution of his mind . " My intention is to purchase land somewhere in Ohio , and undertake the care of an estate ; but I wish to get some employment which will give me a bare sustenance , while I am gaining some insight into the matter of farming , of which at present I know nothing , being one of that amphibious species , half merchant , half scholar , with a strong inclination to become either a cobbler or a blacksmith . " In February , 1832 , he reached Cincinnati with the views and expectations just expressed , but as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid his hands upon the books in the office of his friend which first presented themselves , and is at once fascinated with the science of the law to the study of which he immediately devotes all his energies . To this he was " drawn in part by the exhilarating pleasure of the study , and in part by the counsels of Mr. Walker , and of young friends whom he met at the office , who all admired his commanding intellect . " The social life which he found at Cincinnati , into the choicest circles of which he was at once introduced , seemed to have softened his heart , and to have released his spirit from the disturbed , morose moodiness in which he had indulged . What he found there is forcibly described by Mr. Channing , whatever may be the view which we may have of the other circles , with which he sets off the contrast . " In place of fashionable coldness , aristocratic hauteur , purse-pride ostentation , reserve , non-committalism , the tyranny of cliques and the fear of leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitable , easy , confiding , plain-spoken , cheerful friends , gathered from all parts of the Union , and loosed at once by choice and promiscuous intercourse from trammels of bigotry and conventional prejudice . He breathed for once freely , and felt with joy the blood flowing q nick and warm throughout his spiritual frame . He caught too fhe buoyant hopefulness that animates a young , vigorous and growing community , and mingled delightfully with groups of high-hearted , enterprising men , just entering on new careers , and impelled by the hope of generous service in literary , professional or commercial life . Above all , happiest good fortune brought him at once under the influence of woman , serenely wise , pure as lovely , spreading around her the verdure and bloom of goodness , through daily charities of life . " He was soon brought " into daily intercourse with one who , by her sunny temper , sound judgment , and ready good-will , formed the very complement he needed for harmonious growth . " To the lady who is thus beautifully characterized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet wise-hearted woman , " he was married in December , 1834 . He had the previous spring been admitted to the bar , and was also employed as an editor . His prospects in his profession were brilliant , but the law , which had attracted him as a science , disgusted him in practice , partly from the petty and insignificant character of much of the business which falls to a young lawyer , and principally from the fact that " he could not conscientiously do all that was required of a lawyer in order to secure success . " The reasons which led him to renounce the profession are thus stated by himself : " 1st , because in a city it is too sedentary and adverse to firni health ; 2d , because the drudgery of it is too injurious to the intellect ; 3d , because the devotion which it requires is greater than I am willing to give to any merely worldly concern , which either does not affect my higher powers or impairs them ; and 4th , because the rules of morality by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coincide with my own views , and I am not independent enough of my daily labor to enable me to oppose the ways of the profession . " For a brief period he devoted himself to literature . He had previously edited the IV*stern lfonthly Jfagazine , and was now the editor of the Evening Chronicle . This paper he purchased in 1835 , and united it with the Cincinnati iJfirror , of which , in connection with two other gentle men , he was jointeditor for six months . But pecuniary embarrassments , and the failure of health , compelled him to turn to a country life . In the summer of 1835 , he joined some friends in forming an establishment for mining , milling and manufacturing , at Pomeroy , on // the Ohio . The experiment occupied him some two years , during which he devoted himself to his long-cherished idea of uniting manual labor with intelligent self-cultivation . As a source of pecuniary profit , the experiment failed , and he returned to Cincinnati , in 1837 , where he bought a few acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a log cabin on an income of one hundred and fifty dollars per annum . He spent a short interval at Brookline , for the purpose of publishing a compilation from the constitutional opinions of Judge Marshall , and of obtaining instruction from his father in horticulture . In November , 1838 , he returned to Cincinnati , at which time Mr. Channing renewed their boyish intimacy ,  --  Mr. Channing , at his sohcitations , having accepted the charge of the Unitarian congregation in that city . We quote a few extracts , describing his appearance and manners . " Nothing could have been more unpretending than his manner , as in slouched cap , carelessly-tied neckcloth , loose , rough frock , Kentucky jean pantaloons , and stout boots , which bore traces of long excursions through mud or dust , he exchanged off-hand greetings as he swept along the street , or , with the slight alterations in attire demanded by merest neatness , entered with gracious demureness the crowded circles of society , or the quiet houses of friends . " " A spirit of earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great aims , and indifference to trifles , seemed to spread out from him and clothe him with an air of quiet power . He took naturally , and as of right , the attitude of brotherly kindness towards high and low , learned and ignorant , men and women , young and old , and met all on the broad table-land of manly truth . This unaffected integrity , and characteristic single-mindedness , it plainly was that gave him such a hold over others . " While he was on the eve of leaving Cincinnati , an opening was made for him in the ministry at large which had been recently established by members of the First Congregational or Unitarian Society , and which , being vacant , was offered to Mr. Perkins . It was felt that he was the man who of all others was fit for the place , and that the place was , of all others , fitted for him . He entered upon the work with his whole soul , and the opinion is confidently expressed , that what he did for Cincinnati has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity that can never die . " Indeed , it is difficult to conceive of a man better qualified in all respects to discharge with success the duties of such a station . He had already resided in the city , and had won the confidence of the most wealthy of its citizens . If e was a man of method and energy , qualities which he brought with him from his early training for business . He was a man of // genius , not merely in the use of his pen , but in the use of his tongue , and this not only in moving with irresistible persuasion large assemblies , not only in charming every social circle by his winning and ethereal conversation , but in stealing upon the hearts of the morose among the poor , and in softening down their hard and stubborn prejudices . Above all , he was a man who gave himself to this work as being the divinest and noblest object to which his high gifts could be consecrated , delighting in it as work which he accounted as ' noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was labor directly for his brother man . As minister at large and the friend of the poor , he naturally was inclined to take an interest in all those movements which have for their object , the relief of human misery , the prevention and punishment of crime , and the elevation of man 's social condition . In connection with the account of his agency for the poor , are introduced most appropriately , his views of Prison Discipline , of Christian Statesmanship , Agrarianism , Dangers of the West , the action of Masses and of Individuals , Socialism , and Education . We would gladly transfer to our paves his Opinions upon the subjects named . It is quite surprising t*at one trained in the school in which he was trained , and sympathizing so readily in everything that partook of progress , should make distinctions so important , and exhibit with all the fire and boldness of the most thorough radical , the steadiness and practical wisdom of the obstinate conservative . Such a man among such associates , and in such stirring times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one among ten thousand . The reformers of our day who systematically sell themselves to the demons of fanaticism and folly , may well take lessons from such an example and such a teacher . The difference between them and himself , is that he sought the truth more than he sought reform , loving reform not for its own sake , but because it is true , while they are mad for progress for its own sake , or rather because it is their cause . The one great thought which was the touchstone to all his principles , character and reforms was , that the character is everything , and that to character , as truly and nobly Christian , everything else must be subservient ; that manners , institutions and laws must be regulated and reformed till these mighty influences shall tend to make and keep a people truly Christian . In discoursing of agrarianism , in 1836 , after showing that the jealousy of wealth which was at that time so rife , was not a vicious desire of acquiring money , but the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that wealth can buy such a position , is anti-republican and unchristian , he discourses thus wisely : // James H. Perkins . Aug . " Very few it is to be feared see that the best principles of policy are wrapped up in the teachings of Jesus ; and very few , by making these teachings known in their remote consequences , would hope to heal the sores of a state . But we believe all good and statesmanlike and substantial policy to be based upon , and flow logically from , the grand principles of human nature , and its guide , the Book of Life . A dissemination , then , of Christian truth , a thorough and unsectarian development and application of this truth to every individual as a man , a citizen , and one member of a family , we believe to lie at the root of all reformation . " " Next to this in importance , we place the spread of education by manual labor schools , where the laborer may be instructed and yet not cease to be a laborer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts of the educated men in our republic . " " The reformation of feeling with regard to wealth , if it begin at all , must begin with those who have the same rank and influence with the wealthy . " " They must first become freemen and then break the chains of others . And they not only must teach , but practice ; they must receive and respect the printer , of good manners and character , while they turn from the rich gambler , or the time-serving attorney . They must be willing to become themselves hewers of wood and drawers of water . Already is this done to some extent in the country , and the more it is done , the better for religion and the republic ; a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump , and one man of education and disinterested talents may give tone and standing to a class . " We have given these extracts , not only to show how he treated a subject of great delicacy , but as a fine illustration of the power there is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and practice of the teacher-when his own life of self-sacrifice and self-devotion seems as it were to be uttered in his words . In speaking of the dangers of the West , he says : " Again , the West was born democratic ; it did not feel or fight its way from loyalty to independence , but began in the faith that all men are born free and equal ,  --  a faith well suited to a race of pioneers . One result of this faith has been , that the principle of reverence has grown weak this side the mountains , while the sense of self-dependence , and , as a common consequence , of contempt for all that is opposed to self , has grown strong . This is an evil ; not a political , but an individual evil ; not an evil that proves democracy unsuited for us , but one that proves it faulty . It is an evil , because no principle of action leads more continually to improvement than a mistrust of ourselves , and a due reverence for others , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based more upon self-esteem than the demerits of what we contemn , is the mortal foe of advancement , and the very opposite of Christianity . It is better to revere what is in itself contemptible , than to despise what is in itself venerable , and imperfect beings must err on one side or the other . One tendency of democratic institutions , then , upon individuals , is to unchristianize them , by destroying Christian humility , and elevating Satanic pride , and the evil results of this tendency , we see daily in our public halls no less than in our private kitchens . " - pp. 149 , 150 . What his views were in respect to the question of Socialism we give in the words of another : " I think I can confidently state , that Mr. Perkins was a Christian Socialist , as I understand that term to be used by most writers . He certainly could not be classed as belonging to any distinct and well defined school of socialists that has // hitherto existed . He was neither a Communist nor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turaed mainly upon social reformatory topics . The substitution of cooperation in industry and commerce for competition was a very favorite idea of his , as a means of bringing men 's daily lives into conformity with the requirements of Christianity ; and that was , I think , the only distinct socialist idea to which he had attained . Of the universal prevalence of selfishness , social evils and imperfections , he was very sensibly conscious ; and of the hopeless inefficiency of all existing political and religious organizations as means to a higher and truer state of man , he was also convinced . Of men 's pietizing on Sunday , and yielding themselves up to selfish tendencies during the week , he thought and felt as all truly enlightened men now do . " He seemed to trust in no method of effecting a change in the condition and well being of mankind , such as he hoped for and conceived to be possible , other than that of persuading men to do rightly . We may know what right conduct is , unerringly , from the teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity with the life of Christ , the means is an appeal to their conscience . This means having been in operation for many centuries , without resulting in the desired change , he hoped for success in future , not by the adoption of new means , but by a more vigorous and better systematized application of the old . In short , he was not a social philosopher , but a Christian Philanthropist , who sympathized with socialism because it is in sympathy with his Christian philanthropy. " - pp. l&amp;5-188 . His opinions in respect to the abolition of slavery were freely and boldly expressed in 1836 : " From what has been said , if we have spoken clearly , it will be seen that we believe in gradual emancipation , not , however , meaning by that term what is usually meant . We do not believe it expedient or right to free the slaves by instalments ,  --  so many one year , and so many the next . The laws of slave States , touching free blacks , prevent freedom from becoming a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free a generation of pickaninnies , ' the children of slaves , and of necessity undergoing no course of parental education , that would fit them to act like freemen . These kinds of gradual emancipation give liberty , but strip it of its main powers , its true value . But let a course of legislation , acting upon the whole slave population , and fitted to raise the characters of that multitude , be persisted in ; let those that sway public opinion give their weight , not only to humanity , but to the plan pursued by the Cuba planter ; let the religious and moral not only think , but feel , on this subject , and we may then have the hope of seeing the slaves , father and child , old and youn* , , all brought to that point when all may be made free , uninfluenced by the degrading laws that s ave States feel bound to pass respecting free negroes . They may be made free , not necessarily to vote and govern-that is no essential point of freedom ; nor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that shall be must depend on the will of the whites ; but free to use their intellect , will , conscience ; free to learn the truth free to worship God , and to grow toward that perfection for which , if they be indeed men as we are , God has fitted them . " - pp. 195 , 196 . We would gladly add his extended opinion of the law of 1793 , respecting fugitive slaves , but our limits will not permit us to do so . It will suffice to say that he contended , that that law " is clearly opposed to the words of the Constitution . " In respect to the sonudness of his argument , and the correctness of // 368 James H. Perkins . his conclusion , it would not be in place for us to offer a criticism or express an opinion . We simply make a reference to this opinion because we would do entire justice to his views . His interest in education was devoted and enthusiastic . As a writer and lecturer , as an overseer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his fervent faith that education is one of the most potent instruments for Chnstianizing man and reforming society . He was especially interested in the education of girls , and devoted himself to a class of young ladies for several years . We have rarely , perhaps never , seen a more satisfactory exhibition of the principles on which female education should be prosecuted , than those presented in a lecture given by him . We *note the following passages , not merely for their intrinsic value , and the good sense which they express , but also as illustrating the frank and teachable spirit of the man : " When I began to teach , I was much prejudiced against introducing Latin , for I was myself ten years learning it , during which time I was flogged till my hand became as hard as a plowman 's , and was so disgusted with the whole study that I left school and entered a mercantile life . Feeling thus , I went on a whole year without Latin , and the second year tried the experiment of using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study for girls . They acquire , through that language , the English language , and come also to the grammar of all languages , while analysis and the powers of composition arc cultivated , as nothing else will cultivate them . " A young man studying Ciusar has to rewrite Ciesar . He has to take the separate words and put them together as Ca3sar did . Here is an effort of composition . I should , therefore , introduce and continue for four years the study of the Latin . " - pp. 236,237 . We should like also to notice Mr. Perkins 's powers and taste as a critic of works of art , as illustrated in his criticisms of some of Powers 's productions . We were especially delighted with the freedom and justness displayed in his remarks upon the Greek Slave , and the propriety of exhibiting naked forms . But we must hasten to consider Mr. Perkins as a preacher , and to unfold the changes and maturity of his religious opinions . In his childhood he had not felt , certainly he had not yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lonely struggles and weariness of the world had shut him for a time in stern despair . " But as he went on , his spirit was softened by a generous sympathy with mankind , the soothing appliances of friendship , and the winning endearments of woman 's love . Thus , by degrees , " the frown of Fate was transformed above him into the s iile of Providence . " First he learned to believe that goodness was leading him by the hand . Then he was taught concerning the true end of his being ,  --  a moral end to be perfected in another life . But all this while , his views in respect to the Christian re // ligion were skeptical and unsettled . " But as he became more aware of his own frailty , and found by sad experience how prone he was to fall short of his ideal , and as the mystery of sin in mankind at large forced itself upon his attention , he asked himself whether there was not a deeper significance than he had been apt to credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period that he found in Coleridge a guide , and Coleridge he always regarded as his Christian father . He did not receive all his theological opinions indeed , but as early as 1840 he spoke of a " Unity in Trinity which all may receive : God the Creator and Governor , seen in Nature ; God the Redeemer , seen in Revelation ; and God the Sanctifier , purifying the heart through Reason , one God in Three Forms . " He began to preach in an informal way to the congregation of which Mr. Channing was the pastor , and in 1841 was invited to succeed him . He accepted the invitation with great reluctance , being greatly diffident of his worthiness through deficiency in character to speak of the Christian life and of Christian truth . He fulfilled the trust with great acceptance , and was esteemed a most instructive and powerful preacher . The secret of his success lay in the richness of his mind and character , and in the simplicity and earnestness with which he inculcated that and that only which he believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not in the originality of his topics . nor in a style of pleasing oratory , for he " had no tricks of imposing form , as too many have , to eke out deficiency or inanity of substance . " " His chief power as a preacher consisted in the fact that he was a practical man , and as such felt a deep and earnest sympathy with the spiritual wants that pertained to the current life of every class . " During all this period his religious views were more and more confirmed in the right direction . Mrs. H. B. Stowe , who knew him well , has given the following account of his opinions and feelings at the time of his death , in 1849 " Mr. Perkins ' position , religiously considered , was one to which few will do justice . He , whose inquiries after truth are so strictly individual and eclectic as were his , finds little sympathy in our religious community , where it seems to be an essential requisite that a man should class somewhere , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various recognized partics . When , therefore , Mr. Perkins ceased to be a Unitarian , and yet could not embrace in toto any of the formurlaics of orthodoxy , his position was in many respects painful . " He was capable of a hearty. settled , genuine belief , and such , on many questions , he had attained to . He first approached the land of moral inquiry from the side of entire skepticism ; and how different are the views of one who enters it on that side from his who glides in upon the tranquil stream of // traditional belief ! It was by earnest wrestling , by vigil and careful inquiry , that he attained to every successive conviction ; but he did attain to many points , which he looked upon as firm land , and not bog or mirage . " The points on which , I think , Mr. Perkins had attained to settled conviction , were , the entire ruin of the human race morally : the entire dependence of man on Divine assistance for any upward progress ; the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the supernatural influences of the grace of God . " He also believed in Christ as so united to the divine nature as to be truly and properly God manifest in the flesh ,  --  a proper object of the highest religious homage and worship : and I remember a very beautiful and eloquent description which he gave of the influence of the living faith in Christ in the transformation of human character . He believed also in the fact of an atonement by the death of Christ , though he stated that he could not as yet see truth in any of the philosophical theories by which the doctrine was supported . " - pp. 273 , 274 . In 1847 Mr. Perkins proposed to his congregation to abandon " the dogmatic , sectarian ground of Anti-Trinitarianisni , and to assume that of a more practical Christianity , having as its basis these points : - lst . Faith in the perfect trustworthiness of the gospels , in their essential inspiration . 2d . Faith in Jesus , as God revealed through man . 3d . Faith in God 's constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith in regeneration and the forgiveness of sin ; and 5th . Faith in a future life of retribution . 6th . Faith in the power of Christianity to cure the evils of the world . " October 8 , 1848 , he preached a discourse in furtherance of this design , from which we extract the following remarkable passages " When modern Unitarianism first found expression in our land , it was the earnest protest of devout hearts against that real or imagined form of faith which of the Triune God had made three Gods , which to the fallen man denied the mere power of receiving God 's spirit , which sunk the great Reconciler of God and man in the victim of divine wrath , which petrified foreordination into a pagan fate , and election into the capricious mercy of a tyrant . " I am not , as you well know , a disbeliever in the value of theology . It is not a mean , or mysterious , or unpractical system of truths , as I view it . Nothing , I believe , is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology . It not only ought to govern , but does govern , the merchant in Main street , the lawyer at the bar , the mechanic in his shop , the farmer at his plow . When you leave this city for New York or New Orleans , your life will depend very much upon the theology of the engineer who holds the safety valve of the steamboat , or modulates the speed of the locomotive . No matter what his skill , his energy , his knowledge : the man's conduct will be finally determined by what he really believes in reference to God and the relation of God to man ; in other works , by his theology . " It is not , then , because I despise or disregard this science-if we may fitly degrade it by such a term-that I say a platform of to-day must bear mind free upon it . Neither is it because I would tolerate all views and bear with all errors . I would bear with no error ; I would tolerate no false view ; I would discard as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too often does , the quiet sufferance of lies . " // The society was constituted on the basis which he proposed , and the establishment of which he so ardently desired . Mr. Perkins was apparently as happy , as active , as hopeful , and as laborious , as teachable and desirous to teach others , as he had ever been , living in the midst of rural scenes , in which he so much delighted , and surrounded by a happy family , when he was suddenly called from life , December 14 , 1849 , lamented by all who had the happiness to know him . Of such a man we are prompted to say , that he died too soon , because he was working out problems of the utmost interest fox ' himself and his fellow-men . And yet viewed in its relation to himseW his death was not too soon ; for Mrs. Stoxve says , most beautifully : - " Amid all the affliction of his sudden and most mournful death , I have never been without a mingling of solemn joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in him so strong , the yearning , the hungering and thirsting after light and purity so ardent , that I rejoice at his having at last found it . His was one of those souls whom a German writer describes as possessed by a lwme-sickness ' which makes them perpetually long for a higher sphere , and forbids them any settled repose on the bosom of created things . Of all such when they depart , may it truly be said , If ye loved me ye would rejoice , because I go unto my Father . ' " We have thns hastily thrown together such passages from this memoir as would give some idea of the character and history of this remarkable man . We fear that they convey but an imperfect conception of him , as he is presented in the extended biography . We ought to add that the accompanying writings are in every respect worthy of preservation , for their own value , and as illustrating the character of the writer . We regret that we can not pursue the many topics of thought which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to dwell upon the advantages of a familiarity with country scenes and country sports , in the formation of character-upon the end for which the sons of the rich should be specially trained in order most effectually to promote the Christian civilization of the people-upon the methods appropriate to such a training . We should also have been pleased to remark at length upon the Christian socialism of our day , which is assuming a form more and more distinct , and upon the hopes and the fears which it excites . The evil of Unitarianism and of the dogmatism from which Unitarianism was a reaction , as illustrated by the long and sad career , through which Mr. Perkins groped his perilous way , opens a wide held for reflection . IBut all these topics we ruust leave to // our readers to peruse for themselves . We doubt not that some of them will be inclined to peruse the work of which we have given this imperfect sketch .                    @
