MEMOIRS OF GEORGE SAND.4 SECOND ARTICLE . l N our previous article on the biography of George Sand , we left the studious child , at six or seven years of age , receiving the elements of a desultory education under the guidance of the inevitable Deschartres , and uttering an occasional protest against the pedantic tasks which formed the unsavory nutriment of her opening mind . She resided chiefly at Nohant , pursuing the same routine , until she arrived at the age of early womanhood . The only studies , in which she took a real interest , were history , geography , music , and elegant literature . Her teaching was of a singularly mechanical character . She was made to learn merely for the sake of learning , without regard to its effect on her happiness , or her moral improvement . Her affection for her grandmother led her to overcome her aversion to the insipid lessons which were forced upon her ; she committed to memory innumerable verses of poetry , of which she could not comprehend the meaning ; delved over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versification , which was like putting her natural poetic talent into a straightjacket ; and puzzled out interminable sums in arithmetic , which was so repugnant to her taste , that she could scarcely add up a column of figures without an attack of vertigo . As a sort of compensation , she plunged into the depths of history , and , studying it in her own way , made it a source of perpetual amusement . She regarded it entirely in its picturesque and romantic aspect . The lofty characters which it exhibits , the beautiful actions , the strange adventures , the poetic narratives , with which it abounds , inspired her with intense enthusiasm , and she found the greatest delight in clothing them with her own language , and repeating them for the edification of the family . In this way , she first got the taste of blood as a writer , first learned to enjoy the pleasures of composition . Her little historical recitals were highly satisfactory to her grandmother , who thought so well of their execution , that she ceased to insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by degrees , struck out a path of her own , and , instead of summing up the volumes she had read , indulged in personal comments and descriptions . " I was more philosophical , " she tells us , " than my profane historians , more enthusiastic than my sacred historians . Yielding full scope to my emctions , without attempting to agree with the judgment of my authors , I colored my recitals with the hues of my own thought , and I even remember that I did not abstain from giving a little embellishinent to the dryness of certain details . I changed no essential facts ; but , when an insignificant or ambiguous personage fell into my hands , obeying an unconquerable impulse of ART , I gave to him such a character as I could naturally deduce from his position or station in the general drama . Unable to submit blindly to the judgment of the author , if I did not always justify what he condemned , I at least undertook to explain and palliate it . If I found him too cold towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my own ardor , diffusing it over my narrative in terms that often drew forth a smile from my grandmother by their naYvet* of exaggeration . " She pursued almost the same process in her musical studies . She faithfully performed the dry tasks enjoined by her teacher , learning , with care , the pieces she was to play to her grandmother : but , when she felt tolerably sure of success , she would arrange them in her own fashion , adding new phrases , changing the regular forms , improvising at random , singing , playing , and composing both music and words . At about the age of twelve , she began to try her hand at writing , without the aid of her historical authors . She composed several descriptive pieces , in which moonlight and shady valleys played an important part . These won the applause of partial readers ; but she was not to be flattered into any conviction of her own merits . Even at that // early age , she had an instinctive sense of art , which led her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to become conscious of their imperfections . From that time , she felt the sentiment which she has never lost , that there is something more in the soul than can be embodied in form ; that , as no art can represent the charm experienced amid the freshness of nature , so no experience can do justice to the spontaneous force of our inward emotions . Hence , she has never felt any complacency in her own literary efforts . " I have never been satisfied , " says she , " with anything I have ever written , from my first essays when twelve years old to the productions of my advanced life . I say this from no modesty on my part . Whencver I have seen or felt any subject of art , I have hoped , I have pleasantly believed , that I could represent it as it had come to me . I have thrown myself into it with ardor . I have completed my task , sometimes with lively pleasure , and sometimes , in writing the last page , I have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' But I could never read the proof without saying : This is not at all the thing . I have dreamed , and felt , and conceived this quite differently . This is cold , out of place , too much said , and not enough said ! ' And if the work had not been the property of a publisher , I should have thrown it into a corner , with thc intention of revising it , where it would have been forgotten in the attempt to accomplish another . " Soon after her first attempt at original composition , she became the subject of a singular experience , combining artistic taste with religious sentiment , which shows the innate tendency of her character to pass the limits of conventionalism both in act and opinion . From her earliest childhood , she had felt the impulse to create an interior world of her own , a world of imagination and poetry ; and this , at length , ripened into the wish of also constructing a religious and philosophical world for herself . In the course of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On finishing their perusal , she felt sad that they had so soon come to an end . The impression they made on her mind was deep and powerful . Not only the beauty and tenderness of those poems , but their religious significance , took possession of her imagination . They awakened in her heart the need of a religious sentiment , if not of a definite belief-as she had never been taught a religion , she found it necessary to make one of her own . A dreaming , frankhearted , solitary child , left , in a great degree , to herself , and already absorbed in the pursuit of an ideal , she could not imagine a world-an idealized humanity without placing an ideal being at its head . The sublime , creative God of the Old Testament , the sublime fatality , Jupiter , did not speak with directness enough to her heart . She perceived the relations of the Supreme Power with nature , but did not feel its presence in humanity . " I did then , " says she , " what humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate person  --  a God-man  --  a divine friend of our unhappy race . " Homer and Tasso , who formed the crowningpoint in her first studies of Pagan and Christian poetry , only caused embarrassment by their descriptions of so many great or terrible divinities . She was at a loss which to choose among such a number . She was preparing for her first communion , but the catechism was a perfect riddle to her . The Gospel narrating the divine drama of the life and death of Jesus , drew secret torrents of tears from her eyes . Still the atmosphere which she breathed could not fail to infcct her mind with a taint of skepticism . Her grandmother , who was one of the strong-minded women of her day , carefully guarded her against all tendency to superstition , and thus she was led. to doubt the received faith of the Church . But this only increased her wish to construct a religion for herself . " Since all religion is a fiction , " she would reason , " let us make a romance which shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a romance . I do not , indeed , believe in my romances , but they give me as much happiness as if I believed in them . " Indulging in such dreams , one night a name and personal form came into her head . The name had no meaning , but was merely a casual combination of syllables , such as is formed in dreams . This became the title of her romance and the God of her religion . rrhe phantom , thus bodied forth in her imagination , remained , for a long time , her religoius ideal . He was the pure creation of her brain . Pure and charitable as Christ , radiant and beautiful as // Gabriel , he combined the grace of the nymphs with the poetic soul of Orpheus . Less austere than the Christian God , and more spiritual than those of Homer , he was clothed with every attribute of loveliness and strength that forms the ideal of humanity . At times , even , he appeared in the shape of a woman . " I wished , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sister , while I adored him as a god . " To complete the enchantment , it was necessary that he should not be entirely free from human errors and weaknesses . Hence , she clothed him with an excess of kindness and indulgence . His existence presented a series of trials , of sufferings , of persecutions , of martyrdoms . Each of the phases of his human existence formed the subject of a book or canto of her imaginary poem . In touching the earth , he became man or woman , and sometimes the supreme God , of whom , after all , he was only the heavenly messenger , placed over the moral government of our planet , would prolong his exile in the world as a punishment for his too great love and pity towards men . Without a line being written , this poem extended to more than a thousand cantos , and finally took complete possession of the young enthusiast , removing her from the sphere of the real world by its sweet hallucinations . While in this state of poetic excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , for the purpose of finishing her education , and gaining those accomplishments which were incompatible with her life of rural and almost wild freedom at Nohant . The English convent , a religious house established by the Catholic exiles from England during the commonwealth , was the institution selected for her temporary residence , and in due time she was installed as a boarding-scholar within its dusky walls . Everything was new to the young country-girl . She did not recover from her astonishment for several days . The superior of the convent was an English lady , between fifty and sixty years of age , but still preserving her good looks , although the amplitude of her person was in singular contrast with the delicacy of her mind . She had reason to pride herself on being a woman of the world , her manners were dignified and elegant , she spoke French gracefully , though not without an accent , and in her eye there was a more decided expression of self-satisfaction and sarcasm than of holy contemplation . Her deportment was gentle and conciliatory , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired their confidence and regard . In this novel scene , the young Aurore soon found herself at home , and was happier than she had ever been before . The confinement of the school , however , did not agree with her health . She suffered for want of the free air and woodland rambles at Nohant . The pupils were subject to the strictest rules of the cloister . They were allowed to go out but twice a month , and could not pass a night away from the convent except at new-year 's . They heard mass in the chapel , received visits in the parlor , where , also , they took their special lessons  --  the teacher on one side of the bars , and the pupils on the other . All the windows of the convent , which looked upon the street , were not only grated , but furnished with heavy curtains . It was really a prison , but a prison with a large garden , and a numerous society . Aurore remained in the convent for three years , during which time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year , she was more the spoiled child than ever ; the second year , she suddenly passed to an ardent and troubled devotion , while , the third year , she joined to this state of mind a feeling of calmness , repose , and serene joy . The transition from comparative religious indifference , to a deep sense of spiritual things , which took place in her fifteenth year , is what she calls her conversion , and forms the subject of one of the most curious episodes in her autobiography . Her soul was plunged into the depths of mysticism . The formulas of the Church , though rigidly observed , gave her no satisfaction . She would pass hours before the altar in the ecstasy of devotion . Her whole nature was absorbed in a sublime dream of eternal love . No subsequent intellectual delight could compare with the rapt sense of the Infinite which pervaded her being . The year thus passed away , leaving her in the most complete beatitude . Every Sunday she received the communion , and , sometimes , two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic doctrine of identification with God in // this sacrament . She was taught that " God is in you-he palpitates in your heart-he fills your whole being with his divinity-grace circulates in you with the blood in your veins . " She felt that the miracle was performed in herself . Like St. Therese , she glowed with a holy fire , she neither eat , nor slept , and was scarcely conscious of the motion of her body as she walked . No austerity was a trial . She was conscious of nothing in herself to sacrifice , or to change . She experienced no weakness from fasting . The rosary , which she wore round her neck , drew blood , but it gave her an agreeable sensation rather than pain . She was lost to the consciousness of the body-it no longer existed for her . She was discreet , obedient , laborious without an effort . It cost her nothing to bring her actions into accordance with her faith . rrhe hour of disenchantment arrived before she left the convent . After passing through many scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of perturbation and uncertainty . One evening , upon entering the church , she could not pray . Her bodily health had begun to fail in consequence of protracted austerities . For several days she felt no access of her wonted fervor . She became a prey to lassitude and sadness . For the first time , since her conversion , she experienced a doubt , not of religion but of herself . She feared that the divine grace had abandoned her . Her ears rung with the fearful words , " Many are called , but few are chosen . " She thought that God had ceased to love her because she had not loved him sufficient ly . She thus fell into a state of gloomy despair . Tranquillity was at length restored , and she recovered her health both of mind and body . She had now become so much attached to convent life , that she wished to be received into the order , and take forever the veil of a nun . But this plan was entirely opposed to the views of her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , much against her will , to take her back to Nohant . Aurore had now arrived at the age of sixteen , and the failing health of her grandmother led her to wish the marriage of her child , before her own death , which she believed could not be far distant . Upon consulting the blushing girl in relation to the subject , the proposal was received with aversion-almost with horror . Several persons were named as the happy claimants of her hand , but they were all rejected with so much disgust , that the whole project was postponed , at least for another year . It was early in the spring of 1820 that she returned to Nohant . The trees were in full bloom , the fields were vocal with the song of the nightingale , the chant of the laborers was heard in the distance , full of tranquil poetical associations , and for the first time , in three years , she awoke in the morning , without the sound of the " angelus " bell . She felt a new sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unknown future , which opened before her , gave her a vague uneasiness , by no means in harmony with the fresh and confiding character of her age . But , after shedding some natural tears , for which 8he could never satisfactorily account , she began to enter upon the enjoyment of her new-born freedom . She was delighted with the gay rose-colored robe which was brought to her by the handsome chamber-maid , instead of the sombre uniform of brown serge . She could arrange her hair to suit herself without hearing the remark of a prudish nun , that it was indecent to expose the temples . The dinner consisted of all the delicacies which her grandmother was fond of , served with proper liberality . The garden was one immense bouquet . All the domestics , all the peasants , celebrated the return of the heiress . She embraced all the good women of the village , who thought she had greatly improved in her looks by growing more stout . The provincial dialect sounded in her ears like delicious music . Even the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly terms , but which had barked at her on the evening of her arrival , now recognized her again , and loaded her with caresses , which , by their frank and intelligent air , seemed to apologize for their momentary forgetfulness . Towards night , the immortal Deschartres , who had been absent on some distant visit , made his appearance , with his immense gaiters and his traveling-cap . The dear man had entirely forgotten that his little friend , from whom he had been parted for three years , must have grown in the interval , and while she // sprang upon his neck , quietly asked where Aurore was . He called her mademoiselle , and , like the dogs , did not begin to recognize her until after about a quarter of an hour . For the first few days , she gave herself up to the physical delight of running in the fields , and revisiting the river , the wild plants , and the meadows in flower . The exercise of walking in the country , of which she had lost the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spirits , that she was unable to think . Such mental inaction , however , soon became burdensome , and she sought for means to occupy the abundant leisure which she enjoyed through the doting indulgence of her grandmother . She , accordingly , marked out a plan for the employment of the days , from which she did not depart as long as she was alone , and mistress of her own time . One hour was devoted to history , another to drawing , another to music , another to English , Italian , and so forth . But the moment for real self-instruction had not yet arrived . The return of her brother , who had become an officer of hussars , gave a new variety to her life at Nohant . They had not met during her residence at the convent , and , at first , were a little afraid of each other . Their ancient friendship , however , revived in a few days , and they became almost inseparable companions . Hippolyte was a great lover of horses , and delighted in taming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste for riding , which exercised no small influence , both on her physical health , and her mental habits . She gives an amusing account of his lessons in the art equestrian . The first time she mounted a horse , he impressed on her docile mind that the whole secret of riding was comprised in two things- " to fall or not to fall "  --  the rest would follow , of course . He naturally expected that , on her first attempt , she would fall , and , therefore , was desirous to select a place where she would not be much hurt by the catastrophe . The scene of the experiment was accordingly laid in a broad meadow , covered with thick grass . A little mare , named Calette , which had never been mounted , arid fresh from the pasture , was destined to be the partner of her novitiate . After having lcd her around the meadow several times , Hippolyte found her so gentle , that he thought she would behave well , and placed his sister on her back . Calette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of astonishing but good-natured antics . Hippolyte called out : " Hold fast-cling to the mane if you will , but do n't let go the bridle , and do n't fall . Think of nothing but to fall or not to fall . ' * ' The fair chevalier followed his advice , and resolved to stick to the saddle at all hazards . Five or six times she was nearly unhorsed ; but , thanks to the Providence that takes care of crazy people and children , she was not thrown . At the end of an hour , lame in every joint , with disheveled hair , and in a state of glorious intoxication with the exercise , she completed the lesson , having gained the confidence and pres* ence of mind necessary to her future exploits as a rider . Calette and she , from that time , became the best of friends , and lived and galloped in company for many years . The health of her grandmother , which had been precarious for some time , now experienced an important crisis . A severe attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her mind enfeebled , and her body paralyzed . She continued in this state , with intervals of convalescence , for nearly a year , and died on Christmas-day , 1821 . During the illness of Madame Dupin , Aurore was left , for the most part , entirely to herself . Her mother remained at Paris , occupied with the care of her other daughter , and declined the request of the family to come to Nohant . Deschartres gave up everything into the hands of Aurore . He made every effort to keep up her spirits , and prevent her from feeling too much the burden of her new anxieties . He encouraged her to continue her rides on horseback , which she had dropped since the afflictions of her geandmother . He accompanied her himself , and at the expense of many falls , until he was obliged to confess that she was the best rider of the two , in practice , though he still plumed himself on his superior theoretical knowledge of the art . Unable to stand the fatigue and danger of the athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the escort of a little imp called Andre , who was as firm in his seat as a monkey on the back of a pony . Not a morning passed without scouring the country forleagues. // The boy Andr6 would not open his mouth during the ride , leaving her to the free indulgence of her favorite reveries . They would explore places usually deemed impossible , to the wonder of the admiring peasants . Sometimes the horses would stop at the roadside and browse , while Aurore was lost in thought  --  the perpetual change of the scenery ; the absence of every object ; the casual sight of flocks and birds ; the picturesque or sombre features of the landscape ; the sweet murmur of the brooks which flowed at the horses ' feet - everything which met the eye or soothed the soul in these solitary excursions took absolute possession of her spirit , and awakened the unconscious sentiment of poetry . At this period , the perusal of Chateaubriand 's " Genius of Christianity , " and Gerson 's " Imitation of Christ " ( Thomas *t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . She was already acquainted with the latter work . Its lessons of humility , of renunciation of the intellect , of absorption in God , and contempt for human knowledge , had been eagerly studied and absorbed . She now read Chateaubriand for the first time . His book rekindled the pious ardor which had become somewhat chilled since her retirement into the country . It surrounded her faith with the prestige of romance . No longer a blind passion , it was felt as a centre of radiant light . The " Imitation of Christ " ceased to be her guide , and she yielded her whole soul to Chateaubriand as the high-priest of sentiment and enthusiasm . But this experience opened to her , for the first time , the path of free inquiry . She entered it , not like Dante , in the evening of life , but in the blossom of her days , and in the lucid splendor of an intellectual dawn . Perceiving the inconsistency between the doctrines of the " Imitation " and the views of Chateaubriand , her mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , she was taught the absolute annihilation of the intellect and heart in the pursuit of personal salvation ; and , on the other , the development of feeling and sentiment in devotion to the common religion . She , accordingly , reperused the " Imitation " with trembling anxiety . It appeared to her like an entirely new book . the perceived the terrible consequences of its doetrines in their application to life . They urged the forgetfulness of every earthly affection , the extinction of every emotion of the heart , the disruption of the ties of family and kindred , and the complete absorption of one 's nature in striving for the salvation of the soul . Her conscience was stung with remorse . She felt that she had done wrong in leaving the convent . She should have forsaken her family , and devoted herself to the religious life . She had made unworthy concessions , and was devoured with a sense of guilt . Everything seemed criminal in her conscience and her life . This must be the case , or her cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Gerson and Chateaubriand . On one side , the sacrifice of everything but the immediate contemplation of God ; on the other , to glorify God by the assimilation of everything in the universe which can give force and beauty to the soul . The alpha and omega of the doctrine was : " let us be dust and ashes , " or " let us be light and flame . " " Examine nothing if you wish to believe , " or " in order to believe everything , we must examine everything . " Here was the dilemma . Gue of the books was absolutely heretical . Were there , then , two contradictory truths in the bosom of the Church ? Chateaubriand proclaimed relative truth . Gerson declared it absolute . The young theologian was in great perplexity . Galloping on Calette , she was wholly with Chateaubriand . Seated by her lamp , she was wholly with Gerson . The evening reproached her thoughts of the morning . But she could find no repose except in the enjoyment of entire mental freedom . Her spiritual director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict the exercise of her mind . He even advised her to pursue a liberal course of reading . For this she found abundant materials in the choice library of her philosophic grandmother . She plunged , at once , into an ocean of history and metaphysics . Mably , Locke , Condillac , Montesquieu , Bacon , Bossnet , Aristotle , Leibnitz , Pascal , Montaigne were grappled with in succession . Then came the poets and moralists , La Bruyere , Pope , Milton , Dante , Virgil , Shakespeare , and the rest . All without order or method , as they happened to fall into her hands . // She comprehended them with a facility of intuition , which she subsequently lost , as she was not naturally of quick perceptions . But everything was a question with her of life and death , as on the result of her inquiries it literally depended whether she should go into the life of the world , or the voluntary death of the cloister . Her decision can easily be anticipated . She lost her interest in the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious sentiment maintained its supremacy over her heart . A new horizon opened before her . She was filled with a sense of the divine love , animated by an enlightened faith , and combined with true freedom of mind . She experienced an interior confidence and security , and , from that day to this , as she declared , her soul has rested on an immovable foundation of faith . A little episode , at this time , diversified the monotony of her life , and presents a curious illustration of her devotion to intellectual pursuits . She formed a friendship with a young man of the neighborhood whom she calls Claudius , and they were soon united by a taste for similar studies . His family belonged to the nobility of the country , and had once possessed a large fortune . The education of ten children had ruined his parents . Some of them had tarnished their escutcheon by a disorderly life and a tragic end . Claudius was the youngest of the family . He had a handsome face , and was not wantipg in knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the sciences , in which he afterwards obtained a certain celebrity . His poverty , at this time , which was caused by the sordid avarice of his mother still more than by his position , decided him to study medicine . Great privations and excessive toil had injured his health . He was thought to be in a consumption ; but he recovered from it , and died of some other disease in mature age . Deschartres , who had been intimate with his father , and who was interested in a nobleman devoted to study , had introduced him to the family , and even engaged him to give Aurore some les - sons in physical science . With a view to aiding Deschartres , if necessary , in his surgical operations on the poor of the village , she had commenced the study of anatomy . He had often called in her assistance in cutting off arms and fingers , setting dislocated joints , and dressing broken heads , and alwaysfound her prompt and skillful , in spite of the pain anddisgust which she experienced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstain from fainting at the sight of wounds . Claudius supplied the amateur surgeons with specimens for demonstration in the shape of heads , arms , and legs ; and a physician of the village lent them the skeleton of a little girl , which was kept for some time in one of the drawers of Aurore 's bureau . This skeleton , by-the-by , was guilty of certain mischievous pranks , which could hardly have been expected of so young a subject . One night Aurore dreamed that the skeleton had arisen , and was drawing the curtains of her bed . She awoke , and , finding it in the place where it had been left , went quietly to sleep again . But the dream continued , and the little dried-up girl performed so many extravagances , that she became quite intolerable . Once more getting up , Aurore placed her at the door , after which she slept very well . The next night , the same follies were repeated ; but , as she was only treated with contempt , she made up her mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau . Claudius was not so facetious as the skeleton , and , for a long time , his conversation turned only on the lessons . On making a visit to Paris , he was commissioned to purchase a considerable number of books , which led to a correspondence in regard to the choice of editions , and other matters of taste . His letters were sufficiently commonplace , until , at last , one arrived , commencing thus : " 0 , truly , philosophic soul , you are , indeed , right ; but you are the truth which kills . " Aurore was entirely nonplussed at this odd exordiurn , and , showing the letter to Deschartres , asked him what it could mean . After puzzling over it a great while , and reading it again and again , the ancient pedant naWely replied " I believe that this must be a declaration of love . What have you written to the lad ? " Upon further reflection , they both decided that the expression referred to a previous conversation , in which Aurore had defended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other letters , Claudius frankly explained the resolution he had formed // since his acquaintance with her . She was a superior being , in his eyes , and had , by a word , cured him of all indecision . He had now no other object than science ; medicine was but a secondary branch ; he wished to rise to transcendental ideas ; to cherish no other passion , and to seek of the exact sciences the final cause of creation . His letters were not without value , on account of their cold and blunt sincerity . Deschartres thought that this intellectual intercourse was a very good thing . Nothing seemed to him more natural than a serious correspondence between two young persons , who might have become smitten with each other in discussing Malebranche , Liebnitz , and harmonies . This was not the case , however . Claudius was too much of a pedant not to take a kind of satisfaction in not falling in love , in spite of the occasion . Aurore was too free from every feeling of coquetry , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to see in him anything but a professor . In this , and in several other points , her life was preparing her for a course independent of the received usages of the world . Deschartres , far from restraining her , urged her on to what is called eccentricity , without either of them having the least suspicion of it . One day he informed her of a pleasant surprise which he had received on a visit to a neighboring count . He had been hunting with a young lad in a blouse and cap , and , on treating him a little too unceremoniously , was told by the count that it was his daughter . " I have dressed her as a boy , " said he , " that she may hunt with me , and climb and jump , without being impeded by the clothes which disable women at the age when all their force ought to be called forth . " The count loved to dabble with medical theories , and , in his opinion , this disguise was an admirable hygienic measure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but boys , he seemed anxious to fancy that Aurore was a man . Her petticoats wounded his gravity as a pedagogue , and , as soon as she followed his advice and donned the masculine frock , cap , and gaiters , his authority gained tenfold importance , and he . taught her Latin with renewed violence , as if she could understand him better than before . Aurore found the new costume far more agreeable for running than the embroidered skirts which were torn into tatters by every bush . Deschartres had a passion for the chase , and wished that Aurore should join him in the amusement . But she had no taste for clearing the bushes , which , in that region , were in great abundance , and covered with murderous thorns . She liked only to hunt quails with the birdcall in the wheat-fields . She was very successful in this pursuit , and was able to furnish birds for the table of her grandmother , whose delicate appetite rejected everything but light game . Her exposure , in this way , to the damps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were alleviated only by violent exercise on horseback . Deschartres was always anxious about her health , and the hero found a new reason for insisting on the masculine costume , which enabled her to take rude exercise in the open air . Her mode of life seemed to follow so naturally from her unique position , that she felt no surprise at passing her time so differently from young girls in general . She was regarded as eccentric , but she was not so much so as if she had cherished a taste for affectation and singularity . Left to herself in everything , subject to no control from her grandmother , pushed to absolute independence by Deschartres , free from every trouble of soul or sense , and always thinking of retiring into the convent , with or without monastic vows , in spite of the change in her religious ideaswhat was called by those around her the opinion of the world , had , in her eyes , neither meaning , nor value , nor use . Deschartres had never looked at the world in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he admitted no restriction on his judgments* referred everything to his own wisdom  --  to his own all-sufficience and infalliblity in his own eyes , with the exception of Madame Dupin . Aurore and himself regarded the whole world as a mere dunghill . He was enraged by criticism , instead of laughing at it , as Aurore did . He uttered indignant invectives against the absurd people who blamed her for want of compliance with their customs . In his view Aurore was a piece of perfection . His admiration for her was even more intense than he had ever given to her grandmother , because he regarded her as partly his own work , and saw in her the reflection of his own excellences. // He had a great love of argument and discussion , and to this she sacrificed many hours which she would have preferred to give to her own studies . He deceived himself with the idea that he knew everything ; but he did know a great deal , and had an admirable memory , and hence he was not tiresome , intellectually considered-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exuberance of his vanity . With the most frowning face , and the most absolute language imaginable , he demanded his moments of relaxation and gayety . His pleasantry was solemn , but he laughed heartily at the pleasantry of Aurore . He bore everything from her , and , while he took up a violent aversion to every one who did not admire him , he could not dispense with her teasings and contradictions . He was like a surly mastiff , who would bite everybody else , while he let his ears be pulled by the child of the house . With such a cross-grained pedant for a tutor , and her own independent habits , it was natural that Aurore should scandalize the gossips. of the village . At that time , no woman was permitted to ride on horseback , except on a pillion behind a servant . The costume of Aurore was an abomination ; her study of dead men 's bones , a sacrilege ; the chase , an act of destruction ; study , an eccentricity ; and her gay and tranquil relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she always treated as the companions of her childhood , and gave them her hand without blushing and ruffling , like a love-sick turkey-were called effrontery , depravity , nobody knows what . Even her religion was a subject of comment and stupid calumny . Such astonishing practices , they said , were inconsistent with piety-some deviltry lurked beneath them . She was a votary of the occult sciences . She had pretended to receive the communion , but had been seen to carry away the sacred host in her pockethandkerchief . With Claudius and his brothers , she had made a target of it , and riddled it with pistol-shots . Another time she had ridden her horse into the church , and was driven out by the priest , just as she was caracoling before the high altar . Since that day , they declared , she had never been seen at mass . Andre , too , her poor little rustic page , was not clear from suspicion in the matter . Either he was June , her lover , or a kind of assistant , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be made to confess anything of her secret practices , but she went by night to the cemetery , with Desehartres , to dig up dead bodies . She never slept-did not go to bed for a year . The loaded pistols which Andr6 always carried in the holsters on their horsebackexcursions , and the two big dogs which followed them , were something supernatural . Such were the almost incredible strictures which she was compelled to undergo from the malignant and prejudiced circles of village criticism . Every occasion was seized to subject her to petty humiliations ; but she was never daunted by the spite of her enemies , and in the end had no lack of zealous and effective partisans . She still cherished the dream of entering the convent , although she was emancipated from an exclusive subjection to the Catholic rule . In the autumn of 1824 , her health had become seriously impaired by her constant attendance at the bedside of her grandmother . She slept only every other night , and even this pittance of repose was often interrupted by some trivial demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not manifested in any physical weakness-for at her age she could easily adapt herself to a change of habits-but in a profound depression of spirits . The evil was increased by her insatiable reading of the most sombre poets . She identified herself with the characters portrayed , and suffered all the ills which were ascribed to them . The everlasting burden of human misery seemed to concentrate in her experience , and life was disenchanted of all its joys . She now felt a strong desire for death , and became familiar with the idea of suicide . In fact , this idea soon took possession of her mind , and held her in its gloomy fascination , until it made her the victim of a complete monomania . The sight of water , especially , exercised a mysterious influence over her spirits , and suggested a secret charm in death by drowning . She would walk nowhere but on the bank of the river , and found herself instinctively near the deepest places . Drawn as by a magnet to the spot , she experienced a feverish gayety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is so easy-you have only a step to take . " At first this mania gave her a strange pleasure , but at length it // became so intense as to produce alarm . She could no longer tear herself away from the bank of the river . The fatal question , " Yes or No 7 " haunted her mind-tempting her to plunge herself beneath the transparent wave by which she was magnetized . Her religion led her to regard suicide as a crime . She , therefore , resisted the delirious impulse , by ceasing to approach the water . But her nervous excitability was so great , that she could not pass the curb of a well without an uncontrollable fit of shivering . Still she believed herself cured , when , one day , on a visit to a sick person with Deschartres , they came to the bank of the river on horseback . They were to ford the stream by a narrow passage , a few steps to the right of which the water was twenty feet deep . She rode behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two-when , on reaching the ! niddle of the stream , she was suddenly seized with the passionate delirium for death -- her heart bounded , her sight grew dim , the fatal " Yes " murmured in her ear , and , violently reining her horse to the right , was at once plunged into the deep water , seized with a nervous laugh and an insane joy . She owed her life to the sagacity of Calette , who , instead of drowning , immediately began to swim towards the shore . Deschartres made a terrible outcry , and prepared to rush into the rescue . Aurore had wit enough left to perceive that the old fellow , awkward and badly mounted as he was , would infallibly be drowned . She called out to him to keep still , and then thought of nothing but of saving herself ' . She found it no easy matter to leave the horse while swimming . Both horse and rider , however , behaved admirably . Calette was full of courage and vigor , and with desperate efforts reached the shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very steep . It was a moment of dreadful anxiety for poor Deschartres . He did not lose his presence of mind , and called out to her to catch hold of a branch of willow within reach , and let the animal swim . She thus succeeded in getting ashore . Calette was not so lucky ; but , after throwing his mistress into a panic of terror at his danger of drowning , had the good sense to swim back to the ford , where the other horse was waiting for him . As soon as he saw Aurore safe , Deschartres flew into a ter rible passion , exhausting all the vocabulary of abuse on his helpless victim . At the sight of his livid paleness , and the big tears which ran down his cheeks , she bent her head to the storm , and refrained from contradicting him in his wrath . As he persisted in this violent treatment during their return , she determined to tell him the whole story , and consult him , as a physician , in regard to the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that he would easily comprehend her ; but he expressed no surprise at - the disclosure , and then declared that the malady was inherited from her father . He had been subject to severe attacks of vertigo , which were now reproduced in another form . Deschartres advised his pupil to combat them by a judicious regimen , and by religion  --  a word which she then , for the first time , heard pass his lips . After this immersion in the river , she lost her passion for drowning ; but the attraction of suicide in other forms still remained , in spite of the medical and intellectual assiduities of Deschartres. - Sometimes she experienced a strange emotion in handling fire-arms , and sometimes the vials of laudanum , which were used as lotions for her grandmother , produced a new vertigo . The death of Madame Dupin made an important change in the external relations of Aurore . By the will of her grandmother , her cousin , R6n* Villeneuve , was appointed her guardian . He was a man of intelligence , cultivation , and refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books , society , and the country . Free from the narrow prejudices of provincial life , he was not annoyed by what were called the eccentricities of Aurore . He fired pistols with her , leaped ditches on horseback , sat up reading and talking with her till two or three o'clock in the morning , and never laughed at her attempts in philosophy . On the contrary , he recommended her to write , assured her that it was her vocation , and that there could be no doubt of her success . By his advice she undertook a romance , but the experiment was unsatisfactory . Aurore 's mother , whom the death of Madame Dupin had summoned to Nohant , was indignant at the appointment of a guardian . She bitterly protested against the arramigement , and insisted that her daughter should return with // her to Paris , instead of residing in the family of her Cousin at Chenouceaux . Aurore could not withstand her mother 's violence . She yielded to her tears of passion , and left Nohant with a secret pang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained alone on the family estate . Her situation in Paris was far from agreeable . The jealousies of her mother had alienated M. Villeneuve , who resigned his trust , and left his cousin to her fate . She was now beset with numerous proposals of marriage , some of which were of a highly satisfactory character , according to the estimate of the world ; bat she refused them all , and with sufficient address not to irritate her mother . At length she made the acquaintance of M. Dudevant , to whom she was introduced by some of her most intimate friends , who gave him the highest character . He was the natural son of a military officer , and a young man of refined appearance and agreeable manners . It was not long before he solicited her hand , though without professing to be violently in love . Aurore was pleased with the sincerity of his language and bearing . He said nothing of love , acknowledged that he had no turn for sudden passion , for enthusiasm , nor the power of expressing himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proof against all trials , of the tranquil happiness which he could confidently promise . Aurore was in a state of mind to be more strongly influenced by this calmness than by the most ardent declaration of passion . She was yet undecided between the convent and marriage . Her heart was unconscious of any want . She would have been frightened at any extravagant professions of attachment , She therefore listened to M. Dudevant with sympathy , and finally decided to accept his addresses . The marriage took place in the autumn of 1822 , and after devoting a few days to the reception of bridal visits , Madame Dudevant and her husband , accompanied by her brother hippolyte , departed for Nohant , where they were welcomed with solemn joy by the worthy Deschartres . The ensuing winter was long and severe . The ground was frozen hard , and covered with deep snow . M. Dudevant was fond of the country , and had a passion for the chase . His wife was , accordingly , left a great deal to herself , June , and occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event . She had never before been accustomed to the use of the needle , but she now took it up almost with enthusiasm . Since that time , she tells us that she has loved the employment , and found in *t a recreation to which she was passionately attached . M. Dudevant and Deschartres , who now gave up the stewardship of Nohant , became good friends . The new master had been warned of the absolute and and irascible disposition of the faithful old retainer , and promised to adapt himself to his peculiarities . He offered Deschartres a home in the family during the remainder of his life , and was warmly seconded in this proposal by Madame Dudevant . It seemed as though he could live nowhere else ; but he promptly declined the arrangement , assigning as the reason , that he had been the sole , absolute master of the house for twentyfive years , with none to control him but women , and that it would be impossible to submit to the administration of his successor without annoying him with comments and contradictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his illusions , and in midsummer he quitted Nohant for a little farm which he had purchased with his savings , in the vicinity . The family , meantime , had taken lodgings for the season at Paris , and in the course of the summer , Madame Dudevant gave birth to a son . " It was the happiest moment of my life , " says she , " when , after an hour of profound slumber which succeeded to the terrible sufferings of that crisis , I awoke and found this little being asleep on my pillow . I had dreamed so much of it in anticipation , and was so weak , that I was not sure but I was still dreaming , and feared to move lest the vision should disappear , as heretofore . " In the midst of these excitements , old Deschartres made his appearance at Paris . He was completely boxed up in his old-fashioned bottle-blue coat , with gold buttons , and his head was filled with vast projects of making a fortune at farming . He had such a decidedly rustic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him as he walked in the streets . But he paid no attention to this , and passed on in his majesty . He examined the new-born Maurice with attention , turned him over // on every side , endeavored to find something which he could correct or criticise . lie gave him no caress-indeed he had never been known to give a caress  --  or a kiss to any human being  --  but he held him sleeping on his knees , and contemplated him attentively for some time . At last , being satisfied with the sight of tIle child , he repeated several times that it was time he should now live for himself . The autumn and following winter were passed at Nohant . The whole attention of the young mother was , of course , given to Maurice . In the spring of 1824 , she was seized with a violent attack of low spirits , for which she could not account . The cause was everything and nothing . Nohant was improved , but thrown into confusipa . The old mansion had changed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more order and less inconvenience in the domestic organizalion . The rooms were better kept , the avenues were straightened , and the inclosure enlarged ; the dead trees had been burned up ; the worn-out dogs put to death ; the old , superannuated horses sold-in a word , everything had been renovated . This was , doubtless , a great impr6vement . It occupied and gave satisfaction to the new proprietor . But the transformation impressed Madame Dudevant with a profound melancholy . She no longer felt herself at home . She missed the old familiar objects to which she had been accustomed from childhood , and suffered so deeply from this sinking of the heart , that life again became a burden . Her husband ascribed the difficulty to their residence at Nohant , with its gloomy associations since the death of her grandmother , and expressed the wish to change their abode . They agreed to make the trial , and , accordingly , made arrangements with some friends to be received into their family at a country residence called Le Plessis . They passed a delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family were charming persons , and cherished an ardent friendship for Madame Dudevant . The house was filled with guests , and amusements of every description were the order of the day . They acted comedies , hunted in the park , took long rambles in the woods ; and with such a variety of visitors , no one was at a loss for congenial companions . Madame Dadevant was 609 most attracted by the youngest portions of the society . Including the children and young girls and boys , connections and friends of the family , there were about a dozen in all , and the number was still further augmented by the young people of the farm . Although not the eldest of the party , she was the only married person among them , and the government of the respectable company naturally devolved upon her . They played all sorts of gam*s , in some of which the very youngest , even Maurice , creeping on all - fours , could engage ; planned great excursions in the park and the immense gardens , and gave themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like many others , was astonished to see his wife become so lively and frivolous all at once , in a situation which seemed so contrary to her usual melancholy habits . Some of the guests thought her very eccentric ; but her husband , more indulgent , made up his mind that she was an idiot . Upon the approach of winter , they took a small house in the vicinity of Paris . Their income was not sufficient to enable them to live with ease away from Nohant ; but they dreaded a return to the family estate ; partly , no doubt , from a secret sense of the incompatibility of their characters , which by this time had manifested itself so decidedly as to leave no room for mistake . Without wishing to conceal anything from ench other , they were unable to come to a mutual understanding . The wife had a great antipathy to discussion , and no wish to encroach upon the opinions of others . She tried to see everything with her husband 's eyes , to think as he did , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she found herself in harmony with him , she was so out of harmony with her own instincts , as to fall into a state of the most profound depression- . " My husband , probably , " says she , " experienced something of the same kind , without being able to explain it . He entered warmly into my views when I spoke of enlarging our circle and engaging in amusement . If I had possessed the art to establish an animated external life , if I had been a little more flexible in my nature , if I had had a taste for varied society , he would have been sustained by his intercourse with the world . But I was not at all the compAnion which he Memoirs of George Sand . // needed . I was too exclusive , too selfconcentrated , too free from conventionalism . If I had known the source of the evil , I might have found a remedy ; I might , perhaps , have succeeded in changing myself into another being ; but I did not , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They remained but a short time in their dwelling in the environs , and soon took apartments in a pleasant situation in Paris . Here they were surrounded by a gay society , but Madame Dudevant relapsed into her accustomed melancholy . At this period Deschartres had become tired of his agricultural projects , and was living alone in the city . He now had some grand commercial speculations in his head , and , with a confidence foreign to his nature , became the dupe of unknown adventurers , who contrived to get possession of his money . In the spring of 1825 , the family returned to Nohant , and hearing nothing of Deschartres for three months , sent for information to his lodgings . Poor Deschartres was dead ! His little fortune had been entirely lost . He maintaincd a perfect silence to his last hour . No one knew anything about him . No one had seen him for a long time . He left his furniture to the washer-woman , who had faithfully taken care of him . Besides that , not a word of remembrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adica to any one . He had entirely disappeared , carrying with him the secret of his blasted ambition , or his betrayed confidence . His death affected Madame Dudevant more than she was willing to acknowledge . She at first experienced a sort of relief in being freed from his wearisome dogmatism , but soon felt that she had lost the presence of a devoted heart , and intercourse with a mind in many respects remarkable . Her brother , who had hated him as a tyrant , lamented his end , but did not regret his loss . For herself , to whom he had filled a large portion of her life , had been associated with all the recollections of her childhood , and had furnished the principal spur of her intellectual development , she felt that she was a little more an orphan than before . The secret of his death was never brought to light . From 1825 to 1831 , with the exception of several journeys , the family resided at Nohant . Although there was no end to domestic chagrins , no serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , whem* Madame Dude.vant perceived the necessity of taking a decided course . She determined to separate from her husband by mutual consent , and establish herself at Paris , with her little daughter , who had been born about three years before . It was arranged that she should have permission to reside three months at a time at Nohant . Her son , Maurice , was left under the care of a private instructor , who had been in the family for two years . It was her intention , in coming to Paris , to devote herself to writing as a profession . Her state of mind , in the interval , is feelinglydescribed in her own words : " I had lived over an immense space during those few years . I seemed to have lived a hundred years under the influence of one idea , so weary had I become of gayety without heart , of a home without intimacy , of a solitude which the noise of intoxication made still more intense . Still I had not to complain seriously of any immediate bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have endeavored not to see it . The disorderly conduct of my poor brother , and the comrades whom he led away with him , had not proceeded to such a pitch that I could not inspire them with a sort of fear , which was not condescension , but an instinctive respect . On my side , I had exercised the greatest possible forbearance towards them . So long as they did nothing but drivel , bluster , and annoy , I attempted to laugh , and even accustomed myself to support a tone of pleasantry which was really revolting ; but when my nerves were placed on the rack , when they became gross and obscene , and when even my poor brother , so long submissive and penitent under my remonstrances , grew brutal and malicious , I became deaf to everything , and , as soon as I was able , without making any pretense , retreated to my little chainber . " She had now become an inhabitant of Paris , with limited means of support , with little experience of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely upon herself in her struggle for independence . She was eager for improvement , desirous to emerge from provincial narrowness , and to gain the level of the ideas and the forms of her time . She // was prompted to this no less by necessity than by curiosity . She was conscious of her ignorance , though well schooled in the world of books . With the exception of some of the most celebrated pieces , she had seen irothing of modern art . She was almost a stranger to the theatre , although greatly interested in it . But she perceived that it was out of the question for a poor woman in Paris to indulge in any fancies of that kind . Still she saw her young friends , whom she was intimate with in the country , living on as little as she had herself , and not neglecting any means of intellectual pleasure or improvement . They went everywhere , and saw everything . She had been a great walker at Nohant , but on the Paris pavement she was helpless as a boat upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , she could not learn to hold up her dress , she got bedraggled , fatigued , took constant colds , and found her wardrobe going to ruin with frightful rapidity . Before coming to Paris , she had often asked her mother how she could live on her moderate income in that expensive city . " At my age , and with my habits , " was the reply , " it is not difficult ; but when I was young , and your father wanted money , he thought of dressing me up as a boy . My sister did the same , and we went everywhere on foot with our husbands , and thus saved at least one-half the expense of the family . " Madame Dudevant recalled the conversation , and the idea struck her as a good one . She had dressed like a boy when a child , and it did not seem strange to resume a costume to which she had been accustomed . She , accordingly , had made for her one of the long , gray frock-coats , which were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a gray hat , and a large woolen cravat , she was completely transformed into a young student of the first year . Her new boots gave her the greatest delight . She could almost have slept with them , as her young brother did when he had his first pair . With their iron heels , she stood firm on the pavement . She almost flew from one end of Paris to the other . She felt as if she could make the tour of the world . Her dress was afraid of nothing . She went out in all weather , returned at all hours , and sat in the parterre at all theatres . No one took any notice of her , or suspected her disguise . This costume , however , was assumed only for a temporary purpose , arid was then laid aside , although it has been said that she wore it for many years , and that , even ten years afterwards , her son was often taken for herself . With regard to the adoption of the pseudonyme , George Sand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystery of what , at the time , seemed to her a quite insignificant circumstance . When her novel , " Indiana , " which had been written at Nohant , was ready for the press , he*r mother.in-law , the Baroness I ) udevant , who had heard of her intention to " print a book , " protested against the family name appearing on the title-page . She reassured the stately matron by the promise that her aristocratic blood should not be thus scandalously compromised . Accordingly , she determined that her book should appear anonymously . She had sketched out the plan of a former work , which was afterwards finished by Jules Sandeau , and published under the name of Jules Sand . This became popular , and another publisher made proposals for a new romance with the same pseudonyme . She wished that " Indiana " might appear under that name , but Jules Sandean modestly declined to accept the paternity of a work to which lie was an entire stranger . But this did not meet the views of the publisher . **ith the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insisted on retaining the name . After talking the matter over with some of her friends , a compromise was agreed on , and it was decided that George Sand should be announced as the author of the forthcoming novel . From that time , Jules and George , who were unknown to the public , were regarded as brothers or co*sins , who bid fair to attain a distinguished reputation in literature . After her writings became known in Germany , it was supposed that the name implied a relationship to Carl Sand , the political enthusiast , and the assassin of Kotzebue-  --  and she often received letters from persons in that country requesting an explanation of the affinity . it has also been taken for granted that the pseudonvme , at least , was a proof of her sym*athy with secret societies and political assassinations . This she expressly disclaims , declaring that nei // June , ther are in accordance with her religious principles nor her revolutionary instincts . As to the name itself , she ac-* knowledged that she might have changed it if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , until the time of the publication of " Lelia , " when she was the subject of the most severe criticism , which attacked even to her pseudonyme , she had expected to pass without notice among the crowd of obscure writers . Seeing that , in spite of herself , this was not to be the case , she clung to the name , and continued her work , believing that the con* trary course would have been cowardly . The adoption of the name was an i*ccident . " Whatever it now is , " says she , " I have made it myself , by my own labor , and that alone . I have never used the toil of another . I have never taken , nor bought , nor borrowed a line from any one whatever . Of seven or eight hundred thousand francs , which I have gained in twenty years , nothing remains ; and now ( 1854 ) , as twenty years ago , I live from day to day on this name which protects my labor , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself a penny . I do not feel that any one can reproach me , and , without being proud of anything ( for I have only done my duty ) , my serene conscience sees nothing to change in the name by which it is designated and personified . " Before the publication of the novel , her husband paid her a visit at Paris . lie did not stay at her house , but dined with her every day , and took her to the theatre . He appeared satisfied with the arrangement which , without quarrel or question , had made them independent of each other . She returned with him to Nohant , which she no longer regarded as her own . She criticised none of the changes which had been made in her absence , and , though she found much that was displeasing , she had nothing to say , and said n'othing . Returning to Paris , she devoted herself to writing , where she lived on the productions of her pen , making occasional visits to Nohant , and always sacrificing herself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards effected between her husband and herself . By the judicial decree she was reinstated in the possession of Nohant , and intrusted with the care and education of her children . She thus became both father and mother of a family at once . - With only a moderate income , and partly depending for a livelihood on the precarious gains of authorship , she found her position one of perpetual anxiety and fatigue . But , with increased demands upon her efforts , she was inspired with a higher and more devoted love of her vocation as a writer . The moment that it became not only a personal need but an austere duty , she pursued it with fresh enthusiasm , and derived from it unfailing encouragement , amid many trials . Her state of mind , under the painful complications into which she had been thrown , is sketched in one of the frank confessions with which she often challenges the sympathy of . her reader : " What various solicitudes for a head without very ample resources ; what extremes of life I was compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the obligations of honor  --  the moral and physical care of children exceeding everything else -- the details of a household , the duties of friendship , of charity , and of courtesy ! The days are all too short to prevent the affairs ' of the houseof the family , of business , and of the brain , from falling into disorder . I have done what I could . I have done only what was possible to resolution and faith . I was not sustained by one of those marvelous organizations which embrace everything without effort , and which pass without fatigue from the sick bed of a child to a judicial consultation ; from a chapter of a romance to an examination of accounts . I have taken far more pains than any one would imagine . For many years , I have allowed my , self but four hours ' sleep ; and , for many other years , I have been subject to terrible headaches , which even caused me to faint over my work . Still , things have by no means always gone according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage should be made as indissoluble as possible ; for , to conduct so fragile a b'ark , as the happiness of a family , over the troubled waves of modern society , a man and a woman are not too much-  --  a father and mother mutually sharing the task according to their respective capacities . " The position of Ge6rge Sand led her into friendly and intimate relations with many of the most distinguished characters of the abc . She took a deep interest // in political discussions , as well as those relating to literary and social questions . No portion of her work is more attractive than her personal sketches of several celebrities among the circle of her acquaintance . Her wide experience gives value to her opinions , and her comments on society , as the results of her observation , are not without a certain pensive grace . " I have been conversant in my time , " she says , " with the extremes of society in various relations-with opulence and misery , with the most conservative ideas and the most revolutionary principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different impulses which act upon humanity , and which decide its vicissitudes . I have looked on with attention , have often been deceived , but sometimes have seen clearly . After the despondencies of my youth , I yielded to too many illusions . My morbid skepticism was succeeded by too great beacvolence and ingenuousnc ss . I was a thousand times the dupe of the dream of an archangelic harmony between the opposing forces in the great conflict of ideas . I am still sometimes capable of this simplicity , proceeding from a fullness of the heart , although I ought to be cured of it , for I have bled much . The life which I here relate has been good on the surface . I have enjoyed the pleasant sunshine which was on my children , my friends , my labor ; but the life which I do not relate has been embittered by frightful grief . " In closing the imperfect narrative of her history , as set forth in the ingenuous disclosures of these volumes , we have no wish to disguise or palliate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . She is even more conspicuous for her systematic independence of the wholesome regulations of society than for the splendor of her genius and the boldness of her artistic creations . Nor is this the place to criticise her career or her productions in an ethical point of view . We have endeavored to illustrate the circumstances amidst which her character has received its distinctive impression , the natural traits which have blossomed out into such peculiar development , and the mental experiences which have made her life a perpetual alternation between the most strongly-marked extremes . Her strange , eventful biography , which has not yet reached its denouement , awaits the verdict of the age . In pronouncing the final decision , let the stern behests of justice be mingled with the tender pleadings of Christian charity .
