txt ART . 11. - Five Years in an English University . By CHARLES ASTOR BRIsTED , late Foundation Scholar of Trinity College , Cambridge . New York : G. P. Putnam. 1852. 2 vols. l2mo . MR . BRIsTED 's book contains an intolerable amount of flippancy , slang , and self-conceit . But it also affords much information upon a very interesting topic , - information which would be sought in vain elsewhere . It gives a full and clear account of the practical operation of the English University system , bringing out into strongest relief those points in which it differs most from the plan of education adopted in our American Colleges , and thereby enabling the reader to judge of the merits and deficiencies of both . No one ever enjoyed more favorable opportunities for making comparisons between the two schemes of University education . Of English descent by his father 's side , though an American by birth , enjoying a competency or even a superfluity of wealth , half a dandy and half a // scholar by natural inclination , equally proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sherry cobblers , " a liberal in English politics and a stout conservative in New York , - his prejudices may be supposed to have neutralized each other , and to have left his mind open and without bias to the reception of the truth . Soon after graduating at an early age , and with some distinction , at Yale College , he went to England and entered at Trinity College , Cambridge , where he remained five years , winning high honors , though not the highest , as a classical scholar , and by his companionable qualities acquiring a large circle of friends . He gives a very lively , and , we have every reason to believe , a very truthful , sketch of life in an English University , of the facilities and the incitements for study which it affords , and of the characters and pursuits of the multitude who there receive their chief intellectual culture . The inordinate vanity of the writer , in one respect , has been of service to the work ; it has led him to chronicle with singular frankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether , or kept in the background . Mr. Bristed tells the whole story , even when his better feelings and principles whisper that the disclosure is a perilous or shameful one . That a young man should be elated by a little distinction gained at College into an undue estimate of his own powers and acquirements , is so common an occurrence , that we are not at all disposed to judge it harshly . But when this feeling leads him to be pert and supercilious in his judgment of others , to speak sneeringly of those institutions of education in his mother country of which he knows nothing except from hearsay , and contemptuously of the scholastic acquirements of men who have grown gray in those studies into which he has only made a dashing inroad , his presumption appears more serious , and merits a harsher name than juvenile indiscretion . However mature in years he may be , the open manifestation of such feelings is essentially boyish ; it certainly proves that his education is incomplete in one respect , as it has not yet taught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgets himself , and pursues his proper theme , the explanation of the English theory of a liberal education , and the mode in which it is reduced to // practice at the University of Cambridge , comparing both its merits and defects with the plan of collegiate education which is generally adopted in this country , his remarks are sensible and instructive . We think he overestimates the advantages of the English system , and generalizes too rapidly when he takes it for granted , that a few peculiarities of Yale , of which institution alone he has any personal knowledge , are necessary features of all American Colleges . It is only as a student , or an undergraduate , moreover , that he has become familiar with the operations of the two systems . If his stay , either at New Haven or Cambridge , had been so far prolonged as to obtain experience in giving as well as receiving instruction , so me of his opinions might have been materially modified . As the general subject of University education is now attracting much attention in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we propose to glean from these volumes all the information which they afford respecting it , and then to consider what features we may profitably borrow from the English plan . The first object , therefore , will be to gain a clear notion of what is actually done at the two great English Universities . The difference between them is not great ; and , from other sources of information respecting Oxford , we have obtained some knowledge of the details of instruction there , which may be compared with Mr. Bristed 's account of the sister University . In both cases , the University is a confederation of Colleges , the latter being distinct corporations , that need only the power of granting degrees in order to correspond very perfectly with institutions of the same name in America . The Colleges are independent , and , to a certain extent , are rivals of each other . Trinity College , which is the largest at Cambridge , has about the same number of students who have not yet taken their first degree , as Yale ; St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many undergraduates as there are at Harvard . These two contain about half the population of the University . There are fifteen other Colleges , most of which are very small ; they do not average over fifty undergraduates each . The theory is , that the Colleges give the instruction , and the University confers the degrees , holding two public examin // ations for that purpose , to one of which the student is subjected about the middle , and to the other at the end , of his undergraduate course . Each College , also , subjects all its students to annual examinations of its own , and offers Scholarships and other prizes , to be contended for at special examinations of those only who choose to become competitors for them . These examinations , and the honors and emoluments which are obtained by those who excel in them , are the pecuiar features of the English University system . No instruction whatever , upon which attendance is compulsory , is offered by the University at large ; and very little such instruction is afforded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures on various subjects to all who choose to attend ; but the number of auditors is usually very small . Out of the fifteen hundred undergraduates in the University , not more than fifty attended Dr. Whewell 's course on Moral Philosophy , while Professor Sedgwick lectured on Geology to thirty . Mr. Bristed tells us he was one of three who listened to Professor Cumming 's course on Chemistry , in 1841 . Several of the Professors do not lecture at all , probably because they can not obtain any hearers. * But in 1848 , " by way of giving the Professors something more to do , " it was provided that all candidates for an ordinary degree should attend , for at least one term , the lectures of one of the Professors , taking his choice among thirteen of them . With this exception , all the instruction which the student is required to receive is that given by the College Tutors , whose exercises are informal or catechetical lectures , which , in the earlier part of the course , are not unlike the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and third years , gradually become " lectures " properly so called , at which the students have nothing to do but to listen and take notes . At Trinity College , the Freshmen are required to attend daily two such lectures , one classical and the other mathematical , each occupying one hour . In the second and third years , the student has his choice of one lecture out of three or four . But the plan of studying with a private tutor being almost universal , Mr. Bristed tells us " the public lectures are , with // some happy exceptions , rather in the way of , than any help to the best men . " Without the aid afforded by the private tutors , he further says , " I should have gained but very moderate benefit from the public instruction of the College ; and I believe every man , except those from the public schools , would say the same thing . " " With regard to the College lectures delivered to the Junior and Senior Sophs , there is frequently , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is owing to the limited nature of the subject . For instance , one of the best Mathematical Fellows at Trinity or John 's is lecturing on some high branch of Mathematics - something of which the Differential Calculus is merely the alphabet ; none but high men can take interest in , or derive profit from such lectures . Now as there are only , on an average , twelve Wranglers from John 's , and nine from Trinity every year , the class is of necessity limited to a dozen , and the lecture takes very much the form of an examination . In Classics , it depends chiefly on the lecturer whether he has a good class or not . The lectures , though mainly for the benefit of a particular Year , which is to be examined at the May in the subject lectured upon , are open without extra fee to all the College ; and a lecturer who has made one author his sp*cialit* , and can translate and explain him in an interesting manner , will be sure to have a large attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . His rooiu was always crowded ; his audience comprised not only the Junior Sophs for whom the lecture was specially intended , but Senior Sophs , Bachelors , and even Feb lows . Nay , some men of other Colleges applied to be admitted ; but this , if I remember rightly , was contrary to the College rules and usages . " Vol. i. pp. 178 , 179 . A College is a corporate society for the encouragement of learning , endowed with property for the maintenance of its Head , of a certain number of Fellows , who are usually graduates , or have taken at least their first degree , and of a certain number of Scholars , ' who are usually undergraduates . All these persons receive certain emolumeuts or * The Head of a College may be called , according to its Statutes , either President , Rector , Warden , Dean , Principal , Master , or Provost. t The Scholars of Magdalea College , Oxford , are called Dernies , because entitled by the Statutes to a demi ration or allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taberdars , because they formerly wore the peculiar gown called a lhbard . The Students of Christ Church correspond at first to the Scholars , and afterwards to the Fellows , of other Colleges ; that is , both graduate and undergraduate members are designated by this name . // allowances , and are said to be " on the foundation ; " and with them the organization of the College is properly complete . The original intention of the Founders was , that all the members of the institution , whether they were instructors or pupils , should receive salaries , or have at least the larger portion of their expenses paid . But there is also another class of undergraduates , who are not entitled to share the bounty of the Founders and benefactors , and though they are often the most numerous body , are simply an accident in the University , and form no part of its essential organization . These are the Commoners , Fellow or Gentleman Commoners , Pensioners , Sizars , &amp;c. , whose generic appellation is " members not on the foundation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees fit , to members of this class , and afford them , on terms by no means disadvantageous to itself , the same facilities for study and obtaining a decree as are enjoyed by its Scholars . But this is purely voluntary ; and some Colleges , therefore , both at Cambridge and Oxford , restrict themselves to the members on the foundation . The academical year at Cambridge consists of three terms , - Michacimas , Lent , and Easter , - which really comprise only twenty-two weeks , thus leaving thirty weeks for vacation . What is called " the Long " vacation extendsfrom the end of May to the 20th of October . We are further told , that each of the terms is divided into two parts ; " and after division ' in the Michaelmas and Lent terms , a student , who can assign a good plea for absence to the Gollege authorities , may go down and take holiday for the rest of the term , having already kept enough of the term to answer the University requisition . " All the lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , when most of the students leave Cambridge , - or " go down , " to adopt the University slang ,  --  and the Commencement practically takes place in the " Long " vacation . It is obvious that the venerable University does not impose any severe labor upon the candidates for a bachebr 's degree . As public instruction is given , on an average , only for about one hour a day during twentytwo weeks of the year , and as the undergraduate course occupies only three years and a third , the requisitions at the public examinations must be very moderate , or the // University would furnish no means for complying with its own demands . We find , accordingly , that the requisitions for admission , for the intermediate examination , or " the Little Go , " and for the final examination , preparatory to receiving a bachelor 's degree , are moderate . Of course , we are now speaking only of what is essential , or what must be performed , before graduating . Still , the greater number of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are obliged to do ; low as the standard is , they do not aspire to rise above it . We shall speak afterwards of the candidates for University honors , and of those who , if they do not enter into the competition for the great prizes of academic life , are still desirous of something more than graduating among the ignoble crowd . Out of about 330 students who receive their first degree at Cambridge every year , over 200 content themselves with " going out in Poll , " as it is termed , or doing just enough to escape being " plucked . " Mr. Bristed says that this is " equivalent to doing nothing for half the course ; " to which we should add , and doing very little for the other half . ' But our readers shall judge . " Before you arc fairly in your college you must pass an examination . At many of the colleges this is little more than nominal , any Master of Arts being qualified to admit a candidate ; but at Trinity there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not very high . The candidates for admission are examined in the First Book of the Iliad , the First Book of the ZEneid , some easy Greek and Latin Prose , Arithmetic , the elements of Algebra , two Books of Euclid , and Paley 's Natural Theology . Any one fitted for the Sophomore Class at Yale could pass here without trouble . The candidates are generally well prepared , and the examiners lenient : out of one hundred and thirty or more who offer themselves there are seldom more than four or five rejected . The principle seems to be , Let in every one , and if they ca n't keep on , that is their look-out . ' In this way , various initiation fees are secured which would otherwise be lost . On a rough estimate , out of one hundred and twenty who enter every year at Trinity , more than twenty drop off by the beginning of the second year . This is the only entrance examination , and however much you may know , there is no such thing as entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men migrating from Oxford , who are allowed their Oxford terms , and can take second or third year rank 5* // at once . The regular examiners are the Dean and the Head Lecturer . The latter functionary was busy about some other matters when I presented myself , several days after the begianing of the term . Accordingly , I was told that my classical examination would be postponed to some convenient opportunity , and meanwhile the Senior Dean would admit me on passing the mathematical part of the examination privately to him . " Vol. i. pp. 15,16 . It is very easy , then , to enter the University , and we have only to inquire how much must be done after you get there . At the intermediate examination , or " the Little Go , " which is held about the middle of the second year , the student is examined by the University authorities in Paley 's Evidences of Christianity , and on one Greek subject and one Latin subject . Notice is given a year beforehand which subject will be taken , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formidable ordeal . In Greek , one book of Homer or Herodot us , or a Greek Tragedy , or two short Dialogues of Plato are usually selected ; in Latin , it is generally one book of Livy or Tacitus . " It will be seen , from the above statement , that there is nothing in the Little Co to occupy a good school-boy of fifteen more than three or four months ; and for a Second-year Cantab of good standing , there is really nothing to prepare except the Paley ; he might without danger trust to the light of nature for his Classics , or if scrupulous to run no risk , read them up sufficiently for practical purposes in three days , and the same time properly applied would make him master of his Evidences . Nevertheless the Classical men do grumble a little , chiefly I imagine on account of the two or three days consumed in the examination , which some of them can ill spare at that juncture , and because they can gain no credit in a pass examination and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessness in Paley . On the Mathematical men it comes rather harder ; some of them , especially in the Small Colleges , are much behindhand in their Classics , and require some time to get up their subjects . But I believe no one of any mathematical eminence ever was plucked for the Little Go , though some have been placed in the second class ; and it is so obvious that a Second-year collegian ought to know Classics enough to pass such an examination , that no attempt has ever been made to alter it in the way of diminution . But within the last three years , as one of a system of changes tending to equalize the requirements from Mathematicians and Classics , two books of Euclid and ordinary Arithmetic were // added , and about the same time a knowledge of Old Testament History was made a requisite . " Vol. i. pp. 126- 128 . At the final examination , the candidate for an ordinary degree must be prepared upon the following subjects - Paley 's Moral Philosophy , Ecclesiastical History , three books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mechanics and Hydrostatics , and the Acts of the Apostles in the original , together with one Greek and one Latin subject , which are announced two years beforehand , and usually consist of one book of history , or an oration , tragedy , or dialogue . The examination upon the last three subjects involves such questions upon history , geography , and antiquities as are suggested by the text . To prepare the candidate for this portion of the ordeal , his private tutor " crams " him , in the course of a few days , with au amount of information sufficient to answer all questions that are likely to be asked ; Paley aud Ecclesiastical History are " got up* ' in a similar manner by a few days ' labor . We do not speak here of the Cbllege examinations ; for though all the undergraduates are subject to them , they form no part of the University preparation for a degree . At " the May " examination in Trinity College , 50 marks or credits , out of the 8,000 which are given for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being " posted , " or mentioned separately as " unworthy to be classed ; " and the only penalty for being twice posted , in successive years , is that the wittol is " advised " to remove to one of the smaller Colleges , or to try some other pursuit . He may still save his degree , if he can pass the University ordeal . At Oxford , the year is divided into four terms , and residence for twelve terms is all that is necessary for a degree , though sixteen are nominally required . The allowance of vacation is even larger than at Cambridge , as the academical year does not necessarily include more than eighteen weeks ; though the proper working period is six weeks longer . A " New Examination Statute " was passed little more than a year ago , the printed explanations of which lie before us , and from them we glean the following particulars . As it is not designed to have a retroactive effect , or to alter the University course for // those who entered before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will not be before Easter Term , 1853 . Whatever may be thought of the amount of study which it enjoins , it is certainly an improvement upon the system previously in force ; the requisitions are increased by it , and the examinations are made to cover more ground . It establishes three University examinations , which virtually correspond to the three years of the undergraduate course ; though provision is made for those who fail at the first trial in the earlier onqs , by allowing him to repeat the attempt after an interval of six months , or even of a year . If imperfectly prepared , he may even postpone making the trial to the end of the longer period . At the first trial , which is called " the Responsions , " the student must be prepared upon a given portion of one Greek and one Latin author , upon two books of Euclid , Algebra to the end of Simple Equations , and Arithmetic as far as the extraction of the square root ; he will also be required to translate some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may offer five books of Homer , or any two plays of the dramatists , or any two consecutive books either of Herodotus or Thucydides , or any four consecutive books of Xenophon 's Anabasis . In Latin , the list proposed for him to choose from is so long that we shall copy but a portion of it ; he may offer any four orations of Cicero , or two books of the De Officiis , or any three consecutive books of Livy , or the Georgics of Virgil , or five books of the iEneid . The next step is the " First Public Examination , " which properly belongs to the close of the second year , when the student must be prepared upon the Four Gospels in Greek , and upon one Greek and one Latin author , of which one must be a poet and the other an orator ; the amount in each , or the number of books , is about the same as at the former trial , - say six books of Homer , or as many of Virgil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction is , that the student can not offer the same books which he brought up at the Responsions . He is also examined in Aldrich 's Logic , or three books of Euclid and the first part of Algebra ; and he is required to translate into Latin a passage of English prose . For " The Public Examination " which concludes the // course , and is the immediate preparation for a bachelor 's degree , the first requisition now is , that candidates must present " a certificate that they have attended two courses of public lectures . " As this refers to the Professorial lectures , it is the greatest innovation which has been attempted at Oxford for many years . It is a return to the ancient system , which prevailed before the Colleges had taken the work of tuition out of the hands of the University , and reduced the latter to the shadow of a shade , - a mere instrument for holding the Colleges together and conferring the degrees . Under the new plan , many of the Professorships will cease to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire the incumbents with fresh energy , and render their lectures a capital feature in the general scheme of a University education . They are twenty-eight in number ; and the undcrgradnates having the privilege of selecting any two of them , a *pirit of competition must be awakened which will greatly add to their usefulness . This final examination is to take place in two " Schools , " or , as we should say , in two classes of subjects , one of which , that is to be passed first and by all , is called the School of Lilerce fluinaniores ; while for the other , the candidate has his choice among the three Schools of Mathematics , Natural Science , and Law and Modern History . The ordeal in the two Schools is not necessarily passed in the same term , but an interval of six months may occnr between them . The minimum in the School of Lilerw ilutunaniores includes the Four Gospels and the Acts in Greek , Sacred History or the subjects of the books of the Old and New Testaments , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one historian , Greek or Latin , but not the same books which were brought up at the Responsions ; " those at " the First* ' examination " being a poet and an orator , can not of course avail for this examination . " In regard to the other School , if the candidate elects that of Mathematics , he is examined in the first six books of Euclid , or the first part of Algebra ; if he chooses Natural Science , a knowledge of two out of the three branches of Mechanical Philosophy , Chemistry , and Physiology , always including , however , some one branch of Mechanical Philosophy , is // required ; if he takes Law and Modern History , he is examined on the History of England from the Conquest to the accession of Henry VIII. , with Blackstone on Real Property ; or from the accession of Henry VIII . to that of Queen Anne , with Blackstone on Personal Property and the Rights of Persons . Justinian 's Institutes may be offered in lien of Blackstone . At the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bachelor 's degree under the New Statute , we find the humble remark ,  --  It is very desirable that all who enter the University should be well versed in Arithmetic " - a caution which , in this country , would be deemed very proper for the candidates for admission into a High School . We have only to add , that the terms of admission at Oxford , and the general course of public instruction there , are nearly the same as at Cambridge . The requirements for entrance at some of the Colleges and Halls are almost nominal ; while at others , which can afford to be select in receiving students , they are about as strict as at Trinity College , Cambridge . Instruction is given by the College Tntors in the same manner , and to about the same extent , as in the sister University ; and the College examinations , corresponding to " the Mays " at Cambridge , and here called " Collections , " are strictly private . Each student chooses a Greek and a Latin book , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having no effect on his standing in the University , or on his chance of obtaining a degree . The brief sketch now given shows , not only all that is required at either of the English Universities for obtaining a bachelor 's degree , but all that is actually performed by the major part of the students , - Mr. Bristed says , by four sevenths of them . To afford the means of comparison , we subjoin in a note what is required for admission to Harvard College here in New England ; other American Colleges demand nearly as much. * The result of the * Candidates for admission to Harvard College are examined in the following books in the Latin department ; - the whole of Virgil , the whole of Ca*sar 's Commentaries , ten Orations of Cicero , Latin Grammar , including Prosody and Versification , and writing Latin . In Greek , they are examined in the Grammar , including Prosody and Versification , in writing Greek with the Accents , and in Feltons Greek Render . This Reader contains twentyseven Dialogues of Lucian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a startling one , and will doubtless take our readers by surprise ; but there appears no reason to doubt its correctness . It may be snmmed up in the statement , that , before the recent changes took place , or till within three years , a student might enter either at Oxford or Cambridge , might pass through the undergraduate course , and finally obtain his first degree , with less labor and study , and less knowledge of Latin and Greek and Mathematics , than are required for admission to what is some* times called " the University at Cambridge " here in America . The recent changes , ( which are all incorporated in the account we have here given , ) have added so much to the list of requisitions , that we should now fix the point of comparison with Harvard College , not at the period of admission , but at the close of the Freshman year. * It will doubtless be said , that the English examinations , though they nominally cover less ground , are really more searching arid complete ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order that the candidates may be compared with each other in respect to the thoroughness of their acquisitions , and a complete classification of them be made out according to their success in passing the ordeal , the examination is intentionally rendered so comprehensive and severe , that even the " Captain of the Poll , " or the most successful candidate , fails to obtain the highest mark in every from the Cyrop*dia , the Anabasis , and the Hellenica , ) about half a hook of Herodotus , a series of extracts from two hooks of Thucydides , one Oration of Lysias , nearly a whole hook of the Odyssey , several extracts from two plays of Euripides and one of Aristophanes , and a selection of shorter pieces from Anacreon , Sappho , Simonides , Callistratus , and Moschus . The Candidates are also examined in Arithmetic , in Algebra throughout Equations in the first degree , and in an Introduction to Geometry . They are fur . ther required to know the elements of Ancient History and Ancient Geography . The examination extends through two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part conducted by writing . Printed extracts in Latin and Greek are given , of which the candidate is required to write a translation into English , and an easy passage of English prose must be translated into Latin and Greek . But in these written exercises , the use of a grammar and dictionary is allowed . * The Classical and Mathematical studies of the Freshman year at Harvard include two books of Livy , the Odes and Epodes of Horace , one book of the Tusculan Disputatious , the Panegyricus of Isocrates , Selections from the Greek Historians equivalent to two books of Herodotus , exercises in writing Latin and Greek , recitations in ancient history and classical antiquities , one complete treatise on Geometry , and another on Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. // particular . But , of course , the University " standard " is determined by the qualifications , not of the Captain , but of the lowest recruit in the ranks ; - by the smallest attainments that xviii enable the student " to pass , " or to obtain a degree . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less classical and mathematical knowledge than is necessary for completing the Freshman year at 1-larvard . But we should have a very imperfect and unjust idea of the English University system , if we were to stop here . Besides the passmert at Oxford and o* 7*o ) *io1 at Cambridge , or the ignoble crowd whose only object is to obtain a degree with as little labor and in as short time as possible , there are the candidates for the College and University distinctions and emoluments , and a few others , who , thoucxh indifferent about such prizes , still " live laborious days " at these ancient seats of learning , and endeavor to make the best use of the advantages there afforded for pursuing their favorite studies , or qualifying themselves for the particular profession which they have chosen . There is a fair proportion of such students at both Universities ; probably a larger proportion than at any other College in the world . And the reason why there are so many of them is obvious ; fairer prizes and larger inducements are held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the vast endoxvments of Oxford and Cambridge are applied to " Exhibitions , " Scholarships , and Fellowships , which are generally tenable only for a fixed period of years , so that many vacancies occur every year , and are filled by free competition . " A Trinity Scholarship is worth ? 60 a-year , if the holder remains constantly in residence - ? 40 to most men according to the extent to which they usually avail themselves of it . Some of the Small-College Scholarships arc worth ? 100 per annum . A Fellowship gives an income of from ? 200 to ? 400 . A friend of mine was , during his third year , between School " Exhibitions , " College Scholarships and Prizes , and the University Scholarship , in the receipt of more than Seventeen Hundred dollars ; and as his expenses did not exceed half that sum , he was a gainer to the amount of the other half by receiving his education . Indeed , it is a common saying , and hardly an exaggerated one , that a poor student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother and sisters for life . " Vol. i. p. 202. // We find , on a rough calculation from the University Calendar , that there are about 350 Fellowships at Cambridge , and nearly 700 Scholarships and Exhibitions . Oxford has about 400 Fellowships , 350 Scholarships , and 130 Portionists , Bible Clerks , IDemies , Choristers , &amp;c. , who are only Fellows or Scholars under another name . We have not included in this enumeration the Heads of Houses , or Principals of the several collegiate establishments , who are chosen from the older Fellows in orders , and whose situations are the most lucrative in the University , being generally comfortable sinecures , their incumbents being also permitted to marry , a privilege that is denied to the others . Oxford , moreover , has no less than 430 benefices , or livings in the Church , at its disposal , which , as they fail in , are given by seniority to the Felloxvs who have taken orders . Cambridge , also , has a large number of these situations in the Church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fellows who have become weary of learned leisure at the University , or are desirous of committing matrimony . These lucrative situations , - Scholarships* Felloxvships , benefices , and all , - as a general rule , do not belong to the University at large , but are the particular endowments of the respective Colleges and Halls , among which they are very unequally distributed . For obvious reasons , those Colleges have the largest number of undergraduates which have most of these rich prizes to distribute . The ordinary practice is , that each College elects to vacancies from the students of its own establishment , often limiting the choice in great part to those who are studying for holy orders . Among the Cambridge Colleges , Trinity has the greatest number of lucrative Scholarships and Fellowships , which are open to competition by all corners . Consequently , it has most students , and the rivalship among them is very keen . Mr. Bristed tells us it is not unusual for one of its members who has obtained a high rank , but not the highest , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle arrives , to shift his residence to one of the smaller Colleges , where he will be sure of a Fellowship , though not perhaps so valuable a one , without effort . Competition for these lucrative posts is not always open . At Oxford , especially , and in many instances at Cam // bridge , they are often close ; that is , they are reserved for natives of particular counties or towns , or for those who have been edncated at certain schools ; or they are so tied up , that birth or interest , more than any positive amount of scholarship , usually procure the candidate 's election . Perhaps the larger proportion of such ungenerous restrictions is one reason why Oxford is inferior in reputation as a seminary of learning to its sister University . It is certain that its four colleges , Baliol , Oriel , Lincoln , and Wadham , where the Scholarships and Fellowships have been , either wholly or in part , thrown open to general competition , now usually furnish the most promising students of the University . Oriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whateley , Coleridge , ( afterwards Jndge of the King 's Bench , ) Keble , Hampden , and Dr. Arnold ; and it was then called , in allusion to the tastes of its most distinguished Fellows , the best school of speculative philosophy in England . On the other hand , All Souls , one of the most magnificent collegiate establishments in the world , with the most ample resources , with a building like a palace , and a library of forty thousand volumes , has no undergraduate members , and can not be considered an establishment for education ; but it has forty Fellows , who are only required by statute to be bene nati , bene vest it i , et in arte cantandi mediocriter docti . Of course , its Fellows are chosen from the graduates of the other Colleges . New College at Oxford is a mere continuation , or upper branch , of Winchester School , as King 's College at Cambridge is of Eton ; both being endowed for the benefit only of the students who come up to them from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in the University , but in the Public School which sends up the future Scholars and Fellows ; the best scholars at Winchester and Eton , who are elected to the vacancies in these Colleges as fast as they occur , are , in fact , provided for throughout their undergraduate course , and , in many cases , for life . So , also , when Fellowships are appropriated to the residents of certain counties or towns , there is usually more or less competition for them , the prize being too valuable to be left to a single candidate . But there is not much distinction in winning the race , except when the course is open to all comers ; and this is generally the case at Cambridge . // Now , the whole business of the two Universities , beyond that of granting ordinary degrees in the manner and upon the terms already explained , may be said to consist in the proper distribution of these munificent rewards of learning . They make scholars because they are able to offer rich prizes for scholarship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it consists in great part of the rigid annual examinations of the candidates " for Honors , " as they are called ; though most of them are , in fact , candidates only for the Scholarships , Fellowships , and fat livings in the Church , which are the sure rewards for obtaining " Honors . " The University does not undertake to impart the instruction , but only to ascertain who , among many aspirants , are the most capable and most learned , - whether they have become so through the advantages previously enjoyed by them , or by their own efforts , or by private tuition since they became residents in a College . The candidates are prepared for the strife by a system of training which has sprung up outside of the proper work of the place , and which has been so largely and successfully developed , that it has completely dwarfed the latter and thrown it into the shade . It may be called the system of " cramming " by Private Tntors , who are not recognized by the University , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not interfering with the formal business of the place . The proper authorities of the institution assume no responsibility for these tutors , do not appoint them , and do not even designate the classes of its own members from whom they must be selected . Each student chooses , as his own private tutor , any Master of Arts , or any Bachelor , whom he deems capable of serving him in that capacity . If he is one of the few competitors for the highest honors and most lucrative appointments which are to be distributed in his year , he selects as his tutor one who has obtained like honors and appointments a year or two before . If he is less ambitious , a scholar of less note will serve his turn ; if he wishes to graduate only " in the Poll , " or among the crowd who seek ordinary degrees , one who has recently graduated in the same ignoble manner will best answer his purpose . He selects as the best guide one who has // just been over the very path which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private tutor is called " a coach , " and his pupils , of whom he has usually five or six , are styled his " team . " " The chief requisite of a Poll coach , " Mr. Bristed informs us , " is patience , as his pupils are likely to be very stupid or very lazy , and in either case very ignorant ; a man of any ability and knowledge going out in the Poll is able to be his own tutor for the occasion . " This last statement , by the by , considering that a large majority of the students " go out in the Poll , " is not very consistent with the following remark made in another place , and coupled with one of our author 's frequent sneers against American professors . The private tutor " is by no means an aristocratic appendage , ' as a wise professor on this side of the water once imagined ; but an ordinary and almost necessary feature in the college life of every student , rich or poor . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil attends for one hour each day , is fifty pounds ( nearly $250 ) a year ; Fellow Commoners pay more , and Sizars less . Consequently , a Fellow , or a Bachelor student who is reading for a Fellowship , is enabled to add twelve or fifteen hundred dollars to his income from this resource alone ; and the opportunity of taking private students is to be added to the other pecuniary rewards which the University holds out to its successful pupils . The system is one which , in great measure , supports and perpetuates itself , without entailing much care or labor upon those who are placed in authority , and have the nominal charge of the whole concern . The Professors , as has been shown , do little or nothing ; the Heads of Houses and Senior Fellows have either grown fat and indolent in the enjoyment of their beautiful rooms , fine gardens , and comfortable incomes , or their attention is wholly absorbed by their particular pursuits in literature or science , their part in the great work of obtaining and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , juniores ad labores , is fully carried out at an English University . The College tutors and lecturers , the private tutors , and even the moderators and examiners , who conduct the great annual examinations , or prizefights , // are generally chosen from the latest graduates , and a new generation of them come upon the stage at least as often as once in three or four years . There is an obvious reason for thus throwing the burden upon the younger men . Every year , the rivalship " for Honors " is so keen , and the efforts made by the competitors to extend and perfect their acquisitions , so as to ensure success , are so immense , that the standard of former years is quickly attained and passed . One who hopes to become a Senior Wrangler must know all that the Senior Wrangler of the preceding year can teach him , and not consider his chance a good one till he has added something even to these large acquisitions . In about three years , both these persons may have become moderators or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of questions and exercises then set by them will be sure to include all that they knew at the time of graduating , and whatever they may have since learned . Mr. Bristed tells us that a particular passage from a Greek or Latin author is often set to be translated for the sake of a single " catch , " dependent upon a nice point of ambiguous or difficult construction . Under such a state of things , it is obvious that a generation of scholars is likely to become very soon superannuated . It is equally obvious that such discipline tends to render scholarship excessively minute ; the examination papers nowadays show a great deal of what may be called infinitesimal learning . The great vice of the system is , that it looks , not to any comprehensive and generous culture of all the thinking faculties , but only to the means , fair or unfair , of distancing all competitors at the great annual examinations , and thereby attaining the splendid rewards which the University is able to bestow . What the private tutors impart is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a specific and laborious training for one narrow object , very much like that which an experienced jockey administers to the high-mettled colt that is expected to win the Derby for the year . Mr. Bristed 's book throws unexpected light upon this point ; and his evidence is the more valuable , as it comes from a decided partisan of the system , whose only purpose in writing is , to show the vast inferiority of the American plan of collegiate education , // and to recommend the English model for our adoption . lie writes without seeing or even suspecting the conclusion that must be drawn from his own testimony . In defending the system of private tuition , he shows very conclusively that it forms an essential part of the English University system ; that a scholar of the largest general attainments , and the most accurate knowledge of the classics and mathematics , would certainly be " floored " on the Cambridge examination papers , if he had not had a private tutor at his elbow , for some months at least before the trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to pursue in order not to " waste " time and effort upon subjects that would not come into play at the great ordeal ; to teach him to write against time , as " pace , " or speed , is a great element of success on these occasions ; and to cram him with as many " dodges " in translation and extempore Greek and Latin versification as possible , besides supplying him with the means of opening many particular " catches " which would probably be set as traps for the uninitiated . We do not mean that there is any intentional unfairness in the mode of conducting the examinations ; quite the contrary . The reputation of all the parties concerned depends on the scrupulous honesty , the even-handed justice , that is shown in every part of the proceedings ; every possible precaution is taken to exclude favoritism and deception . A candidate understands very well , that his chance of success is not a whit improved even if his own private tutor happens , as is not unfrequently the case , to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the habit of the University is so firmly fixed , the particular line of scholarship in which the candidates are expected to excel , and the general character of the tests by which he will be tried , are so peculiar , that there is no hope of success except by obtaining the guidance of a person who thoroughly knows the ground , and has very recently been over it . One who has an admirable knowledge of the geography of the whole earth may yet irrecoverably lose his way in a not very extensive forest . In such cases , a local guide is indispensable . We will hear Mr. Bristed himself , as to the kind of assistance , for it hardly deserves to be called instruction , which is expected from these private teachers . // " To make up for former deficiencies , and to direct study so that it may not be wasted , are two desiderata which probably led to the introduction of private tutors , once a partial , now a general appliance . Now , it is true , that the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for any one who enters very deficient in them to he worked up by nny means so as to take a good degree ; yet even here a great deal may be done , and a very inaccurate and superficial knowledge be filled in and polished up to a surprising extent ; while in Mathematics , the student who comes up knowing only his First-year subjects , but with a very good capacity for science , has time enough , under proper direction , to get a place among the first twenty Wranglers , or even the first ten . And it is through his tutor 's aid that many a Classical man , who could never have passed of himself ; saves his distance in Mathematics , or is even pushed into the Senior Optim*s , so as to be qualified for a Medal ; and that many a Freshman takes a First Class in the May Examination , and is thereby encouraged to go on reading for Honors , instead of being disgusted and killed off at the outset . Moreover , even for the subjects in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to keep him at his work and prevent him from losing ground . The daily or ter-weckly attendance has a beneficial effect in making the pupil work regularly , nor is the tutor in most cases at all slow to blow up any of his team who give signs of laziness . Indeed , this was an acknowledged requisite of a good coach . I am afraid of going to T- , ' you may hear it said , he do n't slang his men enough . ' In working np a clever man whose previous training has been neglected , in cramming a man of good memory but no great brilliancy , in putting the last polish to a crack man and quickening his pace , so as to give him a place or two among the highest in either Tripos ,  --  in such feats , a skilful tutor will exhibit consummate jockeyskip ; he seems to throw a part of himself into his pupil and work through him . " The student reading with a Classical tutor , translates to him from some ( prepared ) author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the tutor 's rooms , examination fashion , both translations and compositions , which , after being corrected , are compared with the tutor 's models . As much of the pupil 's reading must be done by himself ; the great object of the tutor is the Composition , but he also serves as a general commentator and last resort in difficulties ; it is also his business to make selections of hard passages from authors whom the student may not have time or inclination to read the whole of ; and to point out proper books for cram ' and philological information . " In Mathematics , examinations - that is , working examples and problems - are the principal exercise , most book-work ' diffi // culties being sufficiently explained in the books , though some tutors consider their own manuscripts better than any of the books , and make their pupils copy them . The men are continually writing out book-work , either at home or in their tutor 's rooms ; they practise it to get pace as well as accuracy . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour to each . One of great celebrity will have twice as many , if a Classic , or four times as many , if a Mathematician . A mathematical tutor can drive a much larger team than a classical ; the latter can not well have more than three men construing to him at a time , nor can he look over and correct the Compositions of more than ten in a day with the care and accuracy desirable ; the former can be making explanations and setting examples to a squad of eight or ten together . The one to whom I now resorted used to give his thirty pupils regular fights ' as he called them ; he would set ten or twelve of them to write out a paper on some subject , and give them marks for it just as in an examination ; and the results of these figkts papered the room during a whole term or vacation , till there was no place left on the walls for any more . " The men who have taken the very highest degrees do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for high Mathematical men was a seventh Wrangler ; our friend of the ftgkts an eighth Wrangler . " Vol. i. pp. 203- 206 . There could not be a happier phrase than the one we here italicized ; what is expected of a private tutor is nothing but good " jockeyship . " One mischievous effect of the system is , that it attributes a ludicrously exaggerated importance to some of the nicer refinements of learning , and has comparatively little appreciation of the depth of thought and world of matter which are contained in the Latin and Greek historians and philosophers . To an Englishman , a false quantity is like a breach of the Ten Commandments , and an ability to write polished Latin Alcaics by the hour , and without book , is a higher test of scholarship than a familiar acquaintance with all that Plato and Aristotle wrote or Homer sang . The examination papers for the Classical Tripos and the Trinity Scholarships , which Mr. Bristed has appended to his second volume , contain matter enough to illustrate this objection to the system , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough scrutiny of them . They are certainly formidable in // appearance ; some of them  --  to adopt a phrase which shows the manners and the taste of the writer - " would probably astonish a whole roomfull of Yankee Professors . " But the first impression which they make is altogether deceitful . Under skilful jockeyship , by subjecting oneself to what Mr. Bristed calls " a violent state of crai* " for a year or so , it is comparatively easy " to get up , " parrot-like , so large a store of niceties and outof-the-way scraps of learning as to enable one , with ordinary good luck in the " catches " which happen to be set , to solve three fourths of them ; and little more than that is expected even from a " First Class man . " The only doubt would be , to any one who has just ideas of the proper aim of education , whether the play was worth the candle ; - unless , indeed , a Fellowship of two or three hundred pounds a year for doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church , were to be the sure reward of success . Again , the examination papers afford no index of the attainments even of the most distinguished men in the University , because not one of the competitors accomplishes all that is set forth in them , and only three or four perform much more than half of the work . Nominally , the grand trial at the close of the undergraduate course extends over the whole ground of the Latin and Greek classics , and requires a proficiency in composing , without book , Latin and Greek Prose , Greek Jambics , and Latin Alcaics , Hexameters , and Elegiacs . One of the papers gives twenty-seven lines of English blank verse to be translated into Greek lambics in two hours and a half , - pen , ink , and paper being the only means allowed , as usual , for accomplishing the task . The passage is usually expanded into about thirty-five Greek lines ; " and very few of the candidates finish them in the allotted two hours and a half . Sometimes a First Class man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigns thirty-three lines of English verse to be turned into Latin Hexameters , and eleven other lines into Latin Lyrics , in the same time . There were also two passages , equalling in length about a page and a half of this Review , to be turned respectively into Greek and Latin prose , two hours and a half being allotted to each . " Greek prose is the // hardest of all composition , and marked highest in the Tripos ; there are seldom more than five or six men in a year who write it well . " Mr. Bristed was one of the twenty-six competitors for classical honors this year , and came off " second in the Second Class . " But as there were only six in the First Class , his position was a very respectable one , being that of the eighth classical scholar among those who entered into competition this year . Yet he intimates that he made a decided failure in Latin verse and Greek prose , one half of which went up " nearly illegible and without accents , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes ; but every one makes mistakes , except now and then a Shrewsbury man . " The Classical Tripos is a voluntary trial at Cambridge , in which only those who choose to compete are examined , and with this restriction also , that none can enter who have not been placed at least as high as the third class , or among the Junior Optim*s , at the preceding mathematical examination for Honors , which is the grand struggle of the year . This last examination occupies six days , twelve papers being given out , three of which contain , in all , about sixty problems to be solved ; and in the other nine , questions are put which may be answered by " book work , " as it is called , or from recollection of what is contained in mathematical treatises . The " low questions , " or those which are comparatively easy to be answered , are mostly contained in two papers only , which are given out on the first day ; correct answers to these , and to four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five succeeding days , will place the candidate among the Junior Optim6s . " Probably fifty questions and eight average problems , so done as to get full marks , will bring a Questionist comfortably among the Wranglers ; " that is , correct answers to about one third of the questions , and the solution of a seventh part of the problems , which are set , will give rank in the first class , or among the first third of the one hundred and thirty candidates for mathematical honors . But the whole number of graduates at Cambridge each year being about four hundred , it appears that only one in every ten among them attains even this degree of proficiency in mathematical studies . // " The unexpected award of the Senior Wranglership was the great surprise of the year , and subject of conversation for some time . It was said that the successful candidate had practised writing out against time for six months together , merely to gain pace , and had exercised himself in problems till they became a species of book-work to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them which enabled him to do nineteen on one paper of three hours , thirteen on another , and nearly as many on the third , - more than two thirds of the whole number set . The Peterhouse man , Second Wrangler , who , relying on his combined learning and talent , had never practised particularly with a view to speed , and perhaps had too much respect for his work to be in any very great hurry about it , solved eight or nine problems leisurely on each paper , some of them probably better ones than the other man 's , but not enough so to make up the difference in quantity . Both men floored all the early book-work , the Johnian presumably getting full marks , and T perhaps some extra marks for style . In the high work of the last two days , the Peterhouse man beat his opponent ; but he could not have been very far ahead , as the Johnian did all but three questions out of the four papers , and came out on the result of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate , however , was not without a chance of partially retrieving himself the very next week , in the examination for the Smith 's Prizes , which is considered by the knowing ones a better test of excellence than the Tripos , as it embraces a higher classs of subjects , and the element of speed does not enter into it to such an extent . T s friends , as well as himself , awaited the result with a mixture of hope and fear . In the end , he had it all his own way , and beat the Senior Wrangler in the proportion of three to two . But this was a subsequent consolation ; for the present , the triumph rested with the Johnians . " Vol. i. pp. 325-327 . Mr. Bristed obtained rank among the Junior Optimds , or in the third class , though very near the foot of it ; and says , " that of 143 candidates ; 31 did less than myself ; that is , less than the equivalent of twenty-four questions . " The range of studies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination at Cambridge is confined to Mathematics , and a Senior Wrangler need not know more Latin and Greek than is required for admission to an American college . At Oxford , on the other hand , the chief examination is in the Classics , and a First Class man is not obliged to carry // his mathematical studies beyond Simple Equations and the first two books of Euclid . The Oxford examination " for Honors in mathematics " takes place subsequently , being a voluntary after the Classical examination ; just as , at Cambridge , the Classical is a voluntary after the mathematical . " In the former case , the candidates in mathematics are not numerous , being about twenty in a year ; and the First Class " does not average more than three . " At Cambridge , in Mr. Bristed 's year , as we have seen , the volunteers for the Classical examination numbered twenty-six , and the First Class consisted of six . It is evident , then , that , at Oxford , nineteen twentieths of the students learn nothing but Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same proportion learn Mathematics and little else . By the changes which have been made within the last three years , something has been done towards remedying this great defect . In the one case , three " Schools " have been established , of Mathematics , of Natural Science , and of Modern History and Law , and the graduating student is examined in the elements of at least one of them , in addition to his Classical studies , before receiving a degree . At Cambridge , it has been provided that the student shall attend , for at least one term during his undergraduate course , the lectures of one Professor , taking his choice out of thirteen who are enumerated . Two new " Triposes , " of the Moral Sciences and the Natural Sciences , have also been esta* bushed , and placed on the same footing as the Classical Tripos ; that is , any member of the graduating class may volunteer to be examined in either of these three Triposes , after passing with a certain degree of credit through the mathematical ordeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are subjected . Mr. Bristed justly remarks , however , that " the want of pecuniary stimulus , either direct or indirect , to the successful candidates , will probably prevent either of the two new Triposes from soon becoming popular . " This want , however , will be remedied in time ; and Dr. Whewell has already led the way by founding two annual prizes , of fifteen guineas each , for the two who pass the best examination in Moral Philosophy . Most of those who graduate with very high honors at either University usually continue in residence , and pursue // their studies , with a view of competing for a Fellowship , which may be obtained with greater or less difficulty , according to the number of vacancies and of competitors presenting themselves from the respective Colleges in which these vacancies exist . In most of the small Colleges , a high Wrangler or a First Class man is almost sure of obtaining one with little trouble . At Trinity , and some of the other large establishments , the competition is still very spirited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his undergraduate course may offer himself for examination once a year during the three years which intervene between taking a Bachelor 's and a Master 's degree ; and not more than one Scholar out of three can be appointed . The candidates who are reading for a Fellowship usually act as private tutors , and in this way defray most of their expenses . We subjoin Mr. Bristed 's account of a Fellowship examination at Trinity , where , however , it is far more severe , and success in it is consequently more honorable , than at the smaller Colleges , or at Oxford , where the larger part of the Fellowships are close . " The Examination consists of Classics , Mathematics , and a number of subjects conveniently comprehended under the title of Metaphysics . " The Classical Examination nearly resembles that of the Classical Tripos . The Composition is about the same in amount , but the Translation papers are only three in number , two Greek and one Latin ; and there is a long paper of general questions in Ancient History , Antiquities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " paper in short . One extract from the Greek verse paper is to be translated into English verse . Under these circumstances , a man who has taken a high Classical degree rather seeks to review and polish up , than enlarge , his reading ; but a Mathematician , especially if he has . come to the University tolerably well prepared in Classics , and temporarily neglected them to read Mathematics for his Degree , will often extend his knowledge of Greek and Latia considerably . A Mathematician very deficient in Classics stands little chance , unless he be Ilrstrate indeed in his branch , and also very good on the Metaphysical paper . I imagine Classics weigh at least as much as the other two together . " There are only two Mathematical papers , and these consist almost entirely of high questions ; what a Junior Op. or low // Senior Op. can do in them amounts to nothing , and the Classical men usually cut them entirely . " The third branch of the examination comprises several subjects more or less connected among themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History of Metaphysics , because an explanation of the theories of different schools rather than a support of any particular one is expected . " 2d . Moral Philosophy , considered not only in an historical . but also in a practical and , so to speak , polemical point of view . " 3d . Political Economy , considered , like Metaphysics , rather in an historical than a partisan light . " 4th . International Law . " 5th . General Philology . " It is possible that questions are sometimes set on this paper not strictly reducible to any of the above heads . It intentionally covers a great deal of ground , one of its objects being to bring out clever men and men of general and , at the same time , deep reading beyond the immediate sphere of Classical and Mathematical studies . Except in Moral Philosophy , there is no preferred class of opinions . In Ethics , the dominant school was anti-Paley - that of the independent moralists , as they were called at Cambridge , among whom Butler occupies a high rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no contemptible one . No particular opinions being prescribed in the other subjects , there are of course no particular text-books - no substantially similar courses of reading for all candidates . The only works which can come under this category are , Dr. Whewell 's History and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences , and Moral Philosophy , including Polity . His double position as Professor of Casuistry in the University , and Master of the College , has procured him this distinction , and you may always be sure of finding several questions set from his books . " In general , the Creek and English authors are those most attended to . Plato and Aristotle , in their ethical , metaphysical , and political speculations , come in for a large share of attention ; and with them , consequently , their historians and commentators , particularly Hitter . Cudwoi7th is a favorite author . Mill 's Logic became a standard work immediately on its publication . The older Scotch Metaphysicians are not in high repute . Cousin is read to some extent ; Comte , I fancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped into ; most men were afraid of them . The Trinity receipt for getting up Kant was , read the first forty pages of the " Kritik , " and the Index . ' There are generally two or three men who acquit themselves very stylishly on this paper , and cover a great extent of ground // in the three or four hours allotted to it . An acquaintance of mine , who stood first in Metaphysics , and gained his Fellowship by it , confined himself chiefly to one question , an ethical one - in discussing which , he took up and answered , piece by piece , a recent article in the Edinburgh which had attracted his attention . Probably the paper which he sent in would have made a respectable pendant both for quantity and quality to that which had suggested it . Another man , who was second in the same examination , wrote up not only all the paper , but all the ink , within his reach . " The average age of taking the B.A. may be set down at twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually borders upon twenty-five when he attains the dignity of Fellow . The Fellowships are tenable for seven years from the time of taking the M.A. to such of the Fellows as do not go into Orders ; those who do , may hold them till death or matrimony . For a Barrister , this seven years ' Fellowship is just the thing , as it gives him a support ( *2OO a year ) long enough to start him in his profession , and carry him past thirty , by which time he has usually begun to do something if he ever means to ; nor are the two or three years spent in procuring it by any means wasted , the training being in many respects calculated to fit him for his vocation . " Vol. i. pp. 388 - 391 . This brief account of the English University system does not enable us to perceive the vast inferiority of the American Colleges , upon which Mr. Bristed lays so much stress . That there are a few features in it which might be profitably copied here , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not consider it worthy of imitation or of much respect . With much smaller means , with endowments that are not comparable to those of the English Universities , the Colleges in this country actually accomplish more . They actually give instruction and enforce study , which , for any practical purpose , or to any appreciable extent , the English Universities do not . The academical year with us comprises about forty weeks , or is twice as long as in England ; and during the whole of this period , the students are required to attend lectures and " recitations , " on an average , for at least three hours a day ; and the time which must be given to make even a tolerable preparation for these exercises , and which actually is given by the major part of the students , amounts to at least three hours more . The ambitious students , who // compete with each other for such " honors " as the College has to bestow , - no immediate pecuniary rewards , however , stimulating their exertions , - number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twice as much time , or six hours a day , either to preparation for these exercises , or to collateral studies . The range of studies is certainly too great , as we believe that in the English Universities to be too limited ; something more than Latin and Greek , with the elements of pure Mathematics , and something less than an entire curriculum of the Physical and Moral Sciences , added to two of the ancient and two of the modern languages , would furnish a proper amount of intellectual exercise for the three or four years of undergraduate life . The great number and variety of studies in an American college is doubly unfortunate , on account of the youthfulness of the students . Very few enter at Oxford or Cambridge under the age of eighteen ; in this country , perhaps one half of the whole number are admitted when they are under sixteen . The undergraduate course , it is true , is a year longer than in England , so that the difference of age at the time of graduating does not exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly , the system which condemns one who has not yet assumed the American toga virilis , or long-tailed coat , to the study , at one ti*ne , of the Differential Calculus , the Greek Drama , Mechanical Philosophy , Metaphysical Science , Political Economy , and Constitutional Law , is both injurious and absurd . The evil , so far as it depends on the youthfulness of the students , is probably irremediable ; the circumstances of the country , the nature of our institutions , and the habits of the people imperatively require the great majority of students to be prepared for their professional pursuits , or other active duties of life , as soon as they have attained the age of legal freedom . It would be wise , then , to adapt our collegiate system to this necessity ; only such studies , and so many of them , should form a part of it , as can be properly mastered between the ages of sixteen and twenty years . The different appropriation of the College funds is the source of most of the peculiarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen , the immense // endowments of the Universities are given almost exclusively to the support of Scholarships , Fellowships , and other rewards of learning . The meagre funds of the Colleges in this country are devoted entirely to keeping up the means of instruction , - to the salaries of the teachers , the enlargement of the buildings , and the purchase of apparatus and books . It is difficult , indeed , to obtain donations or bequests for any other purpose , - except , indeed , the support of beneficiary students , for which end , funds are most frequently contributed to independent societies , which retain the exclusive management of them , and send the students whom they patronize to such institutions as they may select . Harvard College alone has as many Professors as either Oxford or Cambridge ; though the whole number of its members who are in statu pupillan , including the students in its professional schools is but little over 600 , or about one fourth of the number at either of the English Universities . It has ample means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sinecure . The incumbents of most of them are constantly and laboriously engaged in the active business of tuition ; and there are ten assistant instructors and tutors , who are equally diligent and effective in their calling . If it were considered desirable to change the whole constitution of the College , and to form it strictly upon the English model , there would be no obstacle in the way , except from the appropriation of the funds by the will of the donors . Change the Professorships to sinecures , take away all the salaries that are now paid for tuition , or leave only enough to support a couple of tutors , and convert the whole remaining income of the Colleg* to founding as many Scholarships , Fellowships , and other rewards of learning , as it would suffice to establish . Give up all attempts to impart instruction ; or , for the sake of preserving the mere form , require the two tutors to lecture , each for one hour in the day , on a Greek classic and a mathematical subject , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate semi-annual examinations , one in the Greek and Latin languages , including all the refinements of philology and the illustrations of classical literature , and the other in pure Mathematics and their application to the mixed sciences ; allowing all to 7* // enter and compete who have had their names upon the College hooks , and have paid all college dues , for at least three years . These examinations should be conducted in writing , and a tenth part of the questions proposed should relate only to the elements of classical and mathematical learning , so that any student , after qualifying himself to enter College , could be prepared , by a few months of cramming under a private tutor , to answer them . All who could pass this portion of the ordeal should receive a bachelor 's degree ; xvhile the honors and emoluments belonging to the endowed Fellowships and Scholarships should be awarded , in the order of merit , to those who most distinguished themselves throughout the fiery trial . Many of these would continue in residence , in order to pursue their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which capacity they would virtually give all the instruction that would be needed to keep the whole affair in operation . Snch would be the English system ingrafted on an American College ; and however repugnant it may appear to our notions and habits , it would be a great mistake to consider it as altogether one-sided , inefficient , or corrupt . In some respects , it would be an improvement , though not , we think , a very marked one , on the Amen-. can plan . The few who really profit by it attain a thoroughness and accuracy of scholarship , and an exact discipline of the mental facnlties , with a power of application , and a ready command of their acquisitions , which only long-continued training in classical and mathematical studies , under a strong stimulus to exertion , can impart . The misfortune is , that there are so few who actually receive these advantages ,  --  that vastly the greater number obtain no benefit whatever from their University education beyond what is unconsciously imbibed , as it were , from the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are more uniform ; more instruction is given , and more study is enforced upon the whole body of the students . Some preparation , however slight , must be made for each of the exercises ; and from three hours of attendance every day , for forty weeks of the year , upon the lectures and recitations in the sciences and languages , to say nothing of the written exercises that arc // required , the most indolent and careless student must derive some substantial benefit . At the same time , the regular exercises do not occupy so large a portion of the day , but that the more industrious and capable have abundant opportunity for their private studies or cultivating their peculiar tastes . It is true , that no great incitement to exertion is afforded by the meagre honors which the College is able to bestow ; and this , we consider , is one of the two great defects of the system , the other being the great diversity and multiplication of the studies . The English University system , in both respects , errs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed upon the strong stimulus which is held out for private study , that the University hardly attempts to teach any thing ; and the field for exertion is too limited , the Classics and Mathematics alone being too narrow a basis for what may fairly be called a liberal education . These defects seem to be acknowledged in England , so far as we can judge from the attempts which have recently been made to amend them . All the changes that have been effected within the last three years , both at Oxford and Cambridge , look to an enlargement of the sphere of study , and to an increase , or rather to a commencement , of official instruction by the authorities of the place . One new regulation , as Mr. Bristed remarks , has been made " by way of giving the Professors something more to do ; " and the physical and moral sciences have been fairly introduced into the University course , though as yet they occupy hut a small corner of it . But Cambridge now teaches something more than Mathematics and Paley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not say that any attempt is making to remedy the defects of the American system ; on the contrary , the changes recently made here look precisely the other way . They tend to aggravate the evil , and to reduce our Colleges to the level of High Schools . A demand is constantly preferred to adapt even the higher institutions of education to the practical character of the age , and to the wants , or rather to the opinions , of the people ; and too many of our Colleges are inclined to listen to this demand . In several instances , so many branches of what is considered to be " useful learning** have been crowded // into the course , that a voluntary system has necessarily been established to make room for them , and each student is allowed to select the studies which are best adapted to his tastes , his caprices , or his future occupation in life . Thus the proper idea of a liberal education is lost sight of ; a College is no longer a home of liberal studies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive that general culture which is the only effectual preparation for specific studies and professional pursuits . If this system should be universally adopted , the study of the ancient languages must finally be abandoned , and even that of Mathematics must in a great measure be given up , or limited to the few who expect to become astronomers or engineers . " This favorite notion , " says Dr. Arnold , " of filling boys with useful information is likely to be productive of great mischief . It is a caricature of the principles of inductive philosophy , which , while it taught the importance of a knowledge of facts , never imagined that this knowledge was of itself equivalent to wisdom . Now , it is not so much our object to give boys useful information , ' as to facilitate their gaining it hereafter for themselves , and to enable them to turn it to account when gained . " Admitting this to be a correct view of the purpose of a liberal education , it is obvious that our older Colleges are already amply endowed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach more than the pupils have time or inclination to learn . To endow a new Professorshin in them is to confer a very doubtful benefit . It is only to increase a range of studies that is already too extended , and to distract the student 's mind by a variety of occupations and inquiries , instead of concentrating it upon a single object , - the equal and healthful development of intellect by a series of exercises specially adapted to that end . It is the boast of those who have received an English University education , - and , for a few ambitious scholars , the boast is certainly a well-founded one , - that , however inferior they may appear in general knowledge at the time of graduating , owing to their exclusive devotion while in College to the Classics and Mathematics , their minds are developed so rapidly afterwards , that , in a few years , the loss is more than made // good . A broad and deep foundation has been laid , and the superstructure rises easily and without effort . Long accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the intellectual gymnastics which the experience of centuries has approved as the only firm basis of a liberal and thorough education , minor difficulties vanish before them , and lighter studies become a mere amusement . A modern language is acquired as the diversion of a few idle hours ; and the several departments of natural and moral science only open a field for pleasant excursions , and gratify a liberal curiosity . The great want of American Colleges at the present day is the endowment of a moderate number of Scholarships and Fellowships , for the encouragement of liberal studies . It may be frankly admitted , that the tendencies of the country and the age are not friendly to such studies , and they must gradually die out if they be not more carefully fostered . The ambition of undergraduates is now too much directed to the career that awaits them outside of the College walls . The cares and anxieties of manhood are projected forward into the period which ought to be solely occupied with the preparation for its duties . To limit this forecast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be able to offer something to contend for , - some prizes within the walls , to be won by what is , after all , a nobler contest than any of those which await us in the crowded thoroughfares of the world without , - prizes of intellectual distinction , the competition for which is free and generous , being neither deformed by party spirit , nor darkened by mano3uvring and deceit . Additional incitements are needed , especially for the prosecution of those studies which are peculiarly academic in character , and which , though they are the basis of all thorough intellectual training , have but an indirect connection with the business of the active world and the student 's future success in life . The establishment of prizes for excellence in them , to be won by open competition , and to be enjoyed through some years of continued residence , that might be given to professional studies or general literary pursuits , would elevate the whole tone of scholarship in the institution and the country at large . Very large endowments // would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single Professorship would found three Fellowships or half a dozen Scholarships . If devoted to the former purpose , it would answer no other object than that of adding one to a list of studies which are already too numerous and varied to be crowded into a four years ' course of study . But if distributed among these lesser foundations , it would increase the efficiency and activity of every department of the institution . Those who obtained these distinctions would have the pecuniary aid which they might need for the prosecution of their studies , without being degraded by the necessity of accepting it from a beneficiary fund . Only the capable and industrious would thus be assisted ; and we have great doubts whether it is a judicious exercise of charity to defray the expenses of all who are desirous of obtaining a liberal education , whether they manifest character and ability or not . One of the worst consequences of the original destination of most English Fellowships to the support of the Church is , that many are tempted , for the sake of retaining their college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tastes , and previous habits have wholly unfitted them for the sacred calling . Mr. Bristed 's book contains some striking disclosures upon this point . But we have no right to dwell upon them , as there is too much reason to believe that a similar evil has arisen in this country , from the operations of societies for educating young men for the Christian ministry . Better a thousand times that our pulpits should remain unoccupied , than that they should be filled by purchasing the services of the incompetent , the vicious , or those who are secretly inclined to skepticism ! If the funds which are liable to be thus abused were given to raising suitable endowments in our Colleges , which would insure support to all who merited it by proficiency in learning , none would be attracted either into the ministry or the other liberal professions except by their unbiased choice , and none would be excluded by the accidents of fortune , unless they were disqualified by Providence for the work . We had intended to examine some of Mr. Bristed 's exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colleges . But as // they obviously relate to the single institution which he knows any thing about , and as he has unwittingly exposed the true character of his own pretensions to be a critic , by printing abundance of Greek , almost every line of which exhibits misplaced accents and other blunders , his strictures may be allowed to pass without particular notice . We shall not do the Senior Classic of Cambridge University in 1840 the injustice to believe , that he made as many errors in writing the copy of Greek Anap*sts here published as Mr. Bristed has committed in printing them ; and we shall not consider the well-merited reputation of the instructors in Yale College as at all damaged by his vague charges and flippant criticisms . When he states that " the first lesson " which a student learns at an American College " is to despise his teachers , ** and that he hears it generally said there , that " the College appointees he means those who have obtained College honors , are for the most part poor , dull fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that an appointment is only worth taking as a mere extra if it can be got without taking much trouble for it , and that writing and speaking are the only proper objects of his ambition , " he describes a state of opinion among the undergraduates wholly unlike any thing we have ever witnessed or even heard of ; and our opportunities of observation have been considerably more extensive than those which Mr. Bristed has enjoyed . But when we learn further , from his own cool admission , that one year which he spent at New Haven was occupied chiefly in reading " a dozen newspapers a day , " and talking politics with a young Mississippian , " the only tangible residuum from our debates being a pretty large bill for cakes , icecream , and sherry cobblers , " we readily admit that he may have chosen his associates from a certain class of young men , to be found in every College , whether in Europe or America , who actually entertain , or affect to entertain , the very opinions which he here imputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intimate friends , the only wonder is , that he did not give an equally flattering account of the state of opinion in an English University .
