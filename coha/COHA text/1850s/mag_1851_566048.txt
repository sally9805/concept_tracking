txt ART . VII. - LIFE AND WRITINGS OF CAMPBELL . Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell . Edited by WILLIAM BEATTIE , M.D. , one of his Executors . In Two Volumes . New York : Harper and Brothers , Publishers , 82 Cliff-Street. 1850 . The Complete Poetical Works of Thomas Campbell . With a Memoir of his Life , and an Essay on his Genius and Writings . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. , 200 Broadway . Philadelphia : Geo . S. Appleton , 148 Chestnut-Street. 1847 . WE have had it in mind for some time past to give an account of the life and writings of Thomas Campbell ; the publication of Dr. Beattie 's work affords us a favorable opportunity for accomplishing this purpose . Dr. Beattie 's work is on the whole a good one . It is not written with any preeminent excellence of style , though well enough for his object . But the materials which he has collected , besides displaying the character of the poet in its true light and vindicating it from many aspersions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the outpourings of thoughts and feelings which arose spontaneously and which were uttered just as they arose without the forethought of being published . The literary history of // several of his poems is given with sufficient particularity ; and there are many anecdotes of the distinguished men of the age . The memoir prefixed to the edition of his poetical works is taken from Fraser 's Magazine , but besides being erroneous in a few particulars , it was written by some one who had not entire sympathy with Campbell , and who , as a con sequence , has failed to do him justice . There were two enemies which pursued Campbell through lifeHighland pride , and poverty . For the former , he was not altogether to blame ; for it came down to him , we dare say , from old Sir Neil , contemporary with King Robert Bruce , through all the devious windings of the clan Campbell , undiluted and unimpaired . His poverty he might have resisted better , had it not been that with his Highland pride , nature had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only for all the near and " far awa ' " Camphells , but also for every human sufferer . We mention this at the outset , because his pride and poverty working against each other often involved him in difficulties , and in consequence there has been a certain style of sneer and pity in speaking about him which misrepresents his real character . Thus the writer in Fraser 's Magazine exclaims , " Poor Tom Campbell ! he exhausted all his sympathy on the Poles and spent all his invectives on Russia . " If the writer lives and has read the present memoir , he will have seen that Campbell 's sympathy , instead of being exhausted , continued to grow warmer and more expansive to the last days of life . And surely , the writer of the best lyrics in the English language , the life-long friend of Scott and Stewart and Alison and Jeffrey and others too many to be mentioned , the founder of the London University , and the constant friend and protector of the exiled patriots of every land , needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , as we have already intimated , to a remote antiquity , even to the time of King Robert Bruce . The Camphells of Kirnan  --  the branch to which the poet 's family belonged-had an estate in the vale of Glassary as early as the fourteenth century , and it continued in their possession for several generations , till the death of Archibald Campbell , when it passed into other hands . Archibald Campbell left three sons ; Robert , who was a political writer in London , under the auspices of Walpole ; Archibald , who first went to Jamaica as a Presbyterian minister , but afterwards came to Virginia , where he continued to reside ; and Alexander , the father of the poet . Alexander Campbell was a merchant . He commenced business at Falmouth , in Virginia , but afterwards returned to Scotland and settled in Glasgow , where he and a clansman , Daniel Campbell , entered into copartnership as Virginia traders . The firm continued in prosperous business for twenty years . But our Revolutionary War seriously interfered with // the trade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general ruin . By this unexpected blow , Alexander Campbell , who had married the sister of his partner in business and who had now a family of ten children , was reduced from affluence to comparative poverty , but he easily accommodated himself to his altered circumstances and passed the remainder of his life , at least in comfort and respectability . Alexander Campbell was a man of strong powers of mind and of considerable reading-his favorite subjects being History , Theology , and Philosophy . He lived on terms of intimacy with the distinguished men who then adorned the University of Glasgow-especially with Adam Smith and Thomas Reid . The latter was much gratified with the approbation which Mr. Campbell bestowed upon his " Inquiry , " at its first publication , " for * said he , " there are at least two men in Glasgow who understand my work , and these are Alexander Campbell and myself . " He was a man of unimpeachable integrity in business matters ; in politics , the supporter of liberal principles ; and in his religious views , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer of the " Scotch Worthies , " Robert Wodrow , and was doubtless well instructed in the truths of the Bible . The Campbells of Kirnan had furnished the Kirk with a succession of elders and , in ancient times , of martyrs . Alexander Campbell did not desert the ways of his forefathers . Family worship was never omitted in the household , and it is interesting to know , that the prayers of the father continued fresh in the memory of the son in the last hours of life . Mrs. Campbell was of a different turn of mind from her husband . She of poetry  --  and a passionate admirer of Scotch ballads , which she sung with great effect . It is not unlikely that the family pride descended through her ; she was always " Mrs. Campbell of Kirnan , " to which she afterwards had the satisfaction of adding " mother of the author of the Pleasures of Hope . ' " It has been handed down that she held the reins of family government with no slack hand , for which , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household was somewhat lax in his notions or at least in his practice on that point . The poet was accustomed to tell a story of his early days which well illustrates the different dispositions of the parents . Mrs. Campbell had a cousin , an old bed-rid lady by the name of Simpson , about whose frail health she was very anxious . So Daniel and Thomas by turns were sent every morning about two miles from the city , to inquire " How Mrs. Simpson was ? and how she had rested the night before ? " Getting tired of these daily visits and finding the bulletins pretty much the same , the boys concluded to report progress // without actually going to inquire . This they carried on for some months , till at length they thought it time the old lady should get well , and accordingly they reported her as quite recovered . " But woe* s me , " said Campbell , " on that very morning there comes to our father a letter as broad and as long as a brick , with cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Mrs. Simpson . " The culprits were speechless , and so were Mr. and Mrs. Campbell . They looked at the letter , then at the boys , and then at themselves . " At last , " said the poet , " my mother 's grief for the death of her respected cousin vented itself in cuffing our ears . But I was far less pained by her blows than by a few words from my father . " He seems to have remembered both pretty well and we are sure got no more than he deserved . But it is proper to say that to Mrs. Campbell , who was much younger than her husband , is due the credit of bringing up their large family with respectability and placing the children as they grew up in stations of honor and usefulness . Thomas Campbell was born July 27 , 1777 , and received his name in baptism from the celebrated Thomas Reid . The father and mother seem from an early period to have cherished ardent hopes concerning this , their youngest child-though not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with parental fondness . His education was conducted under most favorable circumstances . At eight years of age he was entered a student of the Glasgow Grammar School , where he continued six years . Living in the bosom of his own family , protected by all the influences of home , and more than all , watched over with untiring love by an elder sister , Miss Isabella Campbell , his affections were developed along with his intellect , and they attained an intensity and purity which continued through life . At the same time every proper stimulant was employed to animate him in his studies . By this means he easily made himself the first scholar in the school . Among the modes of instruction adopted by his teacher , Mr. Daniel Alison , was one which we must not omit to mention , as it had a decided influence upon the style of his poetical writings . Mr. Alison required , as an evening lesson , a translation from some ancient classic , in prose or verse , at the option of the student . Young Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translations were required two or three times a week and were continued for several years , they must have become very numerous . Dr. Beattie has printed some of his earliest verses , but they do not possess superior merit . Campbell was entered a student of the University of Glasgow , at the session in October , 1791 . His college career was brilliant . He was the acknowledged head of the Latin , Greek , and Logic // classes . He received here also much encouragement from his own family . His father , who was competent to direct his reading , and to take a general supervision of his studies , watched over this part of his education ; and although he would sometimes tell his son he had better be reading Locke than scribbling verses , he had the good sense to let him follow the " instinct " of his genius . The son not less understood the character of his father , and in after years rendered him the following tribute " His soul 's proud instinct sought not to enjoy Romantic fictions , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square , from youth He worshiped-stern , uncompromising truth . " It was in accordance with this that the Sunday reading which the father required , and which the son says he read with interest and relish , was Sherlock and Doddridge-although after the affair of Mrs. Simpson and certain slight transgressions of domestic rules , he admits they became less palatable . Campbell continued his versions at the University , and took several prizes . He says , however , " Some of my biographers have , in their friendly zeal , exaggerated my triumphs at the University . It is not true that I carried away all the prizes ; for I was idle in some of the classes , and being obli*ed by my necessities to give elementary instruction to younger lads , my powers of attention were exhausted in teaching , when I ought to have been learning . " But he was universally acknowledged as the poet of the University , and the scholar of the most brilliant talents in it . Dr. Beattie has published several of his college prize compositions , both in prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not recognize anythi*ig very extraordinary in them . We think the college poems of N. P. Willis , of the late George H. Colton , and of others , whom we have known during their college course , are superior to them . Campbell continued at the University from November first , 1791 , till May first , 1796-five sessions . These sessions were each six months , which gives a residence in the whole some months shorter than the usual residence in the four years course of American colleges . Campbell left the University a good Latin and Greek scholar . He continued to pursue his Greek studies through life . It is not easy to estimate with precision the afriount of his scholarship . Dr. Beattie says that he had at command the best passages in Homer and Virgil , even in the Grammar School . One of his University pupils-afterward Lord Cunninghame-speaks of reading with him Demosthenes and Homer . During the vacation preceding his last session at the University-which he spent as teacher in the Isle of Mull-he writes of himself : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristophanes . ' I am the length of the seventythird // page with the Choephoroe ' of IEschylus , the choral parts of which are very fatiguing ; the length of the piece is ninety pages. * , This latter he afterwards completed and revised . The year after he left the University , he finished a translation of the " Medea " of Euripides , and prepared for the press one of the plays of ZEschylus , with original notes . Of these translations , he retained in the authorized edition of his poems only a few , but these are very good . Homer was a special favorite , and so was Virgil . He says at a later period , that Homer was as essential to his breakfast as a Scotch herring . He maintained the essential unity of the Homeric poems at a time when the Wolfian heresy had more followers than at present . At Holland House he discussed with Fox the merits of Virgil , and received the approbation of that fine Latin scholar " he was so right about Virgil . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished contemporary poets , he was the best classical scholar , as he was the most purely classical poet . The period which immediately succeeds the termination of the academical course of education , when it imposes the necessity of a final choice of a profession for life , is one of great anxiety , especially to young men of genius , destitute of property , because their instinctive desires lead them with great force away from all those liberal pursuits by which a competence or a fortune can be secured . It was so in the case of Campbell . He had thought a little of Divinity , and with that view had studied Hebrew and read some of the best divines , but he does not appear to have had a decided call to the Gospel ministry . He attended lectures on Medicine , but the sight of the first blood-letting disgusted him with that profession . With a more determined effort he tried the Law , but never could bring the Pandeets and poetry into harmonious union . He also at one time made up his mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went so far as to take lessons in book-keeping -- it is to be regretted he did not persevere long enough to have mastered at least the mystery of a cash-book . But we must not do Campbell the injustice of ascribing these frequent changes to fickleness . The truth is , he was possessed by a spirit which he could not master , and which led him at its will . He seems to have looked at the matter at last in this light himself , and to have come to the determination to submit to his fate , and become an author . And we must say it was a hard fate . We know of no profession which imposes such wearisome drudgery as making books for a living . The revelations which have been made of the labors of some of the greatest men among the authors of the preceding age , would lead us to apply even to the most successful of them , the epitaph in Goldsmith // When we read of Scott toiling through life like a slave at the oar ; of Southey driving his pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain of a year 's support for his family ; and of Campbell sacrificing the vigor of his days to the merest drudgery , and without , even by this means , attaining to a reliable income , we can not but regard the profession of letters as the most toilsome and the least remunerative of the professions . The alternative seems to be ,  --  to slave at works which are born only to die  --  and live ; or to produce works which posterity will not willingly let die  --  and starve . But to return to Campbell  --  and here we would do as we would be done by , and set down a few dates , as we shall continue to do throughout the article . Campbell left the University , as we have seen , at the close of the session , May first , 1796 . He spent the greater part of the succeeding twelve months as a private teacher in a family at iDownie in the Highlands . Here he had the fortune to fall in love , and very naturally began the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , and in April , 1797 , we find him in Glasgow . He soon after went to Edinburgh and got a situation as " copyingclerk , " in the office of an attorney . But he soon after made the acquaintance of Dr. Anderson  --  the Dr. Anderson of the " British Poets , " - by whose means he obtained his first job , which we think is deserving to be mentioned , as well as the pay for it . It was an abridgment of Bryan Edwards 's " West Indies , " and the pay was twenty pounds . With this prize he went back to Glasgow and set himself to his task . He soon finished it , and in October we find him again in Edinburgh , whither in the following month , at his instigation , his father removed with his family , and ever after continued to reside there . The poet was now engaged in writing the " Pleasures of Hope , " and his situation was by no means an unpleasant one . He thus describes it in the retrospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch metropolis by instructing pupils in Greek and Latin . In this vocation I made a comfortable livelihood* as long as I was industrious . ' But the Pleasures of Hope ' came over me . I took long walks about Arthur 's Seat , conning over my own ( as I thought them ) magnificent lines ; and as my Pleasures of Hope ' got on , my pupils fell off . I was not friendless , nor quite solitary at this period in Edinburgh . My aunt , Mrs. Campbell , and her beautiful daughter , Margaret ,  --  so beautiful that she was commonly called Mary Queen of Scots-used to receive me kindly of an evening , whenever I called ; and it was to themand with no small encouragement-that I first recited my poem , when it was finished . I had other friends whose attachment was a solace to my life . Before I became known as an author , I was intimate with Francis Jeffrey , and with Thomas Brown . " // The " Pleasures of Hope " was published April 27 , 1799 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months old . The title was as follows : " THE PLEASURES OF HOPE , in two parts , with other poems , by THOMAS CAMPBELL . " A copy of this edition must be very rare in this country ; we have never seen one , nor do we know what the " other poems " were . But it turned out that none were needed to help out the popularity of the volume . For very rarely has any poem of an unknown author been received with more unbounded favor than the " Pleasures of Hope . " It was hardly two years since the death of Burns , and the young poet was at once hailed as his fitting successor . They who had turned away weeping from the bier of the inspired peasant , it has been well said , looked around them and joyfully accepted the pledge of returning day . The author took rank immediately , young as he was , among the great men who then adorned the metropolis of Scotland-with Scott , Erskine , Jeffrey , Brougham , Stewart , Alison , McKenzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser lights , for few cities have had a more varied and delightful society of men of letters than Edinburgh at that period . This poem was considered at the time of its publication , and has since been considered , as a very extraordinary production to be written by a young man under twenty-two years of age . But this view does not do justice to Campbell . The poem does not need to have the plea of infancy made in its behalf . It is an extraordinary poem to be written by any man . If it were not , it would not live as it does in literature . To be admired as a mere curiosity ,  --  to be embalmed in collections as some prodigy of nature in a museum-is riot to live as a work of genius ; to do that , it must penetrate and interest the common sympathies of men , and it must appear in that peffect.fornr which nature alone can give . Every poem that perpetually lives in the hearts of men from generation to generation , is something extraordinary ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural product of superior genius . So far is this poem from being extraordinary as the work of a young man , it would have been far more extraordinary if it had been produced by any one , of however great genius , who had passed much beyond the period of life which the author had reached . V his poem is the outburst of the mind , instinct with genius and polished by culture , as it takes its first survey of life . It embodies the thoughts and feelings and aspirations of the generous spirit , which , following its own instinctive judgments , looks with indignation upon the wrongs which afflict mankind , but enlarged by education to take comprehensive views , despairs riot of the final regeneration of the race . It is not the mere effusion of a poetic temperament which seeks to turn everything in life into poetry , nor is it // the utterance of idle wishes ; but it sets forth the sympathies which spring up in every deep-feeling mind , and speaks forth aspirations which have their ground in the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the education of young men of a more generous mould has had frequent occasion to admire the correctness of those judgments which they almost spontaneously pass upon the various moral and political questions which come before them in the course of their studies . Rarely in after life is vice so indignantly rebuked , or oppression and wrong so strongly condemned , while at the same time the very generosity of their own feelings and the unselfishness of their disposition inspire them with ardent hopes that these vices may be eradicated and these wrongs redressed . We believe that the views which a young man of this character would take , are far more likely to be what in strict reason they ought to be , than the views of those whose feelings have been cooled and hopes been checked by the experience of actual life . Not unf'requently has the impulse to great movements for the amelioration of the lot of man on earth , been communicated by youthful sympathy and confidence . The thoughts and feelings and sympathies , therefore , which make up the materials of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation of the youthful mind , but are peculiarly appropriate to it ; it needs only the plastic power of genius to mould them into poetical forms . But it is not every man of genius even , that would have taken the view which Campbell has done . The problem of life must present itself to every thoughtful mind in prospect of an immediate contact with its realities , but in different ways according to the natural disposition  --  and each may be poetical . One may attempt to sound the depths of his own being and comprehend the moral relations which he sustains to God , to time , to eternity-as we may suppose a Pollok would do  --  and if the thoughts take a poetic shape , they will assume a character of sublimity from the very struggle to penetrate the obscure and comprehend the vast . Or one , looking only at the stern realities of the present , may view everything as swept onward by an irresistible fate  --  and if he vent his feelings in poetry , it may be the poetry of hate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surveying life only to flee from it , may retire within himself and live in communion with nature or in an ideal world of his own creation-somewhat as Wordsworth and Southey may have done . But there is another view , which shall represent life neither as a fate to be defied nor a misery to be hopelessly endured ,  --  a view in which sympathy with suffering is united with the determination to relieve it , and indignation at wrong with the purpose to redress it . This latter is the view which Campbell has taken , and he was led to it both by the necessity of his nature and the circumstances of his life and the character of his education . // Campbell was by nature sympathetic , generous and hopeful . He was born near the opening of our Revolution , and the connection of his family with this country must have familiarized him from his early years with our struggles for freedom . He heard the first shouts of the French revolution , and grew up amidst the violent discussions to which it gave rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain that the period had come round for a new advancement of the nation in the path of civil and religious liberty , and he himself might fairly be reckoned among those young men of liberal spirit and extraordinary powers whom Providence raised up at that time to sow the seeds of future reforms and to lay anew the foundations of the state . His education , too , had made him familiar with the masters of human thought . He had studied the history of Grecian and Roman freedom . He had surveyed , under the guidance of the enlightened Miller , the principles of the British constitution . He had learned to hate tyranny in every form , and to sympathize with humanity wherever suffering . How deep these feelings were , we may learn from his pupil , Lord Cunninghame . " In reading Demosthenes and Cicero , " he says , " he delighted to point out and enlarge on their sublime eloquence and the grandeur of their views . He used occasionally to repeat , with the greatest enthusiasm , the more impassioned passages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while at other times he poured forth , with great rapture , Mr. Burke 's declamation against Warren Hastings , and Mr. Wilberforce 's heart-rending description of the Middle Passage . ' " All these feelings and sentiments appear in the poem . Under these circumstances Campbell could not but write as he did . The subject of the poem is not so much Hope as Life viewed by a hopeful spirit . It is not an abstract disquisition nor a formal treatise-it is the gushing forth of the feelings , as the poet , in the first flush of youth , scans the scene of human life that opens before him . Even those topics which are common to men.in every period of life , he colors with the hue of his own feelings . The objects , for instance , which hope summons before the **sailor , ** " the marchworn soldier , " " the wedded pair of love and virtue , " are not precisely such as the several characters might themselves think of but such as the youthful poet conceived he in their situation should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand " with Genius , " t is Hope in youth 's untroubled hour . " And what can be more delightful than the fresh hopes of youth  --  to enjoy or to look back upon ? What view of life can have in it more of poetry than that which is taken when the heart is warm , the affections pure , the enthusiasm unchecked , the aspirations unselfish , the hopes untried ? It is this which makes this poem so dear to every one ; the // young like it because they sympathize with it in their present feelings , and others because they live their youthful days over again in its perusal . It is this which gives it a peculiar and appropriate place in literature . Hope is , indeed , a hackneyed theme , but we are inclined to claim for the real subject of the poem , as we have expounded it , that it is new in poetry , at least to the extent in which the enthusiasm of youth has been made to portray its views of life . The preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us what we shall find in the poem and what we ought not to look for . We should not look for metaphysical discrimination , for subtle observations on human nature , nor for profound generalizations . The author has not sounded the depths of the human heart nor evoked its mighty passions . We meet with few of those unexpected touches which open the secret fountains of the soul and which suggest far more than they express . We can call to mind but a single instance . It is in the description of the maiden made maniac by the loss of her lover . " Oft when yon moon has climbed the midnight sky , And the lone sea-bird wakes its wildest cry , Piled on the steep , her blazing fagots burn To hail the bark that never can return : And still she waits , but scarce forbears to weep That constant love can linger on the deep . " The lines in italics will awaken a multitude of thoughts in almost every mind . But , on the other hand , we shall find passionate thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments , and all expressed in a highly polished style of composition . Indeed , if there be anything in the poem which should be considered as extraordinary on account of the youth of the writer , it is the perfection of the style . Such a mastery of style is not usually gained except by long continued and oft repeated efforts . We doubt if another example of a style so perfect in a writer of genius , at his age , is to be found . It has all the glow of youth without extravagance , and at the same time the polish and condensation of expression which belong to more matured powers . But we think it not difficult to account for this excellence . Besides that mysterious power of language which seems to be a portion of the birth-right of genius , we are disposed to ascribe it to the practice of poetic translation from the classic writers into English , early begun and long continued under the eye of a good scholar . lie thus became in the forming period of his mind familiar with models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the careful management of words and clauses . We have already said that his earliest poetry did not have in it much of promise , and it is possible that // this careful and precise copying of others may somewhat have repressed his powers of original composition . But if it were so , it left them a longer time to mature , and enabled them finally to act with a surer and steadier purpose . This poem has a peculiar interest as reflecting the character of the writer . The sentiments which he here expressed , he never deserted . His love of liberty never abated , his ardent philanthropy never grew cool , his sympathy with whatever is great and noble never failed . Neither his bitter experience of the ills of life , nor his more profound knowledge of man , nor his more extensive acquaintance with the history of the race , changed , in the least , the opinions of his youth ; nor did the triumphs of the oppressors of mankind weaken the confidence he cherished in the ultimate prevalence of right and of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with increasing years , and his benevolence shone brighter and brighter to the last moments of life . The feelings which led him to exclaim " Departed spirits of the mighty dead ! Ye that at Marathon and Leuctra bled ! Friends of the world ! restore your swords to man , Fight in his sacred cause , and lead the van ! Yet for Sarmatia 's tears of blood , atone , And make her arm puissant as your own ! Oh ! once again to Freedom 's cause return The patriot Tell  --  the Bruce of Bannockburn ! " - these feelings revived with increased strength in later years . " And have I lived to see thee , sword in hand Uprise again , immortal Polish land ! " * * * * " A theme for uninspired lips too strong , That swells my heart beyond the power of song. ** It is a little remarkable that many of the wrongs he denounced , he " lived to see , " either wholly or in part redressed . We have already mentioned that he did not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rich in the gems of India 's gaudy zone , And plunder piled from kingdoms net their own , Degenerate trade ! thy minions could despise The heart-born anguish of a thousand cries ; Could lock , with impious hands , their teeming store , While famished nations died along the shore . " This stain on the character of British merchants he beheld at least in part wiped out . But there was one wrong which was upheld in a way that made even Campbell 's hopeful spirit waver . // " Yet , yet , degraded men ! th ' expected day That breaks your bitter cup , is far away : Trade , wealth , and fashion , ask you still to bleed , And holy men give Scripture for the deed : Scourged , and debased , no Briton stoops to save A wretch , a coward ; yes , because a slave ! " Yet he lived to see the day when every fetter was broken throughout the British empire ; and it was among the last public acts of his life to express anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " emancipation of man , everywhere , from the thraldom of man . " Campbell passed the summer succeeding the publication of the " Pleasures of Hope , " in Edinburgh , occupied partly in literary drudgery and partly in preparing for a new edition . The next year , June 1 , 1800 , he left England for Germany , where he passed nearly twelve months , principally in Ratisbon and Altona . Here he studied Kant , read Schiller , Wieland , and Burger , and wrote some of his best lyrics . He reached London on his return home , on the 7th of April , 1801 . The death of his father , which took place while he was in London , devolved upon him almost the entire burden of supporting his mother and sisters  --  a duty which he most cheerfully accepted and most faithfully performed , for more than thirty years . The next two years he spent alternately in London and Edinburgh , employed in the same kind of literary labor . He at length made preparation to visit Germany again , and bargained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he received a part of the pay . But of a sudden his plans are all changed . " The poet was no longer his own master , and he who had sung so much of freedom and independence , began to boast of his own chains . " It may occur to some of our readers that a man who could scarcely make a living for himself , was in no condition to be married . So it seemed to the father of Miss Matilda Sinclair , but the poet could not be made to comprehend the argument . " He had few or no debts ; the subscriptions to his quarto were still pouring in ; the historical work on which he was employed would bring him a hundred pounds a volume ; and , besides , he had at that very moment a fifty pound bank note in his desk . " It is scarcely necessary to say , they were married . The ceremony was performed on the 10th of September , 1803 . He resided the first year of his marriage in Pimlico Square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydenham , a hamlet in Kent , not far from London , where he continued to live for seventeen years . His residence at Sydenham was the happiest period of the poet 's life . It was the greenest spot in his memory . It was here he en.joyed all the blessings of quiet domestic life , for which he was // peculiarly fitted , both from the intensity and the purity of his affections . It was here he formed friendships which blessed him through life . It was here he employed the powers of his genius in their full development , in painful toils for the support of those who were dear to him , it is true , but also in the productions of those poems , which have placed him among the great men of England . It was here , too , he suffered those afflictions which sooner or later must enter every household . We will dwell a little upon the picture which the memoirs present to us . We shall tell the story of his early struggles in his own language : - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute privations of poverty . On the contrary , it was rather the fear than the substance of it , which afflicted us . But I shall never forget my sensations when I one day received a letter from my eldest brother in America , stating that the casual remittances he had made to my mother must now cease , on account of his unfortunate circumstances ; and that I must undertake , alone , the pious duty of supporting our widowed parent . Here now , I had two establishments to provide for , one at Edinburgh and another at Sydenham . I had never known , in earnest , the fear of poverty before , but it now came upon me like a ruthless fiend . If I were sentenced to live my life over again , and had the power of supplicating Adversity to spare me , I would say , 0 Adversity , take any other shape ! ' To meet these pressing demands , I got literary engagements both in prose and poetry ; but a malady came over me , which put all poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My anxiety to wake in the morning , in order to be at my literary labors , kept me awake all night , and from less to more I became a regular victim to the disease called the coma-vigil . Besides the current expenses of our common maintenance , I had to meet the quarterly payment of usurious interest , on a debt which I had been obliged to contract for our new furniture , and for the very cradle that rocked our firstborn child . rhe usurious interes , t to which I allude , was forty pounds a year upon a loan of two hundred pounds  --  a Judaic loan . Throbbing as my temples were , after sleepless and anxious nights , I was obliged next day to work at such literary labor as I could undertake-that is , at prosaic tasks of compilation , abridgment , or commonplace thought , which required little more than the labor of penmanship.

He at once divided it with his mother and sisters . The relief which this timely aid afforded him , is vividly expressed by himself when looking back to it thirty years afterwards : - " Before that event , I had labored // under such gloomy prospects as I am reluctant to look back upon ; and I should probably consign the history of them to oblivion , if I gave way to unmanly feeling or false pride . But everything that is false in my pride gives way to the gratitude which I owe to those friends who rallied around me at that period ; and it would be black ingratitude if I could forget that , in one of those days , I was saved from taking a debtor 's lodgings in the King 's Bench , by a munificent present which the Rev. Sydney Smith conveyed to me from Lady Holland . " Besides , his friends set on foot a new quarto edition of his poems to be published by subscription . The subscription was a very large one . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much brighter prospects . His health returned , his spirits revived , and in the enjoyment of his home , and the congenial society which Sydenham afforded , the poet labored with diligence and enjoyed life with a keen relish . And here , we feel it would be an unpardonable omission , did we neglect to mention the family of Wynell Mayow , Esq. , whose daughters , especially Miss Mary Wynell Mayow , and Miss Fanny Wynell Mayow , were the firm friends of his family for life , and whose intelligence , refinement , and affection , endeared to him his residence in Sydenham , and contributed to the happiness of his whole after life . His residence was not so far from London but that his . friends could easily visit him . He kept up a frequent correspondence with his mother and sisters , with Mr. Alison , Mrs. Stewart , wife of Dugald Stewart , and other Scotch friends . Besides , he enjoyed much congenial society abroad . We will give a part of his own account of a day passed at Holland House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland House , in company with his illustrious uncle  --  and now I come to a passage of my life that ought to give inspiring recollections . What a proud day for me to shake hands with the Demosthenes of his time ! to converse familiarly with the great man , whose sagacity I revered as unequaled , whose benevolence was no less apparent in his simple manners  --  and to walk arm-in-arm round the room with him ! But I must own that when the great man treated me with this condescension , I hardly knew-you will excuse the phrase " - it must be remembered that the poet was yet quite a young man- " I hardly knew whether I was standing on my head or my feet . Luckily for me , however , Fox drew me into a subject on which I was competent to converse . It was the Enei4 of Virgil . It is disgustingly common for shallow critics to talk about the monotony of Virgil 's heroic characters-unfairly quoting a single lineFortemque Gyan , fortemque Cleanthum ' for Virgil 's characters are really varied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great man with whom I was conversing , // agreed with me : and I delivered myself so well on the subject , that he said at parting , Mr. Campbell , you must come and see me at St. Anne 's Hill , and there we shall talk more about these matters . ' Lord Holland also told me afterwards , that Fox said to him aside- ' I like Campbell ; he is so right about Virgil . ' " - Vol. * . p. 447 . We may remark that Campbell wrote a portion of an autobiography , which we regret Dr. Beattie did not print by itself , instead of interspersing it through his own materials . The autobiography ends with this extract . We shall now make a few quotations taken almost at random from letters written during this period , and most generally to some one of the Mayows . Writing from the Isle of Wight , where he had gone for his health , he says " Well , I have been long enough on my own case . I shall tire you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydenham good and pleasing accounts of your health and spirits . * At this star , I stop to break open a letter from poor Matilda . She says my favorites are all well-All well ! It sounds like the sweet note of the midnight sentinel ! A letter from one 's best friend is worth going a hundred leagues for  --  to wish , and long for , and receive . I have never been so far away from her . I may say it is the first wife 's letter I ever received . She seems in very good spirits . I have your family , I believe , to thank for it . I was agoing to have concluded , but my spirits seem to mount as if I had pledged to my absent friends in a bumper . All is well ! My wife-my hearty , brownnecked boys-my faithful sister-in-law  --  and those my wife emphatically calls my favorites . ' All is well incieed. " - June , 1807. - Vol. i. pp. 462 , 463 . Our next extract shall be from a letter written at Sydenham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of health . " I have visited your beloved household ; and as to your sister Fanny-about whom I guess from her nervousness that you are most anxious , I do assure you , I never saw her more healthy , charming , cheerful-everything that is beautiful ; and compared with her sometimes state of nerves , she is now positively brazen faced ! " We had a long , delightful , wise , and entertaining chat this morning . It was after one of my watch-nights , when I had lain as uneasy as the head that wears a crown . I had meandered five hours about the common , from long before dark till eight o'clock-my sleepless eye in fine frenzy rolling - when , after again invoking the drowsy powers , and taking a chapter of Godwin 's Political Justice , ' instead of laudanum , I was favored by heaven with ambrosial rest . At midday I reeled up stairs in a wig , three hundred years old , and a neckcloth tied like a halter about my neck , when the sight of your lovely sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloven-unfit to be seen by a fair lady ! I contrived to breakfast , however , iu her presence , and during a most pleasant forenoon , we discoursed about a thousand things ; and Fanny was so exhilarating and good , and my children , whom she praised much , looked so cherubinical , that I forgot my marvelous old wig , and grew so happy that I could have sat down and purred like a cat . " * * * " I have myself no great hopes of long life-not longer , I think , can this sleepless frame *subsist than twelve or fourteen years . Where you will be then , I // do n't know ; but I often think when all the plays , and poems , and novels , which , by the grace of God , I shall hope to have written by that time , are inspected , the learned commentator and biographer on my poor works-for every poetaster has now his biographer-will trace from piece to piece the similarity of characters from whom I shall have drawn my materials of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fanny and Caroline , and yourself , will see your images as in a mirror-not disfiguring , I trust , but reflecting their genius and dispositions just as they strike my mind as the models of their several descriptions of characters . When you look at some wretched daubing of my forty-year-old countenance , prefixed to some cheap edition of my works , you will often , I fondly imagine , perceive a look of the good will with which your society has often filled my mind ; and which , perhaps , may contribute to make my physiognomy more good-natured . I leave Lawrence the pleasure of drawing your countenance ; I shall be proud enough to delineate the mind . You must not , however , be in the least surprised to see these children of fancy , the shadows of poetical perfection , sketched from outlines of real life , used in a most tragical and heart-rending manner . You must not think I would willingly beat or maltreat you , because some heroine whose nose , eyes , and profile are like your own , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poetical pathos . What would poetry be , if heroines were to sail happily and smoothly through a few hundred smooth lines and never squeeze a tear from the heart of the reader l No , no . I have had a lady of great perfection in mind , manners , and physiognomy , for many months sentenced to a tragical end in my next poem . She may claim whatever resemblance she pleases to real life , but the law must take its course , and the best is , that , while the copy perishes , the original still lives to furnish new pictures of perfection , and new sources of tragical interest in another portraiture under a different name . " - October , 1807. - Vol. i. pp. 473-475 . We add a single extract more , for the sake of the sentiment . " You used to say that talents were always formidable . I think not so . Superior beings are necessarily benignant : they guide us , and guard us , not like the jostling of a mob , but by a gaining , invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fear and hate what the slang of the world calls a clever man ; that is , generally , a pert and half-wise man . In the other sex , the women who bear sway over the generality of minds are called accomplished and beautiful women ; they are , like those half-wise men , generally thought formidable ; they are to me very often great objects of terror ! just as self-conceit and bad dispositions are terrible . But let me see the woman who is truly admirable , and I fancy the most shy and ungainly admirer of female excellence , like myself ; will be very much at his ease , and destitute of all fear or diffidence in her presence . The truly beautiful , the truly wise , the truly good , do not abash even the most retiring . The friendship of wise men which I have enjoyed  --  the sentiments with which I have regarded my real heroines-convince me of this . " - Vol. i. , 479 , 480 . We have drawn rather more upon these letters than is perhaps proper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at this time and under these circumstances that Campbell was engaged in writing " Gertrude of Wyoming . " The sweetly-flowing numbers-and can there be sweeter music than the opening line , " On Susquehanna 's side , fair Wyoming // most delicate taste  --  the lovely vision of Gertrude , presented in perfect form and beauty ,  --  could only come , it would seem , from a mind , made harmonious by such influences and touched in its own experience with a sense of such grace and purity . There are many particular subjects in the poem , which doubtless had their counterparts in the congenial circle at Sydenham ; " those thousand infant charms "  --  the father , " the playmate ere the teacher of her mind "  --  the " enthusiast of the woods " - " the days of raptured influence , " and with what fullness , yet wise reserve , are they all handled . Nor is it difficult to see although the scene is laid in fair Wyoming ,  --  " Sweet land ! may I thy lost delights recall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty was the love of Pennsylvania 's shore , " - that the materials of the picture were drawn from nearer home . The poem was published in March , 1809 . Jeffrey passed judgment on it in the Edinburgh Review , and Scott in the London Quarterly . Both critics knew what value to place on such a poem . The judgment of Jeffrey stands unreversed . " We rejoice once more , " he said , " to see a polished and pathetic poem in the old style of English pathos and poetry . This is of the pitch of the Castle of Indolence , ' and the finer parts of Spenser ; with more feeling in many places than the first , and more condensation and diligent finishing than the latter . " But perhaps the best criticism ever passed upon it , was at Callander House , the residence of Dugald Stewart-as it is reported in a letter from Mr. Alison to a friend of Campbell . " Mrs. Stewart 's rapture rose with every line and when I hinted some apprehension that a little more detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were symptoms of an iron hand having shorn some of the tresses of her luxuriant beauty , Mrs. Stewart declared , most positively , that she was perfect , and that she could not have read one more page for the world . ' " Both Jeffrey and Scott complained of the obscurity of a part of the story , and others have done so since . This is , indeed , a blemish ; but on the other hand , it is just to remember that the other parts of the story are conducted with consummate judgment . Let any one call to mind the many topics adapted in themselves to produce great poetic effect which almost forced themselves upon the poet in the subject he selected , but which with stern self-denial and in obedience to the laws of perfect art he rejected ; and then let him reflect upon the almost matchless judgment which prevails in the disposition of the principal characters in the catastrophe of the poem , and he will conclude that the blemish alluded to is of little account . As in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil the whole , so in a poem there are many places // where the greatest skill of the poet is seen in what he leaves out . It is easy to bring in everything and let the reader take his choice , but it is not so easy to bring in that which every reader wants and to omit only that which no reader misses . In this peculiar exercise of poetical judgment , we think Campbell excelled , and that fall justice has hardly been done him , in this respect . The poem was every where well received . This apparently was the crowning period of his life . He had placed himself among the first of the many distinguished poets of his own age ; and in his own sphere and that a high one , he was without a peer . He was in the full enjoyment of his own happy home and of a refined circle of congenial friends . The powers of his mind were developed in their maturity , and animated by the exhortation of the most sagacious critics of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had yet attempted . But soon after , death entered his household , and in succeeding years stroke after stroke of affliction came upon him . In the spring of 1810 , he lost his youngest and favorite boy , Alison . This blow overwhelmed the sensitive mind of the poet . It was some months before he could devote himself to his usual labors , and weeks after the event , we hear him exclaim " I mourn still for my child ! I cry out Absalom , my son Absalom ! would to God I had died for thee ! ' I think that once I had the soft , lovelyhands of two children to go into each of mine , and now I have but one . I think of my cherub , and see him playing on the common before me . But now- " We need not dwell upon the remaining years of his residence at Sydenham . In 1815 , he received a legacy of five hundred pounds to himself in life-rent , and to his children in fee . We may mention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , because he had divided his pension with his mother , and that this return of the poet 's filial love is still enjoyed in circumstances of peculiar need , by his son . But notwithstanding this accession to his income , he was not relieved from literary drudgery , but he had now attained a position which enabled him to dictate his own terms . He entered , therefore , into an engagement with Mr. Colburn to edit the " New Monthly Magazine , " at a salary of five hundred pounds a-year . Before commencing his duties as editor , he made a short visit with his family to Germany , and on his return , left Sydenham and took up his residence in London , where he continued to live . This was in the spring of 1821 . The most important works which he wrote at Sydenham , after the publication of " Gertrude , " were " Specimens of the British Poets , " and " Lectures on Poetry. ** The essay on the history of **32;900;TOOLONG , hasever been admired as e fine piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // poets from whom extracts were made , were of a high order , showing a mind that sympathized with excellence of every kind . The book was published , we believe , in 1817 . The " Lectures " were first delivered in 1812 , before the Royal Institute in London , and were received with great favor . His other productions we pass over . iDr . Beattie has not given a very full account , and the future antiquary will have in them a fine field of research . Campbell 's residence in London , which was rendered necessary by his assumption of the editorship of the New Monthly , was soon overelouded with gloom . We refer to an event which pierced his heart and embittered all his after-life . His son , Thomas Telford Campbell , now a youth of fifteen , had grown up , either from hereditary taint or an injury received at school , imbecile in mind , and sometime in the latter part of 1822 had become so violent in his conduct that it was necessary to place him in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the father for many years , till at length , after many hopes and disappointments , the painful suspense was ended in the conviction that nothing remained to be done but to make his life as comfortable as possible . Dr. Beattie remarks that the motives and conduct of Campbell had been much misrepresented , if not maligned , as it respects the treatment of his son . But no one can read these memoirs without feeling that not only was there nothing to blame , but everything to commend . We should be at a loss to point out what more paternal kindness could have done . rhe expressions of affection and the outbursts of grief bespeak the most devoted parental love in a heart wrung with sorrows . With regard to his literary labors during this period of his life , we have little to say . His editorship , which continued ten years ,  - -  commencing with 1821 and ending with 1830 , en grossed a good deal of his time , and the affliction which he was suffering unfitted him for original composition . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodric , a Domestic Tale . " This was published in November , 1824 . If we judge of this poem in view of the circumstances under which it was written-amid the sorrows attending the first realization of the calamity which had befallen his son-we shall not condemn it ; but if we look at it with reference to the absolute standard of poetic excellence , we must acknowledge that it is an inferior poem . We have thus far spoken of Campbell as a poet . We are now to contemplate him in another sphere . We regard him as a great public benefactor . To him belongs the honor of having been the founder of the London University . During his visit to Germany he conceived the plan of a large metropolitan school , but he did not for some time communicate his scheme to any except a few intimate // friends . During the year 1824 , however , his views became matured , and in the spring of 1825 , several private conferences were held preparatory to bringing it before the public . We will transcribe his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its more advanced stages . It is contained in a letter . " I have had a double-quick time of employment since I saw you . In addition to the business of the Magazine , I have had that of the University in a formidable shape . Brougham , who must have popularity among the dissenters , propounded the matter to them . The delegates of almost all the dissenting bodies in London came to a conference at his summons . At the first meeting , it was decided that there should be theological chairs , partly Church of England and partly Presbyterian . I had instructed all friends of the University to resist any attempt to make us a Theological body ; but Brougham , Hume , and John Smith , came away from the first meeting , saying : We think with you , that the introduction of Divinity will be mischievous ; but we must yield to the dissenters with Irving at their head . We must have a Theological College . ' I immediately waited on the Church of England men , who had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them : You see our paction is broken ; I induced you to subscribe , on the faith that no ecclesiastical interest , English or Scotch , should predominate in our scheme ; but the dissenters are rushing in . What do you say ? ' They , that is , the Church of England friends of the scheme , concerted that I should go commissioned from them to say at the Conference , that either the Church of England must predominate , or else there must be no church influence . I went with this commission ; I debated the matter with the dissenters . Brougham , Hume , and John Smith , who had before deserted me , changed sides and came over to me . Irving and his party stoutly opposed me , but I succeeded at last in gaining a complete victory . The dissenters themselves , I must say , behaved with extreme candor ; they would not even suffer me to conclude my reply to Mr. Irving , but exclaimed , Eiiough , enough , we are convinced and concede the point that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded amicably . Lord Althorp appeared on the part of the Church , and coincided in the decision . A directory of the association , for the scheme of the University , is to meet in my house on Monday ; and everything promises well . You can not conceive what anxiety I have undergone , whilst I imagined that the whole beautiful project was likely to be reduced to a mere dissenter 's university . But I have no more reason to be dissatisfied with the dissenters than with the hundred Church of England subscribers , whose interest , I have done my best to support . I regard this as an e'ventful day in my ljfe. " - April 30 , 1825 .. - Vol. ii . pp. 166 , 167 . Mr. Brougham and Mr. Hume had an interview with the Ministers , to whom a copy of Campbell 's scheme of Education was submitted . The government favored the plan . The subject became every day more popular . Public meetings were held ; patrons multiplied ; subscriptions poured in ; and before the end of summer he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that success was sure , withdrew from an active participation in the affairs of the University , though not until he had again visited Germany to study the German system of education . Great credit is undoubtedly due to others , but to Campbell belongs the honor // of having formed the plan , of first bringing it before the public , and of directing the movements by which it was at length carried into execution . He always looked back with satisfaction to the part he took in this transaction , and said of it , that it was to him , perhaps , the only important event in his life 's little history . In 1826 , Campbell was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow . The office of Lord Rector had become merely an office of honor , though originally one of great importance . It is usually conferred on political grounds , and always on men of distinction . Sir Robert Peel , Lord Stanley , Lord Brougham , Lord Jeffrey , Sir James Mackintosh , and other great men have held it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received by the students with the greatest enthusiasm , and his inaugural address was pronounced the most eloquent ever delivered . Allan Cunningham describes a part of the scene " It was a deep snow when he reached the college-green ; the students were drawn up in parties , pelting one another , the poet ran into the ranks , threw several snowballs with unerring aim , then summoning the scholars around him in the hall , delivered a speech replete with philosophy and eloquence . It is needless to say how this was welcomed . " Most of the Lord Rectors had contented themselves with delivering the Inaugural Address , because the other duties had become obsolete , but Campbell went through with all the duties , and introduced some changes of great importance to the University . He was reelected the next year , and also the third year , although there had not been another instance of the kind for a century . These honors were highly gratifying to the poet , and he was justly proud of them . But amidst these honors , Campbell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Campbell , whose devoted love had always been his solace and support in all his other trials , was taken away from him . She died on the 9th of May , 1828 . Dr. Beattie has deemed it due to the sacredness of such sorrow , not to lift the vail which conceals it from common view . Perhaps he has decided wisely , although we have always thought that Lockhart , whose sound judgment is seen in every portion of his life of Scott , never showed his judgment more than in publishing that part of Scott 's Diary which immediately followed the death of his wife . Surely never before was such a memorial left on record of any woman . We shall make a single quotation from Campbell 's letters at this time : " At times , the sight of a knot of ribbon or a trinket unmans me and makes me weep for hours . But altogether , I am too mature in life , and too much master of myself , and-I trust I may say , without your censure ,  --  too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unavailing despondency . I wish to make the rest of my life as useful to society and as honorable as my // limited faculties will permit . And I think this is honoring my dear Matilda 's memory in a more manly and decent manner , than if I were to waste myself to tax the sympathy of my friends , by nursing to excess those pangs of separation from the companion of half my life , which , from the nature of things , may well be conceived to vibrate deeply enough through my heart . " This wish was not a vain one . His charities grew more and more abundant , and his sacrifices for others became greater and greater from this time to the end of his life . His philanthropy was not a poetic dream , but an active principle . It would be unpardonable in speaking of Campbell , to omit to mention his connection with the cause of Poland . The last Polish revolution broke out on the 19th of November , 1830 . The news soon reached England . It rekindled all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into the cause with his whole soul . He was absorbed in it ; he gave for it , he begged for it , he interceded for it . He summoned up all the powers of his mind , and rarely in verse have there been expressed such heart-felt sympathy , such terrific invective . His name was hailed in Poland as an omen of success . The Poles fought nobly ; the struggle was prolonged ; and it seemed as if they might triumph . But the sanguinary conflicts of the 5th and 6th of September , 1831 , in which Warsaw fell , destroyed the hopes of freedom . A gentleman who was present when Campbell received the news , says , " Never in my life did I see a man so stricken with profound sorrow ! He looked utterly woe-begone : his features were haggard , his eyes sunken , his lips pale , his color almost yellow . If I had been told that any man could have been similarly affected by the news of any political event , or catastrophe , I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , or mere melancholy , at tidings of a distressing public nature , but real heart-felt sorrow , stupefying grief , an astounding trouble of mind for the loss of a beloved object in which all his hopes centered . " The defeat of the Poles brought large numbers of them into England . Many of these exiles had been reduced from affluence to poverty , and all needed sympathy and aid . Campbell took the lead in the efforts for their relief . In concert with a distinguished German lawyer , Adolphus Bach , he formed a Polish Association for this purpose . He was at the head of it . Everything else was sacrificed to this object . The Association was formed in March ( 1832 ) , and in December he writes , " About four-score refugees have been supported or relieved , and sent abroad by our society . But the task of doing so was left entirely to your humble servant and our indefatigable and worthy secretaty , Adolphus Bach . He has injured his business as a German jurist ; and I have injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in bed later than six-devoting regularly // four hours to writing letters to the rich and charitable  --  and hundreds have I written , in order to raise some hundreds of pounds for our fourscore patriots. " - Vol. ii . p. 286 . But the excitement was too much for his health , and he was obliged to retire from its more active duties , but he continued for several years to contribute to its funds . iDr . Beattie ,  --  whose intimate connection with the poet commenced about this time-thus writes , " At his town lodgings , he was beset every hour of the day by appeals to his sympathy ,  --  solicitations for assistance , literary and pecuniary  --  and these to a man , who had seldom fortitude enough to resist a pressing request , became more and more intolerable . Instead of growing callous , however , he seemed to become more and more sensitive with experience ; and to have witnessed any distress in the morning , which he had not the means of relieving , poisoned his enjoyments for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under these circumstances ; very rarely without some new and most deserving case to be taken in hand ; and , whenever I acted professionally or otherwise , in concert with the poet , the relief he experienced in his own feelings was often as great as that he had administered to the patient . " Dr. Beattie adds in a note , " This partnership between the warm-hearted poet and the writer terminated only at his death-bed ; and if , among the numerous instances that now start up in retrospect , much good was done or evil prevented , the merit was his . He was the good Samaritan , who , while others avoided , sought out cases of distress for the sole pleasure of relieving them . " - Vol. ii . p. 289 . Campbell 's friends were somewhat disposed to laugh at his zeal in the cause of Poland , but it sprang from the best impulses of the heart , and it is by no means clear that the poet was not wiser than the statesmen who then controlled the councils of Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of the edition of his collected poems published in 1831 , makes himself merry over his forebodings as to the growing power of Russia . But have not recent events vindicated the words of the poet * ? " Russia , that on his throne of adamant , Consults what nation 's breast shall next be gored ; He on Polonia 's Golgotha will plant His standard fresh ; and , horde succeeding horde , On patriot tombstones he will whet the sword , For more stupendous slaughter of the free . Then Europe 's realms , when their best blood is poured , Shall miss thee , Poland- " But there is in one of his letters a still more remarkable prediction . " I am sick and fevered with Germany for suffering this foolish Emperor of Austria . He fears letting hisb own people taste a little freedom more than resigning his own freedom to Russia-for he will // soon be the very vassal of the inhuman Sciaves , and so also will the King of Prussia henceforth . " - Vol. ii . p. 240 . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fulfilled prophecy ? The aid which Campbell rendered to the cause of Poland and the Polish exiles , may be regarded as finishing his career as a public man . It will not be necessary to trace out the events of his subsequent life . We return to speak of him as an author . Campbell 's connection with the " New Monthly " ended , as we have seen , with the year 1830 . He was then connected for a year or more with the " Metropolitan . " This closed his labors as an editor . We shall not speak of him in that capacity , although we have some slight sense of the drudgery he endured . In 1834 , he published a " Life of Mrs. Siddons . " In the autumn of this year , he visited Africa , and on his return published in the New Monthly the results of his observations under the title of " Letters from the South , " which were afterwards printed as a separate work . We omit to notice his other prose works as unimportant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which was the last of his long poems . But we can only place it in the same rank with We have reserved the consideration of his lyric poems to this place that we might examine them together ; besides , some of the finest of his short poems were written in the last years of his life . We rank Campbell among the first of English lyric poets . He had that soul of fire , whose burning thoughts and feelings find their most appropriate expression in the ode , and , at the same time , a taste founded on the classic models , the severity of which kept him from the extravagances for which some poets seem to have claimed a poetic license . But the form is as essential to poetry as the matter . We will dwell for a moment upon the nature and worth of poetic expression , since we think Campbell particularly excelled in it . If the thought be the soul of poetry , the word is the body ; and if the soul bear a heavenly impress , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . Poetry is the spontaneous production of Nature , andasthepowersof Nature are ever striving to be developed in forms of beauty , so poetic thoughts and feelings may be said to have an instinctive appetency for perfect forms of expression . Indeed , we need not confine this to poetry . Language itself is no mechanical thing , but a power of nature , the functions of which are to develop by necessary processes the forms in which the productions of the soul are to appear . Particular , definite thoughts can never exert all their influence upon mankind till they shall have attained a form of expression which all shall recognize as the natural one . The proverbs of all nations are the choice thoughts , sentiments , principles , which have become , as it were , incarnated in the // orms which nature seems to have designed for them . But these remarks apply particularly to poetry . this power of giving permanent form to thoughts and feelings is a part of the " gift divine. ** It is the appropriate office of the poet to arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of men , and cause them to come forth in forms of beauty which all shall recognize and own . The thought expressed in the oft-quoted line , " The child is father of the * was common to other minds ; Wordsworth was the first to give it an utterance in a way to make all other persons adopt the utterance as their own . The words of Burns , " A man 's a man for a ' that , " are very simple and express a sentiment which must have been often felt before , but till then had never been spoken in a common language which all could read . It had remained like metal in the ore ; Burns put his royal stamp upon it and made it current coin . We have taken our illustrations from single , short lines for the sake of convenience , but we might refer to entire poems . Were not the thought and the word in Milton 's L'Allegro and Il Penseroso , born together as one perfect creation ' ? This gift of language is a sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far more mysterious power , as it is developed in perfection , for instance in Shakspeare , than that power , which gives birth to the thoughts of the poet , for the latter are often common to all men and derive their preeminence alone from the expression . There is no poet of modern times , perhaps , who has excelled Campbell in this respect - no one who has produced so many lines which live in the minds of men . Many of them have become a part of the language itself . We will refer to two instances only . With respect to the lines ,  --  " T is the sunset of life gives me mystical lore , And coming events cast their shadows before " - . the following anecdote is preserved . The happy thought first pre-9 sented itself to his mind the previous summer . He had gone early to bed , and still meditating on the wizard 's " warning , " fell fast asleep . During the night he suddenly awoke , repeating ,  --  " Events to come cast their shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been hunting during the whole week . He rang the bell more than once with increased force . At last , the servant appeared . The poet was sitting with one foot in the bed and one on the floor , with an air of mixed impatience and inspiration . He called for a light , and seizing hold of the pen , wrote down the " happy thought , " but as he wrote , changed the words " events to come " into " coming events , " as it now stands in the text . That slight change seems to us to have made // the difference between the line being known to every one and being known only by those who are acquainted with the whole poem . Without it , it would have been like a beautiful portrait with some feature imperfect . The familiar line ,  --  " Like angel 's visits , few and far between , " has an interesting history . The thought seems to have been first introduced into poetry by a poet of the seventeenth century , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dote upon- . Like apparitions seen and gone ! But those which soonest take their flight Are the most exquisite and strongLike angels ' risits short and bright , Mortality 's too weak to bear them lonox " Blair has borrowed this thought in his poem of the " Grave , " and thus expresses it ,  - -  visits Like those of angels-short and far between . " But he has marred the line by introducing the demonstrative pronoun , and in substituting " far between " for " bright , " he has not only sacrificed the most expressive epithet , but he has destroyed the appropriate connection there was before between the two epithets , for the visits might as well be " long " and " far between , " as " short and far between , " and indeed with even greater propriety . Burns next took up the theme , and he gives the line thus , " Like the visits of good angels , few and far between . " But the epithet " good " is almost tautological , at least no one would miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , that Campbell found the line and changed it as we now have it , " Like angel-visits , few and far between . " By using the compound " angel-visits , " he secures greater compactness and avoids the harshness of the possessive case , and by substituting the epithet " few** for " short , " he gives a somewhat greater appropriateness to the two epithets , so that he seems to have improved upon Blair and Burns , but as between him and Norris , the question is doubtful  --  the epithet " bright " is so beautiful when spoken of an angel 's visit . If we look , however , at the whole stanza , we shall assign the palm of victory to Campbell . The martial lyrics , " Ye Mariners of England , " **Hohenlinden , ** " The Battle of the Baltic , " and others , are too well known to au // 288 Life and Writings of Campbell . thorize any remarks . " Ye Mariners of England , ** is to us a per fect poem . Although Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war , and in a few odes he has succeeded in the difficult task of surrounding civic heroes with a halo of glory not inferior in brilliancy to that which encircles the brow of the warrior . We will refer as an example to the ode entitled " Men of England , " and will quote three stanzas ,  --  " What are monuments of bravery , Where no public virtues bloom , What avails in lands of slavery , Trophied temples , arch , and tomb ? " Pageants ! Let the world revere us For our people 's rights and laws , And the breasts of civic heroes BarAd in Freedom 's holy cause . " Yours are Hampden 's , Russel 's glory , Sidney 's matchless shade is yoursMartyrs in heroic story Worth a hundred Agincourts . " There is a class of odes which take a higher flight , such as , " The Last Man , " and " O'Connor 's Child . " On the whole we think that " O'Connor 's Child " is the best of Campbell 's poems , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublimity and pathos . In 1836 , Campbell published an edition of his poems , in which he inserted those only upon which he would rest his claim to be remembered . This selection was made with wonderful judgment and self-denial . There are not more than two poems , " The Dirge of Wallace , " and " Love and Madness , " about the admission of which there could be any question , while of all the poems printed by Dr. Beattie in the Memoirs , there is not one that should not have been rejected , though there are a few that , needed only the final polish . His critics , Jeffrey and Scott , were constantly calling for long poems , but borne down as he was by the necessary toils of life , did not the poet judge the more wisely ? Indeed , will not these short poemsthese odes-actually exert a greater influence upon mankind than any of the long poems of his age ? - of Southey 's ? or even of Scott 's himself ? Scott , indeed , with his usual sagacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon Washington Irving 's telling him on a certain occasion , that Campbell was deterred from writing , by the superior brilliancy of Lord Byron 's poetry and of his own , Scott replied , " Pooh ! how can Campbell mistake the matter so much ? Poetry goes by quality , not by bulk . My poems are mere cairngorms , wrought up , perhaps , with a cunning hand , and may pass // well in the market as long as cairngorms are the fashion ; but they are mere Scotch pebbles after all . Now Tom Campbell 's are real diamonds* and diamonds of the first water . " Is not this the sentence which has already been passed on these poets ? We hasten to the closing scene . Worn out by disease , Campbell , with his niece who had lived with him for one or two years , left England and took up his residence at Boulogne in France . Here he was taken dangerously ill . Dr. Beattie with his wife hurried to attend upon him in his last moments . We shall give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June l2th. - By his desire , I again read the prayers for the sick ; followed by various texts of Scripture , to which he listened with deep attention ; suppressing , as much as he could , the sound of his own breathing , which had become almost laborious . At the conclusion , he said , " it is very soothing. ** At another time , I read to him passages from the Epistles and Gospels ; directing his attention , as well as I could , to the comforting assurance they contained of the life and immortality brought to light by the Savior . When this was done , I asked him , do you believe all this ? ' Oh yes , ' he replied with emphasis , I do . ' His manner all this time was deeply solemn and affecting . Later in the day , he spoke with less difficulty-he said something to every one near him . To his niece , who was leaning over him in great anxiety and anticipating every little want , he said , Come-let us sing praises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sit here . ' Shall I pray for you ? ' she said ; Oh , yes , ' he replied ; let us pray for one another ! ' " He died June 15 , 1844 . He was carried to England , and buried in Westminster Abbey . If our readers should think we have dwelt too long upon this subject , we have to say by way of apology , that Campbell is the poet of liberty and humanity , and that in spirit he is as much an American as an English poet .
