txt Axr . IV. - REFORMS IN AUSTRIA UNDER JOSEPH II . Geschichte der Deutschen Hofe seit der Reformation , von Dr. Edward Vehse. 1852- ' 53 . Turs is an entertaining , somewhat gossiping book , written by a man who is on the liberal side in politics , and aiming to give a history of the German courts since the reformation . Much of it may be skipped without serious loss to the reader , as those parts where the author gives lists of the officers of government , or of the nobility during a particular reign . The author professes to have written the work for his amusement , and not to be a book-maker by profession . As he speaks of being prohibited from entering the Austrian dominions , we judge that he must have been compromised by the late revolutions in his fatherland . He is not however a radical , nor does he bear malice , as far as we can see , towards any court or country , but aims to give a faithful picture of politics and society . The work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively and vigorous . Eleven small volumes are spent upon Austria , seven upon Prus* // sia , and four upon Brunswick ; when the smaller courts shall have received their due share of attention , we fancy that the work xviii not limit itself to less than forty volumes . There is much to interest the student of history in the growth and singular structure of the Austrian empire , as well as in its future prospects . But there is one chapter of short extent in Austrian history which has a peculiar interest for us , as illustrative of the genius of the last century and of the course of reforms in despotical countries . We refer to the brief reign uf Joseph IL , between 1780 and 1790 , when Europe was startled by seeing a man , who might pass for one of the society of illuminati , seated on the throne of the most Beotian and the sleepiest country of Europe , and equally startled at the rapidity with which the reforms of the king-philosopher were nearly all revoked . To appreciate Joseph 's reign in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast a glance at the state of Austria before his accession , and at the influences under which his character and way of thinking were formed . The throne of Austria had been filled by comparatively feeble princes of the Styrian line of the Hapsburgers since the energetic and persecuting Ferdinand . On the ascension of Ferdinand to the throne , liberty of faith and worship was in practical operation ; and a large part of the nobility were protestants . Indeed , in Bohemia the protestant interest was predominant ; in ilungary it was great ; and in Austria proper , powerful enough to act as a curb upon measures of the government which the protestants disapproved . With Ferdinand , a pupil of the rising society of the Jesuits , began the most vigorous and effectual attempts to restore the weight of influence to the Catholic party . These attempts were successful . In Bohemia the greater part of the leading protestant families were cut off or driven into exile in consequence of the part they took in the thirty years war . In the German dominions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court were plied with such success , that before the end of this reign the protestant nobility had nearly disappeared . In fact , the extinction of families and conversions xvore out protestantism among the nobility ; while the distribution of titles to the new creatures of the government went on at such a rate as to bring up a new race of titled families instead of the old ones . Scarcely any of the nobility of Austria are more than three centuries old . The political sympathies of Austria , for more than three centuries , had been determined by that memorable marriage which introduced a branch of the Ilapsburg house into the throne of // Spain ; and France had been regarded as a hereditary enemy . On the expiration of the Spanish Jine , however , France , that is Louis XIV , had gained the point of filling the vacant throne with a Bourbon , but in the course of the contest , which grew out of the Spanish succession , had lost its political supremacy in Europe . The hostility between France and Austria still continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when a combination of powers attempted to put a Bavarian into the imperial throne and to strip Maria Theresa of a part of the Austrian possessions , France was still true to its old hostile instincts against the house of Hapsburg . A few years however changed the scene . It became necessary for Austria to find allies against that remarkable man who was enlarging Prussia , now a kingdom , per fas et nefas , lie did not care which ; and who , by the great northern power which he was cementing together , was beginning to render the Austrian office of Emperor of Germany quite insignificant . An alliance with France was therefore made by the minister , Kaunitz , who , for more than a generation , was the autocrat of the Austrian cabinet . This opened the way for French manners and principles into the dark regions of Austria ; and to this end the influence of Francis , the Lorraine husband of Maria Theresa-who was almost a Frenchmancontributed . Under the French influences of this age , the emperor Joseph was brought up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking . Frederick the Great had fallen under the same influences , and being regarded after the peace of Hubertsburg and of Paris as the great man of the day , must have exercised a powerful control over J oseph 's mind . With the freethinking and libertinism of France , came in a reaction against persecution for religious opinions , and a conviction of the necessity of reforms . Joseph showed his reforming tendencies before his mother 's death , upon receiving the office of German emperor , which his father had filled , and shortly afterwards upon being associated in the government of the Austrian dominions with his mother . One of his first acts displayed great magnanimity . His father had laid up state-bonds to the amount of two and twenty millions of forms , which had been issued during the thirty years war . These Joseph burnt on his accession , thus presenting principal and interest to the State . He manifested such a disposition to promote economy and get work out of the officers of state , that a general alarm arose , and Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a greater degree , into her own hands . In the trifling sphere of the German emperor , where he had // no one over him , Joseph seemed determined to correct abuses in every quarter . The court of the empire at Wetzlar , where one process had been going on for nearly two centuries , proved too much of an Augean stable for his zeal to cleanse thoroughly . But he struck terror into the petty tyrants , who held immediately of the empire , by wholesome chastisements . Thus a count of Salm , who had contracted more debts than his whole income would pay the interest of , and who had cheated his creditors and fleeced his subjects shamefully , was condemned to ten years imprisonment and forfeited his right to rule for the future . When the death of his mother left the throne of Austria to Joseph in 1780 , he was nearly forty years old , mature in his views of polity , and unhindered by war or the threatening of it from undertaking those changes in the government , over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at these reforms , the carrying through of which and their subsequent failure have made his name memorable , enquire what were the leading traits of the man , who formed such an exception to the general course of despotic princes by attempting to enlighten and elevate his subjects . Joseph was a man of good intellect , well improved by education , a man greedy of knowledge and far above the average of kings in his acquisitions . His perspicacity appears remarkably in some papers lately published containing instructions as to the education of his nephew , the late emperor Francis II , whose great weaknesses and faults of character he there details and prescribes their correctives , but unhappily without success . His mind seems to have been slow in its processes , but he retained with a strong grasp whatever he acquired . Being controlled rigidly by his mother , he acquired the habit of suppressing his feelings and of living without sympathy , although a man formed for it . And as he found few or none about him who could enter into his feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , with all his enthusiasm for reform , sometimes made him feel that they were not worth taking so much trouble for . His feelings were lively and impetuous . It would seem that as his mind moved slow , and his feelings quick , he was prone to rush into measures before he had well considered the probabilities of success . He had a generous soul , one capable of sympathizing with everything good and noble . The sentimental philosophy of Rousseau had charms for him : while Frederick the Great made Voltaire his bosom friend , Joseph did not even deign to honor the philosopher of Ferney with a call , but sought out Rousseau in his garret-chamber at Paris . Frederick was a despot with a coat of tolerance and freethink // ing thrown over his shoulders , but Joseph was a man inclined to look on men as his brothers , and yet destined to fill a despotical throne . The former kept up the old German form of addressing his subjects in the masculine singular , while the latter adopted the more equalizing usage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person plural in addresses . Another trait of Joseph was obstinacy . He seems to have had great confidence in his own judgment , courage enough not to shrink from carrying its . dictates out , and a resolute will not to yield to small difficulties . As he had to act pretty much alone , to set the example of reform in a sleepy and almost rotten empire , he certainly needed more than the usual amount of energy . He seems too , to have been untiring in his industry , and in general to have had the habits of mind and character of a philosopher . Frederick the Great said of him , " He has been brought up at a bigoted court , and has thrown off superstition ; he has been educated in splendor , but has adopted simple habits ; he has received the incense of flattery , but is modest . " The usual vices of princes he was never addicted to . In the relations of life he was , we believe , moral and virtuous ; he was temperate and frugal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of being indifferent towards his wife , who had been in a sense imposed upon him . He did not throw off superstition as Frederick did , by denying and scoffing at Christianity , but had a genuine faith in its divine reality . He was in short a Protestant Catholic . He had conceived a disgust towards the Catholic clergy , because his sharpsightedness had seen their attempts to govern his mother through her reverence for the Church ; and an equal disgust for the nobility of the Court on account of their fawning servility . He was a philosophic king , but before , his death in 1790 , and before the atrocities of the French revolution had broken out , perceived the necessary tendencies of French political and social principles . We return now to Joseph 's attempted reforms upon his accession in full right , at the death of Maria Theresa , to the throne of Austria in 1780 . Leaving foreign affairs in the hands of the veteran minister Kaunitz , he took the department of the interior to himself , and was his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public business , is shown by his words , that he was only the steward of the state . Shortly after his mother 's death , he wrote a letter to the Duke of Choiseul at Paris , where his sister was queeen , which contains expressions remarkable for a sovereign . " The past influence , " says he , " of the ecclesiastics in my mother 's government , will be a matter for reform . It gives me // no pleasure to perceive that people to whom the care for our future life is committed , give themselves so much trouble to make our existence here below the object of their wisdom . " Then he speaks of the finances as needing his attention , particularly on account of the pensions , and means of side-influence of nobles and public officers , to which he is determined to apply the necessary restrictions , however severe the persons concerned may regard it . " These subjects , " he goes on to say , " are somewhat new to me ; I must take my bearings better ; .1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the objects of duty ; else I shall be a monarch like the Grand Signor , who is acquainted only with the pleasures and with none of the obligations of his post . " In a letter to the Archbishop of Salzburg , written soon after his accession , Joseph thus expresses himself in regard to his intended clerical reforms : " The interior administration of my state demands to be made over again at once . A kingdom that I govern must be ruled after my principles ; prejudice , fanaticism , partisanship , slavery of mind , must be repressed ; and every one of my subjects be put into the enjoyment of his native liberties . Monachism in Austria has been too predominant ; the number of spiritual foundations and cloisters has become extravagantly large . Hitherto the government , according to the rules of these gentry , has had almost no right over their persons , and they are the more dangerous as well as useless subjects in every state , since they seek to withdraw themselves from the observance of civil duties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome . I have a heavy task before me ; I must reduce the army of monks , must turn fakirs into men-those before whose tonsured heads the common people bend the knee in reverence , who have acquired a greater sway over them than anything which can make an impression on the human mind . " With even greater plainness he writes to his ambassador at Rome , a cardinal of the unpronounceable looking Bohemian name of Hrczan : " Since ascending the throne and wearing the first diadem in the world , I have made Philosophy the lawgiver of my kingdom . In consequence of her logic Austria will assume another form , the power of the Ulemas be restricted , and the rights of majesty return to their old credit . It is necessary that I remove certain things from the prpvince of religion which never belonged there . As I despise superstition and the Sadducees , 1 will free my people from them . With this view I will dismiss the monks , suppress their cloisters , and subject them to the bishops of their respective circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rights of God . They will cry aloud then , I am sure , that the glory is departed ; will complain that I take from the people their tribunes , and draw a line of division between the notions of dogma and philosophy ; but they will be still more vexed if I undertake all this without obtaining permission from the servant of the servants of God . The principles of monachism from Pachomius until our day are entirely opposed to the light of reason . They proceed from paying honor to their founders to adoration of them , so that we see in them the Israelites revived , who went to Bethel to worship golden calves . The rights of the bishops , which I intend to call again into exercise , must aid me in remould ing my people 's way of thinking . I will have the priest take the place of the monk , the Gospel that of romances about the canonized gentry , and morals that of discussion of religious differences . Thus after an interval of centuries there will be Christians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples of my kingdom know more accurately the duties they owe to God , their country , and their fellow men . " There is much in all this which looks like the priest hatred that accompanied the ilIum inism of the last century ; and something which may be referred to the arbitrary feeling of a despot desirous of removing all other control over the people out ofthe way . But however independently and arbitrarily Joseph was disposed to act , we think that his whole course shows that the increase of despotical power was not his motive in reforms . He did not aim at an increase of the central authority , but finding himself invested with it , employed it as an instrument for the public good . Nor had he any choice , if he would act at all , for he could have employed no powerful class , whether ecclesiastics , nobles , or burghers , in carrying his reforms through ; but everything needed the strong unrestrained arm of the sovereign . As early as the first year of his reign , Joseph issued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , and the other granting toleration to all non-Catholics . The liberty of the press was unrestricted except as to writings which should be opposed to the State , to religion and good morals . The censors received no special rules for their guidance , but followed their own discretion . At first almost everything was printed , and the state of education being quite low , an immense mass of crude worthless things was given to the world . Brochures appeared inveighing against ecclesiastical and political abuse ; and even against the Emperor himself . The bishops and the ladies complained ; the Emperor had repeatedly to l ) roclaim that the freedom of the press must not be // abused . Finally a number of the worst books in the departments of religion and morals were suppressed ; but the Emperor gave full latitude to lampoons and satires against himself . A pasquinade affixed to the walls of a church he had printed and circulated hy thousands . With regard to ridicule directed against himself , he said , " I have a sound skin , let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare no one , not even himself , when he should come down to his days . " The faults of my ancestors and my own should enlighten posterity . " By the edict of toleration , issued October 18 , 1781 , the two Protestant persuasions with the Greek , and soon after the Jews , were allowed the free exercise of their religion . Schools and churches were built for the Protestants in the provinces , a superintendent and a consistory established at Vienna , and Protestants admitted into offices of state . But the opposition to his measures was so strong and obstinate as to prevent the introduction of full equality between Protestants and Catholics . Jews were thenceforth exempted from wearing yellow sleeves and girdles , and were admitted into most branches of operative industry , as well as into learned professions . Deists enjoyed no toleration . The members of a sect of Deistical peasants in Bohemia called the Abrahamites , were subjected , on professing their opinions , to twenty-five strokes of the cudgel . The dependence of the Austrian Church on Rome was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling a foreign sovereign to exercise control within the realm , and as draining it of large sums of money . To this dependence therefore he attempted to put an end soon after his accession , One ordinance enacted that from that time no Papal bull should have force within the empire without the Emperor 's pleasure . The bishops were forbidden to receive titles and dignities from Rome ; their canonical oath of obedience was limited to cases not conflicting with a subject 's duty ; and they were required to take an oath of allegiance to their sovereign . No religious orders within the Austrian dominions were to have a connexion with their generals at Rome , but they must be placed under the ordinary of each diocese . Dispensations in cases of marriage might no longer be obtained from the Holy See , nor the bestowment of benefices be controlled from that quarter . Of the two thousand convents for males and females , containing seventy thousand inmates , seven hundred with thirty-six thousand inmates , were suppressed in the first year of Joseph 's reign . Thissuppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the convents , where the teaching of the young and the care of the sick were made duties , although retained , could re // ceive no novices . The monks of the suppressed convents received pensions , and the money arising from the sale of conventual property was in part devoted to public charitable institutions . The infamous bull " in coena domini " was ordered to be struck out of all ritual books ; people were not required to bow to the host as it passed in procession through the streets , but only to take off their hats ; and a number of the more offensive superstitions of worship disappeared from public view . Against these innovations the Papal nuntio at Vienna protested , declaring that no Austrian ruler had ever ventured so far as to make laws concerning the property of the Church , to suppress its orders , and to transfer to bishops powers belonging to its head . The minister replied that no foreign power should have any influence over conclusions which emanated from the sovereignty of the country , that the prince exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , and that rights attached for centuries to the episcopal office were not the peculiar property of the Popes . As the nuntio replied to this he was silenced by the words that nothing further would be said concerning matters where the Emperor 's mind was already known . Rome had now become thoroughly alarmed . The Pope accordingly-Pius VI , an affable but vain man-determined to try what effect his presence would have in checking or reversing this system of reforms . After a triumphal procession through Italy , where every knee was bent to receive his blessing , he ap - peared in Vienna in March , 1782 ,  --  the first Pope since the council of Constance that had seen the skies north of the Alps . Although Joseph assured him that he should regard his visit as a special favor and honor , good care was taken to receive him rather as a state prisoner than as an independent sovereign . All the doors of his lodgings had been walled up except one , and at that one was stationed a guard to prevent interviews unauthorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Vienna during the Pope 's visit . The Archbishop of Vienna having been detected in unauthorized correspondence with the Pope was sent away , and heavily fined ; the fine being apportioned significantly enough to a house of correction . On the arrival of the Pope , the Emperor received him a little way outside of the city ; hut without holding his stirrups or kissing his slippers , simply kissed him three times . Afterwards he always avoided a private interview , and the Pope after a visit of four weeks left Vienna without saying a word in private on the important subject for which he came . The Pope celebrated high mass in Easter week in St. Stephen 's // Church , but because the Romish masters of ceremonies had made the Pope 's throne a step higher than the Emperor 's , the latter refused to be present , and had his throne taken down . The Pope attempted to gain the ear of the old minister , Kaunitz , but was treated with a freedom and want of respect , which perfectly petrified him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accompanied him to Mariabrunn , but in an hour or two afterwards dissolved the convent in that place , to show to the world how little importance was to be attached to this remarkable visit . The visit was felt to be a failure and an error throughout Europe . Frederick the Great said , " Who knows but that I might have believed in the infallibility of the Pope , but for that journey to Vienna ? " In the next year Joseph returned the Pope 's visit on occasion of a dispute concerning the civil power over the clergy in the territory of Milan . lie obtained all that he wished , the same control over the ecclesiastical order being conceded to him which had long been enjoyed in France and Spain by the sovereigns of those counrries . It was during this visit in Italy that he said to the theological professors in Bologna , " I am , I know , no theologian , I am only a soldier ; but I know thus much , that there is only one way to heaven , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep to this one doctrine-the doctrine of Jesus Christ . " No one could say this and be a Deist . It is only remarkable that Joseph , at that age with his training and character believed in religion at all . Had he with his enlightened mind lived in some other age , when the vitality of Protestantism was not extinguished , he might have had more of the spirtual element in his way of thinking , and have become an avowed Protestant . Joseph 's reforms as to the nobility were less sweeping than those in the ecclesiastical system . One of them was to extend the privilege of holding landed property , which before had been confined to certain families on a catalogue of ennobled persons , and could not be enjoyed by common burghers . He took away also , as far as he could , privileges which had been conceded by former sovereigns to some of the nobility , such as the right of levying toll and tribute upon their seignories . He attempted to remove the bridge between the higher and inferior nobles ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking , and Jewish families . Far more important than all this was his attempt to abolish the system of feudal service by which the peasantry were so much oppressed . These burdens were removed from the Hungarian peasantry in 1785 . The Emperor naturally excited by such measures , the dis // pleasure of the titled order , and so much the more as he took no pains to conceal his contempt for mere rank . On one occasion at Prague he introduced a plain citizen 's wife into a circle of titled dames . They avoided intercourse with her , but he took away her embarrassment by confining his politeness to her alone . He opened to the pedestrian public , even before his accession , the public grounds at Vienna called the Prater . When the nobility remonstrated against this , on the ground that it had been confined to their equipages , and that they did not wish to meet there the lower classes of society , he replied , " If I must meet nobody but my equals , I shall have to go down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( where his ancestors were buried . ) To a noble lady who solicited lbr her son a post in the army , he returned answer , " I do not perceive it to be obligatory on a monarch to give a place to one of his subjects , merely because he is by birth a nobleman . I lament , madam , that your son is fit neither to be an officer nor a state-servant , nor a priest ; in short , that he is nothing but a nobleman , and that from his whole soul . " To a Hungarian magnate he expressed the opinion , that " the countryman , who was obligated to bear the greatest amount of burdens for the public service , had also an especial right to the king 's protection . " And to the Chancellor of the kingdom of Hungary he wrote that the privileges and franchises of a nobility or of a nation in all lands and commonwealths of the world , consisted not in their contributing nothing to the public burdens , but in imposing on themselves the burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taking the lead , by freely consenting to the enlargement and increase of the imposts laid upon them . He added , that for the sake of free coin petition they must be made equal as it respected their property , to all other citizens and inhabitants . A sovereign desirous of tightening the reigns of despotism , might have done all this ; because a noble class in the state might act as a check upon the supreme power . Thus it was not until the nobility were broken down as a class and had turned into mere courtiers , that despotism was consummated in France under Louis XIV . Thus , too , Julius Ca*sar strove to degrade and make contemptible the Roman senate , by choosing mean persons into it , in order to take away its influence and feeling of importance . But Joseph 's motive was of another kind . He respected man as such . " Be assured , " said he , in a letter to an Italian , " that I should be much concerned if you did not prize the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given me . " Joseph 's changes in the system of taxation show the charac // ter of the man , his impetuosity and want of sound judgment , as well as the sway of the French or physiocratical system of political economy over his mind . Starting from the principle that the soil is the only source of national wealth , and leaving out of view all differences in the several provinces , he aimed to introduce a common system based upon a new measurement of land , according to which , out of a hundred parts of gross produce , the sovereign was to have about twelve and the feudal proprietor seventeen , the remainder going to the cultivator . Payments in service and in kind were to cease . This system , after having given employment to an army of field-surveyors , who did not understand their business and made numberless mistakes , was proclaimed by ediet in the last year of his reign ; and almost immediately abrogated by his successor , on the ground that it required a multitude of new officers for carrying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-twelfth . While in these measures Joseph strove to benefit the cultivator , his commercial policy was one of the narrowest restriction , intended to keep the money from quitting the country and to encourage domestic productions . To some extent he was successful : new branches of industry grew up under the heavy duties imposed upon foreign commodities . But here , too , arose new difficulties . The revenues in Tyrol , which came chiefly from transit duties upon articles conveyed into and out of Italy , dwindled to less than one-third of their former amount ; and the system was modified accordingly . Joseph entered with zeal into reforms in the administration of justice . An act for the regulation of courts and trials , issued in 1781 , cut down the number of advocates in the German provinces , and made them salaried officers of the State . A new civil code was prepared in 1786 , and a criminal in 1789 . Torture was now abolished , and for a time , until experience showed its necessity , capital punishment . A main principle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and convicted criminals of the noble orders received their dues with the most unrelenting rigor . The refined culprit of rank and the coarse Slavonian or Wallachian towed vessels , tied together by the same chain . " Vice is vice , " said the Emperor . " Among the vicious there is no preference. ** Passing by the system of secret police which had been devised by the minister Kaunitz , but now received its full development , and the Emperor 's rigid inspection of the government officers , we come to his plans for the centralization , or rather consolidation of his kingdom . Had it been possible , he would have // attempted to reorganize the German empire . But the great power acquked by a few states of the confederacy , as Prussia and Brunswick , i'endered a return to the system of the eleventh and twelfth century plainly impossible . Within his own domin. ions , however , Joseph was untrammeled . Here his philosophical views led him to take no account of the party-colored aggregation of territories which made up the Austrian empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be disregarded in the attempt to introduce a perfect and uniform system . He would make all Austria happy in spite of itself : a certain coat had the properties of perfection , and all must wear it , however ill it suited their shoulders . Thus he had the German language introduced into the courts in Hungary ; and when one of the magnates of that kingdom remonstrated , replied , " the German is the universal language of my kingdom ; why should I suffer the laws and public business to be transacted in a single province in its national language ; I am emperor of the German empire . Consequently the other states which I possess are provinces , which , in their union with the whole state , form a body of which I am the head . " This was wholly false in regard to Hungary , a distinct kingdom even from the other lands ruled by the Austrian princes . But this is the theory on which the Austrian government is now acting , and to consolidation it looks as its only preservative against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a uniform system of the state met with violent opposition from the Hungarian nobles . He had given more than one proof that he was not disposed to respect their hereditary rights . He had never been crowned or taken the coronation oath according to received usage . He had caused the crown of Hungary to be carried secretly from Presburg to Vienna . This , when known , produced great commotion until he promised to send it back to Ofen , which was to be the new capital , whenever a building should be ready for its reception . He had also ordered the land to be surveyed at the cost of the proprietors , in preparation for a new system of taxes ; and had introduced a conscription of troops ,  --  all without obtaining the consent of the diet . Above all , probably , the apprehension that their fair proportion of the public burdens would be laid upon them , which hitherto had rested with a terrible weight upon the peasantry , made them anxious and restive . The rebellion in Transylvania in 1784 , headed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinations . It was intended to make Joseph 's reforms odious and had that effect . It took the shape of an attack upon the nobility , and the leader pretended to act under the Emperor 's authority . Bloody exces // ses were the consequence until the capture and execution of Horja . The Emperor , being alarmed by this indication of what the peasantry would do , if more liberty was conceded , felt himself compelled to suspend his reformatory measures , and allow the Hungarian magnates to have their own way . In another land , then connected with Austria , but remote from the rest of the empire , still more serious troubles grew out of the Emperor 's plans . The Netherlands , since the peace of Utrecht , had been transferred from Spain to the Austrian house , where , by right of inheritance , they belonged ; and were governed by a viceroy residing chiefly at Brussels . The old political forms of the middle ages continued in the seven provinces cornposing this country , and new abuses had from time to time crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other country of northern Europe ; while the separate estates of the various provinces , the local franchises and the constitutions of the towns made a most complicated political system . This was too tempting a structure for Joseph 's love of simplicity not to seek to alter ; but his innovations nearly l ) ulled down the build . ing upon his head . He provoked the hostility of the clergy by changes in the university system , good in themselves and calculated to improve the education of those who were to be priests . He provoked the hostility of the estates general , particularly in Brabant , by changes in the administration . The towns became seats of tumult and sedition . The Emperor 's representatives managed the government with extreme want of wisdom ; now conceding every thing , and again repressing popular commotion by sanguinary measures . The rebels were encouraged also by England , Holland and Prussia . At length , in the last year of Joseph 's reign , to his extreme mortification , the insurgents obtained possession of the country in practical independence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and embittered his dying hours . At the same time commotions among the Hungarian nobles seemed to be impending ; and the central government issued in January , 1790 , a Latin decree , entitled " a revocation of ordinances which , according to the general sentiment , seem to be opposed to the laws , " by which every reform projected for Hungary , except the act of toleration , was stayed in its course . Thus the extreme branches of the empire were either broken off or exposed to violent tempests in consequence of the Emperor 's philosophical reforms . To these scenes , so painful for the last moments of Joseph , was added the death , just before his own , of the wife of his successor and nephew  --  the being whom of all others he most tenderly loved . His own sufferings , too , // were severe . In his last days he said , " I could wish there might be written over my grave the words-here lies a prince whose intentions were pure , but who had the misfortune to see all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and successor , Leopold II , to begin his short reign with undoing nearly everything which Joseph had attempted in the way of reform , and had not himself been forced to abandon . But although the government was placed again on the old basis , a new impulse was given by Joseph to Austria , which it has never entirely lost , notwithstanding the follies and the tyranny of his successors . The history of Joseph ' . s reforms explains the causes of their failure and of the subsequent reactions . Among those reasons may be named first , that the nation was not prepared for them . The emperor was one of the few enlightened and benevolent men in his kingdom . Everything originated in his own mind , and could be carried into effect only by resources at his control . He could look for no assistance from the clergy , the nobility , or the officers of government , for the reforms tended to abridge their privileges , destroy their license and bring them down , in relation to public law , to the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not useful , and which did not within certain prescribed limits promote the good of the state . He was a man of no imagination , and therefore entirely averse to institutions which were venerable from their antiquity alone : in attempting to overthrow these institutions he encountered local , family and class interests , diffused through all his dominions . He might calculate to have on his side the feudal peasant and the burgher , but neither of these classes had any considerable political strength . Thus by mere administrative energy and sovereign power he undertook to alter institutions , while men remained unaltered , and interests continued opposed to him . Joseph , again , was not a practical man ; his plans and views were those of a philosopher . It is hard for any despotical prince to have a practical knowledge of his people . And hence , we find that when the tone of thinking in society changes , princes are the last to perceive it . They have not changed because they are remote from the causes of change , and so they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incidental to his rank , Joseph shared with many princes of the last century in admiration of that abstract philosophy of French origin , which went abroad to make the nations happy on one and the same rule applied to all , as a quack would give the same medicine to all diseases . The purely speculative and the bold character of that philosophy , was perhaps exemplified by no French von . xi . 52 // revolutionary leader more fully than by this despotical Emperor . It is true that he did not recognize the self-governing power of the state , but considered himself as the state 's representative . Yet within these limits he showed a recklessness , a want of caution , an inability to estimate the strength of local and historical attachments , which place him among the most daring revolutionists of modern times . We only add the remark that Joseph 's reforms illustrate the radical weakness of despotical power as an instrument of progress . Suppose a prince of this description animated by the very best intentions and enlightened as well as counseled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do everything . What man in the world has to the same degree the power of commencing reforms , and of carrying them through with rapidity ,  --  relbrms which in freer countries meet vested interests , and go forward only against opposition and by slow degrees ? But let him make his reforms ; what is there to prevent his successor from overthrowing them all ? And what more likely than that he will do so , since the classes in society , which the reformer abridged in their privileges , will be apt to court the successor in order to regain what they had lost . It is true , some reforms can never go backwards ; as , for instance , the enfranchisement of serfs , which a despot might find it for his interest and for the interest of the country to ordain , and which it would be difficult for any power afterwards to revoke . But reforms of a less sweeping nature may be limited by the life of a single man . Despotism has no institutions ; it is the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to put an end to the reign of mere personal will which it never attempts of itself . Hence , what seems its strength is its weakness ; it has no checks upon it , and therefore the good beginnings of the past can be rendered ineffectual by the weak or the crazy successor of an enlightened sovereign . His reforms were prevented from having their full effect while they lasted , by the resistance of ancient interests ; but the reaction goes on with rapidity and thoi'oughness , because no power was created on the side of reform , and all selfish interest in ruling classes is against it . @
