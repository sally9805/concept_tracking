four . Stuyvesant had been warned of their approach , and had taken measures to strengthen the fort and town . But money , men , and will were wanting . English influence had greatly weakened the attachment of the Hollanders to Dutch rule , and they had heard so much of English liberty that many were not averse to a change of government . Stuyvesant , faithful to his employers , resolved to defend the city until the last , and entreated the people to sustain him . But his haughty carriage and despotic rule had deprived him of his real strength  --  the hearty cooperation of the people . He began to make concessions when it was too late , and the sceptre departed from him . On Saturday morning , the thirtieth of August , Nicolls summoned Stuyvesant to surrender the fort and city , and sent a proclamation to the inhabitants , at the same time , in which he promised perfect security for the persons and property of all those who should quietly submit . Stuyvesant called his council and the burgomasters together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he would not listen to such suggestions , nor allow the proclamation to be seen by the people . The Sabbath passed by , and no answer was returned to Nicolls . The people , in the uncertainty as to what was going on , became much excited , and on Monday the burgomasters explained the matter to them . They demanded a sight of the proclamation , but it was refused , and they were on the verge of insurrection . In the mean while Governor Winthrop , of Connect ticut , had joined the English squadron . He was on good terms with Stuyvesant . Nicolls sent a letter by him to the Director , and authorized Winthrop to assure him that Hollanders , as citizens or merchants , should have equal privileges with the English , if he would quietly surrender . Stuyvesant met Winthrop with a flag of truce at the gate of the fort , and promptly refused compliance . He then withdrew to the council chamber within , and opened the letter before the council and burgomasters . They desired its communication to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoutly insisted upon the just measure , when the Director , unable to control his passion , tore the letter in pieces . The people , who were at work on the palisades , on hearing of this , gathered at the Stadt Huys , and sent a deputation to the Fort to demand the letter . The Governor stormed , but they were inexorable . At length a fair copy of it was made from the pieces , and delivered to the burgomasters ; and the people went on with the fortifications . Receiving no reply from Stuyvesant , Nicolls landed some troops " below Breucklen , " where the South Ferry house now stands , and anchored two ships of war in the channel , between Fort Amsterdam and the Governor 's Island , with their guns all shotted and matches lighted . Stuyvesant saw all this from the ramparts , but would not yield . He knew the extreme weakness of the fort and city , yet his proud will would not bend . And even when Nicolls sent him the message , " I shall come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , women , and children entreated him to surrender , the brave old Director said , " I would much rather be carried out dead . " But at length , when the city authorities , the clergy , all of the principal inhabitants of the fifteen hundred within the palisades , and even his own son Bal*hazar , urged him to yield , " Peter the Headstrong , " who " had a heart as big as an ox , and a head that would have set adamant to scorn , " consented to capitulate . On the eighth morning of this same beautiful month of September , two hundred and ten years ago , the last of the Dutch governors led his soldiers from the Fort down Beaver Lane to the place of embarkation for Holland , and an hour afterward the red cross of St. George was floating triumphantly over Fort Amsterdam , now named Fort James , in honor of the Duke . Nicolls was proclaimed Deputy-governor of the province , which , with the city , was named NewYork in honor of the Duke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Manhattan . They made an effort nine years later to recover the lost province , and succeeded , by the help of treason . It was again New Netherland for five hundred days , when it reverted to the English by treaty , and they remained its masters until our War for Independence . The city and State , which the Dutch founded , form the noblest monument that could be erected in honor of the PILCRIM FATHERS of the Knickerbocker race , in whose veins courses the mingled blood of the Teuton , Saxon , Celt , and Gaul . They gave to the New World a more enlarged vision of the rights of conscience and personal freedom than any other people ; and their love of far-reaching commerce and adventurous enterprise , has ever hovered like a tutelar deity over the island of Manhattan , during all its social and political vicissitudes , and has made the city of New York the emporium of the Western Continent . WHO DISCOVERED THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE ? ( *1 APTAIN M'CLURE has been crowned with Jlaurel s for his supposed discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was he the first to solve the problem which has puzzled the brains of ambitious navigators for centuries ? Is he really the discoverer of this Northwest Passage ? His courage and perseverance are undoubtedly to be admired . The credit he has received he justly deserves . I do not wish to depreciate either the one or the other ; but I demand for myself , and my former comrades who now lie buried beneath northern snows , a patient hearing and even-handed justice . For I , too , have traveled through the Polar regions , and have wintered in the midst of Polar ice . I , too , have passed from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean , through that identical passage whose existence , it is believed , has been only recently established . I performed the feat long before Commander M'Clure // qwq of notice was boarding a deserted ship . We took " Sir iN aAFFiN 's NAY . // " The sea 's very clear for the 25th of July . " " Very , sir . " " With an easterly wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - Very easily , sir . " " And perhaps discover the Northwest Passage , eh ? " " The what ? " said I , looking up hastily . " The Northwest Passage , sir . What the devil do you mean by looking so astonished 1 Why should n't we I " He was perfectly serious . The idea had probably weighed upon his mind for some time . We had beard that a large reward was offered for the discovery of the Passage , and I fancied that the skipper had suddenly become avaricious . " Discover the Northwest Passage ! Ahem ! Suppose you did , who 'd believe it I " " For that I do n't care a cent . I 've my own notions on the existence of the Passage , and think we could get through . I 've not been a-whaling in these latitudes for twenty years without learning what 's what . Jem Fogg knows where the land lies , sir . We 've a good craft-all snug for a polar expedition-plenty of provisions , enough to last us , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a capital crew . What do you say , Mr. Skaites-shall we make the attempt 1 Speak , ca n't you ? " I endeavored , of course , to combat his wild scheme . Supposing even that we should escape with life , I had no particular desire to be frozen up at the North Pole for several years to come . The captain , however , was as obstinate as a mule . I returned to the charge frequently , but soon saw that his mind was completely made up . We talked over the plan at different times during the remainder of the day ; and , though not coiivinced of its wisdom , the skipper 's energy , and my confidence in his skill and experience , induced me to consent to his wishes . We therefore turned in that night with the understanding that if the wind were favorable on the morrow , the crew should be informed of our design , and the ship 's head directed toward those mysterious seas . I was roused the next morning about three o'clock , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I jumped up , and was on deck in a trice . The ship had her top-gallant sails set , and , under a steady breeze , was running some seven or eight knots an hour . All the crew were busily engaged . They learned , without displaying any symptoms of dissatisfaction , that we contemplated a voyage to the Polar Sea . An increase of wages was offered , and beyond this they cared for little . We made a splendid run that day , always kecpiiig the southern coast in sight-our course up the sound being almost due west . We passed several large icebergs , which became more numerous toward evening ; and a dense fog coming on about six o'clock , we were obliged to shorten sail , and advanced very slowly during the night . Next day the weather was still thick , and we did not make , in consequence , more than two or three knots an hour-unable to discern the land , but judging , from frequent soundings , that the coast was not far distant . That night our compasses ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not explain  --  and as we had no opportunity of taking any astronomical observations , we were obliged to lie to . The fog at last cleared away toward midnight , when we discovered very high land bearing 5.5W. , known as Cape Yorke . We were now at the entrance of Prince Regent 's Inlet , near the southern extremity of which it was generally believed that the Northwest Passage would be discovered . Captain Fogg had always been of a different opinion . He used to say to me , " Skaites , we 'll push on to the westward till we ca n't get any further-that 's our plan ; " and accordingly , instead of entering the inlet , we made directly for the opposite shore , crossing with the wind still east-south-east . We encountered here several large floes in a state of decay ; and , at one time , had a narrow escape of being nipped . These floes were moving in a northerly direction ; but we managed to avoid them by diverging a little and running south . It has since been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of the existence of a Northwest Passage ; for Sir John Ross circumnavigated this inlet , and sought in vain for an opening on the south or west . It is certainly somewhat singular that his expedition should have penetrated these regions the same year that we did , and neither should have been aware of each other 's presence . But we were in advance ; and a meeting which might have been very possible up to this time , soon became impracticable . We stood across the mouth of the inlet , as I have said , and hailed the opposite shore , bearing N.N.W. , on the 28th , at noon . This was in consequence of our having altered the course of the vessel to avoid being jammed between the floes . We were now in lat. 730 40 ' long . 90g . Rounding the northern extremity of Leopold Island-for the ice between it and the main-land presented no opening through which we might pass-we thence steered W.N.W. , still skirting along the shore . Weather coldthe thermometer marking at times as low as ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we encountered a severe gale from the eastward . We met also large quantities of ice , driftin* from what we believed to be another inlet , for the opposite shore was in sight . At its mouth were large fields of ice , over which the sea broke furiously ; while along the outskirts of the pack gigantic floes were almost lifted out of the water , and were dashed against each other with a noise louder than the roar of thunder . The skipper looked anxious , and sent me to the masthead . We were then under close-reefed topsails. standing out due north to escape the destruction that lay in our direct path . When in the " crow 's nest " ( as the look-out station is called ) , I could see that there was no immediate danger . To the north , the Polar Sea , as we thought , was perfectly clear of ice ; land to the south , and very high land in the distance , bearing 5.5W. , wew // qwq wind , we were forced immediately to return , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . The thermometer fell very low at 12 P.M. , and in the morning ice was forming all round the ship . Fearing that we might be frozen up in this exposed situation , we forced a passage through the young ice , entered one of the bays along the eastern coast , and were finally frozen up on the 28th of September in lat. 720 , long . 1220 50 ' . At this time our calculations were , that we had advanced ninety miles in a southwesterly direction since leaving Barrow s Strait . Our attention was first directed toward the " Northern Light . " She had suffered severely in combating the ice , and required to be carefully overhauled and stowed away for the winter . In this we succeeded . To the north and south the bay was sheltered by rocky cliffs , which rose almost perpendicularly . Our next care was to look out for winter quarters , for it would have been impossible to remain in the vessel , unprovided as we were with any substantial material for covering the deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Esquimaux . When finished we lined them with seal-skins , leaving a small aperture for a door-way , through which the men were obliged to crawl on all-fours in order to get in or out . At night this opening was closed up with several skins kept for the purpose . We built three of these huts , each about twelve feet in diameter , removing all our stores from the ship into one , and leaving the other two for our own immediate use . By the first of November , therefore , when the sun warned us of his approaching departure , we were regularly housed . With plenty of provisions there was no fear of starvation , at least for several years to come ; and for the rest , we were all a jovial set , accustomed to hardship . Most of us had passed years of our life in northern latitudes , and we looked confidently forward to the next season for a release from our imprisonment . On the 3d of November , Captain Fogg and I. accompanied by three of the crew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as forming the southern extremity of our newly-discovered territory . It was some forty miles distant from the ship , and we therefore brought with us six days ' provisions , lest we should be detained on the way by any unforeseen accident . On the second day of our journey we reached this summit , whence we purposed taking observations . What a glorious scene was here presented to our view ! Down , a thousand feet below us , was the sea-alas ! no open sea , but a vast eternity of frozen waters , heaped up like mountains , and stretching away to the south , east , and west . In the midst of these the sun was settling down to his rest . He seemed to pause in mockery , perched upon the summit of a gigantic berg ; while the whole landscape was flooded with a coloring warmer than the warmest tints of a southern sky . T was only for a moment ; but after he had disappeared-as the purple hue of a Polar night was overspreading the north  --  the peaks of innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimsoned by the reflection . This too disappeared . and the scene once more returned to that of a cold , dreary , monotonous waste , without a single feature on which the eye could find pleasure in lingering . Shortly before the sunset , Captain Fogg , who LAND IN THE DISTANCE . // had been looking through his glass intently for some moments , turned to me abruptly : " Skaites ! By Heavens I see the land on the opposite shore ! Here , take my glass-it bears SW. by S-quick , while there 's light enough - an outline scarcely to be seen-Cape Parry , on the North Coast of America , I 'll swear ! " I took the telescope , and looked long and earnestly in the direction pointed out , and at last perceived a dim haze along the southern horizon , which the skipper positively declared was land . If so , it must have been full fifty miles distant . But I could hardly credit it . I could not believe that our enterprise had been so successful . If yonder speck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our object was then accomplished ! The Northwest Passage was discovered ! When the summer came round it would not be impossible to trace the shores , which we now saw before us , westward to Behring 's Straits , in a single season  --  the distance , according to our calculation , being little more than eight hundred miles . The sun had set . He had sunk in a fiery redness , which betokened a coming storm . We hastened to return to our winter-quarters , well satisfied with the result of our expedition . But it was now no easy matter to proceed ; for a piercing gale from the north sprang up , which , blowing directly on our faces , impeded our progress . We toiled on . About midnight the wind had risen to a hurricane , and the snow drifted round us in the whirlwind , so that we lost our track and wandered hither and thither . It was impossible to take any observation . Though not dark we could not see a yard ahead , for the snow blinded us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell as low as minus 22* , so some idea may be formed of our sufferings . Toward morning my companions showed symptoms of giving way . It was in vain that I urged them to proceed-they were completely exhausted . I shouted to them through the roaring of the storm , that , if they paused an instant , they were lost beyond all redemption . This revived them to a certain extent , but not permanently . We had been obliged to leave our provisions behind us , finding it impossible to drag them after us on the sledge which we had constructed for the purpose , *o that death stared us in the face from all quarters . About six AM. the weakest of our party fell ( lown . We raised him up , shook and beat him ; but it was of no use . He became insensible directly , and in this condition we were forced to leave him in order to save our own lives . Half an hour afterward the two others dropped , and the Captain and myself were left to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it nervously . I knew well what the pressure meant-* -- he felt that his hour was come . Was there no hope ? At last he fell . Worn out myself with suffering , and maddened with despair , too felt the presence of our last great enemy , and sank down beside my friend . What years of misery I suffered in that passing momentconquered in body , but battling yet in spirit with HARPER'S*NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE Death , as he stood there shrouded in his icy mantle ! How awful was it to die upon that desolate land , where man had never trodden until we had taken possession of it for our graves ! No earthly sepulchre was to be ours , but the everlasting snow-burying us even now , while yet alive ! . For successive ages it would still keep on piling layer over layer , until at last a stupendous monument of this drifted snow would cover our bodies , and mark where we died . Perhaps its summit might catch the rosy tints of the setting sun . It soothed me to think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hudson . How green and fresh the fields were ! was it a dream ? If so , how delicious to dream thus for-for-for - ever ; and as consciousness ebbed arid flowed - ebbed and flowed-there came a glare of light , flashing fitfully before my eyes and then strange figuresinoved backward and forward , but I thought I recognized the voices . I was brought back to life . I awoke with a desperate struggle for breath . It was dark , save where the dim light of three oil lamps suspended from the ceiling , sufficed to render the darkness visible , and betrayed the anxious faces of my old companions grouped around me , watching my resuscitation . I was again in our own encampment . I felt an intense pain dart through my joints and limbs , and would gladly have relapsed into a state of utter insensibility . My first questions were after the Captain . Was he safe ? The old boatswain shook his head mournfully . " Ah , Mr. Skaites , you 've had a narrow escape ; they were all frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our brave Captain , who had been the soul of the enterprise-who had brought us thus far , and on whom we all more or less depended , was gone , and our small company was now reduced to twenty-three men . The fact was , that on the evening of the storm half a dozen of the crew had left Succor Bay ( for this was the name we had given to the place where the " Northern Light " was frozen up ) to search for us . They too were out all the night on their merciful errand , but , more warmly clad and less fatigued than we , they were enabled to withstand the cold . They searched for ten hours , and discovered us at last , accidentally , as they were returning home under the impression that we had either found shelter or had perished in the snow . A few yards from where I lay they found their comrades , cold and stiffened corpses even then . No other resource was there but to leave them in their unhallowed tomb , shrouded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was more than a week before I was able to move about . I recollect the day well that I ventured into the keen frosty air-it was on the 17th of November . I mark the time , because we witnessed then a brilliant solar phenomenon . Many who hear me describe this will imagine it a fabrication , but those who have traveled in northern latitudes will know that I am strictly speaking the truth . Sir John Ross , who wintered in Prince // Regent 's inlet that season , describes a scene somewhat similar . To us , the sun seemed ten or fifteen times its ordinary size , and of a dark crimson color . A black spot in its centre resembled a hand grasping a dagger , or some other weapon of similar dimensions . From the edge of the sun 's disc started forth myriads of daggers in every direction , makincr the whole look like an enormous asterisk . I can find no other simile . Our men , naturally superstitious , regarded this as an unfavorable omen . Nor were their fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gliding through the sky with the rapidity of lightning , left in its track what seemed to us a ghastly array of skeletons , standing out pale and phantom-like from the dark blue clouds in the background , which stretched away toward the north . Grim figures they were , which took every imaginable shape , and seemed always to point threateningly toward our ship , as she lay between two huge masses of ice , frozen up in the bay beneath . More or less impressed with these strange phenomena , we all sought rest that night with drooping spirits . I was suffering great pain , and felt nervous and uneasy ; and leaving my companions to sleep , I crawled out through the doorway once more into the open air . A spectacle of surpassing grandeur-that mass of pale , unearthly light , as it flashed over the vast expanse above , darting from one extent of heaven to the other ! Now brooding over the sea-now on the land-settling on the peaks of innumerable hills-as though it would say . See ! what an endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your courage-where is your energy now 3 It was comparatively a mild night-milder than any we had yet experienced  --  and I was muffled up warmly , yet I shuddered and shivered , and crept back into my den , cowed by the wild fancies which that midnight scene had summoned up ! November passed , and with it the sun . A long winter and a long night were now to be our portion . But we were not unprepared . Some of our men on their hunting excursions had killed five deer ; six seals and one bear had also been shot upon the ice . The skins of these animals proved very serviceable to sleep on . Moreover , fresh meat was not to be despised , although we were not in want , or likely to be in want , of food Cooking was the most difficult of our domestic labors ; but when pushed , it is astonishing what apparently insurmountable obstacles can bc overcome . We had collected by this time a large store of drift-wood , that we valued more than we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily to add to the stock , and though they often returned with a very insignificant piece , and sometimes with none at all , yet we had enough , if used sparingly , to last us during the winter None of course can be discovered at this season , for the little that is scattered along the coast is then covered with eight or ten feet of snow . We used to steep several small pieces in oil , and when well saturated they would burn long enough to answer our purposes . THE SEVENTEENTH OF NOvEMBEE. // Besides these we had two small spirit lamps , useful for melting snow , and plenty of oil lamps , with which our hut was heated . We all slept together in the largest hut for warmth , one of the others being set apart for our stores , as we at first intended , and the second used as a kitchen . Thus prepared , as far as our limited means would permit , we looked forward with no slight anxiety to the more rigorous months of winter . December set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we caught a glimpse of the sun-a small portion appearing for an instant , but being soon eclipsed by a dark cloud that lay along the southern horizon , we saw him no more that season . We calculated on six weeks of darkness-not total darkness , for the nioon shone bright and clear , as it always does in those frozen latitudes . We had as yet discovered no trace of Esquimaux-it must be remembered that we had not traveled further than thirty or forty miles from the ship-nor had we seen any symptom that the south shore , along which we had coasted westward from Prince Regent 's inlet , was at all inhabited . It is true that we did not land , except on two occasions after running into small bays when the wind was dead against us , but we always kept a good look-out , and never found aught to induce the belief that man had ventured so far north . On Saturday , the 25th of December ( Christmas-day ) , a dozen of the crew , weary of this monotonous life , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought some excitement was necessary in order to keep them in health ; for if health failed us , our doom was certain . The weather too was very favorable . Twelve of our party accordingly started off with leave of absence for a week . Their determination was to travel due west , in the expectation of discovering a frozen sea in that direction . This had been our unfortunate Captain 's idea . He always thought that the land on which we had settled was an island , and that the lofty cape whence we had seen the distant coast of America , was its southern extremity . This point it seems has been recently established by Captain M'Clure , who , during the years 1850 and 1851 , sailed almost entirely round , and gave it the name of " Baring 's Island . " I was not aware of this fact until I read his dispatches the other day in the newspapers . However , the party started off on the morning of the 26th , in excellent spirits , provided with stores sufficient to last a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact every thing that could be of service on such an expedition . There were only ten of us left in Succor Bay . The weather continued clear and bright , but the cold was intense , and on New Year 's eve the thermometer marked 320 minus . The first day of the year 1830 passed drearily away . On the 3d of January I felt a little anxious about our friends , who had already exceeded their leave of absence . On the 4th , I ascended a hill , distant from our encampment some three or four miles , to see whether they were in sight , but I could discover no trace of them . I had now great misgivings about their safety , and when the morning of the 5th arrived , and they had not returned , I resolved to start at once with the remainder of my companions in search of the lost party . We were not long in making our preparations , and left our now deserted camp with the sickening foreboding that our search would prove futile , and perhaps fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the frozen snow the traveling was good , and we pushed on westward , with the moon shining brightly overhead , until twelve o'clock , midnight , when we halted , and encamped to enjoy a few hours ' rest . By four o'clock AM. we were again en route , and at six arrived abruptly at the termination of the land , which rose precipitously about five hundred feet along the coast . From hence westward , as far as the eye could reach , we beheld nothing but a frozen sea , and this fully established that the land we had discovered was bounded on the north , east , and west by water . But now we were seeking our lost companions , not the solution of geographical or scientific problems . Our Captain , who h'ad been the life of the enterprise , and who had imbued us all with a portion of his own spirit of adventure , was dead already . Like him , I once had a desire to explore these unknown shores and unnavigable seas . But this desire had vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had anticipated . Partially provided with the means for supporting the inclemency of a Polar winter-in a country producing not even a tree-not a stunted shrub that we could turn to account-our sufferings were intense . A summer 's sun or a summer 's breeze seemed to us like some fabled vision of the past , never to be recalled . What would we not have given then for the sight of a green field , or to have been once more upon the ocean , though it were in the midst of the most terrific storm the " Northern Light " had ever weathered Great as our miseries had been , they were trivial to what we endured now . No sight , not a trace of our friends . For six days we searched along the coast , and at last were forced to give them up as lost , and return homeward . Their fate was shrouded in mystery . Had they encountered hostile Esquimaux , and been murdered Surely twelve Europeans of the reckless bravery ofourmen would have defended themselves against any odds . Had they wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Succor Bay I Such a supposition was highly improbable ; for the weather during the last three weeks had been so clear that we might easily have distinguished their tracks along the snow . Had they died of hunger , or were they frozen to death upon this shore , where the wind from the Polar Sea blew so bitterly Such questions we asked one another , but none could offer any answer . We gave up the search , wearied and desponding , and turning homeward , reached our encampment on the fifteenth . From the summit of the hill in rear of the bay , we saw the sun for the first time this year . It was only for a moment that the upper part of his disc was seen above the horizon-a // rising and , at the same time , a setting sun . A glorious scene it was Gorgeous coloring indeed ! But what a mockery to us these summer tints , as we contrasted them with the bay below us , where stood our home . Over it the adjoining hills had cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed the darkness of despair . Day after day , week after week , month after month passed away in the same dreary monotony , until summer came round once more , and found us waiting for the ice to break up , and release us from our imprisonment . This hope renewed our energy and revived our drooping spirits . We had spent a great portion of our time during the winter months in hunting ; and when June set in we were amply supplied with provisions , and all in very good health . The winter , on the whole , had not been severe ; and we expected to be once more upon the water by the end of July . We employed our time now in carefully overhauling the ship . This was satisfactorily concluded by the 20th of June , and on the next day we purposed removing our stores from the snow hut , where they had lain during the previous nine months . The ship 's boats were still on the beach , as they were left the season before . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been quite restored , could our lost friends have been excluded from our memories forever . It was our intention , as soon as the sea was sufficiently free from ice , to steer southward for the American shore ; and if we found it impossible to coast as far as Behring Straits  --  a distance of some seven or eight hundred miles-to abandon the ship , and travel by land . The latter scheme was by no means impracticable ; for it was well known that there , at least , some tribes of Esquimaux could be found , from whom we might obtain assistance . On the 30th of June , as I have said , we were seated in our hut , arranging our duties for the next day . The weather had been very mild of late , and the snow was melting rapidly . This evening the thermometer ranged at various periods from plus 300 to 35O* About nine o'clock it commenced blowing rather freshly , but the sky was clear . I went out myself shortly after , and found the wind rising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been still perfectly clear , were it not for a few scattered clouds driven madly athwart it . How the wind shrieked that night as it careered wildly over the vast area of frozen waters-how it burst ever and anon into our recess , and swept round the bay , howling for escape ! Then away again-heaving up large masses of ice in its fury-seeking some object for destruction ! The very hills around were trembling to their base . Hark ! Louder than the roar of thunder was that crash  --  the sea Lois OF THE NORTHERN LiGHT . K. * * N // is loosened from its thraildom-its waves rise up - huge icebergs are hurled one aginst the other . Our ship ! Our ship ! Now perched upon the summit of a rocking berg , she is seen to reel and stagger to and fro-she disappears-lost to us forever . Our ship ! Our ship ! Where are our hopes now I can not describe the scene  --  a midnight scene beneath the glare of a meridian sun  --  a sight seldom witnessed before by man-which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown hither and thither by the wind , those mountains of ice were tossed upon the angry waves . Ocean bursting open its prison-doors-resuming its power-Ocean triumphant . Our small company standing **32;207;TOOLONG . No , not crushed ; for we were nerved by despair . Hope had not altogether left us . We had our boats-there was yet a chance of reaching the American coast . We worked day and night energetically , arranged the larger one  --  a whalingboat-and waited impatiently for the ice to clear away . It drifted in large fields for three weeks after the storm . To put to . sea during this time would have insured our destruction . At last , on the 2d of August , Succor Bay was comparatively clear , and we resolved to launch our whaling-boat . Having stowed on board as large a quantity of provisions as it could conveniently hold , we embarked at one P.M. , with the wind N.E. by E. , and hoisting our solitary sail , bade adieu forever to the spot which had sheltered us during ten long dreary months . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , and by eight en . reached its southern extremity-the precipitous . peak of which I have already spoken . The wind there slackened , and we made but little way during the night , plying at times the oar . Expecting to reach the opposite shore by the third day at furthj*st , we steered as *iear as pc sible for that point of land which the akipper anc ? I had indistinctly seen from the summit of the Cape-our course being SW. by S. It was the evening of our second day out . The thermometer marke ' 1 50 below the freezing point  --  the mercury having fallen several degrees during the previous hour . These sudden changes of temperature , as is well known , are quite common in Polar latitudes . I thought this evening that we were in the vicinity of ice , hut as the atmosphere was thick and foggy , we were unable to ascertain whether this was or was not the case . The sea , however , was calm , and imagining ourselves near the land , we did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched myself on some seal skins in the how of the boat , and there soon forgot recollections of the past , and fears for the future . J slept ; and in my sleep there rose up before me a vision , so startling in its semblance of reality , that , though years of excitement , and cares , and troubles have passed away since then , it lives in my memory still , and must live there forever . I dreamed that I had escaped from these ice-bound regions , and after much peril and difficulty had arrived near the spot where once had stood my home . How changed it was ! I thought that the mountains were all swept away , and the valleys filled up ; and stretched out before me was a wide extended plain , covered with snow . Far away in the distance rose a gigantic rock of granite . It seemed of marvelous size , for it towered up to the very heavens . And while I looked and wondered , it began to tremble , and then to rock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presently it heaved convulsively , and I saw that it was moving toward me ! It came slowly oncrushing all in its path . Man and beast , animate and inanimate nature were alike leveled before it . Its speed increased as it rolled along . I stood there **31;241;TOOLONG this annihilating and mysterious power . On-on-on it came-faster and faster at every revolutionshaking the earth . It seemed to fill all space , so that there was not a chance of escape . I was rooted to the spot , unable to stir . See ! Crushed beneath its weight were houses-villages-cities . I looked around wildly-no aid was nigh . I crouched down , and hid my face between my hands in an agony of terror . Again I looked up . Onward , still onward rolled that huge mass-the sun was now on its ridge-now hidden behind it - nearer and nearer it came-enveloped in its shadow , it was almost touching me . Oh , mercy ! I shrieked  --  and awoke ! Cowering down in the bottom of the boat were my companions ; some on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roui*d instinctively for the cause . Great God ! save us now ! Looming through the dense mist-on either side , and not a dozen yards apart-were two stupendous icebergs , drawn together by an irresistible attraction . I had only tirhe to think an instantaneous prayer when the crash came . I almost felt the grinding together of those two mountains of ice  --  the realization of my dream . I heard with painful distinctness the shrieks of my companions , and then I was in the water , shivering , gasping in its cold depths . I struggled for life - rose to the top-clutched hold desperately of a large floe , clambered up its rugged surface , and there found myself yet alive , only to regret that I had not died with my friends . How to account for my miraculous escape I know not , unless it be that the boat 's bow , in which I was sleeping , projected so that the stern alone , where the men were seated , lay between the bergs when the collision took place . My hopes of ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if near the coast , I might possibly reach it on the *ce . But what a straw to grasp ! Even if I succeeded in this , but failed in discovering Esquimaux , I must perish with hunger . The atmosphere , too , continued thick and foggy , so that I could not see a dozen yards ahead . The floe on which I lay was about four feet square on the top , rising up pyramidically some twelve or fourteen from the water . Hour after hour passed by . In vain I strained my eyes toward every point of the compass . I could see nothing , not a particle of ice . Even // this would have been a relief . Darkness for a short time succeeded the light ; then morning came *gain , and another day passed , and yet I was not saved . Hunger , which fear had kept aloof , now seized me . I gnawed my seal-skin coat ravenously . My sufferings from thirst were even worse than from hunger . I sucked the ice , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more-for I was cramped and stiffened with wet and cold-did I yet cling with despairing energy to life . During the night I heard the walruses splashing in the water , and one crawled up the floe , bringing his hideous head so close to mine that I felt his breath upon my cheek . I shrunk from his slimy touch . Day broke mistily as before . My memory becomes dark and clouded now . Madness was at hand . I knew it , and cried aloud for a speedy death . I can remember at that awful moment watching several small pieces of ice with feverish anxiety-it was so curious to see them turn over of their own accord . Was this the beginning of madness Presently the piece to which I was clinging began to shake and tremble What ! was it about to turn too As though the last spark of reason flared up to convince me of the fact , I can remember feeling  --  and oh ! with what unutterable horror-that the spot on which I lay was gradually sinking into the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly I can re member crawling mechanically to the u1*per edge , and finding the ice there as smooth as glassnot a crevice to which I could cling ! Thus I remained an instant , but it seemed like years of intense agony . My hold upon the slippery surface becoming feebler and feebler , at last gave way ; but I remained in the same position still . I was frozen to the floe ! * * * * Many months afterward I learned , for the first time , that I had thus been discovered by a party of Esquimaux , for I was but a short distance from the shore . I was perfectly insensible ; and they carried me with them to their rude homes , and there exercised all their simple skill to bring about my recovery . They succeeded in restoring me to iifc , but for ten mouths I was a raving maniac . During this time they traveled on sledges many hundred miles toward the setting sun , always bringing me with them ; but I have no recollection of aught that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was dead , and sent to expiate my sins among fiends who inhabited the regions of eternal snow . When I recovered my reason , 1 was on the THE SOAT CEUSHEO. // banks of the Mackenzie River . It was in the spring of 1831 . The kind Esquimaux who had taken care of me thus far were going to Fort Good Hope to trade with the Hudson 's Bay Company . There I was certain of finding civilized people , and from thence I thought to travel to Vancouver 's Island , and reach home by this route . I arrived at Fort Good Hope , but was obliged to remain there two years . At last , in the winter of 1833 , a company of hunters and traders started for the South across the Rocky Mountains , and I eagerly joined the party . This overland journey was very uninteresting and monotonous . I had sometimes to remain for months at intermediate stations . Finally , I arrived at the Island on the 12th of June , 1835 , having been almost five years performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , from the place where I was picked up by the Esquimaux . Thus it was that , twenty-four years ago , I discovered that same passage through the Polar regions which Commander M'Clure is said to have discovered now . The world does not and will not believe nw story , because I have no other evidence than my own to substantiate it . But it is nevertheless true . Of the twenty-seven men who entered Baffin 's Bay in July , 1829 , I only escaped alive . I am the true discoverer of the Northwest Passage ! * * * * * * I listened attentively to this tale of suffering , and broke in as the narrator paused : " But how did you get here from Vancouver 's Island 3 " " Oh , shortly after my arrival , I found a ship starting for the Sandwich Islands . I embarked in her , and reached Honolulu in due time , where I became so great a favorite with the king , that , to escape the vengeance of his jealous subjects , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atCanton-headed a rebellion which proved unsuccessful-was captured , thrown into prison . and subjected to every species of torture . Then- " " Stay-tell me , in the name of Heaven , wise are you , sir 3 " " Who am I 3-with an air of supreme contempt at my ignorance- " I am *ow the Khan of Tartary " Pardon me , " said I , hastily , " I have some important business to transact , and must say good-by , with many thanks for your interesting narrative . " The Khan bowed with solemn dignity . I thought it prudent to leave him to his own reflections . When I last beard of the Khan of Tartary and Discoverer of the Northwest Passage , he was in a mad-house.
