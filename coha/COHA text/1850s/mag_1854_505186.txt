I N the national wail which has not yet died away , the thoughtful ear seems to hear a Rachel mourning for her children . There are certain great and striking crises when men feel their direct brotherhood most strongly , and emancipate themselves from the conventional separation necessitated by society . Such crises are not only the terrible tragedy , like that of the Arctic , but the universal shock of terror and sympathy among those who may be in no way related to any of the victims . How well we remember when the news of the safety of the Atlantic , three or four years since , arrived in the city . It was at evening , and the Extras , in a moment , sowed the exciting news broadcast over the town . Men stopped each other in the streets , and told the glad tidings as of some great victory which had secgred peace and prosperity to the land . Crowds gathered under the lanterns , while some loud voice read out the happy news . People looked in at shops and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In the theatres the managers rushed upon the stage in the midst of the erformaiice , and announced to the audience *m*t every one was rejoiced to hear . For that evening men stood upon the ground of a common manhood , sure of individual sympathy , in the universal joy . It was different the other day . The fate of the Arctic will be one of the dark spots in all our memories . It is not alone terrible for the awful suffering and sudden fate of all those human beings so full of life and hoPe in the moment of their ending ; nor for the desolating reach of the blow into thousands of families , whose grief shall never be known nor suspected ; not for the inevitable agonies of such a tragedy alone , is it terrible ; hut for that deeper and more solemn mystery which it casts upon the ocean voyage . So common has it now become , so regularly thronged a highway is the sea , that its old terrors , the colossal fear which girded it like a horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , orhad receded into a remote conviction that science and skill had fully mastered its dangers . But at high noon a stout , swift steamer , one of the largest and strongest of vessels , is struck with so little shock , that the jar is scarcely perceived in the cabin , and long before sunset a few drifting spars , tossine upon the waves , are all the relics of that stately ship . Who can wonder that the public heart stood still ? Who can doubt that secret founts of unsuspected pity gushed in hearts that were surprised by their own tenderness ? Who does not know how at morning and in the night the thought of so terrible a thing stole into his mind , and touched his life with humility ? Who can not well believe that , as a survivor reported , when the insatiate sea closed forever over the ruins of that bark of precious lives , a hollow sigh , a groan ( from the steam and heat , perhaps , in the boilers ) rose over the wreck , and mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restores all the ancient terror to the sea , and compels every man who steps upon a ship to reflect upon the solemnity of his undertaking . It is not that accidents are not as common upon land , nor that the chances of life are at all paralyzed by the water . But there is a sense of solitude , of separation , of necessity , upon the sea , which is never felt upon the land . Beyond the limits of your vessel there is little safety , and that vessel is but a chip in a maelstrom , when danger threatens . It is not strange that when a storm is rising men gather in the cabin , and , as the ship begins to heave and pitch in the billows , tell wild and startling stories of shipwreck . Afearful sympathy holds them to the theme . Like children telling ghost stories in a haunted house , every sound and movement gives only too fearful a reality to their words . But here was no storm , no long suspense , no fluctuating hope . Without doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers really supposed that the last moment had arrived . Suddenly , in the very flush of life , they were confronted with death ; and let us believe that they met it calmly , nobly , trustfully , like men . For at suds times every man is apt to be a hero . If there is any latent nobility in his character , it is developed and takes the mastery . When some weak and effeminate Louis XVI . mounts the scaffold , his behavior is so beautiful that he will have the sympathy of the world forever . A Charles I. hears so serenely the noisy building ofhis scaffold , and stands upon it so gravely and patiently , that history is almost ready to wish the revolution unfought . If such illustrious instances of the port of men not really great are so refreshing , even when they had every reason and occasion to seem heroic , whether they really were so or not , think of that solitary and lost multitude , that hecatomb of brave victims , sinking in the sea , without a cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no muse to catch their names , with no future of renown and expiatory praise ; yet-for who can doubt it who has seen similar and sudden crises ? - calni , an ( l sweet , and gentle , and lying down , with true heroism , in the remorseless and unylelaing sea . We can look at this great misfortune quietly from this distance of time . The daily papers have not failed to suggest scores of means of escape which did not occur to the victims-which were , perhaps , not possible in the actual circumstances of the case . The captain , who was so providentially saved , was received by exulting crowds like a monarch returning triunisphant . Ill-judging enthusiasm proposed a hundred things which a sailor 's good sense declined . At most he had done his duty . A thoughtful man is saddened to see that heroism and devotion to duty are considered worthy an especial ovation . A general who falls victorious at the head of his advancing army is held in long and sweet remembrance in his country 's heart . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose he had fled ? What a peal of disgust would have rung through the world ! Every great accident at sea not only reminds us how grave and awful are the chances of the ocean but it puts those who are absent further away . So easy and pleasant had the Atlantic passage become , that Switzerland seemed quite near enough for a summer ramble , and Rome for a winter visit . But now Switzerland and Italy are thrust into a deeper and more inaccessible distance , and all the friends who are traveling there seem much further aWay . In view of these colossal calamities one can well understand the timid mariners creeping along the shores of the Mediterranean , and dreading the open sea . That cloudy waste of water-that race-course of the winds-that arena of tempests-why should we tempt it , we who love the solid , green earth , and the limitations of the landscape ? But since it must be-since Death and sad disaster haunt the shore also-it is foolish to indulge // any extravagant apprehension , or to suppose the sea less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider that speed is not safety-that it is better to arrive in New York a day later than not to arrive at all , but to perish hopelessly at the very portals of home . It is wiser to remember that there may be guilt where no crime is intendedthat there are things too precious to be bought by any kind of outward success-that it is better to keep three hundred passengers three months upon the ocean , rather than that the family of one should suffer unavailingly over his unnecessary loss . There are wiser things to do , when great catastrophes occur , than returning thanks to officials , and exculpating men in authority . Let us bethink ourselves that human life is costly and dear in many senses , and that each man in society is , to a certain degree , responsible for every other . The moral of every event seems to be charity . For those who have escaped the terrible tragedy of the Arctic , there is sympathy and consideration . For those who have perished , the most tender and regretful remembrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few . But how deeply we shall all be guilty if such events occur again ! This was not an unavoidable accident . Two ships , upon a part of the ocean where ships are thickest , are sailing at a rapid rate in a fog so dense that they can not be perceived until they strike . The echo of that collision is the wild wail of broken hearts , much more than the death-cry of the sufferers . Shall it have no other echo , no other influence ? Shall it be that our wives , and children , and friends are to be exposed to a recklessness which is not excusable because it is the custom ? Or are we all so little interested in the true well-being of society , that we will submit to these fearful possibilities without an effort ? We are glad that from our Easy Chair we can prolon* the thoughtfulness into which this event has plunged the public mind . And you , good friend , whose eye falls here , what can *sou do to help or to avert such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struggle , and despair , when you ask yourself the question , " Why did I not feel that it was my business ? " Whatever tends to cheapen human life , is the serious business of every man . SINCE the sudden demise of the Art Union there has been less attention called to pictures and painters . In truth Art finds America an ungenial soil . There are plenty of earnest and devoted men engaged in painting ; but the studios are not necessary places of resort as in Europe . When strangers-as in the autumn-throng the city , they do not inquire for the pictures hanging upon the walls of the painters as they do for the theatre and the opera . The Earl of Ellesmere did diflisrently . He did , as all cultivated gentlemen in Europe do , he remembered that the intellectual and aesthetic condition of a civilization is to be seen and studied in its art , and he naturally sought the studios . We have formerly mentioned that he commissioned several pictures here , from Kensett , Church , and others-some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . But although the private studios are not much frequented , there are not wanting public opportunities of seeing and enjoying fine works of art ; and , indeed , the course of the empire of Art seems to be tending slowly westward . We have had the most illustrious of contemporary singers , and instrumental virtuosos-Paul Delaroche 's Napoleon has found his way here ; Landseer is desirous that America should see his dogs and deer ; and the finest picture of the chief school of Germany , Leutze 's Washington at Monmouth , is a permanent possession here . We can not but consider the presence of such works public advantages . The enjoyment of the great things of Art is a itiat-. ter of cultivation ; and it is pleasant to go to school to such masters as the best contemporary Englishmen , Germans , and Frenchmen . Washington at Moamoutk is in many respects the most important and interesting picture ' we have ever seen in this country . It is a work of universal interest , because we can not escape the commanding charm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our great hero . That Mr. Leutze should have selected this especial subject , shows not only a fine perception of the historical picturesque , but a bold confidence in his ability to present , and in the public patience to tolerate , a moment in the career of Washington entirely different from any other , and totally at variance with the general estimate of his character . The placid , wigged , and knee-breeched gentleman , with a sword at his side and books and papers upon a neighboring table , whom we are accustomed to recognize as the Father of his country  --  or indeed the grave and beneficent historical image of the hero , the Roman fortitude , the incorruptible integrity , the severe simplicity , the punctilious politeness-all the points and principles which combine to make up an idea of the model man of the century and of history , are not in every respect corroborated by personal tradition . It seems to be well authenticated that he was a man of very hasty temper , although he held it firmly under control . But not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes break out and master him . Lately we have heard an anecdote illustrative of this fact . When Stuart was painting Washington 's portrait , he was rallied ene day by the General for his slow work . The painter protested that the *dcture could not advance until the canvas was dry , and that there must be yet . some delay . Upon arriving the next morning , Stuart turned his canvas and discovered , to his great horror , that the picture was spoiled . " General , " said he , " somebody has held this picture to the fire . " Washington summoned his negro valet , Sam , and demanded of him , in great indignation , who had dared to touch the portrait . The trembling Sam replied , that , chancing to overhear Washington 's expression of impatience at the slowness of the work , and the response of the artist that it must be dry before he could go on , he had ventured to put the canvas before the fire . Washington , with great anger , dismissed him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day , after Stuart had arrived and was preparing to work , Washington rang the bell , and sent for Sam . He came in abashed and trembling . The President drew a new silver watch from his pocket , and said : " Come here , Sam* Take this watch , and whenever you look at it , remember that your master , in a moment of passion , said to you what he now regrets , and that he was not ashamed to confess that he had done so . " Many similar anecdotes live in tradition . But // the one great instance-which may be called the historical instance-of his expression of vielent passion , was that of the battle of Monmouth , , when General Lee , leading his troops in full retreat , was met by Washington , who , totally unable to control himself called Lee fiercely to account , even swore at him , and then repelled disorderly retreat . The artist has shown great discrimination in seleeting a subject where Wasriington , being in full action , was , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all understand the hearty indignation of a hero at cowardice , and the irrepressible contempt of a brave leader for a subordinate who retires without reason . The picture is so fine , and so well worth seeing by those of our friends who come to the city from a distance , that we will try to give them some idea of it . Every picture should tell its own story-an axiom which implies certain conditions . A picture of the Crucifixion tells its story only to those who know the Christian history . To any other observer it is only a man in agony . So with a historical picture , the men and the circumstances must be known , or the picture has no meaning . Thus in Horace Vernet 's great picture at Versailles , the spectator who recognizes the French soldiers , perceives instantly that it is a modern French battle in Algiers ; and if he is familiar with the history , he will easily determine what battle it is . In like manner a student of American history , which we all are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be what it is , an incident in the life of Washin*ton , responds* at a glance , Washington at Monracaith . This is its first great success . ft is unmistakable . It tells its story . The battle of Monmouth was fought upon a burning midsummer day . It was supposed that as many died from heat as from the chance of battle . Washington had sent forward nn advance-guard with General Lee , his second in command . The oommand had at first been given to Lafayette , for Lee was so much opposed to the battle that he did not care to take part in it . , Bnt finding Washington resolved , he claimed his position . He had gone on to meet the enemy and commence the engagement , while Washin , , ton came up with the main army . The attack was made near Monmouth court-house . There was confusion but great bravery upon the American side , until , perplexed and uncertain , General Lee ordered a retreat at the wrong moment . The militia immediately commenced crossing a morass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was advancing under Washington . Suddenly he perceived the tumultuous approach of the militia , swarming in wild confusion across the swamp . Perceiving in a moment the moral influence upon the main body of such a reckless retreat of the advance-guard-foreseeing the panic and flight , and the consequent incalculable detriment to the Continental cause , he buried his spurs in his horse 's flanks , and . dashed on the full run across the morass straight toward the hurrying and disorderly mass . The heat was unspeakable ; the sand rolled in clouds  --  the m*ilitia were fainting and falling overpowered at every step . General Lee was riding in front of the column , and Washington rode directly at him . He called him to account in the severest mannerflung at him an oath of contempt ; biet perceiving that the immediate evil to be obviated was the retreat itself , he swept on into the midst of the militia , and with the impetuous energy of rage , and the conviction of an imminent danger to the great cause impending , he succeeded in stemming the retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , and recoiled before his scornful rebuke . He inspired them with his own consciousness of a disgrace hanging over them , and a vital misfortune threatening the cause . They rallied , took heart , and advanced again . The day was won ; Washington was justified , and Lee forever disgraced . Here are all the elements of a fine historical picture , and the artist who so clearly saw , has known equally wall how to use them . The picture is about as large as the Washissgtoa crossing the Delaware . It is crowded with figures and full of action , but there is not the slightest confusion . The eye is at once master of the scene . The centre of the foreground is a pool in the marsh , fringed with long grass and reeds . A dog is plunging in and lapping the water . In the left foreground come in the hurrying militia . One youth , death-stricken , and with glazed eyes , reaches feebly forward toward the pool . lie clings to a rough backwoodsman , who supports his dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the multitude thronging through the swamp , and streaming across the picture from the left corner of the foreground to the upper . right corner of the background . One of the finest figures in the left is a youth , evidently a gentleman , who , abashed by the eagle eye of the chief , and reproved by his own shame , stands leaniag back up9n the crowd , with both arms outstretched to restrain their flight , and half glancing from under his brows at the indignant face he dare not fully front . Behind him the great mass pushes on . Washington occupies the centre of the picture . His horse springs at full gallop over the edge of the pool toward the left foreground . His rider 's left hand curbs him , and his right is stretched straight up in the air brandishing his sword , in the furious conflict of his feelings , to wave backward the retreat . This action gives a breadth to his movement . It makes his intention more manifest . It multiplies and enlar*es his presence . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least melodramatic . The face of Washington is that of a man violently excited by anger . It is hardly recognizable as the Washington of the usual portraits . But there is a fine scorn in the mouth , and an eagerness of defiance against the retreat , which fill the face with expression . The figure , for some reason , perhaps faulty drawing , and perhaps the long lappels of the waistcoat would necessarily produce such an effect , seems too solid and short for Washington . His action is not directed to an individual , but to the whole retreating mass . This has been noticed as a fault . It was contended that the proper historic moment was the rebuke to Lee , who caused the retreat . And that therefore the movement of Washington should have been directed to Lee . But clearly the great point is the retreat itself , not its leader ; and Washington 's great act is stemming the retreat , not cursing the chief who allowed it . Perfect justice is done to this claim . The scornful wrath at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger and // impersonal indignation at the flying army . General Lee sits upon a white horse in the middle distance , just before Washington . His head sinks sullenly . his eyes have the dull sulkiness of a snake . His whole mien indicates a man utterly abashed and ashamed , with a consciousness of guilt . He is withdrawn into the middle distance by design , for he is only in the middle distance of interest . Washington transfixes him with contempt , and instantly waving him aside , sweeps around to his task . Lafayette and Hamilton press on immediately behind Washington . The bland , courteous , hut formal and far from forcible face of Lafayette , is strained toward the retreating columns and General Lee . Hamilton 's small , concentrated , and intense face , ( irawn in so as to throw the brow forward , is as full of thought as Lafayette 's of curiosity . These two heads are finely contrasted . In the right foreground is another carefully-considered group . A drummer boy recoils from the heels of Washington 's horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder , waves his hat enthusiastically , greeting his chief . Another youth , just wounded , falls back in mortal agony , supported by a grave older man , while a comrade stoops over the pool and dips water for his dying friend . The central background of the picture is a knoll or little hill , upon the top of which a company of tl*ing artillery is just wheeling into play . The brisk action of the horses and soldiers in this group carry on completely the movement of the picture , and impress the spectator with the conviction that the battle is still going on . On the extreme rinht background stand the main body of the Continental troops . In the extreme left the English regulars or Hessians are showing themselves upon the edge of a wood . The faults that strike us in this work , and we are by no means sure that longer study would not remove them , are an appearance of flatness in the figures of the middle distance , a want of round flesh-and-blood outline ; and too cold an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more autumnal than the fervor of midsummer . But , for the rest , it is a stirring , spirited work , without any thing too fine or over-wrought , nothing finical , or symbolical in a small way . The scene was simple , the emotions were strong , and simple and strong the painter has made them . If it be asked what great moral or intellectual significance has such a picture , we must remember before we reply , that every work representing a strictly historical event , a mere circumstance , is great by the magnitude of the results that depend upon the single action represented . The pictures of martyrdoms , as for instance that of Iluss , can not represent any result ; they can only deal with the circumstance of a moment . The grandeur which invests in imagination liubens 's Descent frons Ike Cross , and the same picture of Daniele do Volterra , lies in the solemn remembrance of the mind which regards it of the sublime significance of the words- " It is finished . " The picture shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while weeping friends are near . But great pictures are paiisted for " my mind 's eye , Horatio . " In the same way this picture represents the moment in which the battle of Monmouth was won . It is Monmouth victory in its last analysis . For when the retreat was stopped , the triumph was made possible . The artist has seized the most pregnant mo ment of the occasion : there was scarcely one more so in the whole war . We are glad that we can so heartily admire this work , and we have the more pleasure in expressing our admiration , because we know how prone we sitters in Easy Chairs are to find fault , and show our smartness in following small scents . Peccevimus ! What sitter in an Easy Chair does not plead guilty to the charge ? There is a sad disproportion in our fault-finding . Why can we not maintain some kind of relation between ourselves and our judgments ? To see that a thing might bedifferent , is not necessarily to see that it might he better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those of Art , why so furious to insist upon your taste and your convictions as the final criterion ? For ourselves , we are convinced that when men pass the grand climacteric , and sit down in Easy Chairs to survey life and the world , they can not find so soft a cushion a charity . It is pleasanter to love than to hatepleasanter to praise than to condemn . And if we come to criticism , are there not enough who assert that one leg of the Apollo is longer than the other - that the children of the Laocoon are little old men-that the Venus de Medici is a plump nymph - that the Transflgnration is two pictures-that the Last Judgment is unchristian-that IJomenichino is a dauber , and Claude a botcher , and Perugino wooden ? Yet who shall conceive the delicate ministry to human happiness of all the lovely pictures and the noble statues ? There are imperfect roses whose scent breathes all the summer back , nor would they do more were every petal fresh . He is much to be pitied whose regret at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AT last Lady Franklin 's long watchings are over . The secret so long locked up in frozen seas escapes . The dream of an upper ocean , calm and open , supplied with food and flowing around the pole , dissolves . The adventurers among the icy ribs of the earth return ; only a few ships remain among the icy wastes . But stranded forever and ever upon a desert more dreadful than that of the tropics , the hones of brave men bleach In the cold gloom of eternal winter . The Northwest Passage is discovered and Sir John Franklin is dead . We have all read those early hooks . We have all hung enchanted upon Captain Franklin 's story and Captain Parry 's . To our young imagination they were hardly less mythical than Ajax and Achilles . Who of s*s supposed that , after the fervor of youthful fancy had declined , he should read in the cold columns of newspapers that the heroic voyager had died at what we may well call his post ? It seems a life wasted ; a hitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have come of it ? Now that it is known who is the better for it ? The problem is solved . Men and money , brave men , in a world where heroes are rare , have been sacrificed in the solution . But there is another view to which we have once alluded . Human heroism grappled with a problem , the solution of which increased the store of human knowledge . Is it not fine that it did not let go ? Is it not noble that an could not be finally conquered by cold , nor ice , nor desolation ; but wrested from the lonely pole its secret , and scorned the danger of the effort ? In this moment , while none but clmrls can harshly speak of Franklin , we can point to this as the result // of all Arctic adventure , that it is another proof of the untiring persistance of human heroism . It was not merely Quixotic . Nobody supposed we should get tea and sugar sooner . But here was something in geography that we did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more a man for Franklin , and M'Clure , and Kane . For the same reason that " man 's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn , " does each brave aim of every man touch every other man with pride and pleasure . Arctic exploration is now , undoubtedly , forever over ; but it is not enough , nor does it tell the whole story , to call it foolhardy . Respectable men , in warm coats and comfortable offices , draw their dividends , put on their India-rubbers , and go safely home to bed . They take the evening paper with their tea or their wine , and read of Franklin 's fate . In eight of such men out of ten the chief feeling is a kind of contemptuous pity that any man should go on such a fool 's errand . And yet-for here is the moral  --  the spectacle of heroism displayed in one such career as that of Franklin , is worth more to mankind at large-not to his family , who want the dividends-than the life of our friend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explorer , Dr. Kane , is the only one who now remains among the primeval ice . He is followed by the hopes of two nations , and by the respect of the world . We owe to him , in his Grinnell Expedit , the clearest account of the grim realities of the Pole . May he return to us sue*essful and well . He will not , indeed , bring news of Sir John Franklin , as he hoped ; but let him bring himself ; fresh from his manly endeavor , and we shall all be gainers by the return we hail . WE have had our Chair wheeled up to the new Opera-House , and although all our friends who happen in of a morning have seen it , there will be many with whom we converse , who have not seen it , and who will be glad to hear of it . It is very large , very heavy , perhaps clumsy , very brilliant , and , in general effect , despite the quarrel with details , very festal and handsome . Compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacious complain that the heavy columns intercept too much view of the stage ; and there is some truth in the complaint , for from the boxes at the hack of the second tier , the eye falls down a precipice of seats , and dodging about the massive columns , catches glimpses of the singers . The shape of the house is unpardonable . Nothing can excnse an architect for building a house , designed as an auditorium for certain spectacles upon a stage , in such a manner that , , from many parts of the house the stage is not visible . It is the same . kind of mistake as if he were to build a dwelling-house , and have the ceilings of the rooms so low that he could not stand in them . It is mere stupidity . The house is very high , and the steep pitch of every tier toward the front displays the audience to the most brilliant advantage . It is much superior to all foreign theatres in this respect . The boxes of the Italian opera- houses are literally boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that each is a room by itself . This is a charming social arrangement , because a party can talk and laugh without disturbing others . But it destroys the effect of what is called " the house . " On the other hand , it offers a gallery of single pictures , for a beautiful woman , beautifully dressed , and sitting in the front of such a box , relieved by the dark background , tells more to the eye than a mass of fine toilets . These things are to be considered in the case of every opera-house , for the opera is a social institution as well as a matter of Airt . One great defect in our new house , and it will undoubtedly prove a bar to its perfect success , is the difficulty of access to the various parts of the house . The seats are so closely packed , and the passages so few , that where you sit you must remain , or put afi your neighbors to the greatest inconvenience . Originally there was no passage down the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , and if you chanced to have taken the middle seat , you were compelled to disturb twenty-four persons before you could reach it . Such parsimonious and mean mistakes as this-this desperate American effort to blend elegance and economy , incline the spectator to a harsh judgment of the whole . In a house of the scope , and splendor , and intention which this has , there should have been the utmost facility offered for moving about , and in every way the social convenience should have been considered . We will only distantly allude to the seats that fly at a man 's coat skirts like Cerberus . With all these complaints , and with*ill allowance for the satire upon " gingerbread , " and " papier-mache , " and " gilt , " it can not be denied that the whole effect of the new house is spacious , festive , and elegant . And when , as in Semiramide , there are carefully-considered costumes , and well. - painted scenery , and a stage covered with a crowd of priests , soldiers , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever seen in the country . We take the first night of Semirameulc to have been the most brilliant opera evening in America . For some reason the audience is not enthusiastic . Grisi is received coldly , and many of her grandest points fall unacknowledged , if not unrecognized . " I expected to find them cold , " she is reported to have said " but I find them icy . " Perhaps it is the splendor of the place which restrains the applause , or is it that there is some disappointment with the ' singers ? It should have been remembered that we had heard the best of the time . Jenny Lind , Alboni , and Sontag , had all sung to us ; and the moderate success of the latter should have taught the friends of Grisi that her triumph was not entirely secure . There are comparisons drawn doubtless between her voice and Jenny Lind 's and Alboni 's . It is remembered that Alboni sang quietly at the Broadway and at Niblo 's , without any flourish , and with no imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heard the delicious vocalization of Sonta , , at Niblo 's for a long season . To surpass these , and to fill with enthusiasm an immense house at an immense price , demanded something more than Grisi , fine as she yet is , and Mario , although now in his prime . The result shows that this is so . There was a Jenny Lind party , a Sontag party , an Alborli party ; but where is the Grisi party ? She has created no enthusiasm , she has not crowded her houses , she has not borne us away with ferore ; and yet she lies sung as only Grisi can now sing . She has been the N a that only Grisi can be . She has been Seieiram , with Assyrice grandeur ; and Lecrezie , with Venetian splendor . In her and Mario , and Susini , we have had // an opera troupe with which no other ever among us is to be named , and there has been really less demonstration of pleasure than in the days of Benedetti and Truffi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its exquisite power of transmitting the airiest sound  --  a house which for size and effect is among the best in the world , and our hearts have pined for Astor Place and the departed delights of song . We can not but feel that if these singers go to die South they will find their laurels blooming again , and learn that even on this side of the sea there can be the warmest appreciation of what is lest in its kind . The ardor of sympathy which they sought here in vain will there enclose them like a warm atmosphere , and secure them the confidence which conquers success . Even here , as the cold winter settles gloomily around our Chair , we can hear in fancy the warm shouts and prolonged murmur with which our more susceptible and imlietuous Southern neighbors express their delight . The theatre is thronged hy the lovely , languid Creole beauties . A Spanish splendor lightens the boxes . There are flowers , lights , perfumes ; a gay and graceful company , to whom the opera is dear , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the house hushes and the warm scented air breathes 4n upon the Druidess , she moves to the front with a more majestic step ; she culls the herbs with a more melancholy grace , and as she raises her voice to caste Dive , there is a trembling tenderness in its sweetness-for in thought she is across the ocean , in thought she renews her early and unquestioned triumphs ; twenty years melt from her mind , from her eye , from her voice , and , touched by the warm magic of the South , the priestess dreams she is in Paris , and forgets forever the boreal climate of Irving Place . OUR FOREIGN GOSSIP . WE seize our gossip as we can ; sometimes sifting the journals , and coaxing from them enough of dainty paragraphs to furbish into record ; and again , availing ourselves of some kindly ohserver , who tells us , letterwise , what has ruled the European tongue and thought . To such an observer , who has spent the season past in Continental rambles , we are indebted now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but good-natured pen , which thus epitomizes the European summer and autumn : " Mv DEAR H.- , " You thought that , in these war times , I should have a dull summer in Europe ; that people would wear gloomy faces and keep themselves within doors ; that the hotels would be empty , and the roads untraveled . You never were more mistaken in your life . First of all , our own countrymen have been swarming , not only in the cities , but at the springs , and by Lake Geneva , and in the Pyrenees ; and even in my way , by crazy diligence from Florence to Mantun , there were two lean men , in black dress-coats , from some court township of Illinois , who chewed tobacco , and wore satin waist-coats ! " I wish I had come to Europe in those old days when the voyage made a man 's reputation at home , and he was looked up to always after as a kind of Nester , who knew all about pictures and architecture , and delivered opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . I remember meeting with a prim single lady of this stamp when I was a lad , who was the wonder of a large neighborhood , and who at every evening party told a story of having been robbed by brigands , and of going up to the Montanvert under circumstances of danger from precipices and avalancheswhich made her a heroine . How I envied that woman ! " There is no hope now of any thing of the sort ; or if there were , ten chances to one your next door neighbor , who is a clergyman , and has traveled for the bronchitis , can correct your statements , and draw oft half the wonder upon himself . Even the milliner women are beginning to come over to buy their ribbons , and to get a fall ' style of hats . Paris is not so much as New York or Philadelphia used to be in the old days ; and the tailors in the metropolitan city of the French will give you his prices in dollars-American currency . " In fact the man who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nowadays , currently , can make no pretensions to mode whatever . I can remember the time ( you know the years do n't fail me ) when a man was pointed out of by-standers , at evening gatherings and otherwheres , as one who had traveled abroad . Who thinks of such szieiserie now ? Who can win reputatio*i by a European tour-least of all , if lie forgets himself so far as to plume himself upon it ; or ( still worse ) to print the story of it ? " Mrs. Stowe 's was , indeed , an exceptional matter ; and people had to learn how the maker of the Uncle Tom story was f*ted , and how the eyes which had seen such fearful things across the Ohio river , at Cincinnati , would look at the Duke of Sutherland 's castaway tenantry . " And this reminds me-of what you have possibly seen-that some good British democrat stoutly denies all which the authoress says of the good management of the Sutherland estates , and appeals to personal observation as proof against the good report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At all events , it would have been more satisfactory if the good woman in the courls ' had indulged in a little inquisitive chat with the Scottish cottagers themselves , instead of receiviag all her information under the rose-colored lights of the Sutherland Palace in London . There is enough of evil with us to be sure ; but. , God knows , it 's not all the evil in the world . " For the novelty of the thing , I have myself broken barley bread with stout Lancashire reapers , who told me a deal of hardnesses received , and labors unrequited . And as for the English miner0 their woes are crying over the world . " But I began to talk of travel , and the war . One thought that money would be sparingly spent , and , that the tokens of luxury and of extravagance would grow rarer ; but the signs are quite otherwise ; and railway carriages and Continental inns were never so thronged as during the season whose last leaves are now whistling in the November winds . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for want of quarters , even in so wellconducted a town as that of Geneva ? Yet so it was-not a chamber was to he found far or near ; and for a fee , the Swiss conductor left me snuggled in the corner of the cou which brought me from Berne . At Vevay it was nearly as had ; and the great inn by the lake was turned almost into an American barrack . And let me tell you that the quarters one falls into thereabout have very much // to do with the enjoyment of the scenery . You will scarce believe it when I tell you , that only one hotel in the whole town of Vevay has a good look upon the water and the mountains ; and that , failing of lodgings here , you are condemned to some dingy quarter , whence you look on courts begrimined with mud , with only women in sabots to entertain your eye , and the chase of myriad fleas to entertain your thought . " Such was my bitter experience on as bright a Sunday as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I had not resolutely shaken the dust of the town from my shoes , and coquetted with the morning in the pleasant orchards which lie between Vevay and Montreux . You have seen the spire of Montreux , in any chance view you may have had under your eye of Chillon and the upper end of the Geneva lake . It seems to sentinel the road which borders the water ; but in reality it stands two hundred feet or more above it , upon a ledge of the west mountains , all fringed with green walnut trees , and here and there an aspiring poplar . From its inclosing yard you look down on sloping vineyards and gardens , edged by the white ribbon of road which skirts the lake , and winds on by Chillon , and Villeneuve , and Aix , throu , h the sombre upper valley of the Rhine . " There are sermons out of doors in Switzerland ; as , indeed , I think there are every where e*e where mountains are high , and water glancing in their shadows . Mont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the lake ; his head was white as snow , and stood out boldly against the blue of the church ceiling , which was arched over in the form of a dome , and a few clouds of incense were floating below . A company of church elders , in the shape of Savoyard mountains , very much battered with years , and with faces seamed over , and shaggy eyebrows sprinkled with white , supported the preacher , and filled up the east end of the church . There was a baptismal font between them and myself , which caught a rich blue reflection from the ceiling of the church , and mirrored the hoary head of the preacher . The people of twenty towns thereabout , lyin* along the sides of the hills above Vevay , attended church with me ; anda few steeple bells ringing together made a solemn chorus for the service . It lasted until the incense-bearers closed the doors on the Savoyard elders , and on the stately preacher . But a bright gleam of sunshine in the west announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a worshipful man may find perpetual service among those valleys which divide the Alps . That very night which curtained the Sabbath ceremony I just now told you of , gave me the hearing of a great psalm-gust , the like of which belongs to no cathedral choir , and no organ loft but Nature 's . " I was upon the heights of the Dent de Jaman , which , like a jagged tooth , is rooted in the mountains that hang over the northwest skirt of Leman . It is not so high but that the turf grows green to within a hundred feet of its summit ; then a bold cliff rises , with le&amp;es for trailin , , wild flowers , that fling out odors only to the birds who live in the tops of the fir-trees . " I had gone up the path which winds thither late in the day ; and the villagers who have their hamlets nearest told me it was too late to cross the mountain , and that darkness would overtake me in the wild pastura*e slopes . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was one of VOL . X.-No. 55. -I perhaps half a score that stood perched on a plateau of green upon a shoulder of the mountain , two thousand feet above the lake , in whose edge the great chateau of Chillon hung floating like a painted toy . " The good woman of the chalet stewed me a slice from the haunch of smoked mutton that hung to the rafters of her house , while I sat under the walnut trees , listening to the tinkle of the bells upon the necks of browsihg goats , and looking across upon the gaunt Savoyard mountains , half hidden by cloud patches , and blotched here and there with reflections of the red sunset . " They told me as evening darkened , and I had finished my supper of mutton , that a storm was coming , though from what quarter I could not tell . Those mountain people see signs in straws ; and they promised me a wet foot-way on the morrow , though it seemed to me that the clouds grouped lazily over the heights as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thunder woke me at ten ; but I dropped asleep again , and may have remained in my doze for two hours , when there was a rattling of my chamber-door , and my hostess came , in a loose undress , and screaming to me to get up a1* once , as the chalet was in terrible danger , rushed out of the room as hastily as she had entered . " There was no light for me but the fearful gleam of the lightning , which lit up the narrow slopes of the hills , and shone by streams as the distant snowmountains of Savoy . Blaze and thunder came together in dazzling crashes ; and the clouds seemed breaking on the very tree-tops . " I hurried on my clothes , and went out upon a little balcony of the chalet , which was partially protected by the broad-eaved roof . Below , and not ten yards from the house , was a fierce torrent raging every moment nearer and nearer , and bringing down rocks , and broken trees , and debris of harvests from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a brook where * river was now foaming over the bed of the mountain pathway . As the blazes of lightning flamed in the sky , I could see the wretched villagers grouped upon the knolls , on either side of the fierce torrent , watching its progress , or making suck fee -- ble barricades as they could to divert it from their homes . " Upon the nearer side there were only my hostess and two brown-faced herdsmen . The poor woman stood wringing her hands , and crying out to the neighbors to save her home . But the bravest of those who were looking on would not have dared to cross the torrent ; or could they have come over , little could have been done for the protection of the chalet . A green knoll , which was fast washing ' away by the force of the water , still diverted the current from the foundatkm walls of the chalet . The barrier might hold out an hour longer. ; if it went wholly , there was no hope for the chalet in which I had taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's distress , her husband was with his flock upon a higher slope of the mountains , where the storm seemed even fiercer .. The neighbors had seen the bodies of sheep and goats go floating down in the wreck of the torrent . The poor herdsman himself might be in danger . From time to time , moreover , there was heard the crash of trees and of timbers from below , telling dreadful stories of wrecked chalets further down . " I shall never forget the grouping of the peasants , men , women , and children , upon the other side of // this storm-torrent , shouting and running here and there , as the gleams of lightning played over the frightened crowd . Beyond , too , and beyond the trees which glittered in the blaze and the wet , I could see the heights of the snow-mountains upon the other side of the Lake of Geneva , shining for a moment , as they shine by day , and then buried in the rain and the night . The lake itself , too , caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the storm . " With myMackintosh thrown overmy shoulders , and my felt hat dripping streams , I passed an hour looking on anxiously as the rest . After this the storm happily abated its force . The torrent grew less angry in its flow ; the chalet of my hostess was out of danger . I left the mountain people grappling with the timbers which still came down with the current ; and , to the lullaby of thunder echoing still among the mountains , and dying away in hoarse murmurs on the lake below , I fell asleep once more . " And this was the mountain-psalm I told you of . " When morning came , the sun was as soft as a valley summer ; but the wreck of the fields and the crops was terrific . Whole acres of what was smiling greensward the night before , were *ow swept away . Uprooted trees lay across the paths ; and often the paths themselves were gone ; and I was compelled to grope my way through the muddied bottom of a ravine , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was what they call a cloud-break in the mountains ; and as offering something different from the everyday journalings of a foot-traveler in Switzerland , I have thought it worth my while to jot it down for you . " Afterthis , shall I saynny thingof the pealafrom the great organ of Friburg , which I listened to , two days after , and which are reckoned the loudest that come from any church instrument of Central Europe ? The storm ( as the organist played it ) would have been grand , had It not come so near the greater one of my night in the chalet . I fear I hardly did justice to die organist of Friburg ; I know I paid him his fee as if he had not earned his money . " The diligence which goes from Vevay to Berne , stops a half hour at Friburg , and the passengers dine there . Like all stage-coach meals this is a very hurried one ; and had I not booked ' myself in advance , and dined at my leisure , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diligence dinner at Friburg . As it was , I amused myself with the hurry of the coach people , when the conductor gave the word to set off leaving a fat French lady and a cool couple of English travelers in the heat of dessert . As you go out of Friburg , on the way to Berne , there is a swinging hridge of iron cables to be passed over , which hangs some two hundred feet above a ravine , and shakes with the weight of a diligence in a way to scare nervous people exceedingly . " Now we had but half got over this tremulous roadway , when the cool English couple came shouting after , followed by the fat French lady , who had seized upon a half-emptied bottle of wine , gesticulating and puffing in a way that put all the diligence company in a roar . " The coachman cracked his whip ; the Englishman and wife screamed in terrible French phrase ; the fat lady brandished her bottle threateningly ; the bridge undulated more and more under the quickened step of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor ordered the coachman to draw up upon the other side of the ravine . " And here again there was an unexpected trouble ; the English woman was booked ' for a place beside her husband in the beaquette upon the top of the diligence ; there was no ladder by which she could mount ; she tried the wheel and a boost ' of the conductor ; but it was in vain . The husband mounted before her and tried the effect of a lift ; but she was too heavy . " But , my dear , you must get up , ' said the husband . " But , my dear , I cea't , ' said the woman in de. - spair . " But , my dear , make an effort . ' " But , my dear , I lzeve ' ( crescendo ) . " In short , the matter could only be arranged by an amicable compromise with some of the parties inside , by which the unfortunate English lady was separated from her husband until the next stage . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near neighborhood of the fat lady , who had made good her short dinner by bearing off the bottle of wine . She was eloquent in her denunciations of the thieving propensities of hotel-keepers ; it was all an arrangement , she was satisfied , with the conductor , by which people , after paying , should be despoiled of their dinner . For her own part , she was not to be abused in that way ; she always made amends for a hurried dinner ( as one might have judged from her rotund figure ) . If she preferred chicken , she took chicken ; if wine , she took wine : and here drawing gracefully a little patent-leathei* cup from her reticule , she poured out a glass , and drank it off as composedly as she could have doa* at the table of our host . " I like these little diligence meetings of travel ; they open a world of character to the eye ; they put an edge on one 's habit of &amp;bservation ; they make droll memories for after-dinner laughs at a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Even in Switzerland they have a project of tapping the Alps ' with a railway tunnel . The engineers are out . Their crimson bunting is flying on the heights . The subscription-books are open at Basle . " They talk of a ten-mile tunnel not far away fromthePassofSt.Bernard ; andtheroadisto wind along the Upper Rhone , between the sombre , death-like cliffs , and among the wretched cretins and goitres of Sion , and afterward to burrow under the hospice , and to bring its convoy to day again in sight of Aosta and the beautiful and decrepit Italy . " But , thank Heaven , years must slip before this work is done ; and you will have time to heat your mule by moonlight , on the zigzag path that cunducts to the hospitable door of the monks before the monks and the dogs are driven away from their mountain employ . " Among the as dits of the Swiss summer , is the rumor of the imprisonment of an American traveler , who was arrested and ccmfined on suspicion of being no less a personage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of the mistake was not so far flattered by the error as to rest contented with the dungeon durance ; and in addition to our other diplomatic negotiations , we have now afoot the claims for false imprisonment upon the lielvetic Republic . It would be odd indeed itt , some fine day , the Cyane , or some such vessel , should // be dispatched up the Rhine , for the blockade of Basle and the Alps ! " When I was at Chamouni , people were talking of the new ascent of Mont Blanc by an English lady , the third who ever accomplished this task ; and who did it ( the guides said ) without flurry or fatigue . Albert Smith has , I see , alluded to the matter in a complimentary way , in his closing lecture-room ascent ' for the season , and interested his auditors by announcing the fact that the intrepid woman had honored him that evening with her presence . Of course all eyes were turned to the box of honor ( formed by a Swiss window in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady received the applause of the evening . " The romantic danger that of old belonged to the ascent seems now wholly to have gone by ; people speak of it only ( atChamouni ) as an expensive and doubtful gratification : expensive , because a dozen guides must be well tempted with fees ; and doubtful , because a clear evening in these high neighborhoods may be followed by mist and darkness . " The lady in question reported a charming view ; and so did a young English traveler who repeated the journey a fortnight after . And if one may judge from what meets the eye in looking from the lesser height of the Breven , the view must be grand indeed . I suspect that , by dint of cordage and ladders deposited here and there in safe nooks of the rocks , they will arrive in time at an easy way of carrying people of tender nerves to the top of the monarch ; and when that day comes , and supplies of the white Neuchatel or of Molit are frequent , I may be myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , in Switzerland ; and they have had , the summer past , their usual flow of-salts and of people . But they are generally of the cast of St. Ronan 's Well-gone-by Places , whose lamentable history is writ , not by Scott , but by stories of gray moss and lichen , on crumbling roofs . Yet they are curious enough places to visit , to see what kind of invalid race still clings to the traditionary virtue of the mouutain waters . First of all there is St. Gervais , which you reach by going to the right a little way off from the traveled track which leads people from Geneva to Chamouni . It is a wild cleft in the mountains , with a longsided house dismally shaded by the reeking cliffs , and faint , pale garden grounds lingering around it , under the short play of a mid-day sun . Decrepit old men and women go there to drink in health and strength ; gay young Swiss bourgeois people too , in the mirth of new matrimony , wander to St. Gervais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain paths which lead high up on the hills that shadow the springs . " Riotous young fellows with knapsacks , singing German songs over their after-breakfast Altenheimer , clink their glasses at the table of mine host of the St. Gervais , and plot hair-brained scrambles to the glaciers that gleam , cold and grim , atop the St. Gervais mountains . " It is a place withal , to visit once , but not to linger at , unless you would replace dyspepsia with rheumatic twinges and the blue devils . " On the Simplon road again ( or a little way off from it to the left ) , is the queer spring ' place of Leuk . Every body has heard of it , and a great many have passed through the town , on their way across the wild pass of the Gemini , which rises straight up the rocks within a league of the watercourses which give renown to Leuk . The noticeable thing ( medicinally ) about the springs is their warmth ; and they gush as warm from the earth as an egg-boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village on either side the road in a way quite curious to behold . " When I first saw the phenomenon , I thought all the town world had just emptied their kettles ; bat presently I saw a group of stout-armed women at a village trough-all steaming-washing their foul linen in the kettle-water of nature 's furnishing . One would think washing might be cheap ; but my bill of the Leuk-Bedea says-no . " The bath-houses are matters worth seeing : people go to them , not to bathe but to sock . The physicians prescribe variously , as ages or constitutions vary , three and four , and even five hours . And people make a frolic of the healing , and wear coquettish water-gowns , and have floating tables round them , and sit in conclave , buried to their chins , and chatting , and doing needle-work , and reading newspapers , and drinking cherry-rum punches . " A queer place , very , is Leak . " Then there is a Swiss Baden not far away from Zurich , a very pretty place indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and high *green hills towering about it , from whence , looking off in fine weather , you can see that glorious array of white mountain heights which are before your eyes at Zurich . It is a charming place to linger at , with unobtrusive people in the great spring house , who allow you to gang your own gate , ' and meet you in the hill paths with a kindly look of recognition . By a charming bit of railway  --  the only hit Switzerland yet boasts of-you can go from this village to the laughing shores of Zurich , and eat such a dinner at the Hotel Baur as would delight a hungry man in the best city in the world . " If you'come , be sure and take lodgings in the house that sits in a garden on the very edge of the lake . Such a place for saunter as it is-that garden-with the mountains all stretching in crystal chain before you , and the flowers flaming and scattering perfume at your elbow , is not found otherwheres in Europe ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . You go there by the way of Constance , and the memory of the Constance martyrs . It lies near to Ragatz , in a German-talking country , far up a hrook course , which they call the Tamina , and the baths are the Baths of Pfeffers . ' You seem going out of the world when you go there , and wholly out when you arrive there . A little , narrow chcr-*t-banc road leads along the banks of the stream , th:ough a *iim ravine , all shaded by firs and dank foliage . Nor is there lack of danger to sublime ' this one-horse drive , for your wheel frets here and there the edge of a precipice , beneath which , a hundred feet , the Tamina goes raging uneasily among the fallen rocks ; and the hill-side , too , threatens every moment to dislodge black fragments of trap to crush you , or hurry you into the bottom of the defile . Jets of waterfalls race down in clefts , a ad spatter you with spray , and dive under deep culverts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With such accompaniments , making very dreary music , you reach at last a moss-covered old building , seated under the very shoulder of the rock ; and at the extreme end of the defile . The sun only reaches it two hours of the longest days of summer , and it is damp winter there even in later August . // " A few hopeful and hobbling invalids move a*bout the sunken floors of the hobgoblin house , like relics . They bathe thrice a day in wooden tubs , and the walls all reek with the drip of the cliffis nud the year long shadiness . " If you would see the springs , you must take a lantern and a Mackintosh , and follow a wheezing guide into the heart of the mountain . A wild cleft makes the portal by which you enter . A crazy wooden staging makes your uncertain pathway . The Tarnina , raging and foaming , you see forty feet below you ; and only a glimpse of sky through the cleft , a thousand feet above you . The sides are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk on is only hung against the side by oaken brackets that quiver with your weight . As you go on , lantern in hand , the cleft narrows , so as scarce to leave room for the crazy bridge . Still the Tamina is roaring forty feet below you ; and the skylight is utterly shut off by the foliage on the top of the mountain . " On you go , feeling your way on the slippery and shaking planks ; the air full of the noise of rushing waters , and the darkness growing deeper and deeper . Presently you feel a puff of hot steam on your face that half blinds you . The guide takes your hand , steadies your footing , tells you to be bold , and fumbling at a padlock , unlocks a wooden door in the side of the cleft , and shows you the boiling source which supplies the bath tubs of the Pfeffers Hotel . " He screams in your ear to tell you of its warmth ; the steam blinds you ; the bats flap around the lanterns ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sight of sky again , with a hearty feeling of gratitude . " I took a bath at Pfeffers *nd a lunch ; then I climbed the side of the gorge by a rude foot-path ; and by the hour of sunset , was where I could see a mountain horizon thirty miles away . I would not advise hypochondriacato go to the baths of Pfeffers . " What a gay , lightsome change from all this , to the charming walks of Baden-Baden ! And what a contrast with the hobgoblin people of Pfeffers , did the ladies make who sat at the table d'hôte of the pleasant Hotel de Russie ! " Of all the mid-Europe places to loiter in , through a season of sunny idleness* give me BadenBaden . People imagined ( as I said ) that the summers war would take off the edge of its merriment , and the fullness from the houses ; but the place was never merrier , and never fuller than through the season which closes with the great victory of Alma , and the fall of the Russian power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Alboni lending her great voice ) , and torchlight processions through the woods that clothe the hills , in honor of some princely fbte ; and there have been brilliant crowds at the tables of roulette and of tremste et an ( among them figuring the pale head and fine features of the unworthy son of the greatest Englishman of his time ) ; beside all , there has been the usual qsaetuas of piquant gossip . Among the rest , they tell us of a chance marriage , which closed the season in true romantic fashion . The bride a widow ; the groom a prince and millionaire ( for a German ) . The last owned a pretty villa outside the town ; a few miles of country road , often driven over , led to it . The widow , in company with cousins and other kin , chanced to pass it one day , early after her arrival . " She did not know its occupant , nor did she know the envious stories of the prince 's selfishness and of his misanthropy . Her companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed under the shadow of a pretty pavilion which crowned the garden gateway , of the taste which ruled the place , and of the enviable lot of whomso-. ever might possess it . " The widow ( who was pretty ) was loudest in her praises , and grew warm in her jealous zeal to know who might be the happy owner of such a suburban paradise . She ventured the suggestion that all of its parterres were wasted upon some lonely-living bachelor , who had no right thus to cut off the fairest part of humanity from a share in the beauties his wealth and taste had created . " The friends rallied her  --  the proprietor , concealed behind the curtain of his pavilion , overheard her . He watched her fine figure as the group moved on . He grew curious in his turn . The voice was a charming voice ; the motion was graceful ; the dress was tasteful ; he followed and traced the party unperceived to their lodgings . " Through the ready ralets de place he pressed his inquiries ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as exterior of his charming lodge without the town ; and in a month , the quidnuac world of Baden was startled by the announcement that the Prince - was presently to marry the blooming Madame and the bachelor establishment without the town to receive a mistress . " I give you the matter as it was told to me . I know only that the villa . - is a pretty one ; and that blooming widows at the tables of Baden are neither rare nor coy . " You know , perhaps , that our matter of excursion trains ' has found its way into European habit ; and there are companies in Paris which advertise ( or did the summer past ) to carry travelers to the Rhine , , to allow them a week of driving about , upon certain given routes , and then to take them safely back to Paris , either by Brussels or Strasbourg , for a very moderate sum . Thousands have availed themselves of this the season past , and half the French travelers you met with in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the party was crushed , of course nothing was to pay . " A still wider excursion was projected , and , I believe , carried out , in virtue of which parties to the traveling compact were conducted , under the advices of an accomplished courier , to the Great Exhibition of Munich , were furnished with seats at the Opera two nights in the week , were carried over the Tyrol to Prague-given a sight of Dresden and the Elbe-furnished with meals and lodgings at the best hotels-offered free use of the bathm* at Hombourg and Wiesbaden , and landed again at their doors in Paris for a certain fixed sum , surprisingly small . " Will not some enterprising firm in your city take the matter up , and organize , next year , a European excursion , to take nervous people throughout England and France-clear their luggage-pay their bills-talk their Frencb*provide their guides - see to their passports asid purchases-for a sum known and measurable at the outset ? Could not bachelors be put down , for the belle season , at a thousand dollars apiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were limited to five trunks and four bandboxes ? // You know before this , of course , that Rachel , the great tragedienne , is certainly going to America ; and wisat , pray , do you think of her probable success ? Will people make her the fashion ? If not , I fear there is little hope for her . " She is great to be sure , and always will be , ulsile her vigor lasts ; but it seems essential that auditors should have some reasonable knowledge of what a tragedian is saying . Will those whose cars are apt to catch French be enough to supply her with houses ? or will the furor be so great as to draw in those who know nothing of it ? " I saw , the other evening , a stout , sensible man ( American ) , with a stout and ( I dare say ) sensible wife , leave their seats at the Tliegtre Fran*eis , in the middle of one of her choicest performances , with a vacant air on their faces-as if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy Hocquet 's hats . I fear there will be a good many jobbers at New York who will stare vacantly on the plays their daughters may decoy them to . " It is the fashion here , specially among the English , to decry Rachel 's performance of modern tragedy-as if the cold classicism of Racine 's rhyme were all she should ever utter . I hope this sort of affectation will not belong to the newspaper writers with you ; and that she will be appreciated most warmly where appreciation is most natural-in those plays which express passion in honest prose , and in the hearty language which French people use to-day . " A spicy writer of the Paris ! eeilietoas deplores and condemns the action of Rachel , in going , for ever so short a time , among that dollar-people , who made fools of themselves over Elssler and Jenny Lind , and who do not speak French . ' " Can the paragraphist be aimiun a blow at our diplomatic brotherhood ? " Another matter of mention you may have remarked in the journals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of George Sand , ' written by herself . The world was expecting in it a deal of scandal , and has been sharply on the look out for months past ; but thus far she does not promise to gratify them . She writes , like all French people , in evident good humor with herself , and applies her subtle analytic power to the fathoming of her own passions and actions . Aside from this , and Lamartine 's new History of Turkey , there is nothing to put an inkline about , in the whole range of Paris letters . 4*The returning world ( from the summer resorts ) is now fairly back in its old place . Here and there signs of mourning for the dead in the Crimea are visible ; but oftenest these signs are confined to humble life and far-away homes in the provinces . " The beeu-mossde of Paris does not furnish battie-heroes ; and the only army-man of that class who is talked of now , is a young lieutenant , who has just startled all staid mammas by marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of them , are full in these coming wet nights of later autumn . Even the talk of Chantilly , where the English horses were worstod , is dying away in the mention of balls and of intrigues . Flaming equipages have multiplied , and jockeys in blue and silver delight the maids and their masters . " Country houses of England are full of gay company , riotous with pheasant shooting and dintiers that last till midnight . London is deserted , ave of strangers ; and there is little promise of returning gayety for a year to come-so heavily hangs the war-list of slain and wounded upon the hearts and the homes of thousands . " But you , across the water , with your fevers , and cholera , and shipwrecks , and storms , and money crashes , have had your sorrows too ; and the European summer , take it all in all , has worn more constant gayety than the home one which has broken on me in letters-Adieu.
