ART . P1. - RELATIONS OF CHRISTIANITY TO THE DOCTRINE OF NATURAL RIGHTS. * IN former times , in what may perhaps be called the lwst times of our republic , a doctrine of human rights , which placed all men on a common level of justice , was almost universally received , and by none more than by the most conservative class in Society-thoughtful and educated Christians . It is well known that many who were averse to a free suffrage , who regarded the admission even of all native born citizens to the ballot box as dangerous to the stability of our institutions , opposed slavery with all their might as a violation of natural justice . On these principles too all our declarations of right proceed , as the only hypothesis known within our borders , or recognized by our political writers . All our constitutions involve this same notion of equality , and it is so deep in the convictions of th' people , that a change of feeling in this direction would be equivalent to a change in our theory of government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not long survive the theory on which they rest . Such has been the prevalence , we might almost say the universality of the doctrine of natural , inalienable rights in this country . It was acknowledged by both federalists and democrats ; the only difference was that some did not deduce from it the right of all to have a part in the government , while others opened this privilege , also , to all classes , poor and rich , foreign born and natives . But this unquestioning reception of our fathers ' theory of natural rights has come to an end . Some have abandoned it in favor of the vague and profligate doctrine of a certain good of the greatest number , to which the individual and what he holds most sacred must be sacrificed , as if there could be any good apart from justice . Others seem to hold that there is no justice apart from the legal and existing // order of things , and that slavery or any other wrong , however undesirable if it could be prevented at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a sanction . As if law itself could not be unjust , and justice ought not to go before laws and dictate what they shall be . Others are in a state of doubt : they are afraid of the result to which the doctrine of natural rights would lead . It is upheaving and revolutionary in the State , it is too violent and blind a force to be set free , and so they modify or control it . Others still seem to look upon this theory as the natural enemy of Christianity , the offspring of French infidelity , which it needs all the conservative power of religion , property and institutions to keep down , as a kind of gaseous abstraction opposed to the order and practical spirit which the Gospel favors . In this state of opinion , while some are throwing away the old truths which lie at the foundation of our IRepublic , and others are looking on them with suspicion , it may be well to inquire whether there is any good reason for deserting the grouild which our Fathers occupied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is it friendly to Christianity ? What are the attitudes towards one another of these mighty powers , which , if hostile , must come into a ruinous conflict of opinions and interests ? If according to the Christian theory of man there are no natural rights , let us throw them away , and find some solid rock of truth on which our politics can be supported . If there are natural rights , they can not be unfriendly to Christianity , for two departments of truth can not be at variance ; but they may need the help of religion to steer the country , which acknowledges them , clear of disorder and perversion ; they may be misunderstood or misapplied , and a sound Christian conscience may be needed to point out the mistake . We propose in this Article to attempt to show that there is an aflinity between the genius of religion and the doctrine of natural rights ,  --  that these latter are no growth of an age of infidels and demagogues , ( although they have been imputed to one in whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the natural conclusion at which Christian minds // landed , when in the light of the Gospel they looked on the capacities of man and on his destination . There is , however , a doctrine , or a form of expressing the doctrine of natural rights , which is not of Christian* origin , but has passed through the smelting furnace of infidelity , before it was made known to the world . As this doctrine views man , he comes into society from a state of isolation ; where , like a separate atom , he was disconnected from all of his kind , and where , by necessity , he was entire master of his own actions . This state of sovereign liberty is the state of nature , and the right , which a state of society has to snpersede this primordial state , grows ont of the mutual concessions of its members . Or , if the theory thns announced is too violently at war with the facts of the family condition , and with the earliest history of mankind , it is softened down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be deduced . It is argued from what an individual would have a right to do and must needs do in a state of human existence anterior to law and the state , what ought to be his prerogatives in the state and under law ,  --  both what his private rights are in an equal distribution of justice and what is his just share of power in the organized society . Such an hypothesis is rejected by the Christian philosopher , and still more energetically is that state of nature denied which takes no account of tjm family and of the God of the family . The Christian looks at society under law as the normal and natural condition of man ; at rights , as deductions from man 's free responsible nature , from his creation in the image of Gcd , and from his destination for this life in the world among his fellows , as well as for life eternal ; and at obligations , the perpetual correlatives of rights , as the most important feature in the doctrine of rights , which , when acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when expressed in law bind all the parts of society together by the regulative spirit of justice . To him , therefore , the individual in society is no more an atom than the child in the family , or the member in the Church rights , in fact , he regards as the cement by which society is held together . There is also an inference from a doctrine of natural rights , // which the Christian man does not feel himself obliged to admit . We refer to that theory of political power which derives it all from the renounced rights and free compact of individuals entering into society , and which wages war with revolutionary zeal against all governments under any other kind of constitution . This theory lies outside of our present subject , and we name it only because its defiant attitude towards the powers that be , throws a prejudice upon the doctrine from which it professes to be drawn . We can not call it unchristian , for many Christian men have given to it their sanction . We can not call it Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government which subsists , if it maintains the principles of justice . We can not for ourselves receive it as a correct exposition of the relations of the individual towards the State , nor can we feel that in all stages of human development , and forms of society , the State is to be constructed after the same fashion . That the individual should have guarantees for his rights , and power enough to secure himself from oppression , is all important . But that he ought to have power in the State , because a government can not otherwise be just , we do not believe . That in his zeal to acquire such power he should be willing to overthrow the bulwarks of private rights , and create for himself a tyranny of the majority , or a tyranny of an elected despot , is a melancholy proof of the readiness of mankind to sacrifice substance for show , to grasp at a boon , which gratifies their pride and love of power at the risk of destroying the most precious institutions of society . Having removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the doctrine of natural rights harmonize . In the first place , then , they take the same view of man as a free re8ponsible creature of God . IReligion is something more than morals , but there could be no religion without morals . If man were not a free responsible creature of God , plainly he could not perform those religious acts which imply past sin , or the possibility of future sin , such as repentance , faith in a Saviour , and resistance to temptation . The Scriptures are not less a book founded on the conception of man 's voluntary moral nature , than a book founded // on the idea of the one holy , infinite God . The holiness of God in fact we conceive of and estimate through our moral nature . In order to restore holiness in us , he feaches us strict morality , first outward , then inward ; and reveals himself first in his holiness , then in his love . There is no reaching this higher idea of love , nor attaining to the purity and inwardness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From wrong actions recognized we sinners pass to wrong desires and motives , until discovering the uncleanness of our nature , we are ready for the iRedeemer and the Sanctifier . Descending now to the sphere of natural rights , we find that they take the same view of man . The rights which a man possesses are his power or freedom of action , within a certain province for which God has destined him . They are called natural , not because they came with him from a state of nature anterior to law or society , but because they are deducible from the nature which God has given him ,  --  a nature which prompts , and by the facts of birth and kindred necessitates a multitude of persons to live together in society . They are thus God 's law written on man , enabling him to form communities of orderly , peaceable equals . If each member of society had desire and a feeling of power only , there could be no society , but such war as ilobbes imagines ,  --  universal selfishness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan for self-preservation . But with desire and power is implanted in each breast a sense of obligation or feeling of justice . There is no right without a corresponding obligation if the right in us involves an obligation in all others to respect our right , it is certain that a right in each one of them involves a corresponding obligation in us . Thus all the parts of society are interlaced with one another ; and thus for every right we have , we have myriads of obligations to our fellows . It is moreover certain that every other must have substantially the same rights and obligations with ourselves ; for all have the same freedom , the same nioral nature , the same social nature , the same general destination . It is plain also , that the notion of rights is such , that he in whom they inhere must decide whether he will use them or waive the use . If we have property , we are not as a matter of // course obliged to use it , or to use it in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fellow men in the use of it ; - that the doctri*ne of rights itself forbids . Beyond this it says nothing , but hands us over to the higher morality ,  --  to the law of benevolence , to our sense of duty to God . Thus then this right , and in like manner , every other , requires us to be free , and lays on us with freedom , which is power , a fearful responsibility . It is worth remarking , as illustrative of the sanction which the Scriptures give to natural rights , that some of the most important of them are expressly recognized in the law-book of the Old Testament , and in the most solemn manner . The decalogue in one commandment sanctions the patriapotestas , in another the marriage tie , in others , gives security to human life , to property , and to the right of reputation . It is to be ob*erved too , that in these commands , as well as in the conception of man , on which the doctrine of human rights is built , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind , is taken into view . The Scripture does not say that you may kill a slave but not a freeman , or that the great man may despoil the small , but the small may not steal from the great ; but it has the same law for all , and puts all on one level of justice . By fair implication too , the rights which it contemplates are universal . " Thou shalt not commit adultery** implies the universal right of contracting marriage ; " honor thy father and thy mother , " implies that no force from without shall prevent the free exercise of such honor ,  --  so long , at least , as the parents fulfill the end for which they were made parents . One is tempted to go farther still , and say that " thou shalt not steal " implies the universality of the right of acquiring and retaining property , that the notion of a man who can steal but can not acquire something as his own by honest means , who is hedged around by obligations but defenseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandments . But however this be , the common nature of man impresses on a true doctrine of natural rights the character of equality and reciprocity . Here our subj ect might lead us to an other point of contact between the Scriptures and natural rights : // we might consider the analogy between the brotherhood of Christians and of men , as revealed in the Bible , and the equality of men before the bar of natural justice . This topic , however , must be treated in its place hereafter . At present we content ourselves with saying , that a common nature and a common destiny demand that none ought to be restricted in their freedom by social iustitutions ,  --  that they allow of no reason why participants of the same nature should not , as to their rights , be put on one platform . It has been said , in order to avoid the conclusion that rights are universal , that they are determined by duties , and grow out of them , and that , as duties vary with conditions in life , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that rights are prior to duties in the logical order , and determine them . At least the one are as old as the other . Thus , for example , conceive of an order of beings in whom there was no desire of property , and no acquisition by labor . All the duties which depend on the existence of property would be unknown , and equally so all those obligations of contract which presuppose it . Take any other kind of right , and with its extinction you will dry up some other fountain of duties . Carry the same process through all the rights , and it is manifest that you have very greatly abridged the department of morals . It is manifest also that you have at the same time shut off most of the relations between man and man , and that society has nearly come to an end . Rights and obligations there are in the present social system , the very starting point , and the prerequisite , not only for a society under law , but for a moral society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights are at one in their view of man as a free responsible being , we by no means intend to place them on the same level . The one in its moral precepts reaches to all the relations of man ,  --  we might say to all conceivable relations , for the law of love is as old , as wide , and as lasting as the universe . The other has a very limited sphere ,  --  the social life of man in this world , and not the whole of that . The one penetrates to the core of actions , and sits in judgment on the inward motive . // The other is content if the external obligation is conformed to , and asks for nothing more . The worst of men as really fulfills his contract , when he fulfills it , as the best . But although thus humble in its sphere , the doctrine of natural rights , by being the condition of all just society , is the condition of all morality and religion . It thus shows its kindred to religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking up man as a social and moral being , it enables him to form a society , where morals and social order can furnish a soil in which religion may grow . It is a provision of Divine wisdom , for the same nature to which religion appeals . IT . We proceed to say that Christianity and the doctrine of natural ri*jihts both recogmi*e the importance of th' individual . This is a thought akin to the last , but in advance of it , for the value of personality results from our freedom and responsibility , and from their bearings on our undying nature . Now as to the individual viewed in the light of Christianity , is it not evident that the whole power of this immense spiritual agent is spent , in the first instance , in arousing the consciousness of sin , and the need of redemption in a single breast ; that purified society proceeds only from the influences which persons wield ; and that the Church exists not for its own sake , but for that of its separate members ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conscience , produces an independence of character , so that the single man feels that he must do right , although the whole world is against him ; and in its appeals to the intellect makes him feel that the truth , by which he is to stand or fall for eternity , is within his reach ; and in its appeal to the feeling8 , makes a little world of experiences and intercourse with God within him , which are eminently his own ? Is it not evident , too , that all the civilizing efficacy of Christianity begins in sanctifying pers6nal centers of influence , who do good with a power unfelt before , and whose opinion , by modifying law , purifying the social system , and giving rise to new institutions of good , will carry blessings down to future ages ? To this obvious influence of Christianity on the individual , that of the doctrine of natural rights corresponds . Each mem // ber of society has now an existence for his own sake : he is an end in himself , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual feels that he has a realm of his own which society and his fellows may not invade , so he feels that he may not invade the ec*uahly sacred rights of others . His destiny , which was obscure to him while he was unconscious of his rights , is now cleared up : he has , or ought to have , power to play an important part in the world . A being so free to choose , so responsible for choices , so capable of energetic action , if nnimpeded so capable of improvement , must not be nipped in the bud by institutions of injustice ; and if lie have a fair chance , can not fail to act a part corresponding to that to which Christianity calls him . It is obvious , too , that the consciousness of power and worth in the individual , which both the causes in question cherish , must in the end have an effect on the form and sentiments of society . Let there be a barbaric despotism , in which no value is attached to man , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some size be Christianized , and imbued with a sense of individual rights . The people here can no more be treated like a flock of sheep . The government will be overawed by them , and will grant them privileges answering to their estimate of their due , or else will attempt to oppress , and so doing will provoke them into resistance . As soon as a society is deeply pervaded by the feeling of the worth of the soul , of the value of man , it can not continue degraded : its destiny , as marked out by its nature and its Author , is so glaringly opposed to the institutions of an oppressive government , that there must arise a conflict or a concession . christianity and the doctrine of natural rights , taking this view of the importance of the individual , must both repudiate the ancient opinion that the State was the end , and the individual the means . If the individual has no rights , the only question for society is how to dispose of him , so as best to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is desirable that he should be ignorant , should not marry , or hold property , he may be controlled in these respects ; and if his welfare is incompatible with that of the community , it may be sacrificed // without compunction . No wrong is done him , no reparation is due . It is obvious that in such a system there is no morality . The end of the State itself can be only happiness , and not justice ; its system can be guided only by expediency , and not by a feeling of obligation . It must therefore overlook all moral training which the welfare of the community does not render essential , and aim principally at physical prosperity and self-defense . Religion must equally be a means in such a State , as we see that it was in the most civilized States of antiquity . That such a system is abhorrent both to Christian feelings and to the sense of personal rights , must be apparent . The ancients were pardonable for putting the State before the individual , for it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalted motives from gods without morality , or from religions ignorant of man 's true destiny ? When w* read in Aristotle , that " no citizen ought to think himself his own , but that all belong to the State , for each is a part of the State , and the attention paid to each part ought to look towards the care of the whole , " we see , indeed , in such sentiments , a fruitful source of patriotic self-devotion , as well as a stimulus for the State to train up all its inhabitants with a reference to its own perpetuity and glory . We can conceive that instances of sublime heroism may start up befor* our eyes , all along the course of Greek and Roman history , until it is swamped in irreligion and a**thy . But compare with this , as a training for the inhabitant of a State , the doctrine of an infinite , holy God-who is in truth an end in himself ,  --  of a future life , and of immutable morality and justice , which may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does man amid such truths emerge from his earthly nature , and place a crown on his head , as a being whom all civic and all religious virtue conspire to make illustrious ? It is worth remarking here that the rights of individuals were never fully recognized nor embodied in their codes of law by the ancients ; the reason of which seems to be that they started in their science of government from the State , and took no account of individuals. * If the citizen , as at Rome // in its best days , had high prerogatives , such as the right of appeal to the people , and exemption from scourging , * they were owing more to a proud feeling of his dignity , proceeding from the grandeur of the State , than to a conviction of his inherent claims . Philosophers speculated of couirse , then as now , concerning natural fitness , and said many true things upon the order of society , as pointed out by nature , but if we mistake not , all this had no influence on legislation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no true theory of natural society was woven together . The old division of the Roman law was intoju8 gentium and fa8 civile , the latter being that which is peculiar to Rome , the former that which obtains , in conformity with a common principle of reason , among all nations ,  --  or , practically , among all nations known to the Romans . Ulpian , the great lawyer under Alexander Severns , introduced another division into jus naturale , jus gentiurn and jus civile . Here , at a distance , something promising appears before us There seems to be a progress in science , perhaps from the latent working of the Christian leaven . But how are we disappointed , when this jus naturale is defined to be " that which nature has taught all animals , " which is " not peculiar to the human race , but belongs to all living things which are born in the sky , on earth , or in the sea . " t A most barren division , introduced into Justinian 's institutions , but used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being removed from the province of morality . Thus , then , the natural right of the Romans recognizes no natural rights of men , as we understand them ; and thejus gentium does not embrace our law of nations , which is founded on the natural rights of communities of men . How strikingly it shows the affinity between truth and the doctrine of natural rights , that nowhere else , save in the bosom of Christianity , has this doctrine grown into a science ; while the feeling of justice , where Christianity prevails , runs beyond the State , embracing all Christian nations , and promising to embrace all nations whatsoever under one benevolent and righteous system of law . By the Porciaji law . j Justin , Inst. i , Tit. 2. // III . In the third place , the teachings of the Scriptures , concerning the dignity of man , and the exalted position of the Ghristian , favor the doctrine f natural right , and in fact render such a theory a necessity . It is quite remarkable , on the first view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitude of God , before whom all nations are as nothing , and the dignity of human nature , should be taught in the same book . One would expect to find the littleness and insignificance of mau inferred from the greatness of God ; or would look to a heathen religion , where the divinities are human conceptions , for the exaltation of man , rather than to the religion of the Scriptures . But it is far otherwise in fact . Where the idea of God has shrunk in its dimensions , there man is proportionally reduced ; and where God is magnified , his works share in his honor . This estimate of man begins in the oldest records of inspiration . He is made in the image of God , and for that reason his life is sacred . The beast may be slaughtered or used as a drudge without his consent , but he who wears the image of his Maker has a right to live . his destination confers on him prerogatives which animal life , brute force , instinct , can not claim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of God stamped on man , and how , when the rights of such a being are denied or invaded , can impiety fail to be added to injustice ? This stamp of likeness to God gives hi in an imperial character among the inhabitants of this world . " Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands : thou hast put all things under his feet . " Such is man , the sinner and sufferer , throughout his tribes in all his darkness . But when , in order to train up fallen man for filling this his true position on the earth , God revealed himself to a favored people , what does h&amp;*all them ? " If ye will obey my voice indeed , ye shall be a kingdom of priests , and a holy nation . " This dignity however is surpassed by that of the Christian , as was to be expected from the central truth of the incarnation , for what honor could be shown to man 's nature greater than the appearance of the Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who loved them and washed them from sins , kings and priests unto God // and his Father : they are the sons of God , brethren of Christ , partakers of the Divine nature . They are to judge the world , to jndge angels , to be as the angels of God in heaven . Such are some of the declarations of a most sober book . flow plain is the inference that the members of a Christian community ought not to be stripped of their rights by the State , and stilt more that one part of such a community ought not to be enslaved by the other . The abuse of such teachings shows their tendency . When Korah lifted up the standard of rebellion against Moses and Aaron , his doctrine , which he urged in justification- " that all the congregation are holy , every one of them " - was true , although his defense of his conduct was unsound . And so the leveling doctrines which arose after the Reformation and during the English commonwealth , although as false as Antinomianism , rested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community of Christians ought not to be oppressed . It may be said 4hat the passages in the Old Testament which confer so much honor on man are to be taken in an ideal sense , as descriptions of man not as he is , but as he was made to be ; as also that the high privileges of the Christian are of a spiritual nature , so that the lowest slave may be a king and priest unto God . This is true , but it is equally true that the idea of humanity is the point which man ought to have the power of reaching in a free development . Everything therefore which obstructs such a development is a violence to nature . But the deprivation of rights is eminently such an obstruction . If we can reason from the image of God in man , as Scripture does , against killing him like a brute animal , may we not against using him as a chattel . If according to his right by creation he is lord over the earth , if it is true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , his charter of rights is made out in some very essential particulars : he may hold property , but may not be held as property , unless the aim of God in his creation be lawlessly counteracted . It is quite true again that the Christian may be a king and // priest unto God in the absence of all civil rights . But the question must arise , as soon as a man takes such texts of Scripture to be more than empty hyperboles , whether there is not a gross inconsistency between such a state of privilege and a depression in human society down almost to the level of the brute . And the absurdity would be the greater because the Christian character qualified those who had it for the exercise of every right which man can enjoy . The practical tendency of such ideas as the Scriptures inculcate concerning the dignity of man , may be illustrated by a passage from the Testament of Theodore Studita , an influential monk in Constantinople of the ninth century . Addressing his successor in the monastery of Studium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either for domestic purposes , or for the labors of husbandry , seeing he is a man made in God 's image . " * IV . lihe teachings of Scripture in regard to the lrotherhood of mankind and the eqaality of privilege among Christians are in sympathy with the notion of the equality of personal rights . The brotherhood of mankind springs from the facts of one God , a common progenitor , a common nature and a common gospel . When that gospel is so far believed as to induce the formation of a Christian Church , the members are equal in privilege within their community . They form a body C* where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumeision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free ; but Christ is all and in all .

This spirit , whether it is traced to a desire to spread the fellowship of the 4 * This is the motto of M. Wallon 's histoire d'esclavage . Comp. for this man 's views , Neander , Amer . Transi. , Vol . III , page 100. // gospel over the world , or to raise the degraded and suffering , must bind the Christian to his fellow men , while his lowliness of mind leads him to make the least of his actual superiority of position . It is obvious that this Spirit will not spend itself in softening the rigor of usage or law , but must by degrees modify or abrogate the laws themselves . When in the feelings of men , their leading differences are taken away , legislation will talk the language of equality , and the same rights , as well as laws , will apply to all . If the work of change moves sloxvly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in early Christian society . " God , " says Lactantins , * " who generates and gives breath to all , would leave all equal , that is , on a level , ( ae*jjxuos id est pares . ) On all he has imposed the same condition of living ; all He has begotten for wisdom ; to all He has promised immortality ; no one is separated from His celestial benefits-no one before Hun is a slave , no one a master ; for if all have the same father , with equal right are we all free . " He then adds soon after , " some one will say , are there not among you some poor , others rich ; some slaves , others masters ? Is there not a difference between persons ? None ; nor is there any other reason why we impart to one another the name of brethren , but that we believe ourselves to be equal . " Snch sentiments , which are clearly Christian , could not fail of an influence upon the institution of slavery , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such ideas , we find manumissions for religions purposes becoming frequent . We find the slave trade checked ; we find personal slavery , as opposed to predial or villenage , gradually dying out of the institutions of Europe . Thus we see the equalizing tendencies of the doctrines of the Scriptures , and of the Christian* Church . Turning now to the theory of natural or personal rights , we shall find it teacking the same lesson . Indeed , the admission that rights are natural , leads directly to the inference that they equally * Inst. div .

For if they belong to man by virtue of his free , accountable , social nature , and the part assigned to him in the world , they are the common property of all ; and justice consists in denying them to none-in giving to all the same personal standing and the same remedy against wrong-doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the notions of those who refer to our Declaration of Indepeiidence , whether in praise of it or in censure . Some think that it is a political charter , affirming the equal right of all to suffrage and a share in government . But no such thing was in the thoughts of the framers . Their simple doctrine covered the ground of equality of justice . Whether for the security of this , a *hare in the political institutions of a country is necessary or desirable , is a fair question , but lies aside from the doctrine of rights itself . On the other hand , others blame this instrument as being vague and unmeaning . It may perhaps be unfortunate in classing among the rights , the pursuit of happiness ,  - -  which is a barren idea , out of which no moral consequences can be derived ; but we see not how it can be charged with vagueness , unless you say that nothing but a law-book enumerating the several rights , would have been sufficiently explicit . When it declares men to be born free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature common to all , in the purpose for which man was made , why all should enjoy certain rights . If , for instance , there is a right of acquiring and retaining property , there is as good a reason why a government should protect one in this as another . If our nature fits us for locomotion , there is no reason why one should be permitted to use it more than why another should , unless it has been forfeited by crime . Or if free speech is a right , and there is a right of reputation , these must be equally granted to all , and in case of their collision , as when my free tongue injures my neighbor 's good name , there must be the same reparation for all . Or in other words , our nature brings us all into the same relations to time law . It is a friend to all , giving no exclusive favors to one class or shutting out // another from its remedies .

They are both equalizing , but neither is leveling . That theory of society , then , is as unchristian as it is unrighteous , which teaches that for the elevation of one class in the State , there must be another wit ho ? tt privileges , if not incapable of rising . This is a natural view for those to take of the parts of society who hold that , the State being the end , any disposition necessary for its permanence may be made of its inhabitants . We are sorry that we must enumerate among the advocates of such a social theory  --  the two primary philosophers of Greece . But from their Pagan point of view , the theory was unavoidable . How was society to be protected and ennobled ? It was impossible , they thought , that the mass of artificers , retail dealers and day laborers , could be elevated above their groveling occupations . It were well that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governing stratum , supported by the labors of those whose physical powers alone were of use to the State , might have leisure for war , politics and philosophy . And if the society would take a permanent form , there must be a pQrrnanent substratum : the means and stimulus to rise must be removed from this class . Any extensive increase of knowledge , any accumulation of propertj* , opens a revolutionary prospect . Thus for the sake of a small portion of society , the rest must be degraded and kept in degradation . This old theory has not eutirely lost its hold upon the human mind . There are not wanting those in our own land , who urge that the laborer ought to be a slave , in order that the freeman may feel the loftiness of his position-may have a certain sense of dignity , and may have leisure to attend to the affairs of State . It is said , too , that the license of freedom demoralizes the lower class , whilst an underpinning of slavery separates the free from degradation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileged class . Now we say that this theory , which is clearly opposed to // the doctrine of natural rights , is equally opposed to the spirit of Christianity . That a religion which aims at elevating all men above the vices of heathenism , which enlarges the sphere of thought , which has been the pioneer of civilization , which produces , as we have seen , a deep sentiment of brotherhood through a society where it reigus ,  --  that such a religion can look with favor on a plan for keeping a large , in fact a major part of a nation in hopeless degradation , no sane unprejudiced man , who has a glimmering of Christian feeling or knowledge , can believe . Then , as to the alleged advantages of such a plan ,  --  which might commend it , were it true , to such Christians as approve of doing evil that good may come ,  --  they have no existence in point of fact . In proof of this , we will not dwell on what our own eyes might see without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license of selfgratification which such an inferior race affords , to the debasement of the lower order of freemen below even the unfree themselves , to the gradual decay of honor and respect for law in the leading part of society . We will appeal also to what took place at Rome at the end of the republic and under the empire , when vast troops of slaves displaced the old free laborers in large districts of Italy . What could exceed the corruption that then prevailed in the better classes of society , when the Roman matrons vied in vice with the debauched of the other sex , and even professed prostitution before the Inagistrate to avoid the penalties of the , law. * No ! it can not be that such avowed selfishness on a grand scale , as is implied in the deliberate 4 ? basement of one class in society , should be acceptable to Christianity , or should be without a curse in its train . The flagitious plea , that because a class has been inferior and degraded it must be kept in degradation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the women of Rome in the seventh century of the city must he known to our readers . We will only quote in support of the text two passages , one fron the Annals of Tacitus , 11 , 18 , referring to a law , " ne qu*estum corporis faceret cui avus nut pater aut maritus eques Ilomanus fuisset . " The case of Vistilia , whom he proceeds to mention , is worthy of notice . The other is from Suetonius , in his life of Tiberius , 35 . " Fo*mina , famos* , ut ad evitandas legum pcenas jure ac dignitate matronali exsolverentur , lenocinium profiteri coeperant , " etc. // to demoralize those who use it . Kor can the Christian moralist hear without indignation of purity preserved by instituting a rank of society necessarily impure and without sense of character . As if our houses were to be kept from pollution by licensed brothels , and temperance depended on opening grogshops and seeing low drunkards stagger through the streets , and gambling hells made heaven outside of them . We are now enabled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully attained to a true theory of individual freedom . As long as the value of the individual soul was unfelt , how could its rights be of any great importance ? And how could its value be felt as long as its immortality and responsibility were to a great extent hidden from the eyes of the world ? The life which , like a lighted lamp , might be blown out by any wind , was not of enough moment to be the foundation of a political system . Something continuous and as nearly immortal as possible was needed for that purpose . That something was the State . The State , which was then the governing idea , must preserve itself by any means within its reach ; and the unlimited selfishness of the State , thus allowed , must infect the whole of social morality , for the religion of the State supplied almost no moral ideas to counteract that source of corruption . In particular , that there may be a class of able bodied , intelligent , philosophical citizens , there must be another class to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in hopeless degradation , because any change in their condition would shake the social fabric . The doctrine of human brotherhood must be opposed , then , by the institutions of the State . The idea of human progress could not penetrate men 's minds as long as the permanence of a State so constituted was the great end to be secured . Thus , as long as a religion breathing love and promising immortality was unknown , justice could not be the foundation of a State ; the oppression of one class by another , the subjection of the individual to the will of the majority , the reign of selfish expedience in politics , was inevitable . It may be said , with equal truth , that a law of justice between nations was impossible . Sometimes in this ignorance of God a grand idea seemed just on the point of re // vealing itself to the world ; but the fogs of heathenism hid it again from human eyes . The most remarkable as well as influential of all new doctrines in the history of heathenism seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wonderful spread out of India . We refer to the abolition of caste and a doctrine of human brotherhood resembling that of Christ . But the political importance of this Buddhist doctrine was weakened , if not destroyed , by the miserable view of individual existence , which that religion took . How could anything great grow up where something like annihilation was the goal of man , where the tedious trausmi gration of souls was the burden lying before the conscious being , to be terininated only by the JVirwan which should destroy his separate entity , if not his entity altogether . Thus the absence of certain ideas , prominent in the Christian system , must , we see , have rendered true freedom , equal rights and lasting progress impossible . By inference , these great ends can be secured , where Christian principles have full control . We may add , that when slavery is defended in Christian lands , the defense can be placed only on heathen grounds , and manifests an essentially heathen spirit . And if the defense is received as satisfactory by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the life , and destroy the institutions of Christianity . V. Christianity shoWs its affinity to the doctrine of nat*tral rights by its dependence for its success in the world on the recognition of a portion of them . The rigid of worship is necessary in order that religion should be anything more than an individual sentiment . The right of private judgment and of expressing it in opposition it may be to the religion of the State , is one which must be exercised , if the Christian would spread what he regards as the knowledge of salvation . The right of association is essential to the existence of the Christian church . It may be said that Christ was preached and the Church founded , whilst these rights were not admitted , and our religion was a religio illicita . Very well . But what if Peter , John , or Paul , had held that they were not entitled to disobey the // commands of civil powers which were opposed to these rights : could the Gospel have spread ? Could the early Christians have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , for the sake of religion , there had gone along in their minds a sense of violated obligations ? It was not enough for their support that they were working for their Divine Master , for all kinds of things could not be done on the plea of spreading Christianity ; but they needed to have the conviction that the laws they broke were unrighteous ,  --  opposed to their sacred rights , as the rights of men having souls and a religious nature . They claim , therefore , the right to believe and profess their religion . Thus Tertullian , in his address to Tertyllus Scapula , * proconsul of Africa , uses the following language : " It pertains to human right and natural power for each one to worship what he puts faith in ; nor does one man 's religion harm or profit another . It is not the part of religion to force religion , which ought to be adopted of free-will and not by force , since even victims for sacrifice are demanded from a willing mind . " If , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the free exercise of which religion demands , the ground is broken for the recognition of others . For if these rights are justified by this part of our human nature , why should not others be justified by our social nature , our physical , our intellectual ? If these latter should be regarded by the Christian as of less importance , he can hardly fail to perceive that in theory all the rights must stand or fall together , that either all may be taken away b.y the despotism of society at its pleasure , or there is an equal claim for the enjoyment of all . ile will perceive , also , that in fact one rig*it must pave the way for the acquisition of the rest . Let him , by passive endurance or by force , have won the right to serve God as his convictions of truth demand ,  --  the right of worship and the right to an open Bible ; and either in his time or afterwards , those civil rights , which have more to do with temporal interests , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an enslaved people . On the other hand , policy demands that // a people of slaves in fact be kept from the Bible . They can have at the most only *raI religious instruction , guarded with the most jealous care . To such a community Protestantism is wholly unsuited . The pulpit and the sermon ought to give place to the priest and the mass ; and the confessional would prove of the highest advantage as an engine of government . Otherwise those great ideas of sin and redemption , of accountability and privilege , that discipline of the faculties which ever goes with Scriptural truth , will make the slave too much of a man for his condition , or will turn his head and make him dangerous . The connection in theory and fact between rights of different kinds , suggests one reason why Protestant Christians have been great sticklers for freedom ; - sometimes even factious , seldom too conservative , but generally calm friends of civil liberty . That reason is , that from the rights of our religious nature which they so dearly prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united with these , that they perceive their theoretical validity and practical importance ? Being now educated by the Bible to a love of justice , and looking on all as their brethren , regarding the rights of men as a common inheritance from God , they can not fail to feel a warm zeal for that which excited the fervor of ordinary philanthropists . There is a class of rights equally important in their bearings on Religion and on the State , which deserve our attention kere for a moment . We refer to the family rights on which civil as well as religious society depends . Religion throws its sanctity around these , so that they seem in the list of rights to have a place of their own . Two commandments of the decalogue show their importance in the eye of God . Religion properly demands of the State that the purity of marriage shall be protected , that there shall be but one deitnite relation between the man and the woman , that divorce shall not be at the option of the parties , that children shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parents in their right to the children against others . Religion , we say , demands all this , partly for its own sake , as the means of its own growth and even existence ; and partly in the interests of humanity and justice , as that , without // which the human race would sink to the lowest barbarism . And all this , religiou must demand for all . There are no races , there is no part of society which it can pass by , without feeling that it has neglected its duty . Let us suppose now that religion has gained its point ,  --  has acquired for a nation or class , oppressed before , the rights of legitimate marriage , and of parental authority . It is evident that so much gained , if no more , must put an end to the worst sort of servile conditions . The parents can not now be separated save by their free consent , nor the children torn from their parents . The rustic laborer will now have his fixed home ; the slave will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all probability will soon be exalted into a freeman . Thus religion , by securing a respect for the family rights , will prepare the way for the acknowledgment of the rest . VI . I next advert to the objection that Christianity ts a religi on , the essence of which consists in acquiescence , non-resistance , self-renunciation , abandonment of personal claims ; while the essence of individual rights consists in conceding a power to one man which sets him up against society . Individualism , it is said , is the term for selfishness in its most distilled form . It is the characteristic of savages , of cliques or casts , keeping themselves distinct from the community ; it is the spirit of impracticable minds which can unite with no others . It is the spirit of justice , while Christianity , by its principle of love , towers heavenward above justice . In these representations , there is a mixture of false and true . What is false may be met in general by repeating the remark which was made in the preface of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal justice , thus the same foundations with every legitimate polity in the depths of our accountable nature . What is true may be freely admitted , and yet there is no want of affinity between the Gospel and natural rights . Christianity , when it offers grace to the ill-deserving , does not preach an abandonment of the old principles of righteousness . God has still claims on those to whom free pardon is offered . He has rights which are as real as they were before // Christ 's expiation was made known to the world . If , in substituting mercy for justice ,  --  what has been done by another for us instead of what we ought to do , he had destroyed his law or undermined the sense of obligation , " the pillared firmament would be rottenness , and earth 's base built on stubble . " But every Christian mind , whether it form a definite theory of atonement or not , must feel that the legitimate result of the offer of pardon , in its connection with the Redeemer 's death is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waives his right of just infliction upon the person of the sinner , in so doing he has niagnifled the law and made it honorable . So , too , the death of Christ , as far as He was concerned , was purely voluntarily . It was a free renunciation of His right , as a spotless being , to be exempt from suffering . It was no command of his Father which forced him to undertake his office , but his own free , glad consent , in distinct prescience of what lay before him and with power at any time to avoid it . " Therefore doth the Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again . No man taketh it from me , butllayit down of myself . " Now does this waiver of the right to life , if I may so call it , cast dishonor on the principles of justice ? Did Christ in dying forsake the ground of right ? No more than a man deserts that ground when he remits a debt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of undeserved kindness which even the savage and the reprobate can perform . Descending now from these theological altitudes to the morality which governs the daily life of the Christian , we ask whether the endurance of injury to which he is bound , is opposed in any sense to the notion of personal rights ? This question may be answered by asking again whether a waiver of a right annihilates it , or is an acknowledment that it never existed ? Does remitting a debt destroy the justice of the claim , or weaken the sense of justice afterwards ? But there are other considerations to be urged here which we must not pass over . The first of these is that serfsurrendry is rendered more complete 1y the consciousness of // giving up a lawful claim . Mere self-denial may be an act of virtue as opposing selfish desire ; but it is evideiit that when a sense of right goes with the desire there may be a good plea for following inclination . Yirtue then is exposed to a harder trial , and the triumph is nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of justice . But a more important thought is that a renunciation of one 's right on the higher principle of Christian love may prove a protest against injustice and a means of establishing justice in the convictions of men . The principle of justice remains , while its operation is set aside by an individual in a particular case . Can the person benefited draw from this act the inference that no obligation existed ? By no means , for the act shows him that the other party believed in the validity of his own claim , lie himself will be as willing to admit it as before . Will it weaken his feeling of obligation ? Not at all . The act tends to inspire him with compunction for having violated obligation . Coals of fire are heaped on his head . Thus let there be a district full of Christian slaves and unchristian masters . The slaves believe that slavery is a grievous wrong , a violation of nearly all their natural rights . Nevertheless they waive the exercise of their rights in obedience to views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see their children torn from them without rising as Moses did to slay the Egyptian , and some of them endure atrocities from " froward " masters , for a tithe of which those masters would stab or gouge one another . Let it appear too that this meek , uncomplaining spirit is the fruit not of fear , but of the gospel ; that the hands of the oppressed men forbear to strike their masters dead , because they are habitually raised in prayer ; - in short , that Christian feeling is the only thing in the way of righteous vengeance . Now we will not say that Christian feeling requires such meekness everywhere and always , but no matter ; is it not evident that conduct like this would carry a profound impression into the minds of men ? Would it be any defense or justification of slavery that such meek disciples of Christ were , suffering from the institution , or that apostles had exhorted them so to suffer ? Could the world , all that // admire passive heroism , fail to cry out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that they were upholding a system of injustice ? Passsing to the other side of our subject , we maintain that the doctrine of rights leads to no selfish individualism . We may prove this in two ways . On the one hand , conceive of a community where no rights are acknowledged , where only desires exist . Is there any associating principle in such a state of ' society ? Is selfishness restrained where desire without justice reigns ? But again , the very purpose of the imatural rights , as has been shown already , is to maintain the welfare of the indfvidual , to preserve his freedom , and euable him to fulfill the end of his being . For this reason , obligation accompanies every right . The right to property , for instance , when it takes the language of law , does not say " thou shalt acquire property , " but " thou shalt not steal , " and the right to life , not " thou shalt not give up thy life on any occasion , ** but " thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ot the rights is to draw men together , to unite them by reciprocal bonds of j ustice ,  --  the very opposite of grasping , all engrossing selfishness . And what is more , only when this foundation is laid , can good will , kindliness , confidence , foresight , far-reaching purpose be entertained ; only then can Christianity itself exist . Granted that time stickler for rights with no higher sentiments is a very uncomfortable , a very unattractive character . Shall we not say the same of intellect found alone or even of blind conscience ? VII . lYe proceed to remark in the last place that neither religion nor the doctrine of natural rights alone cdn form a good and stable society , but the conservation of the State is found in their union . IReligion exercising political power in person so to speak , almost of course becomes a tyrant . Its arms are threats to the conscience , excommunications , interdicts ; it must have a great central , infallible will ; it suspects free thought and free inquiry . It is only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can take both worlds into view , and have a stable throne . // Jastice founded on the notion of natural right may measure every relation of society by the square and compass , may of itself put everything in its place , and construct a beautiful framework of a body politic ; but if it drives away religionthe moving power ,  --  the possibility of improvement , the hope of continuance is wanting . Or we will suppose something between the two-tl*eprrncsple of benevolence  --  to usurp their place . Let the greatest good of the greatest number be inscribed on the banner of society , without fixed principles of justice to control it . We maintain that such a principle is among the most worthless possible , or rather , that it is no principle at all , but a bundle of temporary expedients stealing the garb of principle . It is the refuge of every windy demagogue , who dares not do right , and dares tell a lie . It sanctifies every old oppression , every new repudiation . What good of what number will justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Africa to bring them to the light of Christianity ? Nothing but moral and political corruption can be expected to grow out of such a principle , as shifting as the sand , as versatile as a Jesuit ; the plea for the tyranny of a despot at one time , the source of democratic tyranny at another . lYe will make another supposition . Let religion be protected by a State which denies the doctrine af personal rights , or at least such of them as would be dangerous to absolute monarchy . What is the condition of religion here ? She has her hands and feet chained . She must limp along in a certain track , dissent from which is punishable by law . The individual Christian , whose soul is as large as his country , is confined in a dungeon . Nearly every department of usefulness is shut to him . Association is the foe the government most dreads . How feeble , how one-sided , how passive is religion here in her best estate ! Lastly , let the doctrine of natural rights be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the reigning power is a despotism . Here it will prove a mighty upheaving force , and yet a blind one , powerful to destroy , powerless to reconstruct , reckless of consequences or opportnnities . It // becomes now an avenger of long delayed insulted justice , a moralforce , because it does homage to a God of righteousness , an immoral one , because it enlists on its side all the malignant passions , all the discontent , all the selfish interests of mankind . Such are these two great principles divorced from one another . Let us now look at them in co*peration . It would be expected from their affinity , as already unfolded , that they would work well together in the movements of society ; but they do more than this : they are the true and the only conservative principles . Neither fear of change on the part of those who are prosperous , nor the influence , direct . or indirect , of property , nor restrictions of suffrage , nor troops , nor concentration of power in an executive , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up a State , if these are wanting ; but if these are present together , you have man s moral and religious nature united with his interests and hopes on the side of order . Take as an illustration of this the protection which they give , when united , to the holders of property . Property , especially in a democratic State , is timid , and is apt to have that blind con servatisin , which clings to anything existing for support . As it increases and concentrates , it acquires more and more a feverish pulse ; it dreads the poorer class ; it dreads the reformer ; it dreads agitation ; it is willing to increase the corruption of society , to keep demagogues in pay , if by a percentage of its gains it can secure the mass of its capftal . Thus from sheer cowardice it may make common cause with the institutions of injustice , and oppose the doctrine of natural rights . Now observe how this kind of conservatism defeats it own ends . If slavery can be allowed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive principles . If it is right to deprive a part of the people of the fruits of their labor , to take from them the right of property , and many other precious rights besides ; much more is it right to violate the right of property only . What security has our rich conservative now for his accumulations ? He defends , or connives at a principle // which can be used for his own ruin . He twists a cord for his own neck . What is to prevent socialism from dividing up the property of a community among its members , if we acknowledge that neither property , nor any other right , is sacred ? Or will he imagine that a combination of powerful interests will manage a community ? Alas ! if he puts no faith in eternal Providence , and the power of moral ideas , he is ready for the slaughter . And he is hastening the bitter day by the corrupt , degi management at which he connives . Thus does a violation of rights , a weakening in one place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful breach , for the entrance of the foe , for carnage and sack , and anarchy . Suppose now , where society has been constructed , as among us , on the principle of equal rights , where this has been taught in every State constitution , every political text-book , every speech of the orator ; suppose , we say , that for the sake of keeping up a vicious institution , this foundation doctrine is denied , and inveighed against , as revolutionary and unscriptural will such a change of principles help the peace of such a country ? Not at all . Until the system of natural rights is abandoned in theory by all the best minds , there must be perpetual agitation , for those who receive it will cling to it as to life . And when it is abandoned , what ensues ? We shall have the spectacle of a country forsaking the principles which have held it together and made it what it was . The calamities of war or pestilence , nations can survive ; they can outlive a time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Charles ; they can recover from wide-spread bankruptcy ; but they can not survive the desertion and denial of those principles which are inwrought in their constitution , for which men of old risked all and bled , which gave strength and dignity to their character . As well might the Church of Christ give up Christ and be a Church , as a republican people may expect to continue such after they have thrown away what separates them from despotisms . Nay , despotisms themselves admit the validity of some of the rights , and make up for the loss of others , in some sort , by the energy with which // they protect the conceded ones . But a commonwealth without acknowledged rights , has the weakness of a child ; it can neither protect , nor be protected ; and it is a blessing when *uch a sham gives.place to the grim reality of despotism . And can religion , in consistency with her own nature , pass by on the other side unconcerned , when these bleeding principles of human rights lie in the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea of having nothing to do with politics . But then she will be false to her nature , which , like her Saviour 's , unites every human sympathy with the Divine . Nor will she fail to pay dear for her indifference , for she will drive out the champions of even true liberty from her pale , who , away from her influence , must sink into impracticable theorists , or bitter revolutionists . In the end both their cause and hers will be lost through the divorce . Or she may remain neutral , because she dreads the rash speed of reformers , and is anxious in regard to those physical interests , on which her outward prosperity depends . That she should be cantious , should preach subniission , obedience to law , reverence for the State , is right , and conformed to her nature . But if she will utter no remonstrance when great wrongs are defended by persons professing allegiance to her , while she frowns on every peccadillo which may show itself in the best human society , she must expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If society is reformed , the merit will be laid at some other door ; if there is a triumph of anti-social principles , the blame willbe thrown on her . If , on the other hand , religion and the theory of personal rights act , true to their natural alliance , in unison with one another , all that society longs for will be accomplished , all it fears be prevented . They agree in teaching the priceless worth of man , to ennoble whom Christ died , and for whom Christian civilization is creating as well as spreading the means of improvement . Why should they not together attempt to raise him to the level for which his Creator intended him ? They agree in rejecting , in abhorring that theory which views one race as incapable of improvement , and society as necessarily // restin* on a basis of degradation . Why should they not work together against such a theory , and the practice which it justifies ? When united they are strong , and purify one another . IReligion , true to its consciousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything for which it was called into the world . The doctrines of freedom , on their side , no longer betray the outcast by false promises of aid . Religion is seen to be just . Freedom ceases to be factious . Oh , when shall these things be ?
