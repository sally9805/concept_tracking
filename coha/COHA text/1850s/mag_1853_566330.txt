txt ART . 111. - THE DISCONTENTED CLASSES . Hints towards Reforms . By HORACE GREELEY . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers , 1850 . MR . GREELEv has many generous and noble impulses . His heart readily sympathizes with the poor and the oppressed , and yearns for the lifting up of our race from the degradation of ignorance and sensuality to the high places of intelligence and purity . But it is obvious that men may be in full sympathy with our diseased and wretched humanity , and yet not rightly apprehend either the Cause or the Cure . They may desire to reclaim the bogs and marshes , which sin has made ; but failing to ascertain and cut off the springs of all this mischief , they will be likely to labor in vain , and spend their strength for naught . When Wilberforce sent forth his " Practical View " amidst the formalisms of his time , it caused a ferment in the public mind , to which it had long been unused . And why ? Because it told the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described , and the remedy it suggested . Hence its affectiveness under God , was owing to its vivid , burning trut/*fulness. // Now we do not say that Mr. Greeley 's " Hints towards Reforms " very seriously fail in this particular . The failure seems to us rather in what he does not say , than in what he does . Still the hook contains many valuable suggestions , to which the public will do well to give serious heed . We thank Mr. Greeley for every true and earnest word he has ever uttered in behalf of truth and righteousness , while at the same time we may express the hope , that his Philosophy of Reform , as he grows older , will catch more of the spirit of Him , who " came to seek and to save that which was lost . " We do not propose to give an analysis of the work , placed at the head of this article . We take it rather as the motto of some thoughts of our own , upon the general subject of which it treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public mind , it is curious to observe how soon , and in what forms , it is developed , after the key note of reform is fairly struck . An example to our purpose , and very suggestive in other respects , occurred in the early public life of David . Declared an outlaw by the despotism of Saul , and simply because being the better man , he was gaining the hearts of the people , he sought to hide himself in the cave of Adullam feom the rage of his l ) ersecutor . When this fact came abroad , we are told , that " every one that was in distress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was discontented , gathered themselves unto him , and he became a Captain over them " - just as all the bad humors in the body rush to the part most inflamed . It may be doubted , however , whether this discontented bandthese men in distress and debt-would all have enlisted under the standard of such a leader , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to permit nothing to be done contrary*to the laws and institutions of his country ; for it is not under the standard of principle , that such men are wont to rally . With nothing to lose , and much to hope for , from change , they naturally attach themselves to the side advocating the repudiation of debts , and the extension of the area of the widest , or rather , the wildest , liberty . Turning the world upside down is very pleasant to those who dislike to have it the right side up . One thing is certain , to wit , that free institutions have most to fear from men of broken fortunes , and of unsettled , discontented minds . To examine the character and influence of this class of men , and to suggest the remedy adapted to the evils they originate , is the leading design of this article . The three classes from whom special evil to the country is // to be apprehended , may be named after the pattern given us at the cave of Adullam-those in distress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distress is often caused by the maladministration of the civil government-more frequently by the folly or inconsideration of the sufferers themselves . In despotic countries , there are forms of distress , of which we have had no experience . To have property and person and life itself placed at the absolute control of one man , and he cruel , jealous and capricious , is to have a state of things , in which the real manhood of our nature will have little opportunity to develop itself ,  --  and in which the iron must go into the very soul . But though by the mercy of God , and the wisdom of our fathers , we are personally strangers to this form of wretchedness ; yet we have seen multitudes of greater sufferers in this land of the free , than can be found in Austrian dungeons . Intemperance and licentiousness can forge worse chains than the most cruel of this world 's despotschains which bind the soul , torturing it to desperation , and yet are destined to become stronger to all eternity ! Such suffering is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit of our own ill regulated desires . For such sufferers , conscience is armed with a whip of scorpions ; while to those , like Paul and Silas , who go into prisons , and are scourged for the truth 's sake , there comes such refreshment as to make the voice of praise , rather than the sighs of despondency , the fittest expression of their feelings . Turn out now into the public view all who are made wretched and desperate by drunkenness , and gluttony , and licentiousness ; and will you not have an exceeding great army ? What if they never draw the sword ; yet such a mass of festering corruption in the republic may well fill us with apprehension for the result . But where distress springs from the want of necessary food , and prevails widely among the people , there will of course sooner or later be a revolution . It was the cry for bread , that once overturned the French government . And it was this cry , coming up from the mining districts and manufacturing towns of Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . Rosseau never uttered a truer sentiment than this " when the poor have nothing to eat , they will eat the rich ; " nor Carlyle , saying , " when the thoughts of a people in the great mass have grown mad , the combined issue of that people 's workings will be madness and ruin . " It must be so . With the first consciousness of power , they cry out , as they run over the long catalogue of their sufferings- " plunder shall be paid with plunder , violence with violence , and blood with blood . " But distress // of this sort , pervading large masses of the people , is unfelt in this country ; and may the mercy of God prevent the arrival of such a day . True , there is want in many a dark , damp cellar in our cities , and many a family pining for the bare necessities of life ; and the wonder is , that so many are willing to remain in such unfriendly positions , while a large and unoccupied country invites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free to all , and where constant industry will ensure food and clothing . Still this form of distress is too limited to make its influence widely felt . Yet it will doubtless grow with the growth of the population ; and well will it be for the stability of our institutions , if the proper remedy is seasonably apl ) lied . Another mischievous class of men are those in debt . To contract debts is easy ; to pay them is a task too hard for the shiftless . Without endorsing the sentiment of a late distinguished statesman , that " men trading on borrowed capital ought to break , " we may safely adopt the proverb of Solomon , and say , " the borrower is servant to the lender . " The debtor can not act with the freedom and independence of one who owes no man anything but love . Yet the difference is great with different persons . Some , by the perspicacity of their calculations , and the steadiness of their industry , are sure at length of getting out of the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can swallow them up . Others , without forethought or the ability to fit means to ends , plunge into the sea of debt , and become at last the sport of its waves and the victims of its whirlpools . Deeply and more deeply they become involved , till , losing all hope of relief , they are ready to enlist under the standard of any Cataline that may offer himself ; and in utter despair of bettering their condition , are " fit for treason , stratagems , and spoils . " The former class of debtors are safe and honorable citizens ; and with the ordinary blessings of Providence , may expect to gain the foothold of independence . But the latter class , if numerous , will be like leprosy on the body politic , ever sighing for some change , though it be from bad to worse , and ready , like the Anti-renters of New York , to overturn all order and law . But the Discontented form by far the largest class of troublesome men ; a class , uneasy with their present condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasy in the sense of using their faculties , in an earnest , honest way to improve their condition by an improvement of character , but because possessed with the restlessness and fretfulness from which spring greeneyed envy and unprincipled ambition . It is the wish for consideration beyond desert  --  a desire for the re // wards of industry without its patient labor-for personal honor and emolument without regard to the public good . It is the passion of small minds for high offices . There is a discontent which is honorable both in its spirit and aim , which seeks relief from oppressive burdens by fair and manly endeavors . We honor the discontent which threw the British teas into Boston harbor , and refused to pay the taxes of unrepresented imposition . We like the impatience of Ronge and his associates under the yoke of Romish despotism , which complains if the freedom of speech and of the press is fettered , and which demands the free action of the soul in all its religious relations . Such discontent , based on principle , and seeking for truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safety both of Chui'ch and State . Perhaps some of those who put themselves under the direction of David at the cave of Adullam , may have been of this class ; but as a portion of this company on one occasion proposed to cut off Saul 's head , while he lay asleep in his camp , and that too without regard to the forms of law , we incline to believe , that they at least were discontented in the bad sense ; like some in our day , who seem to think it right to do evil , that good may come . The causes of this Discontent are various . Some are discontented because they can not make haste to be rich as fast as they desire . They spread all sail to catch the breeze ; but if the wind does not blow a perfect gale , and waft them rapidly into port , they fret and excite a mutinous spirit on board , and thus disturb the quiet of their otherwise peaceable fellow passengers . Others , after toiling long to no purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fails to awaken the ardor and energy of their minds , because ill suited to their taste and order of intellect ; and hence that all the headway they have made has been against wind and tide . The lawyer is without a brief , the physician without patients , the clergyman without a parish , and the statesman without an office , because trials have developed a serious unfitness for the professions they have chosen . Too far advanced in life , perhaps , to qualify themselves for another calling , more in harmony with their mental structure and sympathies , they are now in danger of becoming soured by the spirit of discontent , and joining the ranks of ' those busy bodies and croakers , that do exceedingly trouble our country . Others , again , deeming it disreputable to labor with their own hands on the farm , or in the mechanic 's shop , are going in crowds to our cities as merchants ' clerks , twenty applying for // the place where only one is wanted ; or they contrive to live by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for all the world like the load of sin , with which Christian fled from the city of Destruction , trudge along from house to house , and from village to village , exposing their wares for sale , and cheating all who are foolish enough to patronize such characterless , itinerant peddlers , while others try their hand at opening the seals of Mesmerism , or exhibiting by the queerest engravings the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt to Canaan ; or with just wit enough to turn the crank of an electrical machine , they propose to lay bare all the secrets of thunder and lightning ; or by other contrivances , too numerous to mention , seek to sponge a people fond of being humbugged . But these tricks will at length fail to pay ; and then the players of the game , having nothing to do , must be added to the ranks of the discontented . There is another item , which belongs to this connection , though some may regard it as unworthy of this special notice . In the center of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen a class of individuals , mere hangers on in all places of public resort , " who spend their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing , " yet looking like dullness personified , and perpetually violating that most excellent rule of the Apostle , that " if a man will not work , neither shall he eat . " These men of sloth , however , must sooner or later come to want ; and then , too lazy to work , they may be expected to add another wave in the sea of popular discontent . To these causes of restlessness in the public mind , we add another  --  the fact that large and increasing numbers of our population are retiring from the cheerful light of Christianity into the darkness of sensualism and unbelief . Even in New England , it is seldom that one half , often not so many , of the people , regard with favor the institutions of the gospel , or take any responsibility for their support . All these are made peevish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad failure to answer the great end of life , while yet the animalism of their nature has become so strong , as to discourage all attempts at reformation . What wonder is it , that they should be discontented with themselves , and with the mysterious* but admonitory aspects of the Providence of God ! No thoughtful man , without many a sad foreboding , can contemplate the time when this dark mass of human beings shall be thoroughly excited by the spirit of discontent , and moved by the madness of their hearts to join in those awful conflicts against the cause of truth , which prophecy speaks of as now near at hand . // This spirit of discontent in the public mind is increased and intensified by the character of the multitudinous emigrants to our shores from other lands . Thousands of them are the mere tools of the ten horned beast , as restless as ignorance and sin will permit them to be amidst the lights and restraints of their adopted home . Other thousands of them , darkened by unbelief and brutified by sensuality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but finding none . Add to these the sweepings of the poor houses and jails of Europe , and we shall cease to wonder at the existence of so much disquietude and turmoil , as compared with the earlier periods of this Republic . Now here are causes at work , which , if left unchecked , may be expected , as the country grows older , to bring increasing numbers into distress and debt , and under the influence of discontent . The poor will be arrayed against the rich , and the employed against the employer , till the bitterness of this animosity shall destroy all the charities of social life . Over all this , however , we might sleep undisturbed , if the war cry should be under the direction of men like him in the cave of Adullam . But , alas ! the leaders most likely to be chosen by such malcontents will be " of their father , the devil , and the lusts of their father they will do . " We can not therefore safely sleep on the bosom of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the proper remedy . And here we need not be at a loss . For the actual workings of the causes , to which we have alluded , are already so visible to the attentive observer , as to indicate some of the evils to be apprehended , and the remedy which , if seasonably applied , is sure to work a cure . Distress and debt will naturally prompt men to the use of unprincipled means of relief . Accordingly , Fourierism comes forward to say that the only way to counteract or prevent the influence of selfish action , is for different communities to live and act together in one large family ; each individual engaged in work suited to his ability and taste-some nursing the children- " the boys , fond of dirt , doing the dirty work "  --  the women-those of coarser mould at the wash-ti7ib ; those of finer grain inditing articles for the Ladies ' Magazine ; the men , some following the plough-others , drawing on their mental resources ;  --  and all putting their earnings into the common stock . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only make it more rampant , we are certain not only from experiments already made , but from the nature of selfishness itself . " Leviathan is not so tamed . " Mad bulls , turned into the same pasture , would be quite as likely to lose their ferocity , and gain // the gantleness of lambs . Fourierism , set it forth in its best possible light , is certainly another gospel . See too what masses of excited individuals have come together at the trumpet call of Mormonism ! What but distress of some sort , or debt , or incurable discontent , could have induced so many to follow the meteor track of this wild delusion ! What this movement has already cost the single State of Illinois would be sufficient , on the plan of the gospel , to convert many a wilderness into a fruitful field . But questions of loss and gain have little weight with the multitude , when thoroughly permeated with the leaven of discontent . Hence also the turbulent scenes a few years since in Rhode Island had their origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely have been successful , because Frenchmen , with few exceptions , seem to be strangers to that " anchor to the soul , " characterized by an Apostle , as " sure and steadfast . " But happily when the vessel of our sister State seemed to be drifting upon a lee shore , at the mercy of wind and wave , that anchor ljield it safely , till the storm had spent its fury . And whence come the war spirits of our land ? Who constitute especially " the rank and file ? " We would not speak slightingly of the soldier , nor of the profession of arms . And yet we have some thoughts on this subject , which we find it difficult to repress . We can not doubt that those who most readily enlist in the service of war , have shared least in the humanizing influence of Christian truth . Wars and fightings , we are divinely assured , " come from our lusts , which war in our members ; " and coming from such a source , we can not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to set down a few items of the cost of war , as illustrating the dreadful uneasiness of the mind ; which , nevertheless , seeks relief by rushing into it . The annual expense of one such vessel of war as the North Carolina , is equal to the annual expense of any six of our Colleges . The average annual cost of each gun in the Navy would more than support twenty Missionaries of the Cross . During the last fifty years , our government has expended more than $400,000,000 in time of peace , for warlike preparations ! Four hundred millions of dollars ! Now we do not ask in the spirit of Judas , " To what purpose is this waste ? " but we do ask , what if this sum had been expended to secure such appliances to the mind and heart of this nation as , with the blessing of God , would have exorcised the war spirit , and put in its place the brotherly love , which Christianity enjoins , and promises ultimately to accomplish ? What say you to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well considered the destruction of morals , the havoc of life , and the ruin of souls , which always follow in the train of war ? If you have , and are still belligerent , then go , and fight with the wild beasts of your own wilderness , rather than with those for whom the Saviour died , and over whom this prophecy bends as a bow of hope : " And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares , and their spears into pruninghooks ; nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more . " But , alas ! the discontent of which we speak , knows less of Christianity than of the arts of pugilistic combat ; it is so excited by a restless ambition , as to finii greater pleasure in the turmoils of war than in the quiet enjoyments of domestic life . But we have no heart to go farther into the details of this subject . We had rather speak of the remedy , which can cure the distress and discontent already so rife in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to spread more widely , and to be less accessible to healing influences . And here we have no other to suggest than that which men , wise in their own conceits , have everywhere and in all ages accounted foolishness ; to wit : the preaching of the gospel , wit/s the Iloiy Ghost sent down from heaven . For the entrance of this gospel into the public mind giveth light ; and if it does not , by the spirit of industry which it excites and fosters , altogether cure the distress of poverty , it will at least give us grace to bear its burdens . It will certainly prevent all the expense before incurred for the support of a vicious habit , and put an end to the degradation and wretchedness which are its unfailing attendants . It will do more . It teaches us to deny ungodliness and every worldly lust , and to live soberly , and righteously , and godly in the present world . And surely with this truth , vital in his heart , the pious poor man stands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor man . At any rate , the gospel heartily received , is a sovereign remedy for all distress of mind-for here we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ . Piety in the dark , damp cellar of a city , will not fail to give a cheerful light ; for it has this radiant promise- " Trust in the Lord , and do good , and verily thou shalt be fed . " But will the gospel pay a man 's debts ? We answer , it will give him that patient industry and self-control , if anything can , which will enable himself to do it . At the least , by reason of the more sensitive conscience it forms , it will prevent him from assuming responsibilities which he knows he can not meet . It will make him an honest debtor ; and this is much . It takes off half the curse of being in debt , if integrity and conscientiousness // are at the bottom ; if promises are made with caution and redeemed with punctuality . And yet will not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , teaching him , as it does , to provide things honest in the sight of alE men-to render to all their dues  --  and to endure as seeing Him who is invisible ? And as to discontented men , ready for any change , because they suppose it can not make their condition worse , and may improve it , we are sure that the gospel is a certain remedy for all the evils they suffer or inflict . A discontented man , in the bad sense , with the well founded hope of heaven in his heart , is a contradiction in terms . With this hope , a Wilberforce in the Parliament of Great Britain , and walking with the nobles of the land , is no more quiet and peaceful than a Dairyman 's daughter in a cottage , calmly awaiting the results of a wasting sickness . Both felt alike , though placed at the extremes of life , that " godliness with contentment is great gain . " " He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , He is my refuge and my fortress ; my God ; in Him will I trust . He shall cover thee with His feathers ; His truth shall be thy shield and buckler . Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night , nor for the arrow that flieth by day ; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness , nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday . " While Luther was at Coburg , during the sessions of the Diet at Augsburg , in 1530 , a Pastor , who was with him , wrote to Melancthon , as follows : - " I can not cease to wonder , to see how steadfast , joyful , and full of faith and hope he is in these dangerous and miserable times . But he becomes more and more so by daily and diligently strengthening himself at the fountain of God 's word . No day passes , in which he does not devote at least three hours to prayer and meditation . 1 once succeeded in hearing him pray ; what faith , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man communing with God , and with such trust and faith , as a man , conversing with his father . " So true are the words of the prophet , " Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee ; because he trusteth in thee . " In the gospel of Jesus Christ , then , filling the soul with the sympathies of heaven , we have the only adequate remedy for the heartburnings of envy , and the pinings of discontent . This gospel , preached through the length and breadth of the land , and rendered effectual by the power of the Holy Spirit , will fill the public mind with the love of order , truth and justice , and stimulate the public heart to deeds of charity and good will . It // will make us a law loving and a law abiding nation . Yes , here is our hope . Looking at the results of the growing popular discontent in the less evangelized portions of the country , we can hardly fail to be impressed with the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May the Church fully awake to this duty , before the things which concern our peace , are hidden from our eyes ! The present is a day of merciful visitation . Let every Christian and Patriot work , while we have the day . And when we look at the tumultuous sea of human passions , and tremble , as we remember , that upon it are all the precious hopes of the friends of liberty , and human elevation  --  a sea , often rocked into fury by the maddened excitements of selfish hearts , let us also remember , that the oil , Which , when poured upon it , will make its waves still and peaceful as the sea of Tiberias , when Jesus spake to it in its angry mood , is the gospel of this same wonderful Son of God ! *
