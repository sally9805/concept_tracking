txt Aiu*. 111. - DUTY IN REGARD TO READING . Publications of the American Tract Society . Pastor 's Library . 24 vols . Youth 's Library . 70 vols . Evangelical Family Library . 15 vols . IT would be no easy task to analyze all the influences which unite in forming the character of individuals or of nations . But there is one influence , the power of which has never been sufficiently considered and can never be over-estimated ,  --  we mean the influence of literature . The power of thought and feeling , perpetuated and expanded by the press , reaches even beyond the sphere of the thoughts and feelings uttered in the intercourse of man with man . We need not compare the two ; they exercise the same general influence , and are resolvable ultimately into one and the same power  --  the power of mind on mind . They both involve grave , moral responsibilities . With whom we associate-what is the character of our conversation-what the principles and subjects we are familiar with in the daily intercourse of life-these , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect depend solely upon the fact , that pure and elevated society is within our reach-it depends as well upon our own inclinations . It is somewhat so with respect to our reading . It is not less important in our intercourse with the world of authors that we should be conversant with the best society . But this , too , is a matter closely connected with the individual himself , with mental training , with the moral principles , with an enlightened understanding of duty . It is not enough that good society be open to us ; we must , furthermore , have the disposition to avail ourselves of it . There is needed , therefore , both a good literature and a deep conviction of the moral obligation to // use it , in order effectually to resist the ' influence of an evil literature . With respect to the former , we have no complaint to make , of any disregard of its importance or any special neglect to do what ought to be done in the case . It is highly creditable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested so correct views of their responsibilities as conservators of literature and morals . The professedly religious publications are of a high character . We need not enter into particulars , although among the various agencies of this kind , we must not omit to mention the publications of the American Tract Society . The tract , in its original conception , was an humble instrument , ingeniously adapted to meet a specific necessity . But from that small beginning has grown up and branched out a system , which , in comprehensiveness of design , in facility of execution , in the greatness of the results already produced , and in the prospect of future usefulness , affords a most striking example of that wonder-working providence of God , which early plans and wisely matures the agencies for the exigencies of particular eras . But with respect to moral obligations in regard to reading , we think there is need of greater efforts than have as yet been put forth . The pulpit and the religious press do of course assail those corruptions of the heart which delight in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of man , which , though innocent in themselves , in their abuse give occasion to the production of most of the hurtful , or at least useless , literature in the world , but which are nevertheless overlooked . The feelings of delicacy and modesty , the sentiment of reverence , the love of the beautiful and sublime , curiosity and the desire of knowledge , are principles of human nature , which have bearings upon this subject , that need to be pointed out and their importance to be enforced . A book may be pure and yet irreverent , reverent and yet vulgar , correct in taste and yet of little value , valuable as it regards the knowledge it contains , and yet not to be read indiscriminately . But we pass by these principles and consider another still more worthy of attention , though when we mention it  --  the love of novelty , in its connection with literature-we fear the reader may think we have overstated the importance of the subject . The love of novelty , as a master-passion of the mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent their time , " we are told , " in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . " But what is this spirit ? The love of novelty is a part of our being , and may be and often is , turned to good // account . It inspires the student in his investigations of the mysteries of nature . It has led to many discoveries , which have greatly benefitted the world . Rightly directed , then , this passion is to be encouraged rather than condemned . It is what prevents our fallen humanity from becoming like the Dead Sea , destitute of life and beauty . It is not of the use , but of the abuse , of this disposition , that we speak ; pursuit of novelties for the sake of gratifying a morbid curiosity , or of preventing the mind from preying on itself . Has this passion died out in consequence of the clearer light of these days ? Or is its cry as loud and importunate as ever ? Has the garrulity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that love to hear them , disappeared , since the advent of a higher form of civilization and refinement in our own times ? Who can be at a loss for the answer , when he sees the kind of literature most in demand in this country , as he passes along the great thoroughfares of business , or examines the shelves of the bookstore , or listens to the conversation of the gay and fashionable world . " Give us something new-something exciting ; - something which will please the imagination , without destroying the delusions of sin , or stirring the sensibilities of conscience , " is yet , we believe , a cry as strong , and general , as in ages less enlightened , and more given to licentiousness . One end of the study of literature is the discipline of the mind ; but to read from the love of novelty merely , is most hostile to this end . We begin then with its influence upon the habit of mental discipline . No man can use his mind effectually , until its faculties are under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment they seriously make the attempt . The young writer , in his first effort to draw out a train of thought from a given theme , always finds his mind inclined to wander from the point . To think patiently and consecutively by the hour , he confesses , is the hardest work he ever undertook . The reason is , that the mind is not yet under his control . It is like the wild horse of the prairies , unused to the curb , and disliking all restraint . Nor can this mastery be obtained , till he has accustomed his mind to go often through long and difficult processes of thought , and trained it to habits of patient and prolonged investigation . To put him in possession of this power is the great design of our seminaries of learning ; and this is done , if done at all , by years of intellectual drilling and exercise . And yet so strong is the tendency in most minds to the love of ease and self-indulgence , that few even of our college graduates , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these few are the lights of the // world . The truth is , there is no victory which costs a man so severe and prolonged a struggle to achieve , as that , which gives him the possession of his own mind , and which enables him to subject it to the higher laws of his being . But , the great antagonist to such a government of the thoughts , is the love of novelty , as a master passion of the soul . Let the young student become an indiscriminate reader , and he will soon find in himself a growing distate not merely to the serious reading , designed to make his immortality pure and happy , but to that also , which seeks to enlighten him in regard to the philosophy of mind and matter . Loving the excitement of light reading  --  the mere syllabub of literaturerather than its substantial fruits , a scholar , from the nature of the case he can not be , nor even a man of business ; because to conduct successfully a difficult and complicated enterprise , requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such enterprises , the lover of novelty will either break down , or be diverted from his object by every suggestion of improvement , that he has not strength and patience of thought enough to weigh , and which , therefore , will only hasten the catastrophe of his hopes . Now the havoc of mental discipline made by the love of novelty at the present day , is believed to be enormous . See the multitudes in all our thoroughfares of business , in the saloons of fashion , and in our halls of legislation , who are too weak to give a useful direction to thought , and strong only to pester and clog every healthy movement . We mourn over the delirium tremens caused by the use of strong drink-because it strikes the eye with a sensible horror . But could we see the fearful wreck and waste of mind , produced by the intoxications of novelty , the sight , we are sure , would fill us with a greater horror . Could we see the multitudes , who rise from the fascinating pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no high endeavors , but , on the contrary , weakened and staggering under an excitement , which , when allayed , must be renewed by carrying the mind through the same process , causing greater dissipation and weakness of intellect , we should , doubtless , witness an evil as ruinous to all manly action , and the salvation of the soul , as that which follows in the train of intemperance . We pass to another result . It is not a little curious that we find among indiscriminate readers a counterpart to one of the most annoying characters in society . A just conception of the workings of this passion of novelty brings before us an individual who can not bear the solitude of his own thoughts-who has no high and noble object of pursuit , no lovi of nature or art , // no fondness for useful books , no true devotion to the well-being of others ; but one nevertheless who is all the more active abroad for not having any solid satisfaction at home-moving hither and thither to give vent to his morbid excitements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed their fires . Of course , the effect of his missions can only be to stir up jealousy and alienation between neighbors , and to create dissensions man otherwise peaceful community . The mischiefs wrought in a village by only a few individuals of this character , all have had more or less occasion to see and to deplore . For though they have no discipline of mind , they are yet remarkably gifted with the power of speech . The tongue , under the influence of this spirit , is so nicely balanced , as to be moved by every breath of scandal in the neighborhood ; and hence originate those " whisperings which separate chief friends , " and those " evil surmisings , " which poison the very fountains of social order . The law of happy social intercourse requires that much of what we daily see and hear should be buried in silence ; and he is a wise man who can make the necessary discrimination , and a well balanced man , if " he offend not in word . " But this law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their minds by yielding to this passion for new things . The consequence is the introduction of evils , which seriously mar the beauty and order of social intercourse , and weaken , if they do not sunder , those ties of friendship from which we derive so much of our earthly happiness . How often we have occasion to notice that " the countenance of Laban is not towards us , as before . " What can have caused this change ? What serpent has crept into our Paradise , and turned it into such a howling wilderness ? In nine cases out of ten , the cause can be traced to the " all devouring tongue , " moved by the passion " either to tell , or to hear some new thing . " Now it deserves to be considered that the passion which makes the busy-body in society , differs not from that passion which seeks gratification in fictitious representations of life . It is the story  --  the plot  --  the incidents-so arranged and managed as to put the mind in suspense and keep curiosity awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inveterate novel reader . But we need not confine the analogy to the reader of light literature . One may read sober fact with no other purpose than to while away time . Even history , biography and travels may be perused without an effort to acquire permanently valuable knowledge , but merely from the desire to hear some new thing . In either case , when this is the sole object of reading , there result most disastrous consequences , // the loss of relish for useful acquisitions in literature , the decay of memory and the weakening of the powers of reflection and meditation . But the evils already enumerated , as growing out of a ruling love of novelty , are light as air , compared to the injury it does in the department of morals and religion . Here , and here alone , is the one thing needful . He who fails here , is a bankrupt in character and hope forever . " What can a man give in exchange for his soul ? " He may have such mental discipline and stores of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the world will not willingly let die ; he may also be the delight and ornament of the social circle , and by the amenity of his disposition and his genial deportment , send the gladdening light of his own spirit through all his neighborhood ; but all this will not avail him at the final judgment , if his heart is controlled by the law of sin . How the passion of which we are speaking affects this great interest is now the question . Religion is a matter both of the intellect and the heart ; and both the intellect and the heart are nourished and strengthened by truth . Whatever either affects those habits of mind which are necessary to the full appreciation and enjoyment of the truth , or makes the presentation of the pure and sublime truths of religion uncongenial to the mind , must either prevent the formation of a religious character at all , or , if formed , render it unstable , and exposed to the temptations of idle speculation and of novelties in matters of practical duty . We specify some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , that this passion for novelty , in the sense we have defined , prevents the formation of a reliable Christian character . Admitting the possibility that a man in these circumstances may be renewed in the spirit of his mind , we must yet believe , in view of the influences which are permitted to control his life , that he can not be rooted and grounded in the truth , because the fluctuations of feeling and opinion , caused by this master passion of his mind , will give him neither space nor disposition to study and obey the laws of Christian knowledge . Hence his views of duty must be as unsettled and various as the winds of doctrine , which may happen at different times to prevail around him . Men of this character once encountered Paul at Athens ; but as well might seed take root on the hard beaten highway , as his serious logic and truthful words have found a genial place in their minds . Had he been , as they at first supposed , " a setter forth of some strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own imagination , // they would doubtless have listened to his statements , and perhaps prepared a niche in some of their temples for the image of the new divinity . But when he revealed the true and only God , and the methods of his grace , it was more than they could bear . The love of novelty had made them too volatile to receive the truth , or to form a character based on Christian principle . Novelty may amuse , but it can not edify . It takes pleasure in contemplating imaginary scenes , but from the real desolations which evil passions have wrought in the heart , which only the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ can repair , it turns away with a cold indifference . In such an atmosphere a healthy religious character can not live ; on such nutriment it can not thrive . It demands for this purpose " the sincere milk of the word . " Truth , old and steady as the throne of God , must be in the heart , and send its vitalizing properties through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt its instructions to all the different habits and states of feeling in different men , and to all the trials and temptations that meet them in the outer world ; it also admits of illustrations rich , various , and sufficient to task and to satisfy the greatest minds : and yet all this is utterly offensive to the passion which seeks only for amusement , and seeks it mainly to drown the complaining voice of conscience , and to prevent the power of the world to come from making its intended impression on the soul . With such habits of thought and feeling , how can a reliable christian character be formed ? It deserves also to be mentioned , as another injurious effect of this spirit , should it take a pious turn , that it leads one to consider and treat religious subjects as mere abstractions rather than as involving the eternal welfare of the soul . How many reason and speculate on the disclosures of the Bible without feeling or desiring to feel the impulse of that faith which " is the substance of things hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The love of novelty may find much to gratify its taste in surveying the outposts of Christianity , as witness the multitudinous tomes of Neologising Germany . But neither the writers nor the readers of these books are led , in the anguish of an awakened conscience , to pray " God be merciful to me a sinner , " because the object is to give activity to the intellect rather than to correct a perverted heart . Here then is an evil as great as the loss of the soul . To treat religion as the child does the rainbow , is to make the one as impossible to be realized as to overtake and grasp the other . Men may speculate with all the eagerness of curiosity about the great truths of religion ; but if a childlike docility and a felt want of the remedy which the gospel reveals and offers to the guilty , be absent , they will // only speculate themselves out of eternal life . We must set it down , therefore , as one of the injurious consequences of the spirit in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the heart to the cross of the Redeemer . Moreover , it is a spirit which sets men at variance in matters of faith and practice , and thus does much to prevent the spread of religion in the world . The prejudices of education no doubt have much to do in causing and perpetuating this mischief in the Church , but the love of change quite as much , if not more . It demands something new-something fitted to give a fresh impulse to fancy even in this relation , where only the words of truth and soberness should be uttered or heard . That it will not keep the path trod by patriarchs and Apostles , is obvious alike from its nature , and the history of its manifestations . It must and will have a new line , not for its thought , ( for it does not really think ) but for its fancies . And to such a call , Joseph Smith responds with his Mormon Bible ; Davis with his puerile revelations , and Swedenborg with his misty nothings . The consequence is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unstable souls are beguiled from the right ways of the Lord . But the crowning evil , which follows in the train of this passion , and which has already been alluded to is , the loss of the soul : because its salvation is impossible , until the mind becomes absorbed in those same old doctrines , which melted the heart of Abel , and which from age to age have guided " the sacramental host of Cod 's elect " to the kingdom of Heaven . We are painfully impressed with the conviction that we do not overstate the matter . And if this is the case , is there not a great moral responsibility in relation to our reading , which is overlooked even by religious persons ? And are not those treading a perilous path , whose great aim , in reading and conversation , is to gratify a morbid appetite for those novelties which neither expand and strengthen the intellect , nor tend to purify the heart ; but which , on the contrary , serve only to increase their mental dissipation , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood by this remark as dealing out indiscriminate censure . The great works of the imagination produced by the masters of human thought , instead of weakening and dissipating the mind , fill the soul with lofty thoughts and pure and noble feelings . There are works of fiction , too , in the narrower sense of the ordinary novel , full of just and useful thoughts ; and there are readers , " who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both // good and evil . " The class of readers , to which we allude , are those who read works of fiction , not as a relief from severer Btudies and duties-not as a source of high intellectual enjoyment-not for the sake of improvement in any form , but to pass away time pleasantly , and to prevent the painful consciousness of the dreadful desolation of their souls . It is of such lovers of novelty and of novel reading , that we now speak . And the number of such seems to be increasing from year to year , and their appetite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It is enough ; stay now thine hand , " its constant and importunate cry is , Give , give . ' " And unhappily the supply of matter is equal to the demand . Many pens and presses are daily employed for this purpose , and hawkers of the light material are seen at every steamboat landing-in every railroad car  --  and in all the thoroughfares of business and places of recreation . And what is worse , this is almost the only kind of reading which has attractions enough to engage the interest of great and increasing numbers of the young in every part of our land . And such is its hold upon some of this class , that they can not consent to go even to the house of God upon the sabbath without taking with them the latest novel , with which to beguile the otherwise tedious hour . The consequences of this habit can not but be disastrous to all that is manly in intellect , or pure in morals and religion . The youth will grow to maturity , weak to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-lovers of their own selves-haters of the just claims of God , and prepared to aid in the introduction of that general licentiousness of manners , which draws after it the wrath of God . Nothing but the word of Christ , dwelling in us richly in all wisdom , can satisfy the cravings of an immortal mind . What we need is , to walk in the same old paths of justification by faith , in which the true hearted of other ages walked , and found the bliss for which we sigh . Then , fortified by habits of mental discipline , and by a conscious devotion to truth and purity , we shall " mount up on wings as eagles , " and " the joy of the Lord will be our strength . " Of this energy , we have the greater need on account of the peculiarly exciting character of our times , absorbing the thoughts of multitudes , and causing aspirations , which are not in the line of truth and righteousness . The new phases , which society is now often assuming ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the party questions , now so hotly discussed , are giving an importance to , and a taste for , the merely political newspaper , which may work out for the people a character , like that of the old // Athenians , " who spent their time in nothing else , but either to hear or to tell some new thing . " In the midst of these excitements , what place in the public estimation is the Bible likely to hold , that main-spring alike of christian enterprise and national prosperity ? Who will read Baxter 's " Call , " while the calls of novelty absorb the general attention ? Where are the men who go out like Isaac to meditate at even tide and think on those who think not on themselves ? Is it not time to pause and take the bearings of the public taste and settle our minds on the unchanging principles of God 's government ? " Thus saith the Lord , stand ye in the ways and see , and ask for the old paths , there is the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your souls . We end as we began , with the expression of an abiding conviction , that the duties involved in the intercourse which almost every one in an intelligent community must have with the world of authors and writers , are of the greatest importance , and deserving of far more attention than they have received . The question is not so much what we read as for what we read . It is a question that in its relations extends far beyond the common topics of declamation , a licentious newspaper press , and profligate French novels ; it embraces the whole circle of reading . It includes within its results , to a very considerable degree , the moral and intellectual character of the nation . No man can read all that is written , no one should wish to do it , if he could . A selection must be made . But the particular works which should be read , can not be selected either for the whole community , or for a class of the community , or for the individual . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the question .
