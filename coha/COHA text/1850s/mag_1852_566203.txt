txt ART . IL-ETHICS OF EDITORSHIP . Reply to the strictures of Lord Mahon and others , on the mode of editing the Writings of Washington : by JARED SPARKS . Cambridge , 1852 . THE pamphlet , bearing the above mentioned title , is a republication of three letters , which first appeared in the New York Evening Post , a month or two since . Ia February and March of last year , a writer for that paper , with the nom de plume , Friar Lubin , charged President Sparks with varying widely , in his edition of Washington 's writings , from the original manuscripts . A suspicion of this , he observes , he should not have thought of entertaining , had he not heard that Mr. Hallam had remarked " a striking difference between some of the letters given by Sparks , and letters purporting to be the same found in other compilations . " For the purpose of ascertainin* how far this suspicion was well founded , he made a comparison between certain letters of Washington , published by Mr. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , published in *xtracts only , by Mr. Sparks . The result of this comparison he claims to be , that Mr. Sparks has not only allowed himself grammatical and other verbal alterations , but has altered certain passages and suppressed others in such sort as materially to affect the sense . This charge has been repeated by Lord Mahon , in the newly published volumes of his " History of England , from the peace // of Utrecht . " This author , who is in general mild and moderate in his statements , indulges in severe and sweeping censures of what he conceives to be Mr. Sparks 's sins against the laws of editorship . He says in one place , in the appendix to his late volumes , that " Mr. Sparks has printed no part of the correspondence precisely as Washington wrote it , but has greatly altered , and as he thinks corrected and embellished it . Such a liberty with the writings of such a man might be justifiable , nay , even in some respects necessary , if Washington and his principal contemporaries had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the year 1838 , leaves , as I conceive , no adequate vindication for tampering with the truth of history . The charge , which I make upon this subject , is mainly derived from a comparison of Washington 's letters to President Reed , ( which in Reed 's biography are printed precisely from the original Mss. , ) and the same letters , as they appear in Mr. Sparks 's collections . " As Lord Mahon proceeds upon this to give the same proofs of his charge which Friar Lubin had furnished to the Evening Post , it is likely that his attention was first called to the subject by some American correspondent ,  --  either the writer for the Post , or some one else who sent his article to England . The Quarterly Review for April of this year endorses this charge of Lord Mahon 's , and it may now fairly be said to be published wherever the English language is spoken . Let us now look at the amount of the charge , the evidence sustaining it , and its bearing upon the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to do in a spirit of impartiality , without the slightest bias towards any of the plaintiffs , or towards the defendant . For President Sparks , and his services to American history , we entertain the highest respect*nd have no doubt that this respect will be greatly increased , when his original historical investigations in our history shall be given to the world . At the same time we have no disr*sition to defend him against fair proof of erroneous judgnzmant in his office of editor of Washington 's writings . Of F%.lar Lubin we know nothing , and do not allow ourselves to suspect who conceals himself under this signature . Lord Mahon , who is an eminently pleasing and readable historian , shows through his earlier volumes a mind above party prefridices , and a conscientiousness in his statements which entitles him to all respect , and we should receive a severe censure like that which we have quoted from him , as being forced from its author by the pressure of truth . The evidence to support this charge is principally drawn from about eighteen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Reed , who had been appointed by Washington his military secretary during the siege of Boston , and who afterwards , when called away by other duties , lived on very confidential terms with the commander in chief . A number of other // letters , pertaining to later years , from Washington to Reed , may be found in Mr. Sparks 's collection ; but if we understand the subject they were not copied from the original manuscripts , but drawn from another source , of which we shall presently speak . The letters in question Mr. Sparks pronounces to be the most imperfect that he has ever seen from Washington 's pen . " They were evidently written , " says he , " in perfect confidence , and without any thought that they would ever be published . I used more caution in selecting from these letters than from any others . " * Whether by this it is intended only that some letters were chosen for publication , or also that parts of letters were omitted , is not apparent . It would appear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he had a perfect right to do , both these liberties ; and particularly that in one or two instances he omitted certain passages out of regard to the memory of Washington . Thus in a letter of January 31 , l7 ? 6 , Washington allows himself the following severe words concerning the mother country : " A nation which seems to be lost to every sense of virtue , and those feelings which distinguish a civilized people from the most barbarous savages . " All this disappears in Washington 's writings . Now , as we just said , the editor had a right to omit passages or parts of letters , which for any reason he did not think worthy of publication . He was only making a selection out of an immense mass of letters , which would fill more than t'ixree times as many volumes as he actually published . At the sa*ne time it might have been well to indicate , by stars or otherwise , that a letter was not published entire ; and behind all this lay thb question , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation needed the propping up of omitting any ang*y sentence , whether this man of unexampled self-command ought Lot to be exhibited as he was ,  --  as at rare intervals losing his temper amid the perplexities of the moment . The verbal and compar*wively unimportant deviations from the original draft in these letters are numerous . One or two specimens must suffice . Waslington says , " old Put , " but in the edition of his writings appears " General Putnam . " So " Wooster " becomes " General Wooster , " while the " noble Enos " is softened down into " Enos . " Changes on grammatical accounts are tolerably numerous ,  --  far more so from the imperfect state of these letters , we have reason to believe , than in any other part of the correspondence . Wb propose to discuss // an editor 's duty in regard to the text of his author by and by : at present we only remark , that any changes to support a kind of stilted dignity in Washington seem uncalled for . " Old Put , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text . It is pleasant to see the grave , majestic Washington unbending like other people . And to some extent , at least , we would have even his grammatical inaccuracies , or at least his homely expressions ; preserved and handed down to posterity . One instance of an interpolated sentence is produced by Friar Lubin from Mr. Sparks's. edition of these letters , but without reason ; the pretext for the change being an omission in copying for Reed 's life . And in general it yet remains to be seen how many of the discrepancies between the two published texts of these letters are owing to mistakes in copying on the one or the other side . Beyond these eighteen letters there is no evidence that changes have been made in the text of Washington 's correspondence , except those which are of a grammatical nature . There is indeed a letter of the year 1778 , written to Reed , the text of which in Mr. Sparks 's work differs considerably from that in the life of Reed . But the explanation of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the harsh accusa* tion that Mr. Sparks had published a garbled edition of the manuscripts which were put into his hands . We say would have prevented , if known ; but we should rather say , ought ta have prevented ; for Mr. Sparks , in a preface to Washington 's writings , gives the following very clear and intelligible account of the Washington Mss. , from which it appears that a large part of them are likely to exist in two recensions , both proceeding from the same hand . " In regard to the text , also , it is proper here to repeat what has been said in another place , that frequent embarrassments have occurred . It was Washington 's custom , in all his letters of importance , first to write drafts , which he transcribed . In making the transcripts he sometimes deviated from the drafts , omitting , inserting , and altering parts of sentences ; nor did he always correct the drafts , so as to make them accord with the letters as sent to his correspondents . These imperfect drafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an amanuensis into the letter-books . Hence the drafts , as now recorded , do not in all cases agree precisely with the originals that were sent away . My researches have brought under roy inspection many of these original letters . Regarding them as containing the genuine text , I have preferred it to that of the letter-hooks , and it has accordingly been adopted whenever it could be done . " But the discrepancies are of little moment , relating to the style , and not to the substance . For the most part , I have been obliged to rely on the letter-books ; and , for the reasons here mentioned , it is probable that the printed text may not in every particular be the same as in the originals , that is , the corrected copies , which were sent to his correspondents . These remarks apply chiefly to private letters , written when Washington was at Mount Vernon , and to those written // during the French war . In the periods of the Revolution and the Presidency , much more exactness was observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is generally a literal accordance between the original letters and the transcripts in the letter-books . " Thus the letter in question , although differing from the other copy in nine places , differs from the text in the letter-books in but two , in putting a disaster for disaster , and log-houses for logged-houses . " Whether these corrections were made by me , " says Mr. Sparks , " or by the proof-reader , I can not undertake now to determine . " And similar discrepancies exist , as the editor of Washington 's writings shows , between other published letters , as they appear in Marshall 's Life of Washington , and as they appear in the collected works . While , therefore , we can not entirely acquit Mr. Sparks of an error of judgment as to the freedom of his alterations in the letters first mentioned , he has shown satisfactorily in his pamphlet that he is not responsible for by far the greater part of the differences between his text and that of manuscripts which have been or may yet be examined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before our readers , had we not felt that two or three points in the ethics of editorship deserve some discussion . There are questions of casuistry in this department of human activity , as well as everywhere else . And perhaps there are cases where it is as difficult to steer between the extremes of blind adherence to the litera scrzjpta , and of licentious wandering from it , as it is between those of scrupulous minuteness and vivid freedom in a narrative of events . In general , then , the question to an editor of another man works should be , not what he would wish to have written , but what he actually wrote . Possibly , if Porson could have been at the shoulder of Euripides while he was writing Hecuba or Phoeniss* , the English critic might have suggested useful alterations : here another order of words would have improved the verse , and there the pause might have been mended . But the question for Porson in editing the works of the dead man Euripides is , what is the actual text of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , indeed , when it is doubtful , be decided by considerations drawn from the prevailing practice , or the taste of the author who is edited . But we must by no means obtrude our subjective judgment upon him , or put our words in the place of his . We have met now and then with editors of the ancient classics , whose dealings with their authors were more in the style of a butcher than of a man who puts together delicate machinery . They hack and mangle that they may // mend again after their own fashion and to show their own skill . Their language is in substance , " if Demosthenes wrote so and so he was a fool . " But the obvious reply is , in the first place , that the folly may lie somewhere else , that the mote may be in the worthy editor 's eye , end again , that it is not inconceivable that Demosthenes did not always choose the best expression . Sometimes ,  --  we have a poet 's authority for it ,  --  bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wished to modernize Milton , and who , stumbling upon the unwonted accent in Leveled with right asp6ct his evening rays , altered it into Leveled with aspect right his evening rays . The alteration here was effected by transposition , the easiest of all changes , and the one most level to the meanest capacity . The good man thought , that if Milton had lived a little later , he would not have written as he did . Supposing him in the right , what excuse is that for the alteration ? Supposing him mistaken , as he undoubtedly was , did he not deserve a sound castigation for meddling with what was above him ? Fidelity to the manuscript text may sometimes involve the necessity of making the mistakes or follies of a deceased person known to the world . What is an editor or a biographer bound to do in this case ? This may sometimes be a hard question to answer , but in general , we have no doubt , the true and right answer should be , publish the truth , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you undertake to represent a deceased n*an before mankind , you should regard yourself in the light of a witness on the stand ; and your readers in that of the jurymen . Waat right have you , if you profess to give a full account of him or are the means of his giving a full account of himself , to conceal his faults or follies , any more than to forge virtues for him , which you know he did not possess , or to forge unreal passages in his history ? You are likely enough , if you should adhere strictly to the rules of truth , to give him more than his due , for you must insensibly contract a partiality for the man whose life you write , or whose works you publish . Why should you add to this almost inevitable bias the intentional suppression of passages in his life , which were as truly a part of him , although a small part , as his nobler traits of character . The scriptures present to us at this point a noble example of honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , the reli. * gious reviewers of Jewish life and history , would have cut oW the right hand , sooner than suppress blame where it was // needed . Doubtless , David 's crimes distressed him who first put them upon record , whether it was Nathan , or Gad or whatever nameless person ; but he wrote for God , and the interests of God and of truth weighed more with him than David 's reputation . He could no more whitewash over an unworthy character , than Micaiah could promise the wicked king of Israel to prophesy safety to him like his false prophets . But with all this we admit that the duty of the eulogist may be different from the duty of the professed biographer . The latter undertakes to describe a man as he is , while the former gratifies the natural desire of man to have the excellencies of a remarkable or cherished person spread out before their minds . While both agree in the obligation to say nothing which is not strictly true , the former may select but one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . But even he is bound not to attempt to eulogize a man , who on the whole does not deserve it ; he is bound , that is , to make a substantially true impression , although he may keep out of view minor blemishes , which the feelings of the audience and the time forbid him to notice . And so , also , an editor may select such parts of a correspondence as will give , on the whole , the most favorable view of the person whom he undertakes to bring before the public . He may omit letters or parts of letters , which a man would most probably keep out of sight , were he alive . He may pass lightly , if he sees fit , over the earlier documents which emanate from a character as yet unformed or imperfect , and give prominence to the later life of the wise and complete man . He may do this , we say , consistently with truth , because the later and mature character is that which needs to be put on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it is oftentimes the most interesting part of the study of a man 's life to watch the transition from the state of thoughtlessness and folly , as confidential letters manifest it ; and to compare the old and the new natare in their struggles and in the final victory of the latter . We feel thankful , for instance , to the biographer of Dr. Chalmers , for allowing us to see from the diary and correspondence , how light gradually broke upon his mind , how he began to pray for the Holy Spirit , how his thoughts by degrees wore a deeper tone and his aims became decidedly Christian . But it was quite unnecessary to publish the love-letters of Doddridge , and may be called even an act of injustice , because he soon outgrew the follies of his youth . The case would have been quite otherwise , had he fallen in his later years into new theological opinions : honesty would require that this developmen*t should be // given to the world , as an important chapter in his life , and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while an editor may use discretion in publishing or withholding manuscript matter , he is bound in most cases to make the fact known , both in the preface of his work , and by the proper indications , such as stars or dashes in each particular place . Thus no one will be deceived into arguing from the silence of a person whose diary or letters are published , that he had no concern in a transaction . We pass on now to a less important inquiry , which concerns itself not with the impression of character that an editor conveys , but with his treatment of the text . Here the point of most importance is the interest attaching to the manuscript . Is it interesting on a philological or merely on a historical or biographical account ? Is it the manuscript of an ancient author , or does it belong to modern time ? According to the answer given to such questions as these , will the importance rise and fall of preserving the exact form even in the minuti of spelling . In publishing an ancient manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words should be noticed and copied , wherever it is of importance , that is , wherever a word was spelled or has been supposed to be spelled in more than one fashion . In publishing a Saxon or an early English manuscript , perhaps the same rule should be followed , and it might even require that the spelling of the original should be fully represented in the printed text . But the further down we come , the less necessary it is that differences of spelling should be noticed . It is well known that even in the last century the women of England did not spell correctly ; it was Swift who told one of his intelligent lady-correspondents that she had too many letters in her words , although she had not too many words in her letters . But it surely would not be demanded of an editor that letters of so modern a period should preserve all the peculiarities of the manuscript . With regard to grammatical changes , the following rule may be laid down : that obvious slips of the pen , where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be silently corrected , but that faults in writing , arising from want of taste or of training , should ordinarily lie , without being touched , at their author 's door . The first part of this rule obviously depends upon the principle that the pen did not obey the mind , that by a wandering of attention during the writing , a word was passed over , or the wrong one put upon paper . Thus if we found in a letter " great many persons " instead of " a great many persons , " we should have no hesitation to cure the de // defect of grammar , before giving it to the world . With regard to mistakes of grammar or faults of style which are not involuntary and accidental , we think that the case is different . These pertain to the man himself , as much as his manners do , or his tones or gestures ; and to alter them is to alter the impression which the man would make . Or if more than this is done , the reader ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slovenly phrase is improved , brackets , or some other typographical expedient must give notice that the editor has been at work ; or if he is determined to make a thorough revision of his author 's style throughout , he ought to give notice of the fact in the preface , and run the risk of lowering the value of the work in the eyes of all judicious persons . Alterations by editors in works which have long been the property of the public , such as religious treatises or hymns , rest on another ground . There are many valuable religious writers , such as Baxter , or Howe , or Edwards , who are extremely wordy and extremely careless , but yet rich and profound . We see no objection to publishing abridgmnents of such works , where due notice of the fact is given ; and this has been a very general practice . It is implied , of course that no opinion of the author is affected or omitted by this curtailing process . Omissions of doctrine , or suppressions of particular passages in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if avowed ; and dishonest , if not avowed . If deceased authors have any rights , the most valuable of these is that they shall speak to posterity as they think , that no " medica manus " of an editor shall stop their mouths , or soften down their words into mere inanity . No kind of composition has been considered so much in the light of " animalia ferce natura ? " as religious hymns . Any editor who conceives that he has a vocation for it , may mutilate or alter them as he sees fit . There are books where it would seem as if undue length in the hymn were , more than anything else , dreaded . Lest the minister should give out too many verses , they are with tolerable uniformity cut down to four verses or under ; and of course thoughts are imperfectly expressed , a subject is unfinished , a gap is allowed , and the lyric entireness of the original is shamefully destroyed . *rhei'e are books , also , where alterations for the purposes of the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in spoiling almost evei.y thing that was touched . Other alterations undertaken on aesthetic or theological grounds have proved still worse . We recollect still our feelings when we first noticed in a hymn-book , which shall be nameless , many years ago , the lines // " My God , I cry with every breath For some kind power to save , " adulterated into " My God , I cry with every breath , Exert thy power to save . " As if any one were in danger of supposing that help was to come from some other source than God . Such things as this would be literally crimes , if ignorance could not be pleaded in mitigation . Happily there has been good taste enough in our country to demand back again the old hymns nearly as their authors wrote them . The newest hymn-books show a decided advance upon their immediate predecessors , in fidelity to the original . The public opinion now pretty plainly is , that , while the practical end in view in a collection of religious poems altows of some changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done without imperative reas6ns , and upon very mature consideration . If a hymn is too long , contrivances are easily introduced , such as the insertion of one or more verses in brackets , by which a part may be omitted in the reading before a congregation . It is usually a crime of booksellers rather than of editors when garbled editions of English books by living authors are published . If the omissions are duly confessed on the title page or in the preface , there is no imposition upon purchasers . But it is rather hard , where a man buys the latest publication , rejoicing in the thought that it cost less than half of an English copy , to findhimself as much deceived in regard to the entireness of the work , as a lady would be on finding a large piece gone from the middle of the silk she had purchased for a dress . There have been some curious proceedings of this kind , and if they were all collected together in one list , it would be a pretty formidable one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Quarterly Review have been suppressed more than once , lest the sensitive ears of Brother Jonathan should tingle , and he should withdraw his subscription . The present bishop of Oxford too might have some reason to complain that " the unfeigned faith which dwelt first " in his father on the matter of slavery was not allowed to show itself in his book on the Anglican Church in the United States , lest it should be offensive to his high-church , slave-holding friends . As a matter of course , if books containing indignation or remonstrance upon one subject are to be re-printed at the south , they must be made to . roar like a sucking-dove ; or to hold their tongues altogether , lest a committee of inquisition destroy the printing house and the printer both . But less violent motives are the usual explanations of the mutilated editions of English works rQ-printed here . // Sometimes they are too long , and certain chapters , or an appendix , or a body of notes , often more important than everything else , must be struck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiars , who are in the habit of advising such mutilations , that this may sometimes be a perilous thing ; the noise of it may be bruited abroad through the land , the unsuspecting be warned , and the edition meet with no sale . It is difficult to decide how far a received text ought to be altered upon the discovery of its incorrectness . And with regaid to the text of the scriptures this question becomes one of great delicacy and importance . On the one hand , nine-tenths of the emendations upon which all critics would agree are of little or no importance , and perhaps would not affect our English version at all . On the other , there are passages of great ( loctrinal weight , like Acts xx , 28 , and 1 Tim . iii , 16 , where the true text is so doubtful that two orthodox critics , of equal honesty , might come to different conclusions respecting it . In neither of these cases do the interests of truth seem to require that the existing text should be disturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John v , 7 , in which all competent judges concede that there is an interpolation , and which many persons omit when they read the context in public . Do not truth and honesty require that such a passage should be struck out of our English Bibles , a passage which Luther would not express in his translation , and which did not creep into the German Bible until nearly fifty years after his death ? Would the shock of its insertion in brackets , or of its disappearance flom our version , do as much harm as the display of Christian honesty and of true reverence to the genuine word of God would do good ? We suggest that a number of biblical critics , of approved character for orthodoxy , should move in this matter , and demand at least a careful consideration of this text . We can not but believe that the state of the case is so plain as to admit of but one conclusion . And we can not think that anything would prevent the change from being effected , but an unworthy timidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article was made up there has appeared in the North-American for July a review of Lord Mahon 's last volumes , in which the editor of Washington 's Wrifings is vindicated . In the main we have the same views with the writer of that article as to editorial morality ; but we differ from him in regard to the amount of freedom allowed to ati editor in correcting his author 's style , and in regard to the propriety of exempting Washington 's writings from the ordinary rules .
