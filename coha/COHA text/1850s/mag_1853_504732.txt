NAPOLEON BONAPARTE . BY JOHN S C. ABBOTT ITALY AND SPAIN . MUCH has been said respecting certain secret articles in the Treaty of Tilsit Napoleon and Alexander privately agreed to unite their forces against England , if she , refusing the mediation of Russia , should persist , as she had now done for ten years , in embroiling the Continent in war . They also agreed to combine against Turkey , should the Porte repel the mediation of Prance The two powers also engaged , should England refuse peace , unitedly to summon Sweden , Denmark , Portugal , and Austria to close their ports against English merchandise . Such were the terms of the occult treaty . Napoleon , concentrating all his energies to the promotion of the prosperity of France , patiently awaited the result of the negotiations commenced by Russia with England . He sent a special emhassador to Turkey to endeavor to secure peace between that power and Russia He was successful . The Turk accepted his mediation , and the sword was sheathed . England , finding herself abandoned by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She strove to counteract the peaceful influence of France , by justly representing that Alexander was hungering for the provinces of the Turkish Empire . By these means she ere long roused Turkey again to war The mediation of Russia with England , was entirely unsuccessful . The cabinet of St. James at first evaded the application , and then proudly , contemptuously , and with an energy which amazed the world , rejected all overtures . Briefly we must ' *record this new act of English aggression , which roused the indignation of all Europe . The kingdom of Denmark had most studiously maintained neutrality Jealous of the increasing power of Prance , she had stationed the Danish army upon her frontiers Apprehendiiig nothing from England , her seaboard was entirely unprotected . Napoleon , with delicacy but with firmness , had informed Denmark , that should England refuse the mediation of Russia , all the powers of Europe must choose in the desperate conflict , the one side or the other . The most perfectly friendly relations then existed between England and Denmark . The cabinet of St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Continental alliance against the sovereign of the seas , resolved to take possession of the Danish fleet . This fleet , unprotected and unconscious of peril , was anchored in the harbor of Copenhagen Denmark , at peace with all the world , had but 5000 troops in the fortresses which surrounded her metropolis . Secretly the English government fitted out an expedition . It consisted of 25 sail of the line , 40 frigates , 377 transports . About 30,000 men were conveyed in the fleet . Suddenly this powerful armament appeared in the waters of the Sound , and landing 20,000 man , under the command of the Duke of Wellington , then Sir Arthur Wellesley , invested the doomed city by land and by sea . An agent was immediately dispatched to the Prince Royal of Denmark , then regent of the kingdom , to sunimon the surrender of the fortresses and of the fleet . Mr. Jackson , a man of insolent manners and of envenomed spirit , was worthy of the mission . He assigned to the Prince , as a reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the passage of the Sound , and to take the Danish fleet , lest both should fall into the power of the French He therefore demanded , under peril of a bombardment , that the fortress , the port of Copenhagen , and the fleet should be immediately surrendered to the English army . He promised that the whole , when the danger was over , should be returned again to Denmark , and that in the mean time the English would conduct as friends , and pay for all they should consume . " And with what , " exclaimed the indignant Prince , " would you pay for our lost honor , if we were to accede to this infamous proposal 3 " Mr. Jackson replied , " War is war . One must submit to its necessities . The weaker party must yield to the stronger . " The interview was short and hitter . The parties separated . The Prince , unable to present any resistance , heroically enveloped himself in despair . The English envoy returned to the fleet , and the signal was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English had taken with them an immense quantity of heavy artillery . They were also accompanied by Colonel Congreve , who was to make trial , for the first time , of his destructive rockets As there were a few thousand regular troops behind the ramparts of the city , it was not deemed prudent to attempt to carry the place by assault . The English having established themselves beyond the reach of danger , reared their batteries and constructed their furnaces for red-hot shot . Calmly , energetically , mercilessly , all their arrangements for the awful deed were consummated . They refrained from firing a single gun , until their furnaces were completed , and their batteries were in perfect readiness to rain down an overwhelming storm of destruction upon the helpless capital of Denmark . Nothing can be imagined more awful , more barbarous , than the bombardment of a crowded city Shot and shells have no mercy They are heedless of the cry of mothers and of maidens . They turn not from the bed of languishing , nor from the cradle of infancy . Copenhagen contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace and prosperity . On the evening of the 2d of September , the appalling storm of war and woe commenced . A tremendous fire of howitzers , bombs , and rockets , burst upon the city The very earth trembled beneath the terrific thunders of the cannonade . During all the long hours of this dreadful night , and until the noon of the ensuing day , the destruction and the carnage continued . The city 50 // was now on fire in various quarters . Hundreds of dwellings x ore blown to pieces . The streets were red with the blood of women and children . Vmt columns of smoke rose from the burning capital . The English waited a few hours , hoping that the chastisement had been sufficiently severe to induce the surrender . General Peymann , intrusted with the defense of the metropolis , gazed upon the spectacle of woe around him , his heart almost bursting with grief and indignation . He still maintained a firm and gloomy silence . The conflict in his bosom , between the dictates of humanity and the pleadings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the evening the English recommenced their fire . They kept it up all night , the whole of the next day , and the ensuing night . Two thousand of the citizen . had now perished Three bundred houses were burned to the ground . Two thousand dwellings had been blown to pieces by the shells . Half of the city was in flames . Several beautiful churches were in ruins . The arsenal was on fire . For thr e days and three nbrhts those demoniac engines of death , exploding in thronged street , in churches , chambers , parlors , nurseries , had filled the city with carnage , frightful beyond all conception . There was no place of safety for helpless infancy or for decrepit age . The terrific shells , crushing through the roofs of the houses , descended to the cellars , bursting , with thunder peal , they buried the mangled forms of the family in the ruins of their dwellings . Happy were they who were instantaneously killed . The wounded , struggling hopelessly beneath the ruins , were slowly burned alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shells , flying in every direction , produced ghastly mutilation . The mother , distracted with terror , saw the limbs of her infant torn from its body . The father , clasping the form of his daughter to his bosom , witnessed with a delirium of agony , that fair form lacerated and mangled hideously in his arms The thunders of the cannonade , the explosion of shells , the crash of falling dwellings , the wide wasting conflagration , the dense volumes of suffocating smoke , the shrieks of women and children , the pools of gore in parlors and on pavements , the mutilated forms of the dying and of the dead , presented a spectacle which no imagination can compass General Peymann could endure this horrible massacre of women and children no longer Copenhagen was surrendered to England . The victors rushed into the city . Almost every house was more or less shattered . One eighth part of the city was in ashes It required the utmost exertions of both friend and foe to arrest the conflagration They found about fifty vessels , ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession . Two ships of the line upon the stocks were burned ; three frigates were also destroyed . All the timber in the shipyards , the tools of the workmen , and an immense quantity of naval stores , were conveyed on board the English squadron . From the ramparts and the floating batteries they took 3500 pieces of artillery . The prize money divided among the crew amounted , as estimated by Admiral Lord Gambier , to four millions , eight hundred thousand dollars . One half of the English crews were then put on hoard the Danish ships . The entire expedition , leaving the hapless metropolis of the Danes drenched with blood and smouldering with fire , made sail for the coast of England . With triumphant salutes and streaming banners of victory , the squadron entered the Thames Such was the emphatic response which the cabinet of St. James gave to Napoleon 's earnest appeal for peace , through the mediation of Russia . The Duke of Wellington had just returned from boundless conquests in India . At Copenhagen he commenced that European career , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition returned to London , the Iron Duke received the thanks of Parliament for the skill and efficiency with which he had conducted the bombardment Copenhagen and Waterloo ! The day is not far distant when England will he willing to forget them both. * * Say the Berkeiy men in the Napoleon Dyn ty , Sir Arthur Weiiesiey had been recaiied from the East Indies , where he had achieved ail his fame hitherto , by a career of robbery and crime , extortion , murder , and ihe extinction of nations , compared with which Napoleon 's worst acts of usurpation , in the height of his ambition , paled ints iniignificance And here we will allow troih to arrest us lhr a single moment , while we enter our protest against asy of the complaints of England or of English writers about the usurpatiens of Napoleon . For the sole purpose of self-ag , , randizemene England has robbed more territory , taken mere lives , confiscated more property , enslaved more men , and wrought wider and darker ruin on the plains of Asia , than Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hut one sentiment throughout all Europe . Nowhere was it more severely condemned than in England . Distinguished members of both houses of Parliament , and the masses of the people raised a loud cry of indignation . Lord Grenville , Addington , Sheridan , Grey , and others , most vehemently expressed their aborrence . All idea of peace was now abandoned . England on the one hand , and Napoleon on the other , prepared for the most desperate renewal of the strife Russia was extremely anxious to wrest from the Turks the provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia upon the Danube She would thus make a long stride toward Constantinople . The Turks , unaided by other powers , could not prevent this conquest . Napoleon was reluctant to allow Russia to make such an advance toward the Empire of the East . With great hesitancy he was at times half disposed , for the sake of securing the friendship of Alexander , to consent to this encroachment . the British cabinet immediately dispatched a messenger to Alexander to endeavor to secure his favor , by offering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to Austria , to dispose her to see with calmness Moldavia and Wallachia become the property of the Russians . The English embassador at St. Petersburg endeavored to apologize for the affair of Copenhagen . He said that the British mirpsters had merely endeavored to deprive the common enemy of Europe of the means of doing mischief ; that Russia ought to rejoice over the event instead of being irritated by it ; that England relied upon Rtissia . to bring back Denmark to a more just appreciation of the occurrence , and that the fleet should be returned to the Danes if Denmark would join against Napoleon . Alexander was indignant , and returned a haughty reply Diplomatic intercourse between the two countries soon ceased . Alexander immediately sent for General Savary , the envoy of Napoleon , and thus addressed him : " You know that our efforts for peace have ended in war I expected it . But I confess I did not expect either the Copenhagen expedition , or the arrogance of the British cabinet Mv resolution is taken , and . I am ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow that conduct which shall best suit your master I have seen Napoleon I flatter myself that I have inspired him with a part of the sentiments with which he has inspired me . I am certain with , if upon his single head were to rain down the curses of every widow and orphan made in Europe for a quarter of a century It is unholy mockery of truth , it is puritanic cant , it is English spite against Napoleon 's eagles England began under the administration of Pitt , the work of crushing the French Republic . She kept it up to gratify the ambition and spite of her ministers , and she carried it through to maintain the position she had taken It was all a costly , and well-nigh a fatal mistake for En , , iand . And her historians have no business what . ever , to vent their spleen upon the only man on the Co - tinent who ventured to set limits to the proud empire of Britain . " Strong and impassioned as is this utterance , it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I could see him as at Tilsit-every day , every hour . What talent for conversation ! What an understanding ! What a genius ! How much should I gain by living frequently near him ! How many things he has taught me in a few days I But we are so far distant ! However , I hope to visit him soon " Alexander requested permission to purchase muskets from the French manufactories . " I desire , " said he , " that the two armies , now destined to serve the same cause , may use the same weapons . " He also solicited permission to send the cadets , who were to serve in the Russian navy , to France for their education . These friendly expressions were accompanied by a magnificent present of furs , for the Emperor Napoleon . " I wish to be his furrier , " said Alexander . Napoleon was greatly embarrassed . The cordial friendship of Alexander gratified him . He perceived the intensity of desire with which this ambitious monarch was contemplating Constantinople , and a mighty empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadow Europe , and to subjugate the world . " Leaning upon the north pole , " with her right hand grasping the Baltic , and her left the Dardanelles , she might claim universal sovereignty Nothing would satisfy Alexander but permission to march toward the East . Napoleon earnestly desired his friendship , and also feared to make concessions too dangerous for the repose of Europe He sent Caulaincourt to St. Petersburg , as his confidential embassador ; informed him fully of his embarrassments* and urged him to do every thing in his power to maintain the alliance without encouraging the designs of Alexander upon the Turkish Empire . That Caulaincourt might worthily represent the great nation , Napoleon allowed him the sum of 160,000 dollars a year , and placed in his suite several of the most distinguishe 'd young men of France . He also wrote a letter to Alexander , thanking him for his presents , and returning still more magnificent gifts of S*vres porcelain . Denmark promptly threw herself into the arms of Napoleon . A strong division of French troops , at the solicitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alexander himself , having been brought under the fascinations of Napoleon 's mind at Tilsit was perfectly enthusiastic in his admiration of his new ally . But the Russian nobles , having never seen the great enchanter , trembled at the advance of democratic freedom The republican equality of France would elevate the serf and depress the noble . The Czar was willing that his haughty lords should lose a little of their power , and that his degraded serfs should become a little more manly . Hence there arose two parties in Russia . One , headed by the haughty Queen Mother , and embraced by most of the nobles , was for war with France , the Emperor was at the head of the less numerous and the less influential peace party . Caulaincourt , conscious of the hostility stillex isting in the bosoms of the Russian nobles toward Napoleon , sent an employe into the circles of the old aristocracy at Moscow , to report to him what was said there . Freely the nobles censured the sudden change at Tilsit , by which the young Czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commerce of Russia a deadly blow . Nothing , they said , could compensate for such sacrifices but obtaining possession of Moldavia and Wallachia . Napoleon , however , they affirmed , will never allow Russia to take those fine provinces Caulaincourt immediately transmitted these particulars to Napoleon He assured the Emperor that notwithstanding the sincerity of Alexander , the court of Russia , deeply mortified , could not be relied upon . Napoleon pondered the question long and anxiously . The alliance of Russia was of vital importance . The aggressive power of Russia , overshadowing Europe with its gloom of despotism , was greatly to be dreaded . The Turks , having deposed , imprisoned , and finally put to death Sultan Selim , the friend of Napoleon , were now cutting off the heads of all who were in favor of alliance with France The agents of England *ere busy in rousing the barbarian Turks . They did not hold themselves accountable for the excesses which ensued . Napoleon was not much troubled with conscientious scruples about transferring the sovereignty of Turkish provinces to Russia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained by fire and sword-by outrages , the recital of which causes the ear to tin0le . The right of proud despots to rob a people of liberty and of happiness is not a very sacred right . Bad as was the government of Russia , the government of Turkey was still worse . Napoleon consequently did not hesitate to consent to the transfer of these provinces because he thought it would be wrong , but simply because bethought it would be impolitic . The Turkish government waging now a savage war against him , and in alliance with England , his ever relentless foe , could claim from his hand no special protection . Napoleon could not , however , merely step aside , and let Turkey and Russia settle their difficulties between themselves . Turkey and England were now united as one power against France . I'he Turks , in defiance of Napoleon 's mediation , had renewed the war against Alexander . France was consequently pledged by the treaty of Tilsit to unite her armies with those of Russia . Under these circumstances Napoleon proposed a conference with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Turkish question . He alto suggested a grand , gigantic enterprise , of t lie three united powers , to cross the continent of Asia , and attack the English in the territories which they had invaded in india . Austria was deeply interested in this matter . Already she was overshadowed by the colossal empire of the North . To have the mouths of the Danube , the Mississippi of Austria , in the hands of the Turks , indolent as they were , was bad enough . The transfer of the portals of that majestic stream // to the custody of her great rival , Russia , was to be resisted at all hazards . Alexander received the proposal of a conference with transports of joy The acquisition of the coveted provinces would add to the glory of his reign , would immeasurably increase the prospective greatness of Russia , and would compel the nobles to a cordial approval of his alliance with France . So deeply was Alexander excited , that he read the letter of Napoleon with trembling eagerness . Caulaincourt , who had delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " exclaimed Alexander , again and again , as he read the welcome lines , " the great man the great man ! Tell him that I am devoted to him for life . My empire , my armies , are all at his disposal . When I ask him to grant something to satisfy the pride of the Russian nation , it is not from ambition that I speak . I wish to give him that nation whole and entire , and as devoted to his great projects as I am myself . Your master purposes to interest Austria in the dismemberment of the Turkish empire . He is in the right . It is a wise conception . I cordially Join in it . " He designs an expedition to India . I consent to that too . I have already made him acquainted , in our long conversations at Tilsit , with the difficulties attehding it . He is accustomed to take no account of obstacles . Nevertheless the climate and distances here , present such as surpass all that he can imagine . But let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportioned to the difficulties . We must come to an understanding about the territories which we are going to wrest from Turkish barbarism This subject , however , can he usefully discussed only in an interview between me and Napoleon . As soon as our ideas have arrived at a commencement of maturity , I shall leave St Petersburg , and go to meet your Emperor at whatever distance he  |p1eases  . I should like to go as far as Paris . But I can not . Besides , it is a meeting upon business which we want , not a meeting for parade and pleasure . We might choose Weimar , where he would be among our own family . But even there we should be annoyed by a thousand things . At Erfurt we should be more free , more to ourselves . Propose that place to your sovereign . When his answer arrives I will set out immediately . I shall travel like a courier " Here originated the idea of the celebrated conference which was soon held at Erfurt . After many long interviews between the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Napoleon for his consideration . The one proposed but a partial division of the Turkish empire . The Turks were to *e left in possession of the Dardanelles , the Bosphorus , and of all their Asiatic possessions Russia was to have the coveted provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia , upon the left of the Danube , and Bulgaria upon the right . Austria , as a consolation for seeing the Colossus of the North take so long a step toward universal power , was to receive Servia and Bosnia Greece was to be emancipated from its Turkish oppressors , and placed under the protection of France The second plan was bold and gigantic in the extreme . All of Europe and all of Asia Minor were to be rescued from Turkish sway . Russia was to gratify her long and intensely cherished ambition , in taking possession of Constantinople , and all the adjoining provinces on each side of the Bosphorus . Austria was to receive a rich accession to her territory in the partition All of Greece , all the islands of the Archipelago , the straits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be transferred to France . Such were the plans proposed by the Russian cabinet to Napoleon It was not deemed prudent to affix any signature to a paper containing propositions of such startling magnitude . As the documents were placed in the hands of the French embassador to be conveyed to Napoleon , Alexander , whose ambition was excited to its highest pulsations , said to him : " Tell Napoleon that this note meets my full approbation . It is an authentic expression of the ideas of the Russian cabinet . " * * This extraordinary document , so characteristic of the times , and of the iiiustrious personages then , by their position and energies , controlting the fate of Europe , we give in fuil , unaitered and unabridged : " Since his Majesty , the Emperor of the French and the King of Italy , &amp;c. , has recently adjudged that in order to attain a general peace , and to secure the tranquillity of Europe , it would be expedient to weaken the Ottoman empire , by the dismemberment of its provinces , the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is ready to concur in it . " The first idea which could not fail to present itself to the Emperor of all the itussias , who is fond of calling to mind the occurrences at Tilsit , when this overture was made to him , was that the Emperor , his ally , purposed to proceed immediately to the execution of what the two monarchs had agreed upon in the treaty of alliance relative to the Turks ; and that he added to it the proposal of an expedition to India " It had been settled at Tilsit that the Ottoman power was to be driven back into Asia , retaining in Europe nothing but the city of Constantinople and Roumelia . " There was drawn at the same time this consequence , that the Emperor of the French should acquire Albania , and Morea , and the island of Candia . " Wallachia and Moldavia were next allotted to Russia , giving that empire the Danube for its boundary , comprehending Bessarabia , which is in fact a strip of sea-coast , and which is commonly considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added Bulgaria , the Emperor is ready to concur in the expedition to India , of which there had been then no question , provided that this expedition to India , as the Emperor Napoleon himself has just traced its route , shall proceed through Asia Minor . " The Emperor Alexander applauded himself for the idea of gaining the concurrence of a corps of Austrian troops in the expedition to India , and as the Emperor , his ally , seemed to wish that it should not be numerous , he conceives that this concurrence would be adequately compensated by awarding to Austria Turkish Croatia and Bosnia . unless the Emperor of the French should find it convenient to retain a portion of them There might , moreover , be offered to Austria a less direct but very considerable interest , by settling the future condition of Servia , incontestably one of the fine provinces of the Ottoman empire , in the following manner . " The Servians are a warlike people , and that quality , which always commands esteem , must excite a wish to regulate their lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just vengeance against the Turks , have boldly shaken off the yoke of their oppressors , and are , it is said , resolved never ti .. // Upon receiving this communication , Napoleon peremptorily refused his assent to the latter plan . No consideration could induce him to permit Russia to take possession of Constantinople . He was ready to break the alliance , and to see that immense power again arrayed against him , rather wear it again . In order to consolidate peace , it seems necessary , therefore , to make them independent of the Turks . " The peace of Tilsit determines nothing in regard to them . Their own wish , expressed strongly and more than once , has led them to implore the Emperor Alexander to admit them into the number of his subjects . This attachment to his person makes him desirous that they should live happy and content , without insisting upon extending his sway . His Majesty seeks no acquisition that could obstruct peace . lie makes with pleasure - this sacrifice , and all those which can contribute to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to erect Servia into an independent kingdom , to give its crown to one of the Archdukes who is not the head of any sovereign branch , and who is sufficiently remote from the succession to the throne of Austria ; and in this case it should be stipulated that this kingdom should never be incorporated with the mass of the dominions of that house . " This whole supposition of the dismemberment of the Turkish provinces , as explained above , being founded upon the engagements at Tilsit , has not appeared to offer any difficulty to the two persons commissioned by the two Emperors to discuss together the means of attaining the ends proposed by their Imperial Majesties . " The Emperoc of Russia is ready to take part in a treaty between the three emperors which should fix the conditions above expressed ; but on the other hand , having conceived that the letter which he recently received from the Emperor of the French seemed to indicate the resolution of a much more extended dismemberment of the Ottoman empire than that which had been projected betWeen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of the three imperial courts , and particularly in order to give the Emperor , his ally , all the proofs of friendship and deference that are in his power , has declared that , without wanting a further diminution of the strength of the Ottoman Porte , he would cheerfully concur in it . " He has laid down as a principle of his interest in this greater partition , that his share of the increased acquisition should be moderate in extent or magnitude , and that he would consent that the share of his ally in particular should be marked out of much larger proportion . His Majestyhas added that beside this principle of moderation he placed one of wisdom , which consisted in not finding himself by this new plan of partition worse placed than he is at the present in regard to boundaries and commercial relations . " Setting out with these two principles , the Emperor Alexander would see , not only without jealousy but with pleasure , the Emperor Napoleon acquire and incorporate with his dominion , in addition to what has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyprus , Rhodes , and even whatever is left of the seaports of the Levant , Syria , and E , ypt . " In case of this more extensive partition , the Emperor Alexander would change his preceding opinion respecting the state of Servia . Studying to form an honorable and highly advantageous share for the house of Austria , he should wish that Servia should be incorporated with the mass of the Austrian dominions , and that there should be added to it Macedonia , with the exception of that part of Macedonia which France might desire in order to fortify her Albanian frontier , so as that France might obtain Salonichi This line of the Austrian frontier might be drawn from Scopia to Orphane , and would make the power of the house of Austria extend to the sea . " Croatia might belong to France or to Austria , as the Emperor Napoleon pleases . " The Emperor Alexander can not disguise from his ally that , finding a particular satisfaction in all that has been said at Tilsit , he l ) laces , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions of the house of than thus betray the liberties of Europe . " Constantinople , ' said Alexander , " is the key of my house . " " Constantinople ! " exclaimed Napoleon . " It is the dominion of the world . " The possession of European Turkey will enable Russia to bid defiance to every foe . The Austria between theirs , in order to avoid the point of contact , always so liable to cool friendship . " The share of Russia in this new and extensive partition would have added to that which was awarded to her in the preceding plan , the possession of the city of Constantinople , with a radius of a few leagues in Asia ; and in Europe , part of Rournelia , so as that the frontier of Russia , on the side of the now possessions of Austria , setting out from Bulgaria , should follow the frontier of Servia to a little beyond Solismick , and the chain of mountains which runs from Solismick to Trayanpol inclusive , and then the river Moriza to the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second plan of partition , there has been this dillerenes of opinion , that one of the two persons conceived that , if Russia were to possess Constantinople , France ought to possess the Dardanelles , or at least to appropriate to herselfthat whichwas on the Asiatic side . I his assertion was contested , on the other part , upon the ground of the immense disproportion proposed to be made in the shares of this new and greater partition , and that even the occupation of the fort would utterly destroy this principle of the Emperor of Russia not to be worse placed than he now is in regard to his geographical and commercial relations . " The Etnperor Alexander , moved by the feeling of his extreme friendship for the Emperor Napoleon , has declared , with a view to remove the difficulty ; istly . That he would agree to a military road for France , running through the newpossessions ofAustria and Russia , opening to her a military route to the ports of Syria . 2ndly . That , if the Emperor Napoleon wished to possess Smyrna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the point of that coast which is opposite to Mitylene to that which is situated opposite to Rhodes , and should send troops thither to conquer them , the Emperor Alexander is ready to assist in this enterprise , . by joining , for this purpose , a corps of his troops to the French troops . Idly . That if Smyrna , or any other possession on the coast of Natolia , such as has just been pointed out , having come under ths dominion of France , should afterward be attacked , not merely by the Turks , but even by the English , in hatred of that treaty , his Majesty the Emperor of Russia will , in that case , proceed to the aid of his ally , whenever he shall be required to do so . " 4thly . His Majesty thinks that the house of Austria might , on the same footing , assist France in taking possession of Salonichi , and proceed to the aid of that port whenever it shall be required of her . " ithly . The Emperor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south coast of the Black Sea , which is in Asia , though , in the discussion , it was thought that it might be desirable for him . " 6thly . The Emperor of Russia has declared that whatever might be the success of his troops in India , he should not desire to possess any thing there , and that he would cheerfully consent that France should make for herself all the territorial acquisitions in India which she might think fit . And*that it should be likewise at her option to cede any portion of the conquests which she might make there to her allies . " If the two allies agree together in a precise manner , that they adopt one or the other of these two plans of partition , his Majesty the Emperor Alexander will have extreme pleasure in repairing to the personal interview which has been proposed to him , and which could perhaps take place at Erfurt . He conceives that it would be advantageous if the basis of the engagements that are to made there , were previously fixed with a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to the extreme satisfaction of seeing one another but that of being enabled to sign without delay the fate of this part of this globe , and thereby , as they purpose to themselves , to force England to desire that p ace from which she now keeps aloof willfully and with such boastittg.

The the liberal opinions which France was every foresight of Napoleon anticipated this question . where diffusing . She was inconsolable for the " In half a century , " said he , at St. Helena , loss of Italy .

How then could she resist France and Russia combined ! England , always unpopular , had become absolutely odious to Europe by her conduct at Copenhagen . Yet through England alone could Austria hope to regain Italy , and to retard the appalling growth of Itussia . Napoleon was perfectly frank in his communications with the court of Vienna . There was no occasion for intrigue . He sincerely wished to unite Austria and Russia with France , that , upon perfectly equitable terms , peace might be forced upon England . He desired notbing so much as leisure to develop the resources of France , and to make his niajestic empire the garden of the world Weary of contending with all Europe against him , he was willing to make almost any concessions for the sake of peace . " England , ** said he , " is the great enemy of peace . The world demands repose . England can not hold out against the strongly expressed unanimity of the Continent . " The Austrian court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continental alliance . An envoy was dispatched to the court of St. James , with two messages . The one was public and for the ear of Europe . It declared that France , through the mediation of Russia , had proposed equitable terms for peace ; and , that , if England now refused peace , all nations must combine against her , The other message was secret and deceitful It stated that Austria , left alone upon the Continent , could not resist France and Russia There was a little blending of magnanimity in the addition , that England ought to think of peace ; that if she still persisted in war her best friends would be compelled to abandon her . The Austrian embassador was also commissioned boldly to declare , that the act , perpetrated at Copenhagen , was an outrage which was deeply felt by every neutral state . About this time Napoleon left Paris for a tour through Italy .

Even Josephine had received no previous notice On the morning of the 21st , his chariot wheels were rattling over the pavements of Milan . Eugene was taken by surprise Immediately on the morning of his arrival , Napoleon visited the Cathedral of Milan , where a Te Deum was chanted . His pensive and impassioned spirit ever enjoyed the tolling of bells , the peal of the organ , the swell of the anthem , the dim religious light , struggling through aisles and groined arches , and amidst the pillars and gorgeous adornings of the most imposing temples of wow*hip . His serious and earnest nature was never attuned to mirthfulness . THE RETURN FEOM ITALY . // THE FLIGHT OF THE PORTUGUESE COURT . qwq ing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wherever he appeared , by the most enthusiastic acclamations of the people . On the road , he met the King and Queen of Bavaria , whose daughter Eugene had married , his sister Eliza , and his brother Joseph , whom he most fondly loved . The three royal bands united . In one meteor of splendor they swept gorgeously along over the hills and through the valleys of rejoicing and regenerated Italy . Arrivin g at Venice , the authorities , and a vast population , awaited him in gondolas decorated with silken hangings and with streaming banners . He was floated along the crystal streets of the proud queen of the Adriatic , enveloped in the most exultant strains of music , and in shouts of welcome The barges were indeed freighted with a magnificent company . The Emperor was attended by the Viceroy of Italy and his noble bride , by the King and Queen of Bavaria , the King of Naples , Eliza the Princess of Lucca , Murat the Grand-Duke of Berg , and by Berthier the Grand-Duke of Neufehatel . Venice , exulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon would annex her to the highly-favored Kingdom of Italy . In the midst of these scenes of festivity , Napoleon 's energies were all engrossed in devising works of great public utility . He visited the dock-yards , the canals , the arsenal , accompanied by efficient engineers . An enterprise , was immediately commenced for rendering the waters of Venice navigable for ships of any burthen He organized an administration for keeping die canals in good condition , and for deepening the lagoons He decreed a basin for seventy-four gun ships , a grand canal , hydraulic works of immense importance He instituted a free port into which commerce might bring merchandise , before the payment of duties . The public health was provided for by transferring burials from churches to an island cemetery . The pleasures of the people were not forgotten . The beautiful place of St. Mark , rich in historical associations , and the pride of Venice , was repaired , embellished , and brilliantly lighted . Hospitals were established . Such were the benefits which Napoleon conferred upon Venice In that flying visit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , than Austria had attempted during ages of misrule . It was for the glory which such achievements would secure , that his soul hungered . He received , in return , the heartfalt acclamations of a grateful people . But Venice , and other large portions of Italy , had b en wrested from the domination of Austria . The cabinet of Vienna was watching , with an eagle eye , to fall upon this king of democracy , and to regain her lost possessions . Leaving Venice he inspected the principal fortifications of the Kingdom of Italy . At Mantua he had appointed a meeting with his brother Lucien . For some time they had been partially // estranged . Napoleon e*rnestly desired a recon &gt;iliation . Lucien had secretly married , for a second wife , the widow of a Parisian banker . He was a high-spirited man , of commandinr talent and decided character , and was not at all disposed to place himself under the guidance of his brother 's mind . Napoleon , conscious of his own power , and seldom distrusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would execute his plans . The private interview as protracted till long after midnight . Lucien left in tears . The brothers could not agree in their views , though they retained a cordial esteem for each other . But little can be known respecting this interview , except what is related hy Baron Meneval , Napoleon 's secretary . He says : " After having received the orders of the Emperar , I went , about 9 o'clock in the evening , to eek Lucien Bonaparte at the inn where he bad alighted . I conducted him to the cabinet of the Emperor . The interview was protracted till long after midnight . Lucien , upon leaving , was extremely a*itated . His eyes were flooded with tears . I reconducted him to the inn . There I learned that the Emperor had made the most pressing solicitations , to induce Lucien to return to France and to accept a throne ; but that the conditions imposed wounded his domestic affections and his political independence . He charged me to make his adieu to the Emperor , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding his brother inflexible , gave him time to consider his propositions . lie charged his brothers and his ministers , Talleyrand and Fonchd , to urge his acceptance . They could accomplish nothing . Napoleon regretted to he deprived of the co-operation of a man , whose noble character and exalted talents he highly esteemed . The eagerness , with which Lucien hastened to  |p1-ce  himself by his brother 's side , in the hour of adversity , is his best eulogy. ' * It is a noble testimonial of the private virtues of 1 ) 0th of these men , that when Napoleon was imprisone ( 1 upon the rock of St. Helena , Lucien applied to the British government for permission to share his captivity . He offered to go , with or without huis wife and children , for two years . He engaged not to occasion any augmentation of expense , and premised to submit to every // restriction imposed upon his brother , or that might be imposed upon himself either before his departure or after his return Napoleon immediately left Mantua for Milan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , he found innumerable letters awaiting him from all parts of Europe . England began now to suffer very severely from the operation of the Berlin decrees . She could not sell her goods Her capitalists were failing . Her manufactories were crumbling to ruin . Her workmen were starving . The Continent on the con trary was by no means proportionately afflicted . Napoleon had opened new channels of traffic . The arts and manufactures were generally in a state of prosperity . Under the influence of this exasperation , England issued some new orders in council . They were more rigorous and severe than the first . By these decrees England reaffirmed the blockade of France , and of all the continental states in alliance with France . She also declared all vessels , of whatever nation , lawful prize , which were bound to France or to any of her allies , unless such vessels had cleared from , or touched at , some English port . These neutral ships were ordered to pay in England a duty of twentyfive per cent . for all goods which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nation except Great Britain , to France or to any of her allies . Thus England endeavored to remunerate herself , by a tax upon the commerce of the world , for Napoleon 's refusal to purchase her goods . Napoleon , upon receiving at Milan , these orders of the British cabinet , immediately issued , in retaliation , his famous Milan decree . In his Berlin decrees he excluded from the port.s of France and of her allies , every English vessel , or every vessel which had touched at an English port , and which might thus be supposed to have on board English goods . He refused to have any commercial intercourse whatever with his belligerent neighbor , until England should manifest a more pacific spirit . As England confiscated all French property which could be found upon the ocean , Napoleon confiscated all English property he could find upon the land . But in the Milan decrees , imitating the violence of England , and as regardless of the rights of neutrals as was his powerful foe , he declared every vessel denationalized , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these British orders , by paying the duty demanded . " These rigorous measures , ' said he , " shall cease in regard to any nations which shall have caused the English government to respect the rights of their flags . They shall continue with regard to all others , and never be released till Great Britain shows a disposition to return to the laws of nations , as well as to those of justice and honor " Thus England declared all ships , of whatever nation , lawful prize , which should fail to touch at her ports and pay duty Napoleon declared all lawful prize which should consent to touch at English ports and pay duty . VOL . VH-No 37. -E Beneath the gigantic tread of these hostile powers , weaker nations were trampled in the dust . Napoleon , in his Milan decree , remarked , " All the sovereigns of Europe have in trust , the soyereignty and independence of their flags . If , by an unpardonable weakness , such a tyranny is allowed to be established into a principle , and consecrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to assert the same as a right , as they have availed themselves of the tolerance of governments to establish the infamous principle that the flag of a nation does not cover goods , and to give to their right of blrckade an arbitrary extension which infringes on the sovereignty of every state . " He , however , immediately communicated to the American government , that his commercial decrees were not intended to apply to the United States . " The United States of America , " he afterwards said to the Legislative Body , " have rather chosen to abandon commerce and the sea , than acknowledge their sla ery to England . " Napoleon also learned at Milan that England had ordered the troops , returning triumphantly from Copenhagen , to proceed to Portugal . In the harbors of that feeble power , which was in reality but a colony of Great Britain , and at the impregnable fortress of Gibraltar , which she had wrested from Spain , England was assemblinv the most formidable forces . Napoleon immcdiately informed Spain , his unreliable ally , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Napoleon left Milan , the grateful Italians voted the erection of a monument to perpetuate the memory of the benefits which their illustrious benefactor had conferred upon them . Napoleon then hastened to Piedmont , and examined the magnificent fortress which he was rearing at Alexandria . Thence he went to Turin , rousing wherever he appeared the energies of the people , and scattering benefits with a liberal hand . He ordered the channel of the Po to be deepened , that it might be navigable to Alexandria . He marked out the route , with his own consummate engineering skill , for a canal to unite the waters of the Po and of the Mediterranean . He opened a high road over Mount Genevre , thus constructing a new route between France and Piedmont . Seven bridges , at his imperial command , with graceful arches , sprang over as many streams For all these useful expenses his foresight provided the financial means It is not strange that voluptuous kings , dallying with beauty , and luxuriating in all sensual indulgence , should have dreaded the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal ease and comfort , was consecrating his whole being to the elevation of the masses of mankind . It is but just to Napoleon to contrast the benefits which he conferred upon Italy , and upon every country where he gained an influence , with the course which England pursued in the vast territories which she had . conquered in India . " England , " says Burke , " has erected no // churches , no hospitals , no palaces , no schools . England has built no bridges , made no high roads , cut no navigations , dug out no reservoirs . Were we to be driven out of India this day , nothing would remain to tell that it had been possessed during the inglorious period of our dominion by any thing better than the ourangoutang or the tiger . " Napoleon left Turin enveloped in the acclamations which he so richly merited . Josephine , in whose bosom bliss and agony were struggling for the supremacy , sat at his side . She loved her magnificent husband with a fervor which has , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his most extraordinary and unremitted attentions , his burning words of love , attested the sincerity with which he reciprocated the affection and the homage of his wife . She well knew that this strange , fascinating man , intensely as he loved her , would tear from his heart every quivering fibre of affection , if he deemed it essential for the accomplishment of his plans . On the evening of the 1st of January , 1808 , he returned to Paris . The court and the city authorities immediately thronged the 1'uileries with the offerings of their heartfelt homage . The rejoicing Parisians filled the garden ; bells rang ; illuminations blazed . The acclamations of hundreds of thousands , filling the air with the sublime roar of human voices , proclaimed to Napoleon , in terms not to be misunderstood , that he was enthroned in the hearts of his people . Napoleon immediately turned his whole attention to the affairs of Portugal and of Spain . A more perplexing question was never presented to the human mind . The kingdom of Portugal consists of a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish peninsula . In extent of territory it is about equal to the State of Maine . An ignorant and inefficient population of about three millions , debased by ages of oppression , loitered over its fields . Portugal was so entirely under the influence of the British cabinet , that it was virtually a colony of Great Britain English ships filled her harbors . The warehouses of English merchants crowded the streets of her cities . Napoleon transmitted a note to the Portuguese government requiring Portugal openly to esrouse the one side or the other in the great conflict . If Portugal was willing to cast in her lot with the continental alliance , she was required , like the other powers , to close her ports against England , and to confiscate all the English goods in her territory . A diplomatic correspondence immediately ensued . All the communications of Napoleon were sent by the Portuguese government to the British ministers . Mr. Canning admitted in Parliament that the cabinet of St. James dictated the replies . The evasive answers which were returned , Napoleon perfectly understood . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rescue Portugal from the dominion of the English . Resistance was in vain . None was attempted ; not a gun was fired ; not a drop of blood was shed . A small army under General Junot , crossed the Pyrenees , and ad-* vanced with rapid steps toward Lisboii . The people , sunk in the lethargy of debasement , gazed upon the march of these French columns with unconcern . They were too , much oppressed to love their wretched rulers . They were too deeply debased to cherish any noble aspirations for liberty . The council at Lisbon was divided . Some were in favor of adhering to the English alliance , and with the aid of the English army and navy to oppose Napoleon . Others were for joining the continental alliance , and for abandoning England altogether . Others recommended that the whole court , with all the treasure which could be suddenly accumulated , should forsake Portugal , and retire across the Atlantic to their far more extensive possessions in Brazil . This majestic Portuguese province , in South America , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as large as the little kingdom of Portugal . The latter plan was suddenly adopted , when it was announced to the imbecile court that Junot was within two days ' march of Lisbon . The Queen of Portugal was insane . The Prince Regent governed in her stead . A fleet of thirty-six ships of war and merchantmen were in the harbor of Lisbon ready to receive the regal retinue . It was the 27th of November , 1807 A cold storm of wind and rain swept the streets . But not an hour was to be lost . The Queenmother , her eyes rolling in the wild frenzy of the maniac , the princes , the princesses , nearly aM the members of the court , and most of the noble families , crowded through the flooded streets on board the squadron . Innumerable carts thronged the great thoroughfares , laden with plate and the priceless paintings and the sumptuous furniture of the regal palaces . All the money which could by any possibility be accumulated by the energies of the government and by the efforts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quays were covered with treasures of every kind , drenched with rain and spattered with mud . Carriages were rattling to and fro conveying families to the hurried embarkation . Men , women , children , and servants , to the number of eight thousand , rushed , in a tumultuous mass , on board the squadron . The precipitation was such that , in several of the ships , the most necessary articles of food were forgotten . In the confusion of the embarkation husbands were separated from wives , and parents from children , as the mass was swept along by diverse currents into the different ships . They remained in the most anxious suspense respecting each other 's safety until the termination of the voyage . An English fleet was cruising at the mouth of the Tagus , to protect the court in its inglorious flight . In a gale of wind , the fleet pressed out of the harbor . The British squadron received it with a royal salute . Sir ' Sydney Smith , who had command of the squadron , dispatched // a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in Rio Janeiro . Scarcely had the receding sails vanished in the distant horizon , ere Junot made his appearance . He entered Lisbon with hut fifteen hundred grenadiers . A population of three hundred thousand souls raised not a hand in resistance . Thus Portugal strangely passed* like a dream of enchantment , from the control of England into the hands of Napoleon . A branch of the family of Bourbon occupied the throne of Spain . King Charles IV . was a gluttonous old man , imbecile in mind , impotent in action , dissolute in life . He was utterly despised . His wife , Louisa Maria , a Neapolitan princess , was as shameless a profligate as could be found in any dwelling of infamy in Spain . Manuel Godoy , a tall , graceful , handsome young soldier , was one of the body-guard of the King . Entirely destitute of moral principle , without any high intellectual endowments , he still possessed many attractions of person and of mind . He sang beautifully . He touched the lute with skill . He had romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows of the dark towers of the Escurial , and sang passionately the plaintive and the burning songs of Spain . The Queen , from the sunny clime of Italy , and from the voluptuous court of Naples , was the child of untamed passions . She heard the warbling voice of the young soldier ; sent for him to the palace ; lavished upon him wealth and honors , and surrendered her husband , the government , and her own person , without reserve , into his hands . The imbecile old king , happy to be relieved from the cares of state , cordially acquiesced in this arrangement . He also , in the inconceivable depths of a degradation which revolted not from dishonor , loved Godoy , leaned upon his shoulder , and called him his protector and friend . In consequence of the treaty of Basle , which Godoy effected , he received the title of the Prince of Peace . " Every day , " said Charles IV . to Napoleon , " winter-as well as summer , I go out to shoot from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chase , which I continue till sunset . Manuel Godoy then gives me a brief account of what is going on , and I go to bed to recommence the same life on the morrow . " Such was the employment of this King of Spain during the years in which Europe was trembling , as by an earthquake , beneath the martial thunders of Marengo and Austerlitz , of Jena and Auerstadt , of Eylau and Friedland . Charles IV . had three sons-Ferdinand , Carlos , and Francisco . Ferdinand , the heir-apparent to the throne , was at this time twenty-five years of age . He was as imbecile as his father , and as profligate as his mother . " Our son Ferdinand , " said Louisa , " has a mule 's head and a tiger 's heart . " The young prince was anxious to ascend the throne . The great majority of the nation were with him . The people , disgusted with the deb*.rchery of the court , thought that *iny change must be for the better The once mighty empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gulf of anarchy , poverty , and ruin . Godoy , the upstart favorite , was detested . Plots and counter-plots filled the realm . Spain was the disgrace of Europe Neither the King nor the Queen had political foresight enough to care for the movements of Napoleon . Godoy hated and feared that mighty - mind , that majestic intellect , which was overthrowing feudal thrones , and bringing up into the light of day the energies and the rights of the masses . Ferdinand was accused by Godoy , and probably justly , of an attempt to poison father , mother , and minister . The heir-apparent was arrested and thrown into prison . The populace , from hatred to Godoy , espoused the cause of the imprisoned prince . Ferdinand aided in arousine them . An enormous mob of countless thousands , with knives and bludgeons , surrounded the palace of Godoy . The I* ( ing 's troops dared not attack them . The terrified favorite fled to the garret , and rolled himself up in a pile of old mats , among the cobwebs , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed in an inundation through his magnificent parlors ; swarmed up the stairs and through the chambers . Sofas , mirrors , paintings , were hurled from the windows , and dashed in pieces upon the pavements . Two young ladies , the guilty favorites of Godoy , were carefully conducted to a carriage , and removed to a place of safety . The tramp of the mob was heard upon the floor of the garret . Godoy trembled in aiiticipation of a bloody death . The dusty mats concealed him . Night came and went . Day dawned , and its long , long hours lingered slowly away . Still the wretched man , tortured with hunger and thirst , dared not leave his retreat . Another night darkened over the insurgent city . The clamor of the triumphant mob filled all hearts with dismay . The trembling minister survived its protracted agony . For thirty-six hours he had now remained , cramped and motionless , in his retreat . In the dawn of the third morning , intolerable thirst drove him from his hiding-place . As he was creeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shouted the alarm . The cry resounded from street to street . In confluent waves the masses rushed toward the palace . The wretched victim - his garments soiled and torn , his hat gone , his hair disheveled , his features haggard with terror and suffering-was thrust into the streets . A few mounted troops of the King , with gleaming sabres , cut their way through the throng . They seized him by his arms , and upon the full gallop dragged him , suspended from their saddles , over the rough pavements . The mob , like ravening wolves , rushed and roared after him . Half-dead with frightand bruises , Godoy was thrown , for'protection , into the nearest prison , and the gates were closeJ against his pursuers . The exa. *1*'r*ted populace , with loud imprecations and vows of vengeance , turned their fury upon the dwellings of the friends of the hated favorite . House after house was sacked . And 63 // now , the portentous cry was heard , " To the Palace ! " The scenes of the French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terror . Visions of dungeons and guillotines appalled their weak and guilty spirits . The king , to appease the mob , issued a proclamation dismissing Godoy , and abdicating the throne in favor of his " well-beloved son , Ferdinand . " It was a perfidious abdication , insti* , ated by force , and which the king had no intention to respect . He , accordingly , immediately appealed to Napoleon for help . Imploringly he wrote as follows : " I have resigned in favor of my son . The din of arms , and the clamor of my insurgent people , left me no alternative but resignation or death . I have been forced to abdicate . I have no longer any hope but in the aid and support of my magrianimous ally , the Emperor Napoleon . " Ferdinand , also , immediately wrote to secure the support of the great Emperor He spared no uxpressions of adulation , and no efforts of sycophancy to secure that end . He wrote : " The world daily niore and more admires the greatness and the goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ferdinand the most faithful and devoted son . Ferdinand implores , therefore , the paternal protection of the Emperor . He also solicits the honor of an alliance with his family . " It will be remembered , that when Napoleon was upon the cold summit of the Landgrafenberg , the evening before the battle of Jena he received information that Spain , nominally his ally , was perfidiously entering into an alliance with England , and was rising in arms against him . Napoleon was far away in the heart of Prussia , struggling against the combined hosts of Russia , Prussia , and England . The Bourbons of Spain treacherously seized upon that moment to rouse the Peninsula , to fall with daggers upon the back of that friendly monarch , who had neither done nor meditated aught to injure thein. * Had Napoleon lost the battle of Jena , the fanatic peasantry of Spain , headed by the troops and the officers of England , would have rolled , like an inundation , down the passes of the Pyrenees , upon the plains of defenseless France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Napoleon , in an hour , would have been hurled from his throne . The rejected Bourbons would have been forced upon France . It was midnight , dark and gloomy , when Napoleon , by the fire of his bivouac , read the dispatches announcing this act of perfidy . His majestic spirit was too deep and tranquil in * " A convention , " says Aiison , " was secretiy coneluded at Madrid , between the Spanish government and the Russian embassador , to which the court of Iiiben was biso a party by which it was agreed , that as soon as the favorable opportunity was a*ived , by the French armies being far advanced on their road to Bertin , the Spanish government should commence hostilities in the Pyrenees , and invite the English to co-operate . " tt is impossible to rouse in our hearts any very vehement cenotions of indignation against Napoleon , for adopting effectual msasures to secure himself from the repetition . f such perfidy its flow , to admit of peevishness or irritability . Calmly he smiled , as he folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , " shall be replaced by princes of my own family . " The next day , upon the fields of Jena and Auerstadt , the Prussian monarchy was ground to powder . The Spanish Bourbons , terrified at the unexpected result , hastily sheathed the sword which they had drawn . Upon sycophantic knees they bowed before the conqueror . But Napoleon well knew , and Europe well knew , that the treacherous court was but waiting and watching its opportunity to strike a deadly blow . It was under these circumstances that the Spanish Bourbons were compelled , by the pressure of their family corruptions , to appeal to Napoleon for protection . Napoleon was exceedingly embarrassed . In no other period of . his life did any vacillation ever seem to mark his course . Here he appeared to take one step after another with no settled plan . There were but two things which he could do , each of which seemed to be equally portentous of danger . He could , by his almost miraculous powers , overthrow the Bourbons , and place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that noble country , by throwing into it the energies and the sympathies of popularized France . Thus he would secure a cordial alliance , and be protected in his rear , should the great northern powers , who were still in heart hostile , again combine against him . But there was an aspect of unfairness in this transaction against which his spirit revolted . It would arouse anew the angry clamor of Europe . The feudal monarchs would justly regard it as a new triumph of popular right against the claims of legitimacy-as a terrific exhibition of the encroachments of revolutionized France . It would thus add new venom to the bitterness with which the republican empire was regarded by all the feudal monarchies . On the other hand , Napoleon could sustain Ferdinand upon the throne . For Godoy and Charles were not to be thought of . He could endeavor to give Ferdinand a wife of exalted character , imbued with Napoleonic principles , who would control his weak mind , and lead perfidy in the path of fidelity and truth . After long and anxious reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he at last decided upon the latter plan . In his reply to Ferdinand he wrote that it would be necessary for him to investigate the charges brought against the Spanish prince , for he could not think of forming an alliance with a dishonest son . He immediately began to look around for a wife for Ferdinand . But young ladies of commanding intellect , of exalted character , and who can appreciate the grandeur of a noble action , are rare . The saloons of the Tuileries and of St. Cloud were full of pretty girls . But Napoleon searched in vain for the one he wanted . His brother Lucien , residing in Italy , a repining yet voluntary exile , had a daughter , by a first marriage  --  a brilliant girl , who had teen living in comparative neglect with her father . // NAPOLEON BONAPARTE . Napoleon fixed upon her , and called her to Paris . He , however , deemed it necessary , before making her Queen of Spain , thoroughly to understand her character . He , consequently , gave orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , this young lady , brought up in exile with the impetuous , estranged , yet noble-hearted Lucien , had been accustomed to look with an envious eye upon her uncles and aunts who were filling the thrones of Europe . Her lofty spirit was not disposed to conciliation . Proudly she made no effort to win the love of her relatives . With much sarcastic talent she wrote about Napoleon and all the rest of the family . When the letters were placed in the hands of the Emperor , he good-naturedly smiled as he perused them , and rather maliciously summoned his mother , brothers , and sisters to a family meeting at the Tuileries . The witty letters were read to the assembled group . Napoleon , accustomed to every conceivable kind of attack , was exceedingly diverted at the sensitiveness of his relatives . He , however , promptly decided that Charlotte did not possess the proper requisites to infuse his spirit into the monarchy of Spain . The following day she was on the road for Italy . It was , for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a more brutal , inhuman , utterly worthless creature , than this Ferdinand subsequently proved himself to be . Had she , however , married Ferdinand , it is not improbable that the destinies of the world might have been changed . Napoleon regretted this disappointment . He still shrunk from the odium of dethroning the Spanish Bourbons . All circumstances , however , seemed peculiarly to combine for the promotion of that end . A French army , . under Murat , had entered Spain , partly to be ready to quell any rising in Portugal , and partly to assist Spain to resist an anticipated attack from the English . Madrid was now occupied by French troops . The monarchy was entirely in Napoleon 's power . Still he was greatly perplexed . What secret thoughts were revolving in his mind , no one can tell . He divulged them to no one . Even those who were most entirely in his confidence , and upon whose co-operation he most fully relied , in vain attempted to penetrate his designs . Indeed , it is not probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . Napoleon was at St. Cloud , when he received intelligence of the abdication of Charles IV . It was Saturday evening . The next morning , he attended public worship . All observed his absent and abstracted air . Immediately after service , he called General Savary , the Duke of Rovigo , to walk with him under . the trees of the park . During an earnest conversation of two hours , he thus addressed him : " Charles IV . has abdicated . His son has succeeded him . This change has been the result of a revolution in which the Prince of Peace has fallen . It looks as if the abdication were not altogether voluntary . I was prepared for changes in Spain . They are taking a turn altogether different from what I had expected . I wish you to go to Madrid . See our embassador . Inquire why he could not have prevented a revolution in which I shall be forced to intervene , and in which I shall be considered as implicated . Before I can recognize the son , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally . It is with him that I have contracted engagements . If he appeals for my support , he shall have it . Nothing will induce me to recognize Ferdinand , till I see the abdication duly legalized . Otherwise a troop of traitors may be introduced into my palace during the night , who may force me to abdicate , and overturn the state . When I made peace on the Niemen , I stipulated that if England did not accept the mediation of Alexander , Russia should unite her arms with ours , and compel that power to peace . I should be indeed weak , if having obtained that single advantage from those whom I have vanquished , I should permit the Spaniards to embroil me afresh on my weak side . Should I permit Spain to form an alliance with England , it would give that hostile power greater advantages than it has lost by the rupture with Russia . I fear every thing from a revolution of which I know neither the causes nor the object . " I wish , above all things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a species of sacrilege . But I shall not hesitate to incur its hazards , if the prince who governs Spain embraces such a policy . Had Charles IV . reigned , and the Prince of Peace not been overturned , we might have remained at peace . Now all is changed . For that country ruled by a warlike monarch disposed to direct against us all the resources of his nation , might , perhaps , succeed in displacing by his own dynasty my family on the throne of France . You see what might happen if I do not prevent it . It is my duty to foresee the danger , and to take measures to deprive the enemy of the resources they may otherwise derive from it . If I can not arrange with either the father or the son , I will make a clean sweep of them both . I will re-assemble the Cortes , and resume the designs of Louis XIV . I should thus be in the same situation with that monarch , when he engaged , in support of his grandson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same political necessity governs both cases . I am fully prepared for all that . I am about to set out for Bayonne . I will go on to Madrid , but only if it is unavoidable . " The same day , the Duke of Rovigo , with these instructions , set out for Madrid . The next morning Napoleon wrote as follows to his brother Louis , the King of Holland : " The King of Spain has just abdicated . The Prince of Peace has been imprisoned . Insurrectionary movements have shown themselves at Madrid . The people demand me , with loud cries , to fix their destinies . Being convinced that I shall never be able to conclude a solid peace with England , till I have given a great movement on the Continent , I have resolved to put a French prince on the throne of Spain . In this state of affairs , I have turned my eyes to you for the // threne of Spain . Say at once , what is your opinion on that subject . You must be aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 men in Spain , yet , according to circumstances , I may either advance directly to my ohject-in which case , every thing will be concluded in a fortnight  --  or be more circumspect in my advances , and the final result appear after several months ' operations . " Two days after the writing of this letter , Napoleon again appears to be in a state of great uncertainty . He wrote the following letter to Murat , who was then in Madrid : " Monsieur the Grand-Duke of Berg-I am afraid lest you should deceive me with respect to the situation of Spain , and lest you should also deceive yourself Events have been singularly complicated by the transaction of the 20th of March . 1 find myself very much perplexed . Do not believe that you are about to attack a disarmed people , or that you can by merely showing your troops subjugate Spain . The revolution of the 20th of March proves that the Spaniards still possess energy . You will have to do with a new people .

If they are alarmed for their privileges and existence , they will bring into the field against us levies in mass , which might eternize the war . I am not without partisans . If I present myself as a conqueror , I shall have them no longer . The Prince of Peace is detested , because he is accused of having - betrayed Spain to France . This is the grievance which has assisted Ferdinand 's usurpation . The popular is the weakest party . The Prince of the Asturias does not possess a single quality requisite for the head of a nation . That will not prevent his being ranked as a hero , in order that he may be opposed to us . I will have no violence employed against the personages of this family .

England will not let the opportunity escape her of multiplying our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she maintains on the coast of Portugal and in the Mediterranean , and enlists into her service numbers of Sicilians and Portuguese . The Royal Family not having left Spain to establish itself in the Indies , the state of the country can only be changed by a revolution . It is , perhaps , of all others in Europe , that which is the least prepared for one . Those who perceive the monstrous vices in the government and the anarchy which has taken place of the lawful authority , are the fewest in number . The greater number profit by those vices and that anarchy . I can , consistently with the interests of my empire , do a great deal of good to Spain . What are the best means to be adopted ? Shall I go to Madrid ? Shall I take upon myself the office of Grand Protector in pronouncing between the father and son ? It seems to me a matter of difficulty to support Charles IV . on the throne . His government and his favorite are so very unpopular that they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy of France . It is for this he has been made king . To place him on the throne would be to serve the factions which for twenty years have longed for the destruction of France . A family alliance would be but a feeble tie . My opinion is that nothing should be hurried forward , and that we should take counsel of events as they occur . It will be necessary to strengthen the bodies of troops which are to be stationed on the frontiers of Portugal , and wait . I do not approve of the step which your Imperial Highness has taken , in so precipitately making yourself master of Madrid . The army ought to have been kept ten leagues from the capital . " 1 shall hereafter decide on what is finally necessary to be done . In the mean time , the following is the line of conduct I judge fit to prescribe to you . You will not pledge me to an interview in Spain with Ferdinand , unless you consider the state of things to be such that I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave with attention and respect to the king , the queen , and Prince Godoy . You will exact for them , and yourself pay them , the same honors as formerly . You will manage so that the Spaniards shall have no suspicion which part I mean to take . You will find the less difficulty in this as I do not know myself . You will make the nobility and clergy understand that if the interference of France be requisite in the affairs of Spain , their privileges and immunities will be respected . You will assure them that the Emperor wishes for the improvement of the political institutions of Spain , in order to put her on a footing with the advanced state of civilization in Europe , and to free her from the yoke of favorites . You will tell the magistrates and the inhabitants of towns and the well-informed classes , that Spain stands in need of having the machine of her government re-organized , and that she requires a system of laws to protect the people against the tyranny and encroachments of feudality , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts . You will describe to them the state of tranquillity and plenty enjoyed by France , notwithstanding the wars in which she has been constantly engaged You will speak of the splendor of religion , which owes its establishment to the Concordat which I have signed with the Pope . You will explain to them the advantages they may derive from political regeneration-order and peace at home , respect and influence abroad . Such should be the spirit of your conversation and your writings Do not hazard any thing hastily . I can wait at Bayonne . I can cross the Pyrenees , and strengthen myself toward Portugal , I can go and carry on the war in that quarter . " I enjoin the strictest maintenance of discipline . The slightest faults must not go unpun // ished . The inhabitants must be treated with the greatest attention . Above all , churches and convents must be respected The army must avoid all misunderstanding with the bodies and detachments of the Spanish army . A single flash in the pan must not be permitted on either side . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may always be kept at a distance of several leagues from the Spanish corps . If war is once kindled , all would be lost . " Four days after writing this letter , on the 2d of April , Napoleon set out for the frontier . He was induced to take this journey , by the conflicting reports which were continually reaching him from Spain . Having spent a week at Bordeaux , intensely occupied in forwarding some important national works , he proceeded to Bayonne , an unimportant town at the foot of the Pyrenees . Josephine accompanied him . They arrived at Bayonne on the 15th of April . The next day Napoleon wrote to Ferdinand . In this letter he says : " You will permit me , under present circumstances , to speak to you with truth and frankness . I pass no decision upon the conduct of the Prince of Peace . But I know well that it is dangerous for kings to accustom their people to shed blood . The people willingly avenge themselves for the homage which they pay us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peace without involving in it the queen and the king your father . Your Royal Highness has no other claim to the crown than that which you derive from your mother . If this process degrades her , your Royal Highness degrades your own title . The criminality of Godoy , if it can be proved against him , goes to annihilate your right to the crown . I say to your Royal Highness , to the Spaniards , and to the world , that if the abdication of Charles IV . is unconstrained , I will not hesitate to acknowledge it , and to recognize your Royal Highness as King of Spain . " Ferdinand was endeavoring to blazen abroad his mother 's shame , and to bring Godoy to trial as his mother 's paramour . Napoleon thus delicately suggested to him that in dishonoring his mother , he did but invalidate the legitimacy of his own birth , and thus prove that he had no right to the throne of Spain . But the wretched creature was too debased to feel the sense of such dishonor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ever retaliated before . She told her son , to his face , and in the presence of others , that he was of ignoble birth , that her husband was not his father . Ferdinand hoped , by a personal interview with Napoleon , to secure his favor . He therefore left Madrid , and crossing the Pyrenees , hastened to Bayonne to meet the Emperor . A magnificent escort accompanied him . He took with him , as a friend and adviser , his celebrated tutor Escoiquiz . As soon as Charles , the queen , and Godoy heard of this movement on the part of Ferdinand , they were greatly alarmed . Fearing the infin ence of Ferdinand 's personal presence and uncontradicted representations , they resolved also to hasten to Bayonne , there to plead their cause before that commanding genius who had now their destiny under his own control . Napoleon received Ferdinand , immediately upon his arrival , with the most studied politeness . He treated him with magnificent hospitality . But he threw around the prince a golden chain of courtesy and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regaled him . A splendid retinue surrounded him . The degraded parents and the guilty favorite also soon arrived , bringing with them the two younger brothers of Ferdinand . They were received with every mark of attention . Napoleon , however , studiously refrained from recognizing the right of either party to the throne . He thus unexpectedly found the whole royal family in his power . Whatever hesitation he may previously have felt , in reference to the course to be pursued , he hesitated no longer . He had an interview with Charles IV . The old king , conscious of his utter inability to retain the throne , greatly preferred to place it in the hands of Napoleon , rather than in the hands of his hated son . He , therefore , expressed a perfect readiness to abdicate in favor of any prince whom Napoleon might appoint . Napoleon then sent for Escoiquiz , the tuter and minister of Ferdinand , and thus addressed him : " I can not refuse to interest myself in the fate of the unhappy king who has thrown himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly a compulsory act . My troops were then in Spain . Some of them were stationed near the court . Appearances authorized the belief that I had some share in that act of violence . My honor requires that I should take immediate steps to dissipate such a suspicion . " I would say further that the interests of my empire require that the house of Bourbon , the implacable enemy of mine , should relinquish the throne of Spain . The interests of your nation equally call for the same change . The new dynasty which I shall introduce will give it a good constitution , and by its strict alliance with France , preserve Spain from any danger on the side of that power which is alone in a situation seriously to menace its independence . Charles IV . is willing to cede to me his rights , and those of his family , persuaded that his sons are incapable of go4erning the kingdom , in the difficult times which are evidently approaching . " These are the reasons which have decided me to prevent the dynasty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteem Ferdinand . I am anxious to give him some indemnity for the sacrifices which he will be required to make . Propose to him , therefore , to renounce the crown of Spain , for himself and his descendants . I will give him , in exchange , Etruria , with the title of king , as well as my niece in marriage . If he refuses these conditions , I will come to an understanding with his father . // qwq the deputations of your provinces and cities . I am desirous of ascertaining your wants by personal intercourse . I will then lay aside all the titles I have acquired , and place your glorious crown on the head of my second self , after having secured for you a constitution which may establish the sacred and salutary authority of the sovereign , with the liberties and privileges of the people . Spaniards ! reflect on what your fathers were ; on what you now are . The fault does not lie in you ; but in the constitution by which you have been governed Conceive the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , for I wish that your latest posterity should preserve the recollection of me , and say , He was the regenerator of our country . " Louis Bonaparte , the King of Holland , depressed by sickness and domestic troubles , declined the more onerous burden of the crown of Spain . Napoleon wrote accordingly the following note to Joseph , the King of Naples . " Charles IV . has ceded to me all his right to the crown of Spain . This crown I have destined for you . The kingdom of Naples can not be compared with Spain . Spain has eleven millions of inhabitants . It has a revenue of thirty millions of dollars , besides the colonies in America . It is the crown which will place you at Madrid , three days ' journey from France . At Madrid you are actually in France . Naples is at the other end of the world . I desire therefore that immediately , upon the receipt of this letter , you will commit the regency to whomsoever you please , and the command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Bayonno by the shortest route possible . Keep the secret from every body As it is , it will only be suspected too soon . ' * In Spain there were no popular institutions . The monarchy was an absolute despotism The priesthood , by the gloomy terrors of the inquisition repressed all political and religious inquiry . The masses of the people were in the lowest state of ignorance and debasement . A government more utterly corrupt and worthless , probably never existed in civilized lands . The attempt to rescue the Spaniards from such a government , and to confer upon them ennobling laws and equal rights , is not a deed which can excite very deep abhorrence . Had Napoleon succeeded according to his wishes , Spain would have been filled with monuments reared to his memory by an enfranchised and grateful people . It is the greatest curse of slavery that the oppressed know not the worth of liberty . No slaves hug their fetters more tenaciously than . the victims of spiritual fanaticism . Joseph Bonaparte was , by universal acclaim , a high minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was above reproach . The earnestness of his philanthropy has never been questioned . Under his mild , just , yet energetic sway , the kingdom of Naples had suddenly emerged into a glorious existence . Before the arrival of Joseph efficient agents were dispatched into Spain to report respecting the condition of the army , of the navy , of the finances and of the public works . Said Napoleon , " I shall want those documents in the first place , for the measures which I shall order . I shall want them afterward that posterity may learn in what state I find the Spanish monarchy . " He formed the noblest projects for the welfare of Spain . The designs he conceived and set on foot have elicited the admiration of his bitterest foes . A parliament or congress was immediately assembled at Bayonne , consisting of one hundred and fifty of the most illustrious men of the kingdom . These enlightened patriots exulted in the bright prospects which were opening before their country . A free constitution was adopted , well adapted to the manners of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Joseph arrived at Bayonne the 7th of June 1808 . The Spanish Congress waited upon the new king , to tender to him the homage of the Spanish nation . They then , in a body , visited Napoleon . With heartfelt gratitude they returned thanks to their powerful benefactor , who seemed to be securing for Spain a prosperous and a glorious future . On the 9th of July , Joseph , escorted by a magnificent display of veteran troops , and preceded and followed by more than a hundred carriages filled with the members of the Congress , departed for Madrid to take his seat uPon the throne of Spain . The notice of Joseph 's accession to the Spanish throne was immediately communicated to all the foreign powers . He was promptly recognized by nearly all the continental powers . The Emperor of Russia added felicitation to his acknowledgment , founded upon the well known exalted character of Joseph Even Ferdinand , from the palace of Valen9ay , wrote Joseph letters of congratulation , and entreated him to induce Napoleon to give him one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair which the ingenuous mind contemplates with perplexity and pain . It would be a relief to be able with severity to condemn . Napoleon has performed so many noble deeds that he can afford to bear the burden of his faults . But the calmly weighing judgment is embarrassed and hesitates to pass sentence of condemnation . No one can contemplate all the difficulties of Napoleon 's position , without admitting that in its labyrinth of perplexities he has an unusual claim to charity . Who , at that time had a right to the throne of Spain Charles IV . had been nominally king . Godoy , the paramour of the queen , was the real sovereign . Charles had abdicated in favor of Ferdinand . He solemnly declared to the nation , " I never performed an action , in my life , with more pleasure . " The same day in which he made this affirmation he wrote his secret protest . in which he says , " I declare that my decree by which I abdicated the crown in // qwq by means occasionally violent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such , in a few words , " says Napoleon , " is the whole history of the affair of Spain . Let the world write and say what it thinks fit , the result must he what I have stated . You will perceive that there was no occasion whatever for my pursuing indirect means , falsehoods , breach of promises , and violation of my faith . In order to render myself culpable , it would have been absolutely necessary that I should have gratuitously dishonored myself . I never yet betrayed any wish of such a nature . " Says Alison , " Perhaps in the whole annals of the world , blackened as they are by deeds of wickedness , . there is not to be found a more atrocious system of perfidy , fraud , and dissimulation , than that by which Napoleon won the kingdoms of the Spanish peninsula . " On the contrary , says Sir Walter Scott , " To do Napoleon justice , he at no time , through this extraordinary discussion , made the least attempt to color his selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a plain story . The Spanish Bourbons were involved in the most desperate family quarrel . Father and son hated each other implacably . Both , of their own accord , hastened to Napoleon to secure his co-operation . Napoleon , who had previously , in consequence of their perfidy , contemplated their overthrow , availed himself of this unexpected opportunity . He told them frankly that it was not safe for him to leave either of them upon the throne . He promised that , if they would abdicate , he would give them all they wanted-wealth and splendor . The hostility between the parent and the son was so malignant , that each party preferred to see Napoleon in possession of the throne , rather than the other . They both accepted . Napoleon conferred upon them , with princely magnificence , palaces and huntinggrounds , and placed one of the noblest of men upon the throne of Spain . The regeneration of the degraded peninsula was commenced . Napoleon hoped that he was now secure from a stab in the back . While these scenes were transpiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tireless energies , the most distant provinces in his empire . He had commenced a series of most Herculean efforts to develop the maritime resources of France . Harbors and docks were formed . The coasts were fortified . Vessels of every description were built . Great care was devoted to the training of naval officers . Every available resource was called into action to protect the French flag from insult , and to secure for France the benefits of commerce . In his intervals of leisure he mounted his horse , and rode along the shore , visiting the sea-ports , and gaining much information relative to naval affairs . During one of these excursions , he had seen numbers of fine oaks and firs lying on the ground , and rotting for want of means of transport . " My heart bleeds , " he wrote to his minister , " to see all this valuable wood perishing uselessly. "
