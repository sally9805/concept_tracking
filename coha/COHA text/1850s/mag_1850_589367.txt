164 August , POLITICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . ROBERT MILLIGAN McLANE , WHO was born on the 23d of June , 1815 , is the son of Louis McLane , of Delaware , and Catharine Milligan . His paternal grandfather was Colonel Allan MeLane , than whom no other patriot of his grade did better service for the American cause in our Revolutionary War , as an officer of Lee 's Legion , and the Delaware and Maryland Line . The mother of our subject was the daughter of Robert Milligan , of Cecil County , Md . Robert Milligan was the son of George Milligan , a Scotch merchant of the city of Baltimore , and grandson of John Baldwin , one of the earliest English settlers in Cecil County , Md. , who , in 1750 , became a tobacco planter on the Bohemia river , where he died on his plantation , which is now the property and family residence of Louis McLaue , the father of our subject . His mother , Mrs. Louis McLane , who died during the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the best of wives . She was a lady of great grace of character , widely known and beloved in the large circle in which she moved . To her tender care arc her husband and son indebted for much of the success crowning their labors in the service of their country . The lion . Louis McLane represented Delaware in the House of Representatives of the United States , from December , 1817 , until December , 1827 , and during the two succeeding years he was in the U. S. Senate . At the end of that period he was honored by General Jackson with a mission to England . He returned in 1831 , the President having tendered to him the post of Secretary of the Treasury , until subsequently transferred to the Department of State , on the resignation of Mr. Livingston . He filled that position with great credit to himself and advantage to his c6untry , until the summer of 1833 , when he retired , bearing with him the ardent friendship of General Jackson . This retirement of the elder Mr. McLane was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen , owing to the exclusive devotion of his talents and energies , for so many years , in the legislative , diplomatic and executive branches of the gQvernment . During the pendency of the now celebrated Oregon negoti*tion of the last administration , at its darkest hour and most critical perfod , President Polk did him the honor to insist that he should again represent his government at the Court of St. James 's ; and , accepting the appointment only after urgent solicitation from the Executive and his constitutional advisers , ( who represented that the critical condition of our relations with Britain made it imperatively necessary that he should again repair to London , ) he went to England , and conducted to the entire satisfaction of his country so much of those negotiations as had been transferred to the other side of the Atlantic . The difficulty , pregnant with war , as all conceived for some time , having been happily settled , Mr. 1*ouis MeLane immediately returned to the United States , under an understanding with the President that he might resume the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination of the then pending controversy . Mr. Louis MeLane , on reaching the United States , rc-assumed the functions of the Presidency ofthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company , which he had resigned to thus re-enter the diplomatic service of his country , and which had been kept open by its board of direction to this end . The son , ( our subject , ) received the primary rudiments of an English education in the school of John Bulloch , a worthy member of the Society of Friends , in the town of his birth , Wilmington , Del . From thence he was transferred to Washington Collcge , in the District of Columbia , an academical institution under the patronage and care of the time-honored Roman Catholic Georgetown College . While in that institution , as the writer , who was his class-mate and friend , well remembers , his remarkable quickness of apprehension was displayed to an extraordinary dcgre* , enabling him , intuitively , as it were , to master points in his studies at a glance , or with the aid of a single brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not days , of close application on the part of most of his fellow-students . Mr. MeLane was next transferred to St. Mary 's College in Baltimore , Maryland , a Catholic institution similar to the college he had last attended . He remained there until 1829 , when he accompanied his father to Europe . Shortly after reaching his mission in London , the elder Mr. MeLane sent Robert to Paris , that he might enjoy the superior educational advantages which that city has afforded at all times , during the last half century . While there , he studied under the immediate supervision of M. M. Lemoine , a professor of the College Bour6on , devoting himself to acquiring a thorough knowledge of the Latin and French languages , and attending the lecturcs delivered at the University of Paris . Fortunately for the futurc of Mr. R. M. McLane , General La Fayette , who during his service in this country had been the intimate friend of Mr. MeLane 's paternal grandfather , exercised towards him that frank , generous and cordial hospitality which he bestowed with open hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arms , one and all . Thus he was the adviser and patron of young McLane , who soon became almost domesticated in his family . With the family and connections of Gcncral La Fayette , and with his able , accomplished and kind instructor , M. Lemoine , himself a dramatic writer of ability and fame , our subject enjoyed advantages of familiar , daily intercourse , not only with the ripest scholars of France , but the leaders of the French liberal party of 1830 , from whom he imbibed enlarged views of radical democracy , which have aided greatly in advancing him so young to a political position rarely obtained indeed except after a long lifetime of public service . There he frequently met Odillon Barrot , then a brilliant and rising republican leader ; also M. M. Laysterie , and Ledru Rollin , who at that time was without any particular fame , being a vcry young zvocat , noted for little save the extreme zeal of his democracy . James Fennimore Cooper also made one of the talented and patriotic circle of distinguished gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during his residence in Paris , to enjoy so frequently at the house of General La Fayette and in the family of the American minister , Mr. Rives . At that time Mr. C. was the caressed intimate of the leaders of the Anti-Bourbon party , to the triumph of whose cause his pen is believed to have greatly contributed , through the columns of the liberal joul nals of the French metropolis . // The writer has often heard Mr. McLane gratefully acknowledge his deep obligation to the statesmen and patriots to whom reference is made above , for the training  --  the systematic and philosophical habit of reflection upon public affairs ,  --  for the abiding confidence in the integrity and rarely failing good sense of the people ; for the axiom , that , to seek the advancement and happiness of the whole community , without distinction of persons or classes , is the first duty of the state and statesman ; all of which familiar intercourse with them served to instil into his mind . Our subject witnessed the occurrences of the three eventful days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should write , the views of La Fayette 's circle of friends were so happily realized . In common with almost all the ardent young Americans then in Paris , he spent most of these three days in the streets , being of course , by turns , in all parts of the city . He also had the honor of making one of the gallant band of youthful Americans whom La Fayette , full of gratitude , as of affection , for his adopted country , took with him to the Palais Royal , on repairing thither to tender to Louis Phillipe the post of Lientenant-Gencral of the French nation , at the bidding of the people of France . On the conclusion of the course of studies in Paris marked out for him , Mr. McLane proceeded to the residence of his father , in London , in the spring of 1831 , in the fall of which year he returned to the United States , when the elder MeLane was summoned home to take his seat at the council-board of Andrew Jackson . Soon after his return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was confided by his father to Mr. Dillingham , of Pittsfield , Mass. , at whose excellent school his younger brothers were pursuing their studies . While at Pittsfield , he was per-. suaded by some military friends , then visiting that town on a wedding party , k the festivities of which be joined , to abandon his intentions of undertaking a collegiate career , and to accept an appointment to West Point , which he did in 1S3* . Subsequently , becoming dissatisfied , on account of this absolute abandonment of an intention long entertained by himself and his family , of pursuing the legal profession , without consultation with his friends , he forwarded his resignation to Washington , and returned home , determined to resume the duties of his original academical life . At this interesting epoch , counselled , encouraged , and immediately advised by General Jackson , whose benevolence of heart and uniform kindness to youth are so well known , he reconsidered his action , and consented to submit himself to the long and tedious discipline of the academical course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that institution in June , 1833 , and recommenced its routine of studies , which he prosecuted successfully for four years , graduating in June , 1837 , when he was appointed by the President , at his own request , a Second Lieutenant of the First Dragoons , his appointment dating from the first of July , 1837 . But finding that his graduating grade in the class at the academy entitled him to an appointment in the artillery , which corps was then engaged in Florida , ( while the dragoons were stationed on the western frontier of Missouri , ) he conceived it to be his duty to take service in the corps participating in the Indian war then pending . An order was accordingly issued , canceling his appointment as a Second Lieutenant of Dragoons , and appointing him a Second Lieutenant of the First Artillery , to date from the day above-mentioned , July 1st , 1837 . In conformity with this last appointment , Mr. MeLane , in due time , // was commissioned by the President and Senate . He proceeded immediately to Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October of the same year , he sailed for Tampa Bay . On arriving at Tampa , he obtained the command of Company E , of the First Artillery , owing to the absence of many of his superiors in rank , occasioned by sickness , or by being detached for special duty elsewhere . Our subject served gallantly and successfully in command of his company throughout General Jessup 's distinguished campaign of 1837 and 1838 ; and with Major-General Scott in the Cherokee troubles of the autumn of the latter year . He was then detached from " the line , " and was appointed a Lieutenant of Topographical Engineers , in which capacity he returned to Florida , and by direction of General Taylor , then commanding in that quarter , he was induced to serve on the staff of General Floyd , who commanded the Georgia Volunteers in the Okefinokee District . In 1837 and 1838 , his regiment , the First Artillery , acted as the pioneer eorps of the army of General Jessup , in the arduous and brilliant campaign which that officer made from St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Everglades . These latter regions had been unexplored since the commencement of the war , until they were penetrated by a mixed military and naval expedition , detached from Jessup 's force , which was under the immediate command of the gallant and accomplished Lieut . L. M. Powell , of the navy . Licut . McLane 's Company E , and Company I , of the same regiment , commanded by Lieutenant ( now Lieut . Col. ) Magruder , formed the military portion of that expedition . During this active and trying period of Mr. MeLane 's military career , it was his fortune to take part in several engagements , in which he shared equally with his gallant fellow-officers the praise and glory of the achievements . Thus he was engaged under Col. Bankhead , in the battle of the Pine Islands , driving the Indians from the islands and Everglades , to the main land , where the larger portion of the band were subsequently made prisoners by Col. Harney 's command . It is due in justice to our subject to remark , that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Florida war , no other officer won more thanks from his superiors for his activity , skill , and courage . While to claim more credit for him than fell to the share of his brethren in arms would be invidious , the writer well knows that to accord to him less would be doing injustice to a gallant and meritoiious gentleman . Topographical duties were next assigned to Lieut . MeLane , at St. Augustine , where he was engaged in superintending the public works in the immediate vicinity of that point . While there , his leisure hours were devoted to legal reading , having obtained the use of the law library of a professional gentleman residing at that point . At the end of six months Licut . MeLane was ordered to the northern lakes , where he was employed at various points from Old Fort Covington on the St. Lawrence westward , to the Sault St. Marie and Lake Superior . In January , 1841 , he again visited Europe , in company with Captain Canfield , who had been the chief of the surveying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year . There , under dircetions from the Secretary of War , they were engaged in reconnoissances and examinations connected with their duties as officers of the corps of Topographical Engineers . On his return to the United States , he was employed during the // winter of 1842 in a military survey and reconnoissance of the approaches to the city of New-Orleans ; and during the year 1843 , he was transferred to the parties engaged in harbor surveys at the Delaware Break-water , and Sandy Hook . During this continuous and active service as a topographical engineer , Lieut . McLane devoted his leisure hours to the study of the law , more particularly for six months , ( as before remarked ) in St. Augustine , and for thirteen ( winter ) months in Washington City , where he studied under the instruction of Gen. Walter Jones . Thus beIng prepared for admission to the bar , just before setting out for Europe in company with Captain Canfield , he was admitted as an attorney and counselor at law , by the United States Court for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with credit , the casual examination . In August , 1841 , Mr. MeLane married Georgine Urquhart , the daughter of David Urquhart , Esq. , of Louisiana , a gentleman of honorable fame as a merchant , distinguished for his successful enterprise in business , and for his severe probity in all his public and domestic relations . This union , while it secured for our subject the affectionate companionship of a lovely woman , of high refinement , endowed with singular simplicity and piety in mind and heart , has been blessed with those treasures that form the sacred and holy and most interesting ties of married life . With a view to devote himself to these domestic relations so happily formed , he took the earliest occasion , which his public duty and his private affairs permitted , to resign his military commission . This he did , in October , 1843 , when he settled in the city of Baltimore , Maryland , and was at once admitted to practice law in the courts of that state and of the United States . From the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McLane lost no opportunity to earn position among his professional brethren by bending his every nerve with fair and manly industry to his business . Success almost immediately crowned his exertions , for in less than one year he found himself in full and profitable practice . At the approach of the Presidential canvass of 1844 , the ardor of his political preferences caused him to become active in the councils of the democracy of the city , so that his political talents soon became known to those around him . The result was , that in October , 1845 , after taking a leading part in the national contest , ending in the election of James K. Polk , Mr. MeLane was nominated and elected to represent the city of Baltimore in the Legislature of the State . On the meeting of that body , he was selected as a member of the Committee of Ways and Means , the position being then of great importance , owing to the character of the grave financial question pressing so heavily upon the councils of the state . The writer alludes here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " state faith policy , " indispensable to the maintenance of the honor of the state , to which , in the face of the embarrassments surrounding the question , he gave support so earnest and able , as at once to mark him for one of the leaders in the good cause of state integrity . At that session , too , he had the honor of being one of the small band of those who devoted much of their time and talents to the task of agitating in favor of constitutional reform , which agitation was then revived in the state . A large share of his legislative labors was devoted to that object , which he pressed upon the House , so as to earn for himself reputation , as , perhaps , its most prominent and efficient supporter then in public life . // Thus , on the 3d of January , *45 , he reported a bill to modify the income law passed in Decembei* 1841 , which he accompanied with a preamble and resolutions , setting forth the principles on which the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that it was the duty of the legislature to appropriate to the last*aollar , all excess of revenue after the most economical expenditure , to the full extinguishment of the principal and interest on the debts of the state of all descriptions . And further , that so long as the surplus wealth of a state is sufficient to furnish a greater revenue than is required to pay the interest on her public debts , she is solvent , and , consequently , any compromise of her obligations would dishonor her . This bill and resolutions immediately became the basis of an able and interesting debate , in which our subject tpok the lead on the side of probity and reform . The party of extravagant expenditures having multiplied every species of indirect taxation , at the same time refused to perfect the income law , which would have commanded an unusual amount of floating moneyed wealth , not reached by the existing laws which pressed so heavily upon the trade and commerce of the people . His speech on this occasion was marked with great boldness , radicalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with powerful effect on the popular mind of the state . Therein he struck at the indirect mode of taxation , to which his political opponents had resorted , after their almost invariable custom , in order to throw the burden of providing the state revenue on those least able to bear it . He proposed a modification and perfection of the existing income tax , then in full and oppressive operation throughout Maryland . Though his movement on that occasion resulted in increased taxation , more especially upon many persons of wealth among his immediate constituency , he lost no ground by the zeal and energy with which he advocated right and the principles of eternal justice . On the contrary , his first congressional election ( of which we shall hereafter have occasion to speak , ) soon coming on , his brilliant victory on that occasion proved that he had not overestimated the public spirit and probity of his legislative constituency , as high a mark as he had taken occasion to place upon these qualities of theirs . On the 18th day of February , 1846 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delegates of Maryland , on the great subject of constitutional reform , which from that day to this has been a leading issue with the Maryland democracy . For this result , thanks are certainly due to the foresight and judgment displayed by him , at so early a period , and so successfully , in pressing upon his political friends the necessity for taking ground on that platform ; many of his political friends being indisposed to risk the increased opposition , which an effort to interfere with the privileges and exemptions of the favored and influential few could not fail to bring upon the then comparatively weak democratic party of the state . In this speech , Mr. MeLane urged with great force and perspicacity , the constitutional right of the people to make their own fundamental law , in opposition to the restrictive tendency , under which the whig party covered its resistance to the true spirit of our republican institutions . In fact , it was a fitting exposition of his report , asserting the rights of the people of Maryland to alter and amend their constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the existing constitution of the state . For the first time in the history of reform in Maryland , too , // there was found in his report and speech on this occasion , the position that the right of the people to conventional reform was a legal and constitutional right , without , however , questioning their abstract and inherent right , which , whether regarded as inalienable or revolutionary , he freely admitted , urging that the power to change fundamental laws at their own will , was a right which a people whose system is based on a republican foundation such as ours , can never surrender beyond their control , without radically changing the character of their government . The writer , on setting out to prepare this paper , designed quoting somewhat largely from these two proud monuments of the political fame of Mr. MeLane . But the mass of more worthy incidents connected with the career of his subject , opening upon him as he progressed , warns him that , to do so , will increase this article to a length too great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , from the day on which Robert M. McLane appeared on the stage in the performance of his public duties , at Annapolis  --  the youthful , but none the less able and ardent advocate for such a change in the constitution of the state as would assure the administration of real justice to all at an economical rate , and equalize taxation , as would aid in the development of the resources of the state , and facilitate the general progress , prosperity and happiness of the people of Maryland , while striking down the hydra-headed monster of special privilege , which for so many years has been preying on the vitals of her yeomanry  --  the good cause in whose behalf he erected those victoryinsuring breastworks , has steadily gained ground ; until a few days since , its triumph was finally illustrated by an unprecedented majority of the popular vote of the state in favor of reform . At the opening of the Maryland congressional canvass of 1847 , Mr. McLane was honored with the democratic nomination for the 4th District , composed of the greater portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organised as a whig district beyond peradventure , with exceeding care after the census 1840 , by the legislature . To this end-to give the whigs full five hundred majoity there , certain wards lying on the exterior of the city in which the democratic majority usually ranged from seven to nine hundred , were united to the adjacent counties ( rural ) , and embraced in the 3rd Congressknal District , leaving the remainder of the wards into which the city was divided , for the 4th Congressional District . This was accomplished without any reserve or concealment on the part of the whig majority then swaying the legislature of Maryland-and the city of Baltimore was re-organized and re-divided into wards to make the arrangement effectual . At the first election which followed this scheme of political gerrymandering , which has become unfortunately too common in the partizan strifes of the day , bitter dissensions within the whig party caused them to present two candidates , the one regularly nominated by the whigs , and the other by a faction of that party-then calling themselves Native Americans-this dissension elected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united vote of the two whig candidates . In October , 1847 , both parties presented a single candidate , the Hon. John P. Kennedy being the candidate nominated by the whigs , and Mr. MeLane by the democrats . There has rarely been a canvass conducted in the city of Baltimore , in which greater zeal , activity and ability was manifested , than in that of // 1847 . The country was in the midst of war  --  the administration was being denounced as the immediate cause of that war-which was stigmatized as unjust , aggressive , and dishonorable . Mr. Kennedy was an experienced and favorite statesman of his party . He had for many years represented a portion of the city , which was by action of the legislature held at the command of his political friends . At the preceding October election he had been chosen to the legislature ,  --  the usual democratic majority in the city of Baltimore having sunk to a tie-vote , and he had then fully participated with political friends in the issues of the day . The canvass was conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a series of addresses to them in the public newspapersthree of the four political papers then published in Baltimore being at his command . A joint canvass had been proposed , but declined , owing to Mr. Kennedy 's health . Mr. McLane conducted his canvass in full discussions before the people of the issues presented by his opponent in his addresses through the press . He opened the canvass on the 12th of ' September , in an address , which at the time , won high encomiums from many of the leading democratic presses in all sections of the confederacy , and from none more liberal praise than that which was bestowed upon it by the veteran and far-seeing conductor of the " Washington Union . " In this speech , he ( Mr. McLane ) treated the various political topics of the day , and more especially those relating to the policy of the then existing administration , in a manner evincing that he had not presented himself to the people of his district for a seat in Congress , without having first properly prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures of the democracy . Indeed , no previous emanation from his voice or pen had given superior evidence of his practical discernment , soundness of principles and power of illustration . In this , he most effectually exposed the fallacy of a National Bank , in view of the prosperity of the country and the dangers of such an institution . He also therein ably defended and sustained the administration in the prosecution of the Mexican war , placing in bold and triumphant relieg the causes from which it arose . Mr. MeLane also took occasion to review with scathing severity and touching eloquence the resolutions of the legislature of Maryland , denunciatory of the war , ( in favor of which his opponent voted , ) in his clear and forcible exposition of the righteousness of our cause . This canvass closed on the first Monday in October , in Mr. MeLane 's triumphant election-his majority being about 541  --  a majority equal to that generally given by the entire city  --  and which added to the majority of the democratic wards attached to the 3rd Congressional District , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore . An unprecedented victory in this strong hold of his party . In December , 1847 , when the first session of the 30th Congress opende , the Mexican war still existed , and the opposition were more vehement in their assault upon the administration than at any former period since its commencement . The military movements upon Vera Cruz and the city of Mexico , under the direction of General Scott , had withdrawn from General Taylor the principal part of the army then in the valley of the Rio Grande , and upon the plains of Saltillo . The battle of Buena Vista had left the defensive lines in this quarter , comparatively secure ; but General Scott was at a stand , half way on his march to the city of Mexico , calling for re-inforcements ; while S*inta Anna , abandoning all hope of ' disturbing our positions in the northern states of Mexico , had fallen back // rapidly to the assistance of those then in front of our " army of the south . " The President laid before Congress in December 1847 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing necessity for an additional military force of ten regular regiments , not less , for the successful prosecution of the war , than for the immediate safety of our people then in the heart of Mexico . This call of the executive , was responded to by a howl of oppositionthe war itself was again , and more fiercely than ever , denounced as unjust , aggressive , unnecessary and dishonorable ; the mode and manner of conducting it , was denounced is weak and unsuccessful , and the objects for which it was prosecuted , weve held up to the scorn and indignation of the country . It was boldly and ounced by the highest statesmen in opposition , that no re-inforcement shoi4d go to Mexico for the further prosecution of the war  --  a war caused , they alleged , by the unconstitutional or unwise and incapable conduct of fhe existing administration . Added to these direct assaults upon the President , efforts of the press and of gentlemen in opposition , participating in the congressional debates , were strenuously and earnestly made to foment differences and difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our armies . In a word , the opposition was fierce and ruthless , and their points of attack extended over the whole field of action , commencing with the policy of the democratic party in the acquisition of Texas , to the commencement of the war , and through every step of its prosecution , to the very moment when Congress was called on in December , 1847 , to vote men and money then indispensable to the prompt and successful termination of hostilities On the 19th day of January , 1848 , Mr. MeLane first participated in these debates . In his speech upon that occasion , he covered the whole policy of the administration and the democratic party ; he admitted that the war had resulted from the annexation of Texas , and he approved the policy of annexation ; but hostilities , he said , were commenced by the aggressive act of Mexico . Congress , and not the President , he contended , was responsible for the annexation of Texas ; and the allegation that the act of hostility which commenced the war , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repelled ; not only in view of the allegation that the army was ordered beyond the Neuces in violation of the law of annexation , but also , ( in view of the modified form of attack , ) that it was ordered there unwisely , howsoever constitutional might have been the power of the President thus to direct it . He observed , not only that this portion of Texas was the country actually revolutionized and embraced within the republic of Texas , but further , that a position within the country between the Neuces and the Rio Grande was absolutely necessary to enable our troops to subsist themselves and maintain a position of which they could repel an actually impending invasion of the whole state of Texas , destined and proclaimed by Mexico , as directed to the conquest of the entire state , east to the Louisiana boundary . The position so taken , he proved to be the result of military necessity , and recommended as such by the military commander , General Taylor , then at the head of our force . Having thus indicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged its prosecution with all our vigor and skill , to the prompt subjugation of the power that governed Mexico , with a view to dictate a peace , which , he said , should " illustrate our humanity , our wisdom , and our justice " He supported the policy of the administration , recommending the acqui // sition of territory as an indemnity for the misconduct of Mexico-but urged the mountains of the Sierra Madre , as the proper limit of boundary , with a view to future security against the factions and the violent character of the Mexican government . But while he thus acquiesced in this policy , he avowed his own preferences for one which would reject all territorial acquisition , demanding commercial indemnity , reducing the central government of Mexico to complete subjection ; leaving the several states of Mexico to their own independence in all domestic and municipal matters , subordinate only to such commercial regulations as we might impose upon the central government , and to enforce which , the Castle at Vera Cruz alone need have remained in our possession . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference with domestic slavery , in which he fully and at that early day , committed his best judgment and earnest convictions to the policy of congressional non-interference , leaving to the people inhabiting the territories , the right to regulate their own municipal relations and laws , restrained only by the limitations enforced by the federal constitution , to which all-whether states , territories or people , were alike bound to render deference . This speech gave great satisfaction to his friends , who at once perceived in it the result of his long and severe military training , rendering him more competent to the satisfactory elucidations of a subject like that involved in the discussion , than any other member of the House . It elicited the attention of the opposition and was replied to by Mr. R. W. Thompson , of Indiana , who was at that time the most competent orator on the whig side of the chamber , as well as a gentleman of high general character , occupying a distinguished position in his party . Mr. Thompson enforced the views of the moderate whigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McLane upon his historical argument . Mr. McLane rejoined as soon as he could at the hour on the first of March , 1848 , and successfully maintained his points , notwithstanding another reply from his opponent . No effort of that memorable session , was of more direct political importance than the short speech of our subject , to which we here refer . Mr. Thompson always adroit and plausible , had interposed the sanction of the deservedly influencia*l declaration to break the force of Mr. McLane 's positions , which , if correct , convicted the opposition of factiousness , sympathy with a foreign enemy , and predetermination to falsify the truth of history to accomplish a mere partisan end . That his short rejoinder was indeed triumphant , may be gathered from the fact that , in the soon succeeding presidential contest , the points made out by Mr. MeLane on this occasion , became among the most important arguments , relied on by the democracy from Texas to Maine , to justify the war on our part , as one brought on by the act of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McLane again addressed the committee in reply to Messrs . Stephens , of Georgia , Scheuck , of Ohio , and Hubble , of Texas , in their policy of conducting the war ; the President had been charged with blunder upon blunder , and finally it was alleged in the debate that he had actually conspired against his own generals and his own army , to effect their disgrace and overthrow . Mr. McLane intimately familiar with the military features of the campaign , illustrated forcibly the sagacity and address of the administration , and the consumate ability with which the political and military combinations of their policy was effected , showing how entirely both Generals , Taylor and Scott , concurred , each on their own responsibility , and without conference , in all the military // combinations in question ; while the political features of this policy had even then commanded the approbation of statesmen , in opposition , of the highest attainment . These three speeches on topics involved in the war policy of the government , gave i*Jr . McLane his high position in the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the future labors of their author were destined to be of prime service to the cause of democratic supremacy . Mr. McLane participated in the general legislation of that Congress with zeal and effl*ct , having been early placed on the Committee on Cornmerce , one of the most important branches of the organization of the House . As the representative of a commercial constituency , he felt bound to devote much of his time and talents to that branch of the public business . Thus , enjoying an opportunity to serve more especially the great class of our fellow citizens engaged in commerce , he has omitted no effort in his part to do so effectually . In the discharge of the dutics of his position on the Committee on Commerce , Mr. McLane has become justly distinguished as a political economist of far-seeing sagacity , rare indeed in one of his age and comparatively short congressional experience . his recommendations in this connection are always bold and liberal , rejecting more or less of the restrictive views which are at times urged by many of our political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of many interval improYement objects , which , though received with disfavor now , by a majority of his fellow southern democratic representatives , were held by the democracy , in the times of Monroe and Jackson , to be legitimate objects for the expenditure of public money and the exercise of the fostering care of the general government . On the 10th of July , 1842 , he participated in a very stirring debate , on resolution ( introduced by Mr. Stephens , of Georgia , ) which raised an issue in regard to the rightful boundary of Texas and the legality and propriety of civil government in New-Mexico . This debate was one of violent denunciation on the part of the opposition , and extended itself to the financial condition of the country . Mr. Stephens , and Mr. Schenck , of Ohio , conducting the assault , while Mr. MeClelland , of Illinois , and Mr. MeLane , stood on the defensive . Our present purpose is only to refer to the latter . 1-Jowever , his argument admitted and defended the claim of Texas to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly by the President and the Senate ; admitting which , he defended the temporary civil government recognized by the President within the limits of Texas at Santa Fe , and showed most conclusively that the government actually recognized and approved by the President , was one of very limited and confined functions , not extending beyond the necessity of war , and the actual possession of such territory by the enemy , dispersed thereof by our troops ; conclusive illustrations from the official records of the political and judicial department of the government sustained his position . He then replied to the allegations of the opposition ; that the President had deceived the country , by representing the public debt created by the war , at about half its actual amount . Mr. McLane entered into a minute examination of the estimates , and showed the public debt of the war would be seventy-five or eighty millions of dollars-instead of one hundred and twenty millions , as represented by the opposition in this debate . A year later , when peace was restored , and the fiscal affairs adjusted-eighty millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this debate , not alone to call attention to the exact // exhibit of our affairs given by Mr. McLane , but because the debate itself was one of great interest and point , and embraced the most interesting topics of the day . In August of that year , he spoke *ipon the Illinois Railroad Bill , in which speech he re-capitulated briefly the views upon the question of internal improvement , which he had laid before his constituents before his election . In this speech he said : " If he rightly understood the issue on the question of internal improvement , it lay in the different opinions entertained as to the power of government under the money clause , and as to its right to do whatever was necessary to carry out the grants of power in the Constitution . " He then denied the power of the Government under the money power , or in virtue of any power , to appropriate money for what was termed a national or general system of internal improvement . But he admitted the power of Congress to provide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , or directly connected with foreign or domestic commerce , as regulated by Congress . Reference is made to the speech , for a full illustration of the argument and its application . That his opinions on this topic is so full of interest , may be understood , we have , in the foregoing remarks , had no other purpose than to state the conclusions , &amp;c. , &amp;c . In the second session of the thirtieth Congress the slavery agitation was the engrossing topic . At this session Mr. McLane spoke on Gitt 's resolution , to provide for abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia . He contended that Congress had exclusive but not omnipotent legislative power over the district -- which was ceded to the federal government for a purpose ! All legislation necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose he held to be constitutional . But to abolish slavery was in no sense necessary for that purpose . And , again , he contended that the powers expressly given to Congress in regard to slavery , implied a prohibition against the exercise of all power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Constitution provided that private property can not be taken for public use , without compensation . This grant was tantamount to an express prohibition against taking it for any use but a public use , and abolition or emancipation he said was not a public use . His conclusion was , that Congress could not touch slavery in the District of Columbia without an enlargem entof constitutional power . Though he explained fully to the House that the slave trade complained of in the District , was forbidden by the laws of Maryland at the time of . ' cession , and that such a trade only existed by the laws of Congkss  --  a repeal of such laws would leave the Maryland law in force , arid abolish the slave trade , and he advocated such a course of legislation . After this congressional service , he had entertained the intention of an exclusive devotion to his profession  --  but a deference to the wishes of his friends , and what they considered most conducive to the public no less than to his own interest , made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th Congressional District , which he represented , had fallen back again to the whigs , at the presidential election , in the preceding year , and great anxiety was felt , that he should redeem it once more , not less in vindication of his own character at home , than in view of the nearly balanced state of parties in the new House of Representa .. tives . The canvass was earnestly and zealously conducted . His opponent , Major John P. Kennedy , was a gallant officer who had distinguished himself in the Mexican war , and an ardent supporter of the present // administration . A majority of some 950 for Mr. McLane was the triumphant result . On repairing to Washington at the commencement of the present session of Congress , the name of Mr. McLane was promptly brought forward in connection with the democratic nomination for the speakership ; it being urged that while acceptable to the " old line " democrats of the House , no other gentleman of the party could so surely concentrate upon himself , the votes of all the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whigs . But believing the position due to the previous services of his able and patriotic senior in congressional life , Howell Cobb , of Georgia , Mr. MeLane promptly and publicly declined permitting his friends to urge his name in caucus . The writer can not pass over the long and trying struggle for this speakership , without remarking that , the conduct of Mr. MeLane , on the floor and elsewhere contributed perhaps , more than that of any other gentleman of the House , to secure the eventual triumph of the democratic nominee . In organizing the committee , Speaker Cobb paid Mr. McLane , though so young , the compliment of placing him at the head of the Committee on Commerce ; after the Committee of Ways and Means , perhaps , the most important committee of the House . But Mr. MeLane had previously discharged the duties of a member of that committee , wherein his professional knowledge as an engineer as well as his fine attainments as a commercial lawyer , rendered him most efficient in the protection of the interests of that most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MeLane has taken , as usual , a very active part in the business of the House during the present session , no other democrat being more relied on to conduct one side of the war of motions and counter motions of points of order , and explanatory speeches upon which the fate of each closely contested measure rarely fails to turn . Upon the great question of the day , the settlement of the difficulty now threatening to destroy the union of these States , Mr. McLane took ground among the moderates , being emphatically a compromised man . Having had occasion more than once since December 3 , 1849 , to address the 1-louse upon this subject , Mr. MeLane has urged with vehement eloquence and convincing power , the justice of the demand of his section of the confederacy for a participation in the enjoyment of territory won by the expenditure of the common blood and treasure of the people of all our sections and states . Yet he has not failed to evince a readiness to give up a portion of the clear rights of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brotherly love and community of interests , which , until recently , bound together the hearts of the people of the different sovereign states , as one great nation . But this sketch is already too long . The writer has sufficient material by him to make volumes of interest rather than pages . His purpose , however , is but to make the democracy of the country more intimately acquainted with another whose career of public usefulness has been well nigh unprecedented in the annals of the statesmen of America . Of the untiring activity of mind and energy of character , of a quickness of perception most remarkable , of sound and practical judgment of men and things , of unswerving devotion to the principles of the democracy , and of great personal popularity , Mr. McLane bids fair , at some future day , to contend successfully for the highest honors of the republic .
