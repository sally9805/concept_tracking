The Franklin Expedition , or Considerations on Measures for the Discovery and Relief of our Absent Adventurers in th' Arctic Regions . With Maps . By the Rev. W. SCORESBY , D. D. , Fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh , Member of the Institute of France , &amp;c . London . 1850 . JUST a year ago , an account was given in this journal of Sir John Franklin 's disappearance , and the expeditions sent to his relief . The last have returned , Franklin has not . The want of success in these expeditions has aroused an enthusiastic interest in the fate of the lost navigator , both in England and in the United States , which is as characteristic of the present // age , as the Crusades were of the times called the Dark Ages . The failure of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy on the part of the commanders , as a sketch of their proceedings will show . Sir James Ross left England in June , 1848 , and passed Upernavik , on the western coast of Greenland , on the 13th of July . As he advanced to the north , he found the ice was of unprecedented solidity . The whalers , that had kept company with him , soon turned back , abandoning all hope of crossing Baffin 's Bay . By persevering , he succeeded in forcing his way to the western shore , and reached Pond 's Bay on the 23d of August . Observing that the ice rested upon the land a few miles to the south , he sailed towards the north , close along the shore , watching narrowly for any boats that might contain the lost party ; in fog and at night , guns were fired and rockets sent up , to attract their notice if they should be on that coast ; and at suitable points , parties were sent on shore to look for any indications of their having ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of September , off Cape York , at the eastern point of the entrance of Prince Regent 's Inlet . Having dropped overboard many casks containing notices that a depot of provisions would be found at Port Leopold , off the western shore of the entrance of Prince Regent 's Inlet , it was a matter of importance to reach this port and make the deposit . He was shut out , however , by a solid mass of ice extending fourteen miles from the shore . Turning then to the northern shore of Barrow 's Strait , he found Wellington Channel frozen firmly over ; standing then to the west , he found Barrow 's Strait in that direction an unbroken mass of ice from shore to shore . Driven back to Port Leopold , he struggled through the loosened ice into the harhor on the 11th of September ; the ice closed over the entrance the very night after his entrance , shutting both ships in till the end of the next August . When spring permitted the men to leave the ships , Sir James Ross with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Cape Bunny , longitude 950 20 ' W. , then , following its bending to the south , to latitude 72* 38 ' N. , longitude 950 40 ' W. At this extreme of his journey , there was a high point from which the coast could he traced with the eye fifty miles farther . Another expedition followed down // the western shore of Prince Regent 's Inlet to Fury Beach , in latitude 720 45 ' N. , while a third crossed to the northern shore of Barrow 's Strait . None of them found any trace of Franklin 's party . Building a house on shore , and leaving in it provisions for a year , fuel , and other necessaries , besides a steam launch large enough to carry the lost navigators to the common whaling grounds , Sir James Ross succeeded in extricating his ships from the harbor on the 11th of August , 1849 , after a year 's detention . He at once proceeded towards the northern shore of Barrow 's Strait . He saw nothing to the west but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his progress when within twelve miles of the shore . The floating masses gradually enclosed the ships , then freezing together , fastened them as firmly as if they were imbedded in rock . The mass was stationary a few days , then drifted eastward , at the rate of eight or ten miles per day , to the entrance of Lancaster Sound . The current here turning to the south , the two crews , prison bound in their island fifty miles in circumference , were floating helplessly along the coast , when a number of grounded icehergs were seen directly in their path . Destruction seemed inevitable . But , while many hearts were beating with apprehension of the expected collision , the whole field in which the ships were enclosed was suddenly rent into fragments , as if by some unseen power . All dashing against each other , they filled the sea with new dangers . But the strenuous exertions of the men were successful , and the ships were again in clear water , on the 25th of September . This was too late to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commander could only begin the homeward voyage , to bear the tale of bitter disappointment to England . Sir John Richardson , who had command of the overland expedition , left England in March , 1848 . Travelling over the British possessions , he reached the mouth of Mackenzie* s River on the 4th of August . As he followed the coast in his boats to Cape Bathurst , he found the sea entirely open , and the shores populous with Esquimaux . The natives told him that , for six weeks in midsummer , no ice can be seen there from the loftiest headlands . Yet not one of them had seen the lost ships , or any of their boats on this open water , nor had they ever heard of them . After rounding Cape Bathurst , Sir John Richardson found the appearance of the sea was // changed . Floes of ice appeared ; they became more numerous and extensive as he advanced , till , on the 3rd of September , when he had passed Cape Hearne in Coronation Gulf , finding the sea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter quarters on the Coppermine . He felt assured , from the representations of the Esquimaux , that Franklin 's party had not been in sight of any part of the shore which he had examined . He returned to England in the following spring . Dr. Rae , however , remained to examine the strait which , some suppose , leads northwardly between Wollaston Island and Victoria Land to the ocean . Tidings ought to have arrived from him ere now , but we have heard of none yet . Commander Moore sailed from England , with the intention of passing through Behrring Strait and examining the shores to the north in the summer of 1848 . But his vessel was so dull a sailer that he had to winter on the shores of Kamtschatka , without reaching the Strait . Leaving his winter harbor next season , he passed through , in the beginning of July , 1849 , and was immediately joined by Captain Kellet , with the Herald , who had just arrived from England . They sailed together up the American coast to longitude 160* W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted out the Herald 's thirty feet pinnace , and two twenty-seven feet whaleboats , to explore the coast beyond Point Barrow . Leaving them on the 25th of July , the ships sailed due north to latitude 71* 05 ' N. , where they met the pack of ice extending from N. W. by W. , to N. E. , as far as the eye could reach . The ice was dirty colored , and five or six feet high , except some pinnacles deeply seated in the pack , which , Captain Kellet says , had no doubt been thrown up by the floes coming in contact . They sailed along the edge of the pack in a northwesterly direction , till the 28th of July , when they reached latitude 70* 51 ' N. , longitude 168* W. As before , the ice was five or six feet high , dirty colored , showing an outline without a break in it , and having the same appearance of columns and pinnacles some distance in . Commander Moore thought he saw an appearance of land towards the north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off the pack , there was not a particle of loose or drift ice , arid , as far as could be seen from the mast head , it trended away W. S. W. At this point , Commander Moore // and the ice master reported a water sky to the north , and a strong " ice blink , " ( or glare indicating the presence of ice , ) to the southwest . They returned to Wainwright Inlet on the 2nd of August , and went to sea again on the same day . Captain Kellet , steering west , found a shoal , ten miles in diameter , latitude 70* 20 ' N. , longitude 1710 W. , and landed on a triangular rocky island , a few miles in extent , rising to a lofty peak , latitude 710 20 ' N. , longitude I75* 16'W . From this island , mountainous land was distinctly seen in the north and west , at the distance of thirty-five miles . The unbroken pack of ice here stretched northerly and to the E. S. E. , presenting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American shore , Captain Kellett met Mr. Martin , who had returned with the pinnace from his exploration of the shore , and a Mr. Shedden , who had come to this icy region in his yacht by way of taking a pleasure trip , and had accompanied the boats around Point Barrow . The pinnace and whaleboats , though obstructed by the ice , had advanced forty miles beyond Point Barrow , to a low sandy islet four or five miles off shore , off the east point of Dease Inlet , as marked by Simpson . Pullen continued east with the whaleboats , to examine the coast as far as the mouth of the Mackenzie River , so as to connect with Sir John Richardson 's examination . Captain Kellet says he learned from Mr. Martin , that the water east of Point Barrow is extremely shallow ; that the yacht grounded and was obliged to return . Commander Moore says , - " Mr. Martin reports that the water is exceedingly shallow off and about Elson Bay , and that , although the summer has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming through , yet the depth of water necessary is wanting ; this , together with the northeast current , and the prevalence of southwest winds , renders the northwest passage , in my opinion , decidedly unattainable . " Captain Kellet soon afterwards took his ship to the Pacific , and *Commauder Moore laid his vessel up in winter quarters near Behring Strait , so as to resume the exaniination early in the season of 1850 . The Governor of the Hudson 's Bay Company has published a letter , stating that Mr. Pullen had arrived at the mouth of the Mackenzie River without finding a trace of Franklin . // When Sir James Ross started , it was intended that he should send home one of his vessels in the second season , and prosecute the search alone . But the Admiralty , wishing to make the expedition more effective , sent Mr. Saunders in the " North Star " to Lancaster Sound , with supplies , in May , 1849 . If , after delivering the supplies , the water were open and he had ample time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds , to ascertain , if possible , whether Sir John Franklin 's ships had entered either of those inlets . His instructions added , " we desire that you will carefully avoid risking all hazard of the North Star ' being detained a winter in that region ; " " hut you are distinctly to understand , that this permission to join in the search is given only in case of your joining sufficiently early for that purpose , and of your paying implicit obedience to our order that you return to England , so as to run no risk of being shut up in the ice . " Of course , no officer would dream of disregarding such orders , and since Mr. Saunders has not returned , it is very clear he could not . The last news we have of him is a letter dated 19th of July , 1849 , latitude 7403/ N. , longitude 590 40 ' W. , which speaks of the amount of ice opposing him as very discouraging . The letter was brought by the captain of a whaler , whose vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats to the Danish settlements in Greenland , when he met the " North Star . " None of the whalers that penetrated to the western shore of Baffin 's Bay last season saw any trace of the ship . Two sailed into Lancaster Sound , until they met the unbroken ice extending from shore to shore , without seeing a trace of any vessel . A Captain Gravill landed on one of the capes at the entrance of Jones 's Sound , and surveyed the Sound through a telescope forty or fifty miles from its entrance , without seeing any evidence of any vessel ever having been there . The " North Star " is another missing ship . With all our admiration of the explorers , it is difficult to read these narratives without disappointment . The result of the expeditions may be summed up almost in the very words that we used a year ago in anticipation ; a northwest passage has not been discovered ; the northern coast of the continent has been traced from the Pacific almost to the Atlantic ; but little has been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arctic regions , and of Franklin , still all that can be said is , that while there is doubt , there is hope . So far was Ross from discovering a northwest passage , that he found impenetrable ice where its eastern beginning was looked for ; and Commander Moore , after examining the sea north of Behring Strait , says such a passage is , in his opinion . decidedly unattainable . The additions to our knowledge of geography are quickly summed up ; Sir James Ross traced a hundred miles of coast , which seemed to be the shore of an inlet ; Commander Moore thought he saw an appearance of land over the ice , northwest from Point Barrow ; and Captain Kellet , besides discovering a shoal and two small islands , saw mountainous land afar off over the ice . In regard to the lost party , the results are all negative , but sadly significant . In a thorough examination of the shores of the continent from Bebring Strait to the Coppermine , not a trace of the party was found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing of it . The explorations of Sir James Ross , it is true , were not very extensive ; but his long stay at Port Leopold is big with inference . If Franklin had been arrested by the ice within three hundred miles of the entrance to Prince Regent 's Inlet , he would certainly have travelled back to it on the ice , before the end of the summer of 1849 , as the surest means of returning to England . Now had he proceeded directly west , towards Melville Island , he would certainly have been arrested within that distance ; had he attempted to advance to the south of west , beyond Cape Walker , there is every reason for believing he would scarcely have gone half so far . Or had he attempted to penetrate into Prince Regent 's Inlet , in quest of the strait which was believed , four years ago , to connect it with the ocean to the west , he could not have gone three hundred miles . Since , therefore , no one of Sir John Franklin 's party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last August , nor was met by any of Sir James Ross 's exploring parties , which scoured all the surrounding region that spring , we are almost compelled to infer , that Sir John Franklin adopted none of these courses . The only other course left was through Wellington Channel , and the other channels flowing between the Parry Islands . But the papers published by order of the house of Commons shake one 's con*lde*ce a little in the hope that these chan // nels communicate with an ocean to the north . The general expectation of finding a passage through them is founded entirely on Sir Edward Parry 's narrative . When he sailed by the entrance of Wellington Channel in 1819 , it appeared from the mast head to be as free from ice as the middle of the ocean . No ice hut field ice , we believe , has been found west of Barrow Strait . From the observations of Captain Kellet last summer , it appears that field ice can not be seen from the mast head at a greater distance than eleven miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer of 1819 , there was no ice in Wellington Channel within eleven miles of its juncture with Barrow 's Strait . Sir Edward Parry also says , that he saw no ice whatever in the channel , when he returned in the following year . He does not state how nearly he approached the channel ; but his course , as marked upon his chart , shows that he was not within thirty miles of it . Of course , he saw no ice . All we know is , that in the summer of 1819 , there was no ice in Wellington Channel within eleven miles of Barrow 's Strait , and in 1848 and 1849 , it was firmly frozen over all summer . We can only say , it may be a channel leading to the Arctic Ocean , or , may he an inlet or bay . If it is an inlet or bay , we know from the experience of navigators in the great inlet called Prince Regent 's , that no ship could force its way 300 miles from its mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of its mouth , his party would have found their way back over the ice in the spring . Since they did not , we must infer , that if Wellington Channel is an inlet or bay , Franklin is not there . If it is a channel communicating with an ocean to the north , and favorable weather enabled him to force his way through , we are at a loss to conjecture his fate . But the little we know leads inevitably to the conclusion , that the expanse of water spreading to the north of the region ahout the Mackenzie River is a part of the Arctic Ocean . If Franklin had penetrated to the ocean , it therefore seems likely , that some part of his expedition would have been able to prosecute its route over this open sea to the continent . Since no part of the expedition has appeared within sight of the continent on this sea , we have some reason , ( very doubtful it is true , ) for supposing that Franklin did not enter Wellington Channel , even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // It seems now , that Franklin had another project in view , in case all that were suggested in his instructions should fail . Mr. Hamilton , a gentleman living in the north of Scotland , has written to the Admiralty , that he had a conversation with Franklin just before he took his last leave of British soil . The unfortunate navigator then said , if he failed in all these attempts , he would retrace his way through Barrow Strait , and advancing up Baflin 's Bay , would endeavor to find a passage through Jones 's Sound . The Admiralty do riot appear to give full credence to the story ; as to the success of such an enterprise , it is impossible to say any thing . Nothing , in fact , was known of Jones 's Sound , save its existence , until a whaler captain surveyed its shores last summer , with a telescope , as far as he could see from its mouth . What does all this amount to ? That there is some reason , be it much or little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never entered Barrow 's Strait . What then ? That on the very threshold of the voyage , before the region of discovery was reached , his luckless vessels were crushed by the icebergs off Baffin 's Bay , and every life on board lost . This notion , which will at times force itself upon us , is somewhat countenanced by the reported dangers of Baffin 's Bay . The whole central portion of the Bay is covered in summer with broken ice , floes , and bergs , setting towards the ocean , called by the whalemen , the " middle ice . " It leaves but little open water on the western shore , none at all , indeed , near Davis Straits ; but on the eastern shore , there is generally , after the first of June , sufficient navigable water . Vessels arriving at Lancaster Sound sail up the western coast of Greenland , generally as far as Melville Bay . In favorable seasons , they can push through the ice in a lower latitude . But the common practice is to coast up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June , or beginning of July , double the " middle ice , " or sail round its northern edge . Unhappily , southwesterly storms are apt to prevail there at this season , driving the " middle ice " on to the shore , and crushing or overwhelming the ships in its way . So many disasters have happened from this cause , that the passage of Melville Bay is called by the whalers , the Devil 's Nip . An eye witness , writing to Dr. Scoresby , mentioned the loss of nine ships in 1819 , about eleven sail in a year or two after , and twelve or thirteen in the following season . // A numerical catalogue of shipwrecks , xviii not give so clear an idea of the peculiar dangers of this coast , as an abstract of Dr. Scoresby 's full and spirited account of the season of 1830 . Forty sail of whalers were in Melville Bay on the 11th of June , 1830 , fastened to the edge of the land-ice , which extended many miles out from shore , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the 24th , there being indications of a storm , the crews cut canals into the land ice , some hundred feet deep , and drew their ships in for protection . The whole visible expanse was covered with ice ; to the east , with the smooth , unbroken land ice ; to the west , with the floes and icebergs that made " middle ice . " The storm burst forth next day , driving the seaward ice furiously on towards the ships . Floes , dashing against each other , piled up huge ridges , in mimicry of the bergs . The accumulated mass bore against the land ice , crumbling its outer edge , annihilating the canals of refuge , and dealing destruction among the ships . Some were raised by the pressure , some were thrown upon their beam ends ; the broadsides of some were broken in ; others were squeezed flat , and tossed over on the level ice . One was pitched upon her stern , in the posture of a rearing horse ; others were thrown upon the smooth ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , a ship was so quickly covered over in this way , that in a few moments nothing was to be seen but the outer end of the mizzen-boom . The air was fluttering with signals of distress , and the land ice was peopled with shipwrecked sailors . All set emi'rnestly to work deepening the canals , to preserve what vessels were not yet destroyed . After raging a few days , the storm lulled . It rested a few days , then broke forth again with as great fury as before . The bergs again ploughed through the field ice , floes again were heaped up into hillocks , and the remaining vessels were battered as before . When , at last , continuous fine weather had released the remnant of the fleet from their dangerous situation , it was found that twenty ships were lost , and the rest were more or less injured . Few lives , however , were lost ; very few , indeed , except in cases of men attemptin g long journeys over the ice while intoxicated . The life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the ships , instead of being moored to a firm plain , on which the wrecked mariners found an asylum , had been a hundred miles from // land , entangled in the floating ice , we see but little chance of the men or ships escaping destruction . A plain landsman can scarcely read these accounts , bearing in mind at the same time that Franklin , when last seen , was in this calamitous region , and that no trace of his party has been found , without having some fear that the ships were destroyed here , before the expedition was actually begun . Men of nautical experience , however , especially whalemen , who are most versed in the dangers of Melville Bay , seem to fear nothing of the sort . They all say it would be singular that one ship , and incredible that two , sailing in company , should he so entirely destroyed as to leave not a remnant to be discovered ; that in the annals of navigation , the loss of La Perouse is the only instance of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not Franklin 's party still survive ; the doubt is , where they are to he found . The most experienced officers in the British navy , and men of every profession , in this country as well as in England , have published plans for sending relief , and all assume that the lost navigators are only ice-hound in the frozen north . Amidst all who exhibit interest in the lost expedition , stands conspicuous the untiring wife of its commander . Wherever a word is wanted to awaken zeal , or call dormant energy into life , there is heard the entreating voice of Lady Jane Franklin . She has infused her own enthusiasm into the phlegmatic Board of Admiralty ; she has roused a chivalric spirit in the rude whalers of Aberdeen ; all the arctic research of England and America , at her invocation , comes from the study and the cabin to throw light on the obscure regions of the north ; and her prayers of dignified pathos have awakened responsive tones in the hearts of two great nations . The British Parliament and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , British and American citizens , are active in the efforts to which she has stimulated them . The want of success of last year has only whetted the appetite for enterprise . Instead of four vessels provisioned for two years , a dozen vessels are now sent out , supplied with every thing that ingenuity can devise , and provisioned for three years . The discoverers are instigated also by the spirit of emulation . They are all resolved to do more than was done last year . And , among themselves , English perse // verance is put in competition with American energy , regularly commissioned parties vie with volunteers , the Hudson Bay Company , whalemen , and the navy contend with each other . Captain Collinson of the navy is sent to Bhering Strait with the Enterprise and Investigator , Ross 's ships . He is to attach Commander Moore to his command , and , for this summer , is to be joined by Captain Kellet . He is to proceed to Point Barrow , ( beyond which Moore says the water is too shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems best . Two injunctions only are imperative : that nothing whatever is to divert the expedition from its object , the relief of the lost party ; and that two vessels must always be in company , so that if one should be lost , the crew may find refuge on the other . Instructions have been sent to Lieutenant , now Commander , Pullen , at his winter quarters on the Mackenzie River , to explore the sea which spreads to the north from the continent . It is feared that these instructions were sent too late to meet him , and that this , the most interesting of all the expeditions , except the one through Smith 's Sound , may not be attempted . Instructions have also been sent to Dr. Rae , of the Hudson Bay Company , to continue his examination of Wollaston Island this summer , in whatever direction he may think proper . Captain Austin of the navy is despatched with two sail vessels and two steamers , fully equipped for three years , to Cape Walker , Banks Land , Melville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided with light sleds of gutta percha , to enable parties to travel expeditiously over the snow . The importance of these will be appreciated by any one who reads of the toilsome marches which former explorers have had to make on foot . Captain Penny , a veteran whaleman , as familiar with Baflin 's Bay as with the streets of his native Aberdeen , has command of two small vessels , most completely equipped , and manned with a volunteer crew of sailors bred in the Greenland seas . He is clothed with ample discretionary power . His intention , when he left England , was to attempt first to penetrate through Jones 's Sound ; failing there , to push through Wellington Channel . An effort was made to get up a subscription which would enable the old veteran , Sir John Ross , to take command of another expedition . We have not heard that the effort has succeeded . // Finally , two small vessels , fitted out by the munificent philanthropy of Mr. Moses Grinnell of New York , commanded by Lieutenant De Haven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to share in the glory and the perils of the search . The government has received these vessels , two brigantines , from Mr. Grinnel , has manned , victualled them , provided them with nautical instruments , and extended over them the discipline of the navy . This little expedition , numbering thirty-six , men and officers , will push for Wellington Channel first ; failing there , for Cape Walker and Melville Island , failing there , for Jones 's and Smith 's Sounds . We confidently expect this scintillation of American energy will achieve something memorable , perhaps find Franklin , perhaps trace the configuration of the unknown coast far north of the Parry Islands , perhaps make some discovery that no one wots of . Many exploring expeditions hovered around the antartic ice , but it was reserved for an American to find the land which lies behind it . More than one expedition has been sent to the Jordan and the Dead Sea ; but only the American succeeded in making a survey of them . More than one great nation has talked of digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama ; but only the American has begun the work . We are now to see what this same energy will accomplish on the peculiar ground of British discovery . These expeditions can not be abortive . If Franklin is alive , as they who ought to be most capable of judging say he is , he certainly will be found ; if not , his loss will be ascertained . At any rate , important geographical discoveries will be made . XVhat is known of Arctic geography now is only tantalizing . Every voyage which has removed old doubts has excited new ones . Undoubtedly the discoveries of the last seventy-five years have added much to our knowledge , but what remains unknown , is as puzzling as ever . Let navigators achieve as much as they may , they seem always stopped at the gateway of discovery . Whenever we cast our eyes over the boundary of the undiscovered region , the edge of land or water , or the openings of inlets present themselves , promising great disclosures to any who will examine them . No one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onized by Europeans nine hundred years . It is known , however , that large inlets penetrate far into the interior from the eastern and western shores ; that a current sets into those on the east and out from those on the west ; that the great current from the northeast brings down vast masses of ice to the eastern shore , and large masses of ice issue from those on the western shore . It is fair , then , to suppose that these inlets join with each other ; that they are , in fact , straits joining the Atlantic with Baffin 's Bay . Dr. Scoresby , who explored the eastern coast between the 69th and 75th paral-. lels of latitude , thinks it is so ; and Giesecke , who spent a considerable time in examining the natural history of Greenland , lays it down on his chart as a chain of islands . Smith 's Sound is marked on the maps as a break in the northern coast line of Baffin 's Bay . Nothing is known of it but that there is an opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , since it was discovered by Baffin . The Arctic Highlanders , a tribe of Esquimaux living on the neighboring coast of Greenland , afford an argument for holding that this opening is the entrance to a strait leading to the northern ocean . When discovered by Sir John Ross in 1818 , they had nev*er dreamed of people living farther south ; they imagined all the world lay farther north , and they went farther north to enjoy the winter . The Esquimaux , it is well known , depend almost entirely upon the seal fishery for their subsistence , so that it is important to them to live near open water . Their migrations are determined by the opening and freezing of the sea . If they migrate to the north , it must be because the water there remains open longer . This habit of the Arctic Highlanders , therefore , shows that Smith 's Sound leads to some tract of water more open than Balm 's Bay . Following down the western coast of Baffin 's Bay , the next point of interest is Jones 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known . Following the bleak coast still farther south , we come to Barrow 's Strait , through which the Northwest Passage has been so confidently looked for . The great inlet leading to the south is now known to be a hay . The water extending directly west towards Melville Island is called by the British Admiralty , a " part of the Arctic Ocean . " Enough was said in the last July number of this Journal to show , that it is practically a bay , enclosed // on the north by a chain of islands , on the west and south by permanently impenetrable ice . Nor should we be surprised to learn , that it is in fact a bay enclosed on all sides by land . Wellington Channel , and the other channels leading to the north , are confidently looked to as the portals of the Northwest Passage . The doubtfulness investing all we know of them has already been shown . Nor is any thing at all known of the shape or extent of the land lying north , west , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Skipping over some hundred miles to the south , indicated on the maps by a blank , we find the northern coast of the continent . The sea here is at least partially covered with ice all the year , and is compressed into a narrow strait between the continent and two tracts of land lying to the north , called Victoria Land and Wollaston Island . Sir John Richardson , observing that the flood tide comes from the north between these two tracts , inferred the existence of a channel there , leading to the ocean . Dr. Rae spent last summer in examining this channel ; but , until his report shall be received , we must say nothing is known of these lands but the southern shore ; nor of the channel , but its entrance . West of Wollaston Island , no land has yet been found north of America . Between Wollaston Island and Cape Bathurst , the sea is partially covered with ice through the summer . But from Cape Bathurst three hundred miles west , the sea is entirely clear of ice half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks , multitudinous whales disport in its waters , and numberless seals flounder on the shore , a prey to the tribes of Esquimaux who congregate there in the warm months . There can be no question that this is part of the ocean ; but where its eastern and western limits are , no one knows . Farther west , the navigator meets ice in midsummer ; he finds it thicker , and pressing closer upon the shore as he advances , until , near Point Barrow , its glassy surface seems to enjoy perennial repose . At Point Barrow it recedes , a bight or recess being apparently worn into it by the current swept up the western coast of the continent by southwest winds . Beyond Point Barrow , the ice follows the shore , ( generally leaving a navigable passage a few leagues wide , but closing upon the land in some winds , ) to the latitude of // 71* N. At about this latitude , the ice extends out to sea as far as any one has ever sailed , in a line varying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the summers of 1778 and 1779 ; Captain Beechey , in the summers of 1826 and 1827 ; Kellet and Moore , in 1849 , traced it as far long as they had time to examine , and saw it extending still farther . Kellet and Moore went to lat. 72. 51 . N. , long . 168 W. ; from this point , not only was the ice seen trending to the southwest as far as could be seen from the mast head , but also a strong ice blink in the southwest - showed that it extended heyond the horizon in that direction . From a point at 71* 20 ' N. , long . 1750 16 ' W. , that is , 133 miles west , and 91 miles south of the former point , * Capt . Kellet found the ice again , noticed its line extending indefinitely to the north and to the southeast , and saw very high land ahout 35 miles north . Between these two extremes of vision there is an interval of a hundred miles , not yet visited . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currents , and the extreme purity of the water , t we have reason to infer that the icy harrier extends over this interval also . We know , as far as we can know what has not been seen , that land lies beyond this ice . Its permanence , the quietude of the seas , its shoalness , the absence of currents , the vast flocks of ducks that are seen migrating from the north in the fall , and the immense herds of deer that travel to the north over the ice near Point Barrow in the spring and return in the fall , prove so conclusively the existence of land heyond , that the discovery could scarcely add to one 's confidence . As to its extent , we can only infer from the extent of the ice which rests upon it , that it covers many degrees of longitude . Von Wrangell was told by a Siberian , that from Cape Jakan , on the northeast coast of Siberia , one might on a clear summer day descry snow-covered mountains at a great distance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to see so far . He said that , formerly , herds of reindeer sometimes came across the ice of the sea , probably from thence* but that they had been frightened hack by hunters and wolves that he had himself seen a herd returning to the north in April , * At lat. 71 , a degree of long . is 19.53 , at 72 , it is 18.54 miles long . 1 A white plate can be seen distinctly at the depth of 80 feet . // and that he had followed them in a sled drawn by two reindeer for a whole day , until the rugged surface of the ice forced him to desist . His opinion was , that these distant mountains were not an island , hut an extensive land , like his own country . He had been told so by his father . Other natives spoke to Von Wrangell of this distant land , which could be seen in clear weather . Captain Kellet conjectures , plausibly enough , that the distant mountainous land which he descried is a continuation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of Franklin , here finds the whole north closed against him . The passage around Point Barrow , in the northeast , is now admitted to be impracticable . Unless a passage can be found around the coast of Siberia , it is futile to send vessels to Behring ' s sea . The careful observations of Captain Beechey show , that a very slight current sets in through Behring Strait to the north , strikes against the American shore , follows it to Jcy Cape , then strikes off westwardly through the sea . Von Wrangell says , that in summer there is a current from Bebring 's sea passing to the west between Cape Jakan and the distant land seen to the north . These two , in effect , make one current , the only one in Behring 's sea . This passage is sometimes navigable ; for a Russian once sailed through it , from the northern coast of Siberia to the Pacific . Little as is known of it , we are sure of this much : Captain Collinson must take this route , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery than Bebring 's sea . Another conclusion is to be drawn from these facts ; if the northern shore of the continent is ever to be circumnavigated , the course , most probably , will be across Bebring 's sea , around the coast of Asia , to the longitude at least of 18O* W. , then across the north pole to the coast of Spitzbergen . A passage may possibly be found through Wellington Channel , Jones 's Sound , or Smith 's Sound . But the navigation of such narrow channels is precarious ; ice , baffling winds , and adverse currents are apt to retard a ship several seasons . Upon the other hand , a careful examination of the observations of explorers upon currents , climate , and ice , scattered over many books , goes strongly to show ( we can scarcely help saying , shows , ) that about the pole the sea is perpetually open , and the climate is much milder than at Melville Island or at Fort // Enterprise in latitude 640 . If a ship could pierce through the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it could cross the pole , and , favored by the powerful current which pours down from the polar region north of Spitzbergen , could return in triumph to the Atlantic .
