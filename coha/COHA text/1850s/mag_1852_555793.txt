ART . VIII . - Memoir of the Life and Writings of TnoMAS CHALMERS , ID . ID. , LL . ID . By his Son-in-Law , the REV . WILLIAM HANNA , LL . D. New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . 1852. 4 vols. l2mo . WITH what Vigor has Scotland , in these later years , sustained her old claim to the highest rank in science , literature , philanthropy , and art ! The names of her Sons are familiar to the dwellers in every civilized land , and will be , evermore . Her songs are sung on the shores of the Pacific and Indian oceans . Her romances are familiarly known in every log cabin of our mountains , are household books in New Holland and New Zealand . Her histories are pondered , her criticism is watched , wherever civilization and the English language have found their way . Her science is authoritative in the highest schools . Her art adorns the halls of many a proud academy . Her practical skill and energy compete successfully with that of every nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey and Wilson , Alison and Hamilton , Brewster and Miller , ( to mingle the great living with the great dead , ) are but a few of those names which go to make up the glory of the nation ,  --  names of which any country might be proud . In honorable companionship with these , and with the noblest Scottish men of any century , may now fairly be named Thomas Chalmers . His life covered an important period ; and although , from his profession , excluded from political life , he was largely engaged in matters of public concern , and , as almost the crowning act of his career , lent his vigorous and efficient aid to that great movement on the part of the Scottish church whose results we can not yet fully comprehend . John Knox was scarcely a more sturdy and systematic reformer ; but Chalmers had a beauty and gentleness which Knox never knew . Whitefield was hardly a more moving preacher ; but the great Scotchman had a breadth and compass of mind , a variety and profoundness of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robertson could hardly have been more considerate of the prejudices , or honest differences of opinion , in men of // the highest intelligence ; yet Chalmers will be remembered as the fervent and self-denying religious teacher , to whom truths the most profound and far-reaching were as his daily food , when the learned and moderate Principal will be thought of only as an elegant scholar and an accomplished historian . In the unimportant town of Anstruther , county of Fife , on the northern shore of the Frith of Forth , its gray houses with their red roofs stretching along the border of the sea , Thomas Chalmers was born , March 17 , 1780 , the sixth in a family of fourteen children . The germs of future greatness are not always clearly developed in youth . A mind which matures slowly , and expands symmetrically , is often early unnoticed , while that which is forced and eccentric attracts attention . Had Dr. Chalmers died young , he would not , very likely , have formed the subject of a biography , or of an uncommon eulogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merriest , idlest , strongest , and most generous ; with undoubted capacity for learning , when he chose to apply himself and with something of the energy and self-reliance , which were marked characteristics of his future life . Before he was twelve years old , he became a member of the United College of St. Andrew 's , and a fellowstudent with Lord Campbell . His first two years at the University were marked by his devotion to boyish amusements , such as football and handball , " in which latter , " says a contemporary , he was remarkably expert , owing to his being left-handed . " The third year was distinguished by the awakening of his mind ; and the study which attracted him most was mathematics , and especially geometry . Other studies , however , pressed upon his attention . his father was a Calvinist in religion , and a Tory in politics . The tendencies of St. Andrew 's were against both ; and the son manifested his early independence by rejecting the paternal instructions , and adopting , for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . At the age of fifteen , he was enrolled as a Divinity student , although his attention was still mainly devoted to the mathematics . One book , however , took fast hold of his mind , as it had done of Robert Hall 's at a still earlier age . He studied Edwards // on the Will with so much ardor , that some of his friends were afraid that his mind would lose its balance . The grandeur of the thoughts that were suggested , the awfulness of that Divine Being who stood at the centre of the universe , through whom all things existed and by whom they were sustained , so filled his mind , that the difficulty of reconciling human responsibility and the Divine purposes seemed not then to have touched him . Twentyfour years afterwards he wrote to Mrs. Chalmers , - " 0 that He possessed me with a sense of His holiness and I-us love , as He at one time possessed me with a sense of His greatness and His power , and His pervading agency . I remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relish an evangelical sentiment , I spent nearly a twelvemoath in a sort of mental elysium , and the one idea which ministered to my soul all its rapture was the magnificence of the Godhead , and the universal subordination of all things to the one great purpose for which He evolved and was supporting creation . I should like to be so inspired over again , but with such a view of the Deity as coalesced and was in harmony with the doctrine of the New Testament . " Vol. i. pp. 28 , 29 . Perhaps quite as important a part of his mental discipline consisted in his attempts at writing and extemporaneous speaking . In the debating club , the most distinguished members were Lord Campbell and John Leyden . Leyden seems to have been the most noted of the two ; and the remark which his biographer speaks of his having made to a friend of great abilities , but who refrained from speaking through excessive diffidence , reveals the secret of his success . " I see what will happen , " said Leyden to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome his timidity ; " I shall , through constant practice , at last be able to harangue , while you , through dread of the ridicule of a few boys , will let slip the opportunity of learning this art , and will continue the same diffident man through life . " Leaving the venerable university in 1798 , after nearly seven years ' residence , Chalmers entered a o*entleman ' s family as private tutor . The relations here between employer and employed turned out unhappily . Insolence and haughtiness on the one side provoked indignation on the other ; and after suffering various petty // annoyances , which he always took some means of resenting , he returned to St. Andrew 's for a brief space , and in July , 1799 , at the early age of nineteen , was licensed , according to the customs of the Presbyterian church , as a preacher of the gospel . During the next month , he made his first appearance in the pulpit , and , if we may trust his brother James , exhibited something more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective of modern Scottish preachers . Having no place in view as a permanent residence , he spent the next winter and most of the following year in Edinburgh , in diligent attendance upon the instructions of Playfair , Dr. Hope , ( who had just succeeded Dr. Black in the chair of chemistry , ) Prof. Robison , and Dugald Stewart ; where his independence and intellectual vigor manifested themselves in the judgment which he formed and expressed of the value of the lectures of Stewart , considered as profound and scientific discussions . Early in 1802 , he commenced his ministerial labors at Cavers , though with the expectation of an early removal to another parish , when another prospect offered itself so attractive , that he bent all his energies to gaining it . The office of mathematical assistant at St. Andrew 's had become vacant , and he not only obtained the situation , but , during the autumn of the same year , was elected to the living of Kilmany . He entered upon his duties as mathematical instructor with an ardor seldom bestowed upon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils by a warmth of coloring in his lectures , to which they had probably before been entire strangers . The session did not pass , however , without some differences between himself and the mathematical professor , the result of which was that , the next year , it was intimated to him that his services would not he longer required . This he regarded as bearing with it an imputation on his character , and virtually shntting against him the door to that university preferment which was the dearest dream of his life . He resolved , therefore , to give private lessons at St. Andrew 's in mathematics and chemistry , besides supplying his pulpit at Kilmany every sabbath ; and this task he had the energy to accomplish , the very audacity and self-reliance and generous courage of the undertaking // covering the charge of impropriety . The next winter he repeated his course of lectures ou chemistry , and a vacancy happening in the department of natural philosophy at St. Andrew 's , he offered himself for it . It was , however , given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Robison at Edinburgh , he sought an election as Playfair 's successor . He failed , though receiving quite as much support as one so young and comparatively unfriended could expect ; and the contest is memorable only as giving rise to an eloquent and bitter pamphlet , his earliest publication , which he afterwards referred to under circumstances of great interest . It seems , that , during the canvass , the name of IDr . Macknight , a minister of Edinburgh , and at one time an assistant of Dr. Robison , was brought forward very prominently as a candidate , it being proposed that he should perform the duties of the professorship and his ministerial functions at the same time . To this arrangement Professor Stewart strongly objected ; and Mr. Playfair also vrote a letter of remonstrance , in which , among other things , he urged , not only that there were few Scottish clergymen distinguished for mathematical attainments , but that eminence in these was incompatible with clerical pursuits . This last " cruel and illiberal insinuation* ' especially touched the feelings of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous defence of his order , contending that two days in the week were sufficient to enable a clergyman to perform successfully his peculiar duties , while the remaining five might be devoted to any science to which his tastes might lead him . Twenty years afterwards , when Dr. Chalmers 's opinion on the subject of pluralities had long since undergone a decided change , this passage , from the anonymous and forgotten pamphlet , was introduced against him , in a debate before the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church , in which he had taken part . His serious and dignified reply was most impressive . Sir , " said he , " that pamphlet I now declare to have beca a production of my own , published twenty years ago . I was indeed much surprised to hear it brought forward and quoted this evening ; and I instantly conceived that the reverend gentleman who did so , had been working at the trade of a resurrecvon . Lxxv. - NO. 157. 42 // tionist . Verily I believed that my unfortunate pamphlet had long ere now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it was mouldering in silence , forgotten and disregarded . But since that gentleman has brought it forward in the face of this house , I can assure him , that I feel grateful to him , from the bottom of my heart , for the opportunity he has now afforded me of making a public recantation of the sentiments it contains . I have read a tract entitled the Last Moments of the Earl of Rochester , ' and I was powerfully struck in reading it , with the conviction how much evil a pernicious pamphlet may be the means of disseminating . At the time when I wrote it , I did not conceive that my pamphlet would do much evil ; but , sir , considering the conclusions that have been deduced from it by the reverend gentleman , I do feel obliged to him for reviving it , and for bringing me forward to make my public renunciation of what is there written . I now confess myself to have been guilty of a heinous crime , and I now stand a repentant culprit before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publication of my pamphlet were shortly as follows : As far back as twenty years ago , I was ambitious enough to aspire to be successor to Professor Playfair in the mathematical chair of the University of Edinburgh . During the discussion which took place relative to the person who might be appointed his successor , there appeared a letter from Professor Playfair to the magistrates of Edinburgh on the sulz*ject , in which he stated it as his conviction , that no person could be found competent to discharge the duties of the mathematical chair among the clergymen of the Church of Scotland . I was at that time , sir , more devoted to mathematics than to the literature of my profession ; and feeling grieved and indignant at what I conceived an undue reflection on the abilities and education of our clergy , I came forward with that pamphlet to rescuc them from what I deemed an unmerited reproach , by maintaining that a devoted and exclusive attention to the study of mathematics was not dissonant to the proper habits of a clergyman . Alas ! sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have now no reserve in saying that the sentiment was wrong , and that , in the utterance of it , I penned what was most outrageously wrong . Strangely blinded that I was ! What , sir , is the object of mathematical seicace ? Magnitude and the proportions of magnitude . But tken , sir , I had forgotten two magnitudes - I thought not of the littleness of time - I recklessly thought not of the greatness of eternity ! " " For a moment or two after the last words were spoken , a death-like stillness reigned throughout the house . The power // and pathos of the scene were overwhelming , and we shall search long in the lives of the most illustrious ere we find another instance in which the sentiment , the act , the utterance , each rose to the same level of sublimity , and stood so equally embodied in the one impressive spectacle . " Vol. iii . pp. 87 - 89 . The residence of nearly thirteen years at Kilmany was marked by a steady intellectual progress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his estimate of the purposes and duties of his profession , and of his own fitness for them ; a change upon which he always laid the greatest stress , and for a full account of which we must refer our readers to the first volume of the Memoirs . At the age of twenty-seven , Mr. Chalmers began his publications on the difficult subject of Political Economy . On the 21st of November , 1806 , Napoleon promulgated his celebrated Berlin Decree , by which the British islands were declared to be in a state of blockade ; all communication with them was prohibited ; all letters or packets addressed in English were to be seized at the post-office ; all English subjects to be made prisoners of war ; all English property declared confiscated ; commerce in English goods absolutely forbidden ; no vessel coming from England or its colonies , or having touched there , to be received into any harbor . By this severe and unparalleled measure , it was intended so to distress England , to cripple her resources , and to disaffect her people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of Bonaparte . The British manufacturers and merchants felt the blow ; the country generally sympathized with them , and all imagined themselves on the verge of ruin . The retired minister of Kilmany took a different view , and endeavored , through a work which might develop some of the principles of a science little understood , to encourage the hearts of the desponding . He contended that the only loss would be in those foreign luxuries , which the country could well afford to do without ; that the manufacturer of exported commodities would indeed have to change his business , but would , in the end , find an adequate return from the inland consumer , on whom , at any rate , he ultimately relied . The book had a good sale in Scotland , and was somewhat read in England . His own interest in its success was very great , and would have been even more // absorbing , had not his mind been arrested by severe domestic affliction . Not long afterwards , he appeared for the first time before the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattractive , drew to himself a wide attention . He was also engaged in another kind of composition . The Edinburgh En cyclop*dia had been commenced , under the editorship of Sir David Brewster , who solicited his assistance . At first , he chose certain mathematical subjects , but subsequently solicited the editor to assign to him the article " Christianity , " which was accordingly done . The topic itself indicates the change that was going on in his feelings , to which we shall presently allude . When the volume of the EncyclopaAia which contained the article was first published , in 1813 , it attracted considerable attention , and was the occasion of some criticism . It was objected by some , that he dishonored the internal evidences of Christianity by speaking so slightingly of them . Others contended , that the principles of his argument " not only subvert the conclusions of natural theology with the internal evidence , but destroy also the external proofs ; " that " he makes common cause with the sceptic , " and " turns the arms of Christianity against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These attacks led him , not to controversy , but to a more careful examination of the grounds upon which he based his arguments , and subsequently to the more mature and more fully considered series of discussions by which he endeavored conclusively to establish the truth of Christianity . The article for the Encyclop*dia was prepared , however , with great deliberation , and patient study of writings on both sides , and may be considered as forming a part of the standard literature of the subject . During these years at Kilmany , the pen of Mr. Chalmers was busy upon many topics , in sermons which were published , in pamphlets , and in articles for reviews . It illustrates happily the candor which ever eminently characterized him , that when the outcry against geology , as infidel in its tendencies , was strongest , he , and almost he alone , of the Scottish clergy , yielded its mind to his principles so far as they were clearly established , and was indined // to discern in its facts a fresh proof of the truth of Revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led him , not at once to reject geology , but to reconcile it , as to himself he satisfactorily did , with the account contained in the book of Genesis . This was emphatically the seed-time of his life . The enterprises of Christian philanthropy at home and abroad , for which England has been so distinguished , had taken strong hold of his attention . We have seen that political economy formed one of his studies . The condition of the poor , especially as connected with the diffusion of religious and moral education , deeply interested him . On the forma* tion of the Bible Society , with its auxiliaries , a controversy had sprung up , not quite so sharp and bitter as had attended the earlier foreign missionary efforts , but touching more closely the economy of every parish . For , it was said , by absorbing the charity of the public , liberality to the poor would be diminished , and poverty condemned to increased suffering . Mr. Chalmers , with an earnestness amply justified by the subject , showed , by argument and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while pleading in general for the diffusion of the Word of God , demonstrated , at the same time , that the best remedy for poverty was in establishing those principles and habits which would go far to prevent its existence . " The education and religious principle of Scotland , " he said , " have not annihilated pauperism , but they have restrained it to a degree that is almost incredible to our neighbors at the South . They keep down the mischief in its principle ; they impart a sobriety and a right sentiment of independence to the character of our peasantry ; they operate as a check upon poverty and idleness . The maintenance of parish schools is a burden upon the landed property of Scotland ; but it is a cheap defence against the poor rates , a burden far heavidr , and which is aggravating perpetually . The remedy against the extension of pauperism does not lie in the liberalities of the rich ; it lies in the hearts and habits of the poor . Plant in their bosoms a principle of independence ; give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to recoil from pauperism as a degradation . Could we reform the improvident habits of the people , and pour the healthful infusion of Scripture principles into their hearts , it would reduce the existing poverty of the land to a very humble fraction of its present extent . " 42 ' // Two other events occurred during his residence in the quiet parish of Kilmany , which exerted a marked influence on his life . One was his marriage , August 4 , 1812 , to Miss Grace Pratt , who , for thirty-five years , rendered his household so honorable and his domestic life so happy . The other , of wider influence still , was the change which came over his method of regarding religious topics . Upon this subject we can not enlarge , but neither can we neglect to notice it . It will be remembered , that , in early life , he regarded the work of his ministry as quite subordinate to his literary and philosophical pursuits . Various events happened , which led to an entire change of his views . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , had returned from the sea ( he had chosen the profession of sailor , and had risen to the command of a merchant ship , which also carried , in time of war , letters of marque , ) to die of consumption in the arms of his brother . In less than two years , his sister Barbara became a victim of the same disease . An uncle , the most intimate and affectionate friend of his father , had passed away from life in an instant , without a warning , and apparently without a struggle . He himself was seized with a long and severe illness , which confined him to his room for four months , and kept him from the pulpit for six , and left him so reduced in strength that it was a year or two before he fully recovered . All these things brought him to a profound meditation on the brevity of time , the magnitude of eternity , and his own duties and responsibilities . The result was , an entire revolution in his views of certain portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . The chapters which detail this change are the most interesting of the biography , whether considered practically or psychologically ; and the most beautiful , too , as exhibiting the lowliness and humility of his spirit , while he was commanding the admiration of his friends , and extending wider and wider a reputation for eloquence and intellectual power which was soon to fill the whole kingdom . We do not remember , anywhere , a more candid , simple , and direct statement of truths , upon which he was brought to rely , free at the same time from every tinge of bigotry or conceit , or undue self-reliance , than in the letters to his friend , James Anderson , whose intellect he respected as much as he prized his heart . // His eloquence , we have said , began to be known . The quiet and rustic audience at Kilmany could not conceal , any more than they could fully appreciate it . It was the eloquence of a full heart and an exuberant and vigorous mind ; an eloquence which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it was directed , and by the irrepressible thoughts and emotions bubbling up from the living fountain within . " If that man , " said Andrew Fuller to a friend , with whom he had visited Chalmers , " if that man would but throw away his papers in the pulpit , he might be king of Scotland . " Chalmers himself was willing to make the attempt to be an extemporaneous speaker ; but he began too late or did not persist long enough in the experiment ; or the habit , not to say , nature , of his mind was uncongenial with the effort . Whatever was the cause , he did not succeed ; and ever afterwards , though not confining himself entirely to his notes , he mainly relied upon them . Phraseology , sufficiently powerful and expressive for his thought , would not come at an instant to his bidding ; and the result of his unwritten efforts was the unpleasant consciousness that he had omitted much that he wished to say , and had said many things less effectively than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power in the pulpit , occurred shortly before he was called to leave Kilmany . An early and cherished college friend , by peculiar exposure in saving the lives of a shipwrecked crew , whose vessel was thrown upon a sand bank in the bay of St. Andrew 's , by a winter 's storm , had laid the foundation of a disease which soon carried him to the grave . Mr. Chalmers consented to preach the funeral sermon the sabbath after the burial . " It was a brilliant autumn day . The number being too great to be accommodated in the church , one of its windows had been taken out , and a few boards thrown across the sill to form a platform , from which the preacher , while standing but a yard or two from Mr. Honey 's grave , might be heard both by those within the building and those seated on the scattered tombstones of the churchyard . A hum in the crowd ( I now speak on the authority and almost in the words of an eye-witness , ) and a melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher , who seated himself for a minute or two in an old elbow-chair , took the // psalm-book from a little table before him , turned hastily over a few of the leaves , and then rose in the most awkward and even helpless manner . Before he read the lines which were to be sung , his large and apparently leaden eyes were turned towards the recent grave , with a look wildly pathetic , fraught with intense and indescribable passion . The psalm was read with no promising elocution ; and while the whole mass of the people were singing it , he sunk into the chair , turned seemingly into a monumental statue of the coldest stone , so deadly pale was his large broad face and forehead . The text was read : Dent. , xxxii. , 29 , 0 that they were wise ; that they understood this ; that they would consider their latter end ! ' The doctrinal truth which he meant to inculcate being established on a basis of reasoning so firm that doubt could not move or sophistry shake it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared ; and by that inborn and unteachable power of the spirit , which nature has reserved for the chosen of her sons , and which shakes off all the disadvantages and encumbrances of figure , and voice , and language , as easily as the steed shakes the thistle-down from his side , carried the hearts and passions of all who heard him with irresistible and even tremendous sway . It strikes me , ' said the preacher , and as the words were spoken there was a silence among the living almost as deep as that which reigned among the dead who lay beneath , It strikes me as the most impressive of all sentiments , that it will be all the same a hundred years after this . It is often uttered in the form of a proverb , and with the levity of a mind that is not aware of its importance . A hundred years after this ! Good heavens ! with what speed and with what certainty will those hundred years come to their termination . This day will draw to a close , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons . Year follows year , and a number of years makes up a century . These little intervals of time accumulate and fill up that mighty space which appears to the fancy so big and so immeasurable . The hundred years will come , and they will see out the wreck of whole generations . Every living thing that now moves on the face of the earth will disappear from it . The infant that now hangs on his mother 's bosom will only live in the remembrance of his grandchildren . The scene of life and of intelligence that is now before me will be changed into the dark and loathsome forms of corruption . The people who now hear me will cease to be spoken of ; their memory will perish from the face of the country ; their flesh will be devoured with worms ; the dark and creeping things that live in the holes of the earth will feed upon their bodies ; their coffins will have mouldered away , and their bones be thrown up in the new-made grave . And is this the consummation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and issue of man ? Is this the upshot of his busy history ? Is there nothing beyond time and the grave to alleviate the gloomy picture , to chase away these dismal images ? Must we sleep forever in the dust , and bid an eternal adieu to the light of heaven ? " Vol. i. pp. 438 - 440 . There heard him , on this occasion , with peculiar interest , five members of the Town Council of Glasgow , for his name had been spoken of for the Tron church in that city . The canvass was very spirited , but resulted in his election ; and , after some hesitation about leaving the quiet retreat of Kilmany , endeared to him by so many important events in his history , for the wider , more stirring , and more exhausting scenes of the city , he determined to accept the call . The residence of Dr. Chalmers in the great commercial city of Scotland , from 1815 to 1823 , was attended with very interesting results . Though only thirty-five years old , he soon established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city itself from the exclusive influences of trade . The sphere in which he moved was so clearly above that of calculation and economy , that no one could come even within its outermost circles , without being caught up to some nobler purposes than he had been wont to indulge in . He was a scholar and a thinker , more profoundly versed in the sciences than most of those who heard him , and none the less at home in them , because his masculine and vigorous eloquence swept the minds of his hearers along with him towards regions with which natural science has too often been thought to have no concern . Those minds , indeed , were not few whom he rescued from inconsiderate and unworthy notions on religious subjects , not only by compelling their personal respect , but by demonstrating , what indeed has never lacked proof , that an humble Christian faith is entirely consistent with the widest knowledge , and the most original activity of the mind . He had not been long in the city , before it became his turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday , a service which was maintained every week by the clergymen of the city , in rotation . He made the occasion memorable forever , by delivering the first of his Astronomical Discourses , a series which occupied all the afternoons // allotted to him during the year 1816 , and attracted more attention than any series of modern discourses in the United Kingdom . The old church , which often , on such occasions , presented a melancholy array of empty pews , was now crowded before the hour of service . " Long ere the bell began to toll , a stream of people might be seen pouring through the passage which led into the Tron church . Across the street , and immediately opposite to this passage , was the old reading-room , where all the Glasgow merchants met . So soon , however , as the gathering quickening stream upon the opposite side of the street gave the accustomed warning , out flowed the occupants of the coffee-room ; the pages of the Herald or the Courier were for a while forsaken , and during two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old reading-room wore a strange aspect of desolation . The busiest merchants of the city were wont , indeed , upon those memorable days to leave their desks , and kind masters allowed their clerks and apprentices to follow their example . Out of the very heart of the great tumult , an hour or two stood redeemed for the highest exercises of the spirit ; and the low traffic of earth forgotten , heaven and its high economy , and its human sympathies and eternal interests , engrossed the mind at least and the fancy of congregated thousands . " Vol. ii . p. 98 . The Discourses were published soon after their delivery , and their success exceeded the expectations of the most sanguine . The volume " ran an almost equal race " with the " Tales of my Landlord , " published just before . Six thousand copies were sold in ten weeks , and within a year , nine editions had been disposed of . A new vein had been struck . An original and fervent mind had kindled the admiration of all by a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various classes found in the book something to admire . The scientific wondered at the brilliancy of its delineations ; the thoughtful rejoiced at its solution of difficulties ; the devout accepted with gratitude its humble and earnest tributes to the truth ; the man of letters was captivated with the magnificence and sweep of its thought . The fervor of this first admiration we may now well temper , and accept in part the cool and somewhat severe criticism of John Foster , as Chalmers himself , with wonted modesty , admitted its justice . Still , the power // and beauty of these Discourses strike us with hardly less force than at the first reading ; and we can not but remember how much easier it is to pick a flaw here and there , than to conceive the simple but beautiful plan , much more to execute it so magnificently . The domain of astronomy has been much enlarged within a few years ; new and better instruments have largely extended the limits of our vision . But the grandeur of astronomical science has never been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the subjection of all science to revelation , the subordination of all knowledge to divine wisdom , has never been more fully and vehemently enforced . It was not , however , by these occasional displays of power alone , nor perhaps chiefly , that *Dr . Chalmers gained his greatest influence in the commercial metropous of Scotland , but by labors more wearisome , and by preaching on themes more familiar , but not less momentous . He devoted himself , with all the energy of his mind , to the religious and moral welfare of the city . Its schools , the condition of its poor , the building of new churches and chapels , the administration of its charities , besides the more direct duties of his ministry , required of him an amount of labor , which , under our free and voluntary system , we can hardly conceive of . From the Tron church , indeed , he allowed himself to be transferred to St. John 's , a parish with a population of 10,000 , in order that he might have the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . He drew largely upon the assistance of the laity , and inspired all who came to his help with something of his own enthusiasm . The parish was divided into twenty-five districts , over each of which were appointed an elder and a deacon . In each district were established sabbath schools . There were necessarily meetings of the deacons , of the sabbath school teachers , of the session , and of the educational association ; and all these he regularly attended , infusing his own zealous spirit through all the gradations of intelligence which had cheerfully entered his service . While connected with the Tron church , he had found his time so much taken up by intrusive calls , that he made the evil the subject of two public discourses , // in one of which , after depicting , in a manner sufficiently striking to attract the most careless , the various annoyances to which he was subjected , he burst forth in one of those fervid strains , by which he was apt to connect a subject of narrow and comparatively transitory interest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed what losses the learning and literature of Christianity suffered by the unceasing and unnecessary demand upon its ministers for extra labors , and closed as follows - " Now , my brethren , what I strongly contend for is , that in like manner as the Bible of Christianity should be turned into all languages , so the preaching of Christianity should be turned to meet the every style of conception , and the every variety of taste or of prejudice , which can be found in all the quarters of society . The proudest of her recorded distinctions is that she is the religion of the poor - that she can light up the hope of immortality in their humble habitations ; that the toil-worn mechanic can carry her Sabbath lessons away with him , and , enriching his judgment and his memory with them all , can bear them through the week in one full treasury of comfort and improvement - that on the strength of her great and elevating principles , a man in rags may become rich in faith , and looking forward through the vista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of all the hardship and of all the suffering with which they are associated , the reversion of a splendid eternity . Ay , my brethren , such a religion as this should be made to find its way into every cottage , and to circulate throughout all the lanes and avenues of a crowded population , and the friend of the species might take it along with him to the tenements of want and of wretchedness , and knocking at every door where there is a human voice to bid him enter , he may rest assured that if charged with the message of the gospel , humanity in its rudest forms may hang upon his lips , and rejoice and be moralized by the utterance which flows from them . But , my brethren , while I would thus have the religion of the New Testament to send her penetrating influences through the great mass of the towns and families of the community , I would not have her to skulk , in timid and suspicious distance , from the proudest haunts either of wealth or of philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well might , such a front of reason , and to lift such a voice of eloquence , and to fill her month with such a power and variety of argument , as should compel the most enlightened of the land to do her reverence . I would have her - with as firm and // assured footstep as Paul ascended the hill of Arcopagus , and , amid the assembled literature of Athens , drew an argument for the gospel from the poetry and the mythology of Athens - I would have her , even now , to make her fearless way through the halls and the universities of modern Europe , and as she stood confronted with the erudition of academic men , I would have her to equal and to outvie them . Oh ! tell me why it should be otherwise ! Tell me why the majesty of truth should ever want an able advocate to assert and to proclaim it , or why the recorded communication from God should ever want a defender of learning to vindicate its evidence and its history ! " Vol. ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his reputation for eloquence was becoming more widely spread . Crowds flocked to hear him preach . The most intelligent and cultivated were as much fascinated as the unlearned . The church , on a week-day forenoon , was crowded half an hour before the time of service . On one occasion , the inner front door was closed , in order to keep the aisle leading from it to the pulpit empty . But the crowd was too great and too resolute , to allow such a portion of the interior to remain empty . The Doctor had no sooner entered the pulpit than the pressure from without burst in the door , and , in an instant , the vacant space was crammed . Dr. Wardlaw was present on this occasion , and says of it , " On the way home , we talked , inter alia , of this occurrence . He expressed , in his pithy manner , his great annoyance at such crowds . I preached the same sermon , ' said he , in the morning ; and for the very purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I intimated that I should preach it again in the evening ; ' and with the most ingenuous guilelessness , he added , Have you ever tried that plan ? ' I did not smile - I laughed outright . No , no , ' I replied , my good friend , there are but very few of us that are under the necessity of having recourse to the use of means for getting thin audiences . ' He enjoyed the joke , and he felt , though he modestly disowned , the compliment . " Vol. ii . p. 168 . Nor was this a provincial popularity merely . It stood the test of the more critical audiences of the metropolis , because based , not on the accidents of a transitory excitement , or a pleasing manner , but on the exuberance and richness of thought , on the profound verities which are // the exclusive possession of no time or place , and on the deep emotions which these truths , when fully realized , will call forth . On the 14th of May , 1817 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The service did not commence till eleven o'clock ; yet , as early as seven in the morning , the place was crowded to excess , and thousands were obliged to go away for want of room . While in London , Wilb erforce , Canning , and Huskisson , many peers of the realm , and devoted members of the church of England , were among his hearers . On one occasion , the crowd was so great that the preacher was very nearly excluded from the pulpit , the dense mass being absolutely impenetrable , and the request to make way for Dr. Chalmers being taken by the knowing ones as a ruse of ingenious persons , who wished to get a place in front . Among the most interesting of the secondary personages , who move in this narrative about the central figure , is that of the eccentric , but highly gifted , Edward Irving . He appears first , as the assistant of Chalmers at St. John 's , where he attracted many whose minds sympathized with his , and where he did still better service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , his ingenuous honesty , his vigorous intellect , and , above all , his tender and generous sympathies . After leaving Scotland for London , where , for some years , he drew crowds after him by the splendor of his eloquence , he yielded more and more to the vagaries of an enthusiasm , which , even as we look back coolly upon it , is singularly beautiful and fascinating . He ad opted strange views of the prophecies , and believed in miraculous gifts as conferred upon the church ; and vheu some among them pretended to the gift of speaking with unknown tongues , he greedily swallowed the delusion , and defended it with a strength and beauty worthy of a much better cause . " There is a power in the voice , " he says , in describing it , " to thrill the heart and overawe the spirit after a manner which I have never felt . There is a march and a majesty , aud a sustained grandeur in the voice , especially of those who prophesy , which I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sublimest and most impassioned moods of Mrs. Siddons and Miss O'Neil . It is a mere abandonment of all truth to call // it screaming or crying ; it is the most majestic and sublime utterance which I have ever heard , some parts of which I never heard equalled , and no part of it surpassed , by the finest execution of genius and of art exhibited at the oratorios in the concerts of ancient music . And when the speech utters itself in the way of a psalm or spiritual song , it is the likest to some of the most simple and ancient chants in the cathedral service , insomuch that I have been often led to think that those chants , of which some can be traced up as high as the days of Ambrose , are recollections and transmissions of the inspired utterances in the primitive church . So far from being unmeaning gibberish , as the thoughtless and the heedless sons of Belial have said , it is regularly formed , well pronounced , deeply felt discourse , which evidently wanteth only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a very masterpiece of powerful speech . " Vol. iii . pp. 233 , 254 . Alas , that ear was never found ! and the brilliant enthusiast lived to see himself avoided , and almost distrusted , by many who ceased not to admire his genius . Dr. Chalmers , with the almost excessive candor which was natural to him , took pains to send some of the writings of one of the most noted of these users of an unknown language to Sir George Stanton , and Dr. Lee of Cambridge , that he might learn from those linguists if it resembled that of any known language . But on hearing Irving preach , he says , " I have no hesitation in saying that it is quite woful . There is power and richness , and gleams of exquisite beauty , but with all , a mysticism and an extreme allegorization , which I am sure must be permcious to the general cause . " " I undertook to open Irving 's new chapel in London , " Dr. Chalmers says , elsewhere . " The congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been assembled about three hours . Irving said he would assist me , by reading a chapter for me , in the first instance , lie chose the very longest chapter in the Bible , and went on with his exposition for an hour and a half . When my turn came , of what use could I be in an exhausted receiver ? On another similar occasion , he kindly proffered me the same aid , adding , I can be short . ' I said , How long will it take you ? He answered only one hour and forty minutes . ' Then , replied I , I must decline the favor . " Vol. iii . p. 276 . Meantime , the enthusiast went on , from one degree of self-exaltation to another , yet never escaping from the love of his early friend and colleague . For after all , he // was of a noble nature , and his infirmities and faults those of a generous and magnanimous soul . His death , while yet in the prime and vigor of manhood , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter in Madeira , he obeyed rather some miraculous voice of the church , XThich commanded him to go northward , and do a great work in Scotland . Taken violently ill at Liverpool , he had but just begun to recover , when , in spite of prohibitions , he went on board the steamer for Greenock . From Greenock he went to Glasgow , but the powers of life could carry him no farther . Still , he doubted not that he should be raised up for the great labor , till increasing weakness compelled him , at the last hour , to seek a solace in uttering the truth by which he had lived . " The sum of the matter is , if I live , I live unto the Lord ; and if I die , I die unto the Lord ; living and dying I am the Lord 's . " We can understand and sympathize with the testimony of Carlyle . " Butfor Irving , I had never known what the communion of man with man means . His was the freest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with ; I call him , on the whole , the best man I have ever ( after trial enough ) found in this world , or now hope to find . " Chalmers , too , was full of enthusiasm , but of enthusiasm controlled by his judgment , and based upon truth . He was enthusiastic in his preaching , in his efforts for the poor , in his patriotism , in his loyalty . It warms us to read his account of the visit of George IV . to Leith and Edinburgh , the same which so stirred the feelings of Scott . Had it not been , indeed , for that great sea of emotions , which , quiet and simple and unaffected as Chalmers usually was , could be lashed up to such awful commotion , we should have heard little of his name or his iiifiuence . In January , 1823 , Dr. Chalmers was elected to the chair of Moral Philosophy at St. Andrew 's , and felt himself compelled by the state of his health , no less than inclined by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends thought it strange , and nearly inexcusable in him , to give up the wide field of his power , and go to be " extinguished " in the retired college . But in the university , his energy was felt no less than in the parish . // His lectures on moral philosophy , and his favorite science of political economy , were full of instruction , and delivered with an energy which did not fail to awaken the interest of his many pupils . Nor could the indirect influence of a mind of that high order be much less upon the keen and generous susceptibilities of youth . Had we time , we should like particularly to dwell upon some of the scenes of his professional life , as exhibiting , very strikingly , some interesting features of his character . He had not been there many years , before he was solicited to take the chair of Moral Philosophy in the London University . This was declined ; but almost at the same time he was elected Professor of Divinity at Edinburgh , and was thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual life of Scotland , and to that important chair which he retained till the disruption of the Presbyterian church led to his resignation . His introductory lecture was delivered amid rapturous applause ; and throughout the course , his audience consisted not merely of his regular students , but of educated men from all the professions , and of the intelligent citizens of Edinburgh , from whom , at the close , he received the very handsome testimonial of two hundred and two pounds sterling . This was given , partly , in recognition of the fact that , at the time of his appointment , the regular stipend of the office amounted to a little less than that sum . In presenting that tribute , it was gratefully noticed by the donors , not only that the lecturer had given to Theology so dignified a place ambng the sciences , placing it conspicuously at the head of all , but that he had developed his peculiarities of belief with such a generous candor , as to promote a kindliness and catholicity of feeling among those who were separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church government . Yet no one ever charged him with slightly or indifferently maintaining " the awful but venerable tenets of the Calvinistic creed , " which the symbolical books of the Scottish Church so clearly pro . pound , and which he so fully accepted . That breadth of mind and magnanimity were indeed admirable , which enabled him , while judging himself with the utmost severity , to be so charitable to others . While bating nothing of his own theological faith , and defending it , 43 // when rudely and presumptuously attacked , with such gigantic vehemence , he candidly regarded the difficulties and sympathized with the perplexities of those who widely differed from him ; so sympathized , indeed , that he brought into free and almost confidential religious intercourse with himself men of the highest intelligence and proudest self-respect . A short time after becoming fairly established in Edinburgh , he was brought before the public in support of a political measure which produced great excitement . Early in 1829 , the English Ministry introduced a bill into Parliament for relieving the civil disabilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the citizens of Edinburgh was called , in order to petition in favor of the bill . Nearly two thousand people were crowded into the Assembly Rooms , and they were addressed , among others , by the two men of Edinburgh , Francis Jeffrey and Thomas Chalmers . Jeffrey 's speech was marked by gracefulness , good taste , and generous feeling ; Chalmers 's , by the earnestness and vehemence with which he pleaded the cause of religious liberty . " It is not by our fears and our false alarms , " he said , in conchision , " that we do honor to Protestantism . A far more befitting honor to the great cause is the homage of our confidence ; for what Sheridan said of the liberty of the press , admits of most emphatic application to this religion of truth and liberty . Give , ' says the great orator , give to ministers a corrupt House of Commons ; give them a pliant and servile House of Lords ; give them the keys of the Treasury and the patronage of the Crown ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this mighty engine I will overthrow the fabric of corruption , and establish upon its ruins the rights and privileges of the people . ' In like manner , give the Catholics of Ireland their emancipation ; give them a seat in the Parliament of their country ; give them a free and equal participation in the politics of the realm give them a place at the right ear of majesty , and a voice in his counsels ; and give me the circulation of the Bible , and with this mighty engine I will overthrow the tyranny of Antichrist , and establish the fair and original form of Christianity on its ruins . " Vol. iii . pp. 244 , 245 . The effect was magical . Shouts and huzzas filled the air , the audience standing and waving their hats . Jeffrey himself said that he thought eloquence had never produced a greater effect upon a popular assembly ; and his // biographer adds , " no more powerful emotion was ever produced by words , than at the close of Chalmers 's address . Brilliant and glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull compared with his spoken intensity . The rough broken voice , - the ungainly form , - the awkward gesture , - the broad dingy faces - gave little indication of what was beneath . But the capacious brow ! - and the soul ; mens agitat molem. " * In 1832 , Dr. Chalmers published his treatise on Political Economy , and in the year following , his Bridgewater treatise , on " The Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Constitution of Man . " Both of these works were received with much consideration , but yet with criticism . Towards the former , indeed , one Review , the Quarterly , assumed a flippant tone , which nothing in the work itself would justify , even if the character of the writer were not enough to shield him . The subject of Political Economy , and especially the condition of the poor , and the remedy of pauperism , had long interested the mind and sympathies of Dr. Chalmers . his work was not strictly and solely scientific , if indeed it is possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . The large number of the poor , living always on the very verge of extreme suffering , and whom the slightest fluctuations in national prosperity might bring to actual starvation , attracted his attention as a christian and a patriot ; and in bringing prominently to view those moral causes which seemed to bear upon the disease , and to suggest the remedy , he did a work which writers upon the subject are apt to neglect or ignore . Scotland now pays annually , to support her paupers , upwards of two and a half millions of dollars ; and yet the charity is not adequate to the destitution . Is Ireland or En gland better off ? The question respecting the condition of the poor in Great Britain is certainly the most pressing one that can claim the attention of her statesmen and philanthropists . Negro slavery is not so urgent with us ; and those fierce philanthropists , on the other side of the Atlantic , who are so free to denounce us , might well be advised to look a little more narrowly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too well that social evils are not to be remedied at once , nor by violence . The remedy , we know full well , is dark and doubtful , even to the most honest , sagacious , and courageous minds . Whether it be in emigration , the country being overstocked , or in a larger distribution of landed property , in a more liberal public relief , or a more active private charity , or in neither , or in all , we can not say . Dr. Chalmers 's favorite idea was , that the most efficient remedy lay in the moral education of the people , and in the consequent prudence and self-respect which would be diffused , while the small amount of suffering , from misfortunes or unavoidable calamities , would be met by parochial relief supplied by private charity . This , he thought , had been historically demonstrated . " A moral and intelligent peasantry , imbued with a taste for the respectabilities of life , mixing prudence and foresight with every great practical step in the history of their doings , holding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a family , - such a peasantry have more than once been exhibited in the annals of the world , and may be made to reappear. ** We can not stop to develop his general views in political economy , which were strongly Malthusian ; ner can we do more than notice , both in his earlier and later publications on this subject , what Mr. Carlyle , in a characteristic and noble letter , written in reply to a letter accompanying a volume on the Parochial System as a Remedy for Pauperism , in 1841 , calls the " wholesome , grateful air of hope , brotherly kindness , and cheerful sagacity , " which pervades them . " With a Chalmers in every British parish , " he adds , " much might be possible ! But alas ! what assurance is there that in any one ' British parish there will ever be another ? But enough of this . Go as it may , your labors in this matter are not lost no jot of them is lost . . . . My prayer is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , may long be heard in this debate , and attentively laid to heart on all sides . " Nearly connected with his plans for the relief of the poor , and essential , as he thought , to their success , was his project for " church extension ; " for , without the rdilgious instruction of the people , he had no hope of any // lasting social improvement . The population , especially of the large towns , had prodigiously increased ; yet the number of churches and parishes remained nearly the same . From pcrsonal examination , he concluded , that , in many manufacturing districts , not above one eighth of the population had sittings in any place of worship , or made any profession of Christianity . The General Assenmly finally became interested in the matter , and a deputation visited London for the sake of obtaining aid from the government . It was kindly received by the Melbourne ministry , and when the whigs were succeeded by Sir Robert Peel , the good-will towards this scheme seemed to have been transferred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not long before all the parties opposed to the establishment made so vigorous an opposition , by public meetings , by sermons , by pamphlets , and petitions to Parliament , that the ministry forbore to render the assistance asked for . Thus , in the two great practical objects on which he had set his heart , he was destined to fail . His views respecting pauperism were not generally accepted , nor were his efforts for church extension succcssfnl ; and it is touching to hear the humble , self-condemnatory tone , with which that great and generous heart , " dejected and disconsolate , " but not misanthropic or uncharitable , speaks of itself , as if the cause of failure might be in its own lack of purity of motive . " The passage respecting Babel , " he writes , in his Horce Sabbaticce , referring to the Scripture account , " should not be without an bumble and wholesome effect upon my spirit . I have been set on the erection of my Babel - on the establishment of at least two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere idols of a fond and proud imagination , in as far as they are not prosecuted with a feeling of dependence upon God and a supreme desire after his glory . These two objects are , the deliverance of our empire from pauperism , and the establishment of an adequate machinery for the Christian and general instruction of our whole population . I am sure that , in the advancement of these , I have not taken God enough along with me , and trusted more to my own arguments and combinations among my fellows than to prayers . There has been no confounding of tongues , to prevent a common understanding , so indispensable to that cooperation without which there can be no // success ; but without this miracle , my views have been marvellously impeded by a diversity of opinions , as great as if it had been brought on by a diversity of language . The harriers in the way of access to other men 's minds have been as obstinate and unyielding , as if I had spoken to them in foreign speech ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must now - and surely it is good to be so tnught - I must now , under the experimental sense of my own helplessness , acknowledge , with all humility , yet with hope in the efficacy of a blessing from on high still in reserve for the day of God 's own appointed time , that except the Lord build the house , the builders build in vain . ' In thine own good time , Almighty Father , regenerate this earth and gather its people into one happy harmonious fnmily . " Vol. iv . p. 208 . How different this from the pride of a disappointed and soured reformer ! How different its judgment from that probably pronounced upon him hy many of his op. ponents , who thought they knew him well ! His private efforts , however , could in no sense be considered failures . He conducted a wide correspondence ; he issued circulars ; he addressed the country through the public press ; he organized a system of meetings in various parts of Scotland ; and as the result of all , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that nearly two hundred churches had been built , at a cost of more than a million of dollars . In the midst of these labors , he received various academic honors and testimonials . He had been elected a Pcilow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh , and a corresponding member of the Royal Institute of France . Oxford , too , with a courtesy which she has not always manifested , conferred upon him the deoree of Doctor of Laws ; " neither of which last two distinctions , " says his biographer , " had ever previously been bestowed upon a clergyman of the Scottish Establishment . " The year 1838 was witness to an event in the life of Dr. Chalmers , which provoked various criticisms , and was variously interpreted . The passing of the English Reform Bill had excited the fears of many for the fate of the Establishment itself , - fears which were renewed and aggravated , when the Irish Tithe Bill , some years afterwards , proposed to take a considerable portion of the revenues of the Irish Church , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods were proposed in opposition to this aggression . Among them , was a system of lectures to select and influential audiences in London , through whom the principles applicable to the subject might be widely diffused . Dr. Chalmers was requested to address the " Christian Influence Society , " as it was called ; and consented , because he thought it would afford an opportunity for unfolding in " a didactic , rather than in a controversial form , the true theory of a religious establishment , and demonstrating its peculiar efficacy , as the only instrument capable of diffusing , urnversally over a whole eQuntry , the lessons of Christianity . " He prepared himself with extraordinary care , and expectation was excited to the highest pitch . One of the most massive , philosophical , and honest minds of the country and the age , was applying itself to a discussion of a practical question , among the most difficult of those which agitated the times ; a question on the answer to which hung the very existence of that honored and venerable Church which had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bishops and ministers , Latimer and Ridley , Taylor and Cudworth , Leighton and Butler ; which had travelled in the wilderness , while its way was wet by the blood of martyrs ; which had raised its triumphant banner on the mountain tops , while songs of joy ascended from ten thousand thousand voices ; and which , at that very moment , was walking in serene majesty through every city and every hamlet of the United Kingdom . All this seemed to many imminently perilled by the agitations which disturbed the public mind , and by the hazardous movements of hostile or indifferent legislators . And the champion whom they had called to their aid , - it could not but strike many an observer , - was not one of themselves . The arm on which they relied , and which was put forth so firmly and magnanimously , was of a minister whom some of their prelates vould not allow to have a right to administer the sacraments of the Church or to preach , from her pulpits , while some might even have left his salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience was most select . The rooms in Hanover Square had seldom contained a a larger assembly , never one more carefully chosen ; // Members of Parliament , Barons , Earls , Marquises , Dukes , and Prelates crowded the benches . The lectures were received with the utmost enthusiasm , with waving of hats and shouts of applause . One passage , in particular , drew forth a tumultuous burst of approbation , equal to any thing recorded in the annals of eloquence . " If all you mean by an Establishment , " an American clergyman had said to him , " is an organized provision for a clergy , we should rejoice in it . The thing we deprecate is the authority of the civil magistrate in matters of religion . " " Now , " said Dr. Chalmers , " this organized provision is truly all that we contend for . . . . It should never he forgotten that , in things ecclesiastical , the highest power of our Church is amenable to no higher power on earth for its decisions . It can exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . External force might make an obnoxious individual the holder of a benelice ; but there is no external force in these realms that could make him a minister of the Church of Scotland . There is not one thing which the State can do to our independent and indestructible Church but strip her of her temporalities . Nec tetmen consumebatur - she would remain a Church notwithstanding - as strong as ever in the props of her own moral and inherent greatness ; and , though shrivelled in all her dimensions by the moral injury inflicted on many thousands of families , she would be at least as strong as ever in the reverence of her country 's population . She was as much a Church in her days of suffering , as in her days of outward security and triumph ; when a wandering outcast , with naught but the mountain breezes to play around her , and naught but the caves of the earth to shelter her , as now , when admitted to the bowers of an Establishment . The magistrate might withdraw his protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in all the high matters of sacred and spiritual jurisdiction , she would be the same as before . With or without an Establishment , she , in these , is the unfettered mistress of her doings . The king , by himself or by his representative , mi*ht be the spectator of our proceedings ; but what Lord Chatham said of the poor man 's house , is true in all its parts of the Church to which I have the honor to belong - In England every man 's house is his castle ; not that it is surrounded with walls and battlements ; it may be a straw-built shed ; every wind of heaven may whistle round it ; every element of heaven may enter it ; but the king can not - the king dare not ! " Vol. iv . pp. 55 , 56 . As he pronounced this last passage , he rose from his usual sitting position , and uttered the words with an // energy which swept every thing before it , and brought out an enthusiastic response from every hearer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet , and rent the air with their applause . The Church to which he belonged , and for which he had mainly spent his strength , was now , however , approaching that great revolution in which he bore a part so distinguished and so honorable ; that revolution which Lord Jeffrey considered " the greatest event that has occurred in Scotland since the rebellion in 1745 , if not since the Union ; " and which , though it might not demonstrate the error of his principles , yet so strikingly illustrated the difficulty of their practical operation . For many years , there had been growing up a difference of opinion on the question whether a Presbytery was bound to ordain any candidate presented by the party having the living in his gift . On one side , it was held that this was always their duty ; on the other , that the Presbytery were at liberty to refuse ordination , if , in their opinion , the minister could be of no use to the people . As early as   , the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic , that the dissent of a majority of the heads of families in a vacant congregation should be a sufficient reason for refusing to ordain the candidate , - unless such dissent should appear to spring from malicious motives . As this measure was advocated by men who were in favor of retaining the system of patronage , it was thought that all reasonable differences would be reconciled . There soon appeared , however , other parties in the contest . The Earl of Kinuoul presented a Mr. Young to the parish of Anchterarder ; but the candidate proved so little acceptable , that , out of a population of three thousand , only two persons came forward to sign the call . The matter was finally referred to the General Assembly , under whose instructions , Mr. Young was rejected by the Presbytery , so far as that parish was concerned . In connection with the patron , he brought an action in the civil courts against the Presbytery , - at first , to determine who had then the legal right to the stipend , but presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the proceeding of the Presbytery was not entirely illegal . The case // was considered of great consequence , and was argued before the full bench of the Court of Sessions , and finally decided , eight judges to five , against the Presbytery . The minority were Lords Fullerton , MoncrieW Glenlee , Jeffrey , and Cockburn . Here was a decision that the presentees must be inducted into the parishes , however objectionable and odious to the people . Although the decision did not cover the whole ground , since , though pronouncing the course of the Presbytery illegal , the court had not decided what it ought to do ; yet the first step involved the second , and there came up the vital and absorbing question , " whether the church had any jurisdiction independent of the control of the civil power . " The Auchterarder case was carried by appeal to the House of Lords , by whom the decision of the Scottish Court was confirmed . In the mean time , the General Assembly , profoundly moved by this unexpected attack upon its liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 142 , that , " while they acknowledged the entire jurisdiction of the civil courts in all matters pertaining to the civil rights and emoluments secured by law to the church and the ministers thereof " " yet in all matters touching the doctrine , government , and discipline of the church , her judicatures possess an exclusive jurisdiction ; " " and that this spiritual jurisdiction and supremacy and sole head-ship of the Lord Jesus Christ , on which it depends , they will assert , and at all hazards defend , by the help and blessing of that great God , who , in the days of old , enabled their fathers , amid manifold persecution , to maintain a testimony even to the death , for Christ 's kingdom and crown . " We have no room to indicate even , much less to detail , the proceedings within and without the Establishment , the earnest discussions , the appeals to Parliament , the consultations with leaders , now of the whigs , and then of the conservatives , the hopes raised only to be disappointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehement personalities , through which the minds of so large a body of clergy and people were brought to a determination so momentous , as the breaking away from the Church of their fathers . No long time was necessary for the occurrence of new // cases and still more stringent difficulties between the civil and ecclesiastical courts . Presbyteries were summoned before the Judges to receive censure for their proceedings ; the courts assumed that they had a right to interfere , whenever any civil rights were directly or indirectly affected by decisions of the authorities of the Church . Hence , an interdict was granted where a minister had been for a time forbidden to officiate , because this act fixed a stigma on his sacred character . " The minister of Stranraer had been accused of various acts of fraud , and his Presbytery were proceeding in his trial , when he applied to the Civil Court to suspend the whole proceedings of the Presbytery ; ' and further to prohibit , interdict , and discharge the said Presbytery from taking cognizance of the pretended libel . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate acts of theft , and the Presbytery were about to depose him , when he raised an action of reduction in the Court of Session , and obtained an interdict against their proceeding . Mr. Clark , the presentee to Lethendy , who was living in the manse of which he had taken possession , was accused of repeated acts of drunkenness , and the Presbytery of Dunkeld had entered upon the investigation of these charges , with a view to deprive him of his license . But he , too , had recourse to the great Protector , and an interdict against the Presbytery had been issued . " Vol. iv . p. 279 . Interdicts were served against members of certain Presbyteries , to prevent them from sitting in the General Assembly . Patrons and their presentees brought suits for the recovery of large damages from Presbyteries which refused to ordain ; and these damages , in one case , were placed at nearly 80,000 dollars . The press could not be silent in this exasperation of public feeling . The Dean of Faculty , who had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out with a bulky pamphlet , to which Dr. Chalmers replied with a resoluteness and vigor , a dignity and plainness of speech , with which the Dean had perhaps not been accustomed to be addressed . The whole course of events from 1838 to 1842 demonstrated , more and more conclusively , that an interpretation of the law would be sustained , which the clergy felt would put them entirely within the power of the civil magistrate , and that there was no remedy within the // Establishment . To such a community , they had never sworn allegiance . Their liberties were far dearer than the advantages derived from such an alliance with the state . A solemn convocation of four hundred and fifty ministers was held in Edinburgh , not to debate , but to deliberate ; and after six days of anxious consultation , the decision was made . It was a decision made with deliberation , consecrated with prayer , and based upon the most solemn convictions of duty ; yet the public was incredulous . An English Review , devoted to the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feeling in the Scottish clergy , had said , a year or two before , with a pertness and superciliousness which little became it , - " The Scottish establishment is . . . servile to the secular powers , when she has her own ends to gain - very mighty when her vested rights are , in her view , menaced or invaded . . . The means she has employed to assert her spiritual liberties , prove , on closer inspection , to be mere points of form - practically inapt and futile - little more , in short , than the vaporing airs of a body who , feeling their bondage , and galled with the shame of it , submit to the yoke under protest , and thus labor to indemnify themselves by stout words of independence for the loss of intrinsic jurisdiction . ' Before the adjudication of the Auchterarder case , some rather high flights were adventured by Dr. Chalmers and others , in asserting the independence of the Church , and in vaunting their readiness to lose all , and , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mountains , rather than surrender their spiritual liberties . But these tropes meant nothing . The Church is pronounced to be the creature of the State . The mandate has been issued to the presbytery of Auchterarder , to proceed to induct the rejected presentee . One of the presbyteries stood as a culprit , and submitted to solemn censure at the bar of the court . These things are done , and the Church , if not mute , is powerless ; the way to the moors is open , but the talk of martyrdom is quashed , when opportunity and a loud call arise to make a sacrifice for consistency and principle . " A Presbyterian clergyman in London publicly stated , - " If Government is firm , I venture , from pretty accurate information , to assert that less than one hundred will cover the whole secession .... I am not satisfied that any will secede ; " and a day or two before the event , a sagacious citizen of Edinburgh wrote , " Mark my words - not // forty of them will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the opposers understood not the profoundness of the movement , or the spirit of the men . They knew not that the spirit of the martyrs , whose ashes repose in the old Gray Friars ' churchyard , was still alive in Scotland* The day for the final meeting of the unbroken General Assembly at last came , the 18th of May , 1843 . After the usual services in St. Giles 's Cathedral , a venerable structure , within whose walls , two hundred years before , had been taken the oath to the Solemn League and Cove . nant , - the Assembly , attended by the Marquis of Bute , the Lord High Commissioner , met in St. Andrew 's church . After the Assembly had been opened , the Moderator , Dr. Welsh , proceeded , amidst the breathless anxiety of the audience , solemnly to announce his protest and that of his fellow clergymen against violations of the received liberties of the Church , and their consequent determination to withdraw from the Establishment in which they could no longer conscientiously remain . Having read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dand bowed to the Commissioner , left the chair , and walked out of the church , followed by more than four hundred ministers , and a still larger number of elders . They were greeted with cheers by the crowd without , and proceeded through the thronged sfreets , watched by curious , friendly , or jealous eyes , to a hall prepared for their reception , and which , from an early morning hour , had been filled with an expectant crowd . Dr. Chalmers was immediately chosen moderator , and the assembly , thus constituted a free and independent body , proceeded to business . Nowhere , in modern times , has there been an exodus so heroic as this , - four hundred and fifty of the clergy voluntarily laying down their . livings , relinquishing an annual revenue of more than five hundred thousand dollars , ministers from the cities exchanging their costly and attractive places of public worship for humble halls in uncomfortable localities , - ministers in quiet country places going from their pleasant manses , where there was literally not a house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a church could be erected , or a room in which they could minister to the congregations which 4z* // accompanied them . Well might Lord Jeffrey say , " I am proud of my country . " Well might he , too , and other intelligent Scotchmen , complain of the short-sighted policy of a government which , with no more intelligence of the public feeling , or indifferent to the result , should , without earnest efforts at conciliation , have allowed such a body of the most active , sincere , and devoted members of the established Church , for no error of doctrine or of practice , to go out from that body , not angrily , but sorrowfully , shaking off the dust of their feet as a testimony against it . We can not but believe that a little more of a friendly and conciliatory spirit , and a few concessions on the part of the government , would have saved the disruption , preserved the integrity of that ancient Church , satisfied every mind in it , and retained for it a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and prerogatives would have been left inviolate . No sum of money can adequately represent the value to the Establishment of retaining within itself , not only , we say , that noble body who were thus , against their sympathies and established habits , expelled from it , but that one noble genius , whose eloquence had so vigorously defended it , and whose name will be handed down to posterity as one of the truly great men of Scotland . Yet , in hardly any view , can we regret the result . It has , indeed , brought into existence another religious body , while we are far more anxious for union , in these days , than for separation . But it has given another demonstration of the power of a noble purpose , of the life and energy of the highest virtues . We think better of Scotland , more hopefully of the race . The heroic times have not entirely gone by , nor have prudence and thrift and commercial sagacity rooted out from the heart every nobler principle . And the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and benevolence abroad , - these , too , will not in the end be found to suffer . Besides all , there has been demonstrated again , under circumstances of great interest , both the inherent practical difficulties of a union of Church and State , and the possibility of the prosperity of the former without the aid of the latter . Dr. Chalmers , indeed , never changed his opinion of the importance of such a union between the // two , as should secure from the Government a proper encouragement and support , and from the Church an organized and vigorous attack upon the heathenism fearfully increasing among the people . Yet he was the leader in the movement which entirely dissevered the one from the other . We do not propose to follow the history of the Free Church , the petty annoyances or serious trials of its earlier days , or its more peaceful and prosperous course afterwards . Yet it is worthy of notice , for it marks the depth and power of the movement , that , at present , it numbers between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustentation fund ; has built nearly seven hundred churches , and five hundred manses ; has created five hundred schools , and a college with nine professorships , with a salary secured to each of from fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars , - the people having given , for these and other purposes , about $15,000,000 . It has sent its missionaries to Canada and the West Indies , to the Jews in central Europe , to Constantinople and Australia ; and , as long ago as 1847 , was raising annually , for education and religious charities , three times as much as the united Church of Scotland did in 1843 . " It is a favorite speculation of mine , " says Dr. Chalmers , " that , if spared to sixty , we then enter on the seventh decade of human life ; and that this , if possible , should be turned into the sabbath of our earthly pilgrimage , and spent sabbatically , as if on the shore of an eternal world , or in the outer courts , as it were , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had entered far into that seventh decade , - not to him a season of rest , - when the establishment of the Free Church was completed . To his unwearied labors , his prudence and foresight , it owed much of its success . His interest in it did not divert his mind from the higher objects , for the attainment of which it was , after all , but an instrument . He was hardly released from his most pressing labors in connection with it , before he reverted again to his favorite plan of operating upon the lower classes in the city , who seemed utterly beyond the influences of Christianity . He chose the worst locality of Edinburgh , the West Port , and opened his school in a // room at the end of the very " close " made infamous by the atrocious murders of Burke and his associates . The school prospered . An excellent superintendent was obtained . A church was finally built , and , but a few weeks before his death , he presided over its first sacrament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region which , two years before , was regarded as beyond the reach of charity . During these years , however , he seems to have felt himself drawing towards the end . Though of a vigorous frame , he could not quite endure the full amount of former labors . His thoughts seem to have been turned backward over the earlier periods of life ; his affection , always so simple and hearty , to have become still more chastened and beautiful ; and his old age to have fully ripened the best fruits of a noble life . One who heard him in his bursts of overpowering eloquence , when every obstacle seemed loosening and sweeping away under the tide of passionate feeling , would not suspect , perhaps , the childlike simplicity and truthfulness and humility , which so conspicuously marked his private demeanor . One who saw him only when endeavoring to elucidate some difficulty in theology , or establish some favorite point in political economy , would not have conjectured how gentle and playful he was with his children and grandchildren , nor how patient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that Dr. Hanna has devoted a chapter to the minor traits of character , the private manners and ways , of Dr. Chalmers , so that we may see the man at home ; the father frolicking with his children ; the host presiding at his table , as well as the professor in his chair , and the orator in the pulpit ; so that we may get a glimpse of the letter , down which his pen wandered so resolutely , but so strangely , that nobody could read it , and even his father was driven to lay it on the shelf " for Thomas , when he comes home , to read it himself ; ' * so that we may hear the unfamiliar music of that broad Scotch accent and dialect , which he was never ashamed of and never avoided , and gaze upon that massive figure , and the furrowed countenance , with its mingled expression , when in repose , of dreamy heaviness and intelli // gence , and its illumination and fervor when in action ; and listen to his vehement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substantial , unvaried gesture most harmonious with the truthful and earnest character which never aimed at display , and never used a motion nor a word , but for the sake of exalting , or illustrating , or riveting the thought . " I shall blush to my very bones , " said he , to Margaret Fuller , alluding to the outcry of the abolitionists against the Free Church for receiving money from American slaveholders , " I shall blush to my very bones , if the Clzaarrch yield to the storm . " His manner of speaking this gave her , she says , " a hint of the nature of his eloquence . " Most of these private memoranda we must pass by entirely . In 1845 , after an absence of several years , he visited again his native village of Anstruther , sought out the companions of his boyhood , and gathered the shells on the beach , and the flowers from the hedges . " But the most interesting visit of all was to Barusmuir , a place a few miles from Anstruther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had been occupied by Captain R , whose eldest daughter rode in daily , on a little pony , to the school at Anstruther . Dr. Chalmers was then a boy of from twelve to fourteen years of age , hut he was not too young for an attach* ment of a singularly tenacious hold . Miss R was married ( I believe while he was yet at college ) to Mr. F , and his opportunities of seeing her in after life were few , but that early impression never faded from his heart . At the time of this visit to Anstruther , in 1845 , she had been dead for many years ; hut , at Dr. Chalmers 's particular request , her younger sister met him at Barusmuir . Having made the most affectionate inquiries about Mrs. F and her family , he inquired particularly about her death , receiving , with deep emotion , the intelligence that she had died in the full Christian hope , and that some of his own letters to her sister had served to soothe and comfort her latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there a portrait of your sister anywhere in this house ? ' She took him to a room , and pointed to a profile which hung upon the wall . He planted himself before it - gazed on it with intense earnestness - took down the picture , took out his card , and , hy two wafers , fixed it firmly on the back of the portrait , exactly opposite to the face . Having replaced the likeness , he stood before it and burst into a flood of tears , accompanied by the warmest expressions of attachment . // After leaving the house , he sauntered in silence round the garden , buried in old recollections , heaving a sigh occasionally , and muttering to himself- ' more than forty years ago ! ' It is not often that a boyish feeling survives so long , and still less frequent that , after such a life of variety and occupation as his had been , it should break out so freshly and strongly ; nor would we have ventured to record the incident , did it not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much distinguished for the tenderness and tenacity of his attachments , as for the brilliancy of his intellectual gifts . " Yol. iv . pp. 433 - 434 . An immediate effect of the Disruption , was the refusal of the landed aristocracy of Scotland to grant sites for the erection of new churches and manses . This grievance finally became so great , that the General Assembly petitioned Parliament for redress . A committee of the house was appointed , before whom Dr. Chalmers was requested to appear as a witness . This led to his visiting London in May , 1847 ; and the visit appears , by the record in his journal , to have been every way agreeable . He was most cordially greeted by many old friends , and found many new ones . Returning home by the way of Oxford and Bristol , he reached Edinburgh , apparently in good health , on Friday , May 28th . The General Assembly was in session , and he occupied Saturday forenoon in preparing a report to be read before it on Monday . On the Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the afternoon ; and afterwards , walking alone in his garden , he was overheard , saying , in low but earnest tones , " 0 Father , my Heavenly Father ! " The evening was delightfully spent with his family , to whom , on retiring early , he waved his hand , bidding them " a general good night . " The next morning , his housekeeper knocked at the door , but received no answer . She entered ; the room was dark ; she opened the shutters , and drew back the curtains of the bed . There he reclined , half erect , upon his pillow , a " fixed and majestic repose " resting upon his countenance . His arms and hands lay as he was accustomed to place them when he slept , but the brow was cold and the heart motionless . Without the sign of a struggle or a pang , and , as appeared probable , " very shortly after that parting salute to his family , he had entered the eternal world . " On the following Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by the members of the General Assembly , the magistrates and Town Council of Edinburgh , the professors of the college , the teachers and students of the schools , and multitudes of citizens , under the sorrowful gaze of a hundred thousand spectators . " It was the dust of a Presbyterian Minister , " said an Edinburgh newspaper , " which the coffin contained ; and yet they were burying him amid the tears of a nation , and with more than kingly honors . " We have no space , and there is certainly no need , to attempt a more critical estimate of the abilities or the labors of Dr. Chalmers . A merely literary man he certainly was not ; his mind turned naturally to science rather than to letters ; he thought himself intended by nature for a military engineer . He was not contented with receiving the speculations or discoveries of others ; but endeavored to add to the substantial stock of knowledge . What the author of " Peter 's Letters " said of him , more than thirty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is easy to see that he has a mind most richly stored with all kinds of information ; . . . but all his stores are kept in strict subservience to the great purposes of his life and profession - and I think , various as they are , they gain instead of losing , both in value and interest , from the uniformity of the object to which he so indefatigably bends them . It is the fault of the attainments of most of the gifted men of our time , that they seem to be in a great measure destitute of any permanent aim , with which these attainments are connected in any suitable degree . But with him , there is ever present the sense and presiding power of an aim above all others noble and grand - the aim , namely , and the high ambition , of doing good to his countrymen , and of serving the cause of religion . " Peter 's Letter to his p. 478 . Kinsfolk , Am. ed . A lover of philosophy , he was not metaphysical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of analysis , he was an orator rather than a logician . Wherever he was , he exerted the sway of a monarch by the power of a capacious and original mind , and gained the triumphs of his eloquence , not by gratifying the prejudices of his hearers , or by concealing an unpalatable truth , but by // the mingling of argument and illustration , the exuberance of language , the splendor of coloring , the fearless and uncompromising attack ; by bringing the whole strength of his thought , all alive with passion , to bear upon the truth which thoroughly possessed his own soul . Had he written less , he might have exposed himself to less criticism ; but neither could we judge of him with so much satisfaction and certainty . But , far above and beyond all that he was intellectually , were his noble qualities as a man . The virtues which Spenser sang of , in his Faerie Queen , as going to make the ideal of " magnanimity , " were largely exemplified in him . At the age of thirtyfive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his genius was recognized by the best minds of the land ; and thenceforward , through life , his position was among the foremost intellectual men of his day ; - yet never did honors make him forget humility , or the most intoxicating applause lead him to swerve from the path of unaffected simplicity , and kindness , and rectitude . High-toned and generous , enthusiastic and full of sentiment , with a touch of chivalry even ; keenly sensitive to rebuke , yet receiving with acquiescence every truthful and fair-minded criticism , and grateful for approbation ; capable of great severity when provoked , and indulging sometimes in fearful bursts of indignation at injustice , or insult , or negligence , or meanness , and not always discriminating between an incapacity and a fault ; intolerant of all narrowness and bigotry : without jealousy and without fear ; - his virtues and his faults were those of a great and resolute and enthusiastic mind . A Scotchman in language and in patriotism , yet with affection and sympathies quite cosmopolitan , he imparted bis energies broadly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration of every noble mind with which he came in contact . Men of large knowledge and of various opinions and tastes came lovingly to find gratification in his capacious intellect , and sympathy in his many-sided affections . He was a theologian of firm , and , as some would think , somewhat austere opinions ; yet none could be more candid or considerate to every inquirer for the truth than he ; none would stoop lower , or labor more cheerfully , to remove difficulties from // an honest understanding ; none bowed more implicitly to the words of Revelation , or refused more earnestly to believe that all truth was compressed into a linman creed . " Let me not , " he prays , in his Horcr Sabbaticce , as if from some urgent impulse , " let me not be the slave of human authority , but clear my way through all creeds and confessions to thine own original Revelation . . . . Deliver me , 0 , God , from the narrowing influences of human lessons , and more especially of human systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeness of thine own Word , and hasten the time when , unfettered by sectarian intolerance , and unawed by the authority of man , the Bible shall make its rightful impression upon all , because the simple and obedient readers thereof call no man master , but Christ only . " And so , with reverence and love , we take our leave of him , this illustrious man , whose life has honored and dignified his country and his age . " He has gone over to the majority , " to the great assembly of the just and good . This century shall not see his like again . Scotland will cherish his memory among her regalia ; while the devout , the humble , the fervent , the noble-hcartcd , in many lands and in many times , will draw their grand lessons from his life , and instruction from his works . Of the biography itself , we may say , in a word , that it is a complete and noble tribute to the memory of a father and a friend . For the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been omitted ; and for the sake of the wider diffusion of so illustrious an example , we should have preferred a briefer work . But we well understand how , written at such a time and by such a hand , it should grow upon its author , and far outrun his first liberal calculations .
