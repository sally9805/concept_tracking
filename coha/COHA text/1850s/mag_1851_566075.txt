txt ART . VII. - THE WORLD 'S ADVANCE . The Christian Retrospect and Register : a Summary of the Scientific , Moral and Religious Progress of the first half of the Nineteenth Century . By ROBERT BAIRD. l2mo. pp. 420 . M. W. Dodd : New York . 1851 . THE brief Introduction which prefaces this volume sufficiently explains its character and purpose . The author , it seem s , at the suggestion of another , undertook to prepare from year to year a *resum* of facts " bearing upon the progress of the kingdom of God and the most important interests of mankind ; " a year-book , in short , of the world 's history . The present volume is preliminary to that contemplated work , and is designed to form a point // of observation from which to survey the opening scenes of providence in years to come . The plan strikes us favorably , and if carried out as it may be and ought to be , will prove one of no little benefit to the public , particularly to the religious portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we would sooner trust a work of this kind than to the author of the volume before us . Connected as he is with a iReli*ious Association which is necessarily brought into contact , more or less directly , with almost the entire habitable globe ; and himself , by a wider range of travel than ordinarily falls to the lot of men , made acquainted personally with more of the countries and more of the people of the earth than almost any one living ; he has peculiar facilities for the compilation of such a work as he has undertaken . The only fear we have is lest the pressure of other engagements may leave him too little time to accomplish properly what otherwise would be for him sufficiently easy . In this view , we hope the preliminary volume which he has just given us , is not a fair specimen of those which are expected to follow , for we are compelled to say that this is far from being satisfactory , far from being a proper treatment of the subject in hand . And this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give to the work that amount of attention which it imperatively demanded ; for there are portions of the volume which show that the whole might have been such as to commend itself to the most critical reader . There may be in the present case some peculiar ground of excuse , but we hardly know how to pardon , in a grave retrospect of a half-century just closed , such errors and mistakes as are to be met with in this book , and which a moderate degree of care and consideration would seem enough to obviate . The author tells us that the work was begun in the early days of March of the present year , and the Introduction bears date the ninth of the following May . The history of a half-century composed in two months ! This might perhaps do for some half-century during the dark ages , but when it comes to the first half of the Nineteenth century , that is quite another thing . We doubt whether any one has a right to undertake such a task , and were not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to resent the handling which it here receives . Under such circumstances of composition we can not , of course , expect correctness either in an author 's language or his facts . No one , therefore , understanding how the thing was done , would betray any surprise at seeing one write ( p. 77 ) in reference to the discovery of certain planetary bodies , " these discoveries attracted great attention , and their orbits and perturbations were // speedily computed . " Otherwise he might ask to what " their " in the above sentence refers . So again when this sentence should meet his eye ( p. 151 ) : " In October , 1849 , the first steamboat began her trips upon the inland waters of California ; by the close of the next year they numbered 4Th " he would be almost compelled to think that the writer 's pen , in its haste , neglected to put on paper a part of the sentence which was really in the mind . To say too ( p. 187 ) , that " all standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other works , especially on the subject of religion , are i*nmen8ely stereotyped , " savors more of the style of the author of " Napoleon and his *arshals " than of that of either of the compilers of the present work when they write as they can . But these are trifling blemishes , and perhaps we should not advert to them at all . There are , however , those of a more serious character . We have not examined the whole book critically , for we have not had time . Our attention has been bestowed more especially on the first part of the volume , and the mistakes and omissions which we have noticed will be found principally in connection with that . The section on Astronomy opens with the declaration that the progress of this science " was not distinguished by any very remarkable discoveries for some time after the commencement of the present century . " But at a time when the solar system included , all told , barely the sun , seven planets with their satellites , and a single comet of ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of only six years , and at the very opening of the century , of no less than four new planetary bodies would be deemed very remarkable . It certainly has been enongh to keep the whole astronomical world alive with interest on the subject nutil now . Nor is it true , as stated on page 77 , that there were then fifteen of these smaller planets , or that " the satellites of Uranus are now again found and computed . " There were but thirteen of the alleged planets , though another has since been found , while of the satellites of Uranus four only are known to exist , and but two are computed . Nor is it true again that ( p. 87 ) " the western coast of North America was carefully examined through nearly its whole extent by the United States exploring expedition under Captain Wilkes . " The most that can be said of that expedition in this respect , is , that it made a careful survey of the mouth of Columbia River , Puget 's Sound , and the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lieutenant Fremont 's second expedition " disclosed the existence and character of the great Salt Lake " ( p. 87-8 ) , we have a recollection of looking out from time to time // on the map , in our school-boy days , such things as Salt Lake and Lake Tiinpanogos , which were located very much where Fremont 's Salt Lake is . It would seem also that the account of the discovery of the planet Neptune ought to include the mention of the fact that similar computations to those which have immortalized the name of Le Verrier , were made independently by Mr. Adams of England , and the true place of the planet announced by him to Mr. Airy , the astronomer royal . Leaving the section devoted to Astronomy , and coming to that which treats of Medicine , the book before us says ( p. 130 ) " The introduction of ana*sthetic agents into surgical operations took place in Boston , in 1846 . The first surgical operation , upon a patient rendered thus insensible to pain , was performed by Dr. J. C. Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible of proof , it has been proved , and ought never more to be denied or doubted , that two years at least before the date here named , such an agent was introduced to the knowledge of the public by Horace Wells , an ingenious dentist , of Hartford , Conn. , and who received from the French savans , sitting for the investigation of this very subject , their medal and the credit of having given this remedial agent to the world . He used , indeed , nitrous oxide , for the purpose of preventing the sensation of pain . And in his hands this gas was effectual , and sulphuric ether and chloroform were , so to speak , but modifications of his original principle . The application of ether , like the self-acting vaWes of the steam engine , was more the happy accident of laziness than anything else , a chemist having given an operator , to whom Dr. Wells Ii ad made known his discovery , ether instead of the nitrous oxide , as he said , 6ecause it was too muck trou*de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navigation , the representation is made ( p. 152-3 ) that the Atlantic was first crossed by steam , in the year 1838 , by the Sirius and Great Western steamers . The truth of the case is , as almost the slightest research would have shown , that the practicability of ocean navigation was first proved by our own countryman , Captain Rogers , who , we believe , is yet living , and who made the voyage from New York to Liverpool , during the summer of 1819 , in the steamship Savannah , of 350 tons , and in the then short period of twentysix days . We shall not go further in the work of pointing out and correcting errors of fact . There are some sins of omission , however , which we feel bound to notice along with those of commission . We find nowhere in the sections devoted to scientific dis // covery , or the application of science to the arts , any mention of the photographic art , or the nain e of Daguerre . Now , we are very certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once , and it would seem that no one could walk through the streets of New York , for a single day , without receiving an indelible impression of the existence of that beautiful art which has already contributed so much to the sum of human happiness . The extensive introduction also of india-rubber and gutta percha into the arts , we should hardly think one could fail to notice in a review of the history of the last fifty years ; but we have found no mention whatever of these contributions to human comfort . The use of gas , also , for purposes of illumination , though it belongs entirely to the present century , is not spoken of . Little mention either is made of steam , except in its application to land and water carriage . And when we come to those things which more manifestly concern the moral interests of men , we can not but notice the lack of any allusion to many reformatory associations and organizations whose avowed and special object is the reclamation of the bad and the melioration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb ; hospitals for the insane , and the diseased poor ; houses of refuge and correction ; reform and ragged schools ; associations for the relief of the indigent ; model lodging-houses and societies ; peace congresses , with their honorable delegates from all the civilized world ; and peace societies with their books and tracts ,  --  these , and other matters of like character and import , we look in vain for any account of in this retrospect of the last half century . We had supposed , too , that the question of human freedom had made some stir and some advance toward settlement during the last fifty years . We thought it had agitated our own country as well as France and Great Britain , and we had an indistinct recollection of having heard it mentioned even in connection with Turkey and Algiers . The volume before us , by its almost utter silence on this subject , would lead us to doubt , if possible , our clearest knowledge and most painful convictions . There is a saving clause , however , in the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the omission in question . He writes , " It only remains to say that , from the nature of the case , many movements , to which some persons attach no little importance , could not be treated in this volume : some , because of their comparative want of merit ; some , because it is not clear that they have had , or will have , the influence which their advocates claim for them , upon the best interests , temporal or spiritual , of mankind , and some , because the size of the volume would not allow of their being introduced . " We do not know under which of // these categories our author considered the subject of slavery as coming . We will not undertake to decide for ourselves . But , seriously , a history of the last half-century , or the most casual retrospect of it , in which the question of human freedom and personal liberty does not hold a place , is like the play of Hamlet with the Hamlet left out . We have been led so far in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which we have made in an altogether friendly spirit , that we have left ourselves little room for the commendations we would make , and these we must offer in the most general terms . Aside from the imperfections and drawbacks to which we have adverted , and which must prevent the work before us from taking its place upon the shelf as a thoroughly reliable history of the period of which it treats , it is a valuable contribution to our store of general information . So far as it is free from error , it presents , in a convenient form , and in a single view , a summary of events of which no one can afford to be ignorant . And while it will seem meagre to every scholar , in his own special department , to the general reader , who neither cares to be , nor needs to be , very exact in his knowledge , it will be quite acceptable and useful . We have been particularly pleased with the opening chapters , on the political changes of the half-century and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given are , so far as we know , reliable , and they give , in their naked figures , a history of thrilling interest . The chapters which treat of science and its applications , written with equal haste as the previous portions , but with less familiarity with the subjects treated of , would naturally be less satisfactory because less correct . The ordinary reader can not fail , however , to be much interested in this survey of the field of science . The latter half of the book , which is occupied with the strictly religious history of the half-century , we have examined less carefully than the previous portions ; but so far as we have given it our attention , we have seen no reason to find fault , and we should presume that Dr. Baird would make this what it should be . On the whole , then , while we can not commend the volume in question as one to satisfy the wants of the scholar , or those whose facts must be facts , and exact facts , too , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information of the general public . It is not what a history of the last halfcentury should be , and for such a history we must wait , meanwhile thanking our author for this essay in that direction . We believe a work is in progress in England , in some four volumes , which aims to record the events of the fifty years past . We // shall await its arrival with no little interest , and will wait any reasonable time , if thereby we may escape the mistakes of undue haste in its compilation . A man should set himself down to write such a history as he would to write that of a great kingdom or hero . The last half-century was a hero among the halfcenturies . It towers above them like Saul , " who from his shoulders and upward was higher than any of the people ; " and he who undertakes its history , must not think to accomplish his task by using the odds and ends of time which are left uncoilsumed by the ordinary calling and occupations of life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficient to show that in the number of great events which characterize it , and the forces which it has set in operation , it is equaled by no other in the world 's history . It is true , indeed , that we are , at the best , so short-sighted , that it becomes us to be diffident in measuring events with one another , and assigning relative values to them . What to-day looms up in the attitude of greatness , may soon have spent its force , while that which now is hardly noticed may be but the seed whose harvests are yet to cover the earth with their fruit . And yet there are certain weights and measures by which we may estimate the value of principles and events , and calculate their probable effects with well nigh as much accuracy as we do in the case of physical and mechanical substances . We have the word of God , giving us its faultless standard of truth , and its prophetic calculus by which we may measure causes as they project their effects far into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own nature , answering even amid its perversions and defects , to all that is fitted to be of permanent value to it , and indicating , as by a divine mechanism , what bears most directly and strongly upon that final consummation of the world 's history , when all shall be redeemed unto God , when the evils of the fall shall be corrected , when the reign of peace and righteousness shall be fully established upon earth , when holiness to the Lord shall be written upon all things here below , and man shall be in league with the stones of the field , and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with him . While , therefore , no half century , or century , since the world began may compete with that which witnessed the advent of Christ , as being marked by the greatest single event in history , it is equally true-we may say with confidence , and expect the testimony of a long future to sanction the declaration-that no half century has beheld the occurrence of so many events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been completed . Whether we look at the arts of physical life , the arts which contribute to our bodily and social comfort , or , rising to a // higher level , examine the advancement made in the domain of taste and intellectual cultivation , or , taking a still more elevated point of view , contemplate the history of religion and notice what has been accomplished for the personal salvation of man , in either case we shall discover enough to satisfy us that the world has never before , in an equal period of time , had so many forces of power infused into its bosom , and made operative upon its character and destiny . Whether the half century now opened upon us will be equally fruitful in great events , it is not for us to say . We have no right to predict a i will not . And yet it is quite possible that the period which we are now reviewing , has set in operation as many forces as are needed for a long period to come , and that half a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing them and furnishing scope for their full development . " The past at least is secure ; " and that teaches us that the world is rising out of the pit into which it was cast by the apostasy , and is constantly , by a slower or swifter progress , coming to its reinstated condition of perfection . The present is a position in advance of all that has gone before it . And while it is fitted to make us truly thankful for the past , the results of the deeds and labors of which we are enjoying , it bids us look forward to the future with cheerful hope and in the confident expectation that the time to come will be even better than the time that now is . Th casting the eye over the last fifty years , one can not but be struck with the frequency and importance of mechanical inventions and scientific discoveries . The nineteenth century thus far might well be characterized as the Age of Inventions , were it not made equally if not more noteworthy in other respects . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down of the cotton-plant , though actually made in the latter part of the last century , may be said to date its realization and practical efficacy from the beginning of the present . The inventions of llargreaves , Arkwright and Watt stood waiting for this in order that their value might be made to appear . Speaking of these four inventors together , a statistical writer has well said " there is hardly an individual in any country , how remote or barbarous soever , who is not indebted to them for an increase of comfort and enjoyment . " How much the invention of a cheap method of cleansing cotton and fitting it for the loom has contributed to the prosperity and physical comfort of mankind , and so , indirectly , to their intellectual and moral advancement , it is not in the power of any to determine . Enough to know that it has stamped its impress most visibly and deeply upon the history of the world during the half century now before us for consideration . It // is calculated to have been worth already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the annual export of cotton from the United States , has now reached in value 70,000,000 of dollars . The last half century is also specially marked as the era of the application of steam to the mechanic arts and for purposes of locomotion . Watt had indeed , in the last century , so improved the steam engine as to make it of great practical value . But the perfection and triumphs of this mighty agent of comfort and civilization were reserved to be developed in the century within which we live . Had it not been for the improvements and new applications of the steam engine which have been made within the last fifty years , it would have been far from the invention which we see and feel it to be . It has now become man 's commonest helper . It has been harnessed to the wheels of transit , and mankind now pass with breathless speed across wide continents with as brief preparation and with as little fear as in the last century , they started on the journey of a few miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds dismissed for their fickleness and defied in their wrath , the merchant and the traveler cross oceans and circumnavigate the globe itself as readily as , in the days of our fathers , they passed from the seat of government to our country 's metropolis of trade . It is in the workshop and the factory , and fabricates the thousand instruments of human comfort and convenience with a precision and perfection before unattainable . The farmer has called in its aid to do for him what it can do better than horses and cattle can . Yoked to the press , it sends forth its printed sheets like the falling leaves of autumn , and makes the Bible the possession of the poor as well as the rich , while it scatters the religious tract and the newspaper at every door and along the highways of trade and the channels of commerce , free and cheap as the water and the air . Volumes would be necessary to set forth adequately the effects which the last half century has experienced as the result of the various applications now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost created the world anew . It has opened all parts of the globe to the visitation and exploration of mankind , and so virtually compressed the globe to less than half the size it had within the memory of many now living . The time is close at hand when our commercial center will be within sixty days of every important point on the face of the globe . But even the last twelve years have been marked by yet another application of science to the conveniences of practical life , the benefits of which we have but just begun to realize . Along our highways and parallel with the iron tracks of our railways are // stretched the slender wires which have , as it were , endowed the insensible rocky earth with nerves of sensation and voluntary motion . Whole continents quiver with simultaneous impulse and emotion . The fugitive from justice though he takes the winged fiery horse finds the lightning swifter than that , and as he alights from the car in the fancied security of escape is to&amp;iched on the shoulder and made a prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to inform a father at the distance of a thousand miles , of the alarming illness of a child , and the answer comes back before the sun goes down that the parent has received the unwelcome intelligence and is speeding homeward as fast as steam can bear him . The packet comes flying over the ocean to tell us all that had happened and was happening ten days before in a large portion of Europe , and while the busy fingers are hastening to put it in type the telegraph has announced it at the Gulf of Mexico and brings back its effect upon the stock exchange and cotton market at New Orleans in season to be embraced in the newspaper as a postscript to the foreign news by the last steamer . Indeed this is a different state of things from that which existed at the close of the preceding half century ! Then the comforts of domestic life required that the spinning wheel should be heard in every dwelling and cottage upon the hillsides and in the valleys , and every housewife was good ' in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabrics which clothed her household . Then the fanner and the tradesman jogged on to meeting or to market as their horse-of-all-work chose to take them , and in their eyes a turnpike was the very perfection of road and the last and complete triumph of human art in that department . Then the passage from Albany to New York was quick if made in three days whether by water or by land ; and he was specially fortunate who could send a letter from the latter place to Boston and receive an answer after the lapse of only a month , while a voyage to Europe , if it did not quite require a life-time for its accomplishment , was yet enough almost to make the after life-time famous . But these more conspicuous changes do not comprehend by any means all that have taken place within the lapse of the last fifty years . Within that period the arts of stereotyping and lithography have arisen . Within that period Yolta has given us the galvanic pile , leading in its train the various forms of electro-galvanic and electro-magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets of nature . During this period Sir Humphrey IDavy has brought the safety lamp as a gift from Science to those whose calling is to explore the bowels of the earth for mineral treasures , and by which they are enabled to // pursue their labors with impunity in the midst of an atmosphere as explosive as gunpowder . Within the same period Daguerre has made the sun tributary to human art and human happiness , by causing it to preserve to us the lineaments of those we love and the beauties of natural scenery drawn by an unerring pencil . Another has given us the magnetic clock , with its present advantages to science and its future contributions to the common welfare . Another still has demonstrated the practicability of locomotion by means of electro-magnetism . In the same time we have applied the illuminating power of gas to impart additional comfort to our dwellings and offices , and by shedding its light in our streets , to make the night less than formerly a cover for deeds of darkness and crime . The sciences have all been enriched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period in question as never before . The instruments of astronomical observation have been greatly advanced toward perfection , and no fewer than fourteen planetary bodies have been added to the before known heavens . Chemistry is almost a science of the nineteenth century , and its contributions to physiology , agriculture and the various arts of life would be enough to distinguish this era from all that have gone before it . The oxyhydrogen blowpipe , the defiagrator , and the galvanic battery in its different forms , together with the varied apparatus which now adorns the laboratory of the chemist , have revealed to us the ultimate constitution of the physical world and laid open to view the profoundest secrets of nature , and thus contributed directly and incalculably to the comfort and economy of practical life . The stores , the workshops , the farms , the dwellings , the ships , and the offices of those who practice the healing art , all , all bear testimony to the contributions which chemical science has made in the last half century , to the physical well-being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural philosophy by the students of the schools and the students of the workshop , by the professional and not unfrequently by the nonprofessional observer of the laws under which the Great Creator has framed the world , have also laid the entire family of man under lasting obligation to them , and will bestow their benefits upon centuries yet to come . Such are some of the discoveries and inventions and some of the applications of scientific knowledge to purposes of practical life which characterize the first half of the nineteenth century . The winds and the waves have , in a sense , been made to obey us . The great powers of nature , which the world of mankind so long feared as demons threatening their torment or destruction , but which were really God 's gifts reserved for the blessing of a // riper age , have in a marvelous measure , within the period under review , been made tributary to the comfort and advancement of ' man . The moral advantages resulting from these applications of the powers of nature to the various purposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of things , nor so directly tangible as their physical and pecuniary results , are yet too plain to be overlooked , and too important not to demand a grateful recognition by a Christian people . As the physical ever precedes the moral , and acts as the handmaid of that which is highest and best in human history , so it will be seen , if it is not already , that these great and manifold discoveries and inventions of the last fifty years , if they have not led along with them discoveries and advancements in the mental and moral domains have prepared the way for their advent on a magnificent scale in years and even centuries to come . But turning now from these distinctively physical discoveries and improvements , we shall find in other spheres of inquiry a progress not less remarkable . The last halfcentury has been distinguished , as none before it ever was , by great mental activity pervading entire masses of men and even the whole civilized world . That a quickened activity has sprung up in the mental action of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of those great discoveries in physical science which have just been noticed . Individuals , whose minds were awake and busy with inquiry and investigation , there have always been . No age of the world has been entirely barren of discovery or destitute of advancement . But never , as since the opening of the present century , have the masses of mankind been seen arousing themselves to a quickened activity of thought and emotion . Kings , statesmen , charlatans and philosophers have hitherto been alone , and separated by a wide interval from their subjects , their dupes , or their disciples . But , beginning with the discovery of this continent and the revival of letters , a power has been working like leaven in the great mass of humanity . Humble men , soldiers in the ranks , peasants on the hillsides , serfs of lordly barons , begun at length to think for themselves , to consider their souls , if not their bodies , their own . Be ginning to think , they came naturally and necessarily to see a worth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously been acknowledged by the customs and laws of society . Our fathers , the puritans and the pilgrims , made at length a very important stand for individual rights , and while opening this land as the abode of freedom , achieved also , in no inconsiderable measure , the liberty of the mother country , by the revolution which took place there a few years only after the pilgrims left vox*. ix . 29 // Holland for this hemisphere . The contagion spread . The great right of individual thought and private judgment , and the right of habeas corpus or personal liberty , began to be more generally claimed and throughout a wider extent of territory . The duty of toleration was maintained more and more generally , and the natural equality of men , first practically admitted in the constitutions of our American States , was more and more widely asserted in ot ) *er lands . At length the French revolution , at the close of the last century , gave manifest token of the secret power that was working in the depths of society and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave new courage to the humble and the unarmed ; gave new courage to the masses . The opinions hitherto held in silence by individual minds , were now more freely thrown out to the public . The principle of legitimacy , whether in church or state , was more openly questioued . The divine right of kings , as hitherto asserted , was denied more pointedly and strenuously than ever . And so this freedom of thought , this freedom of the individual mind , has gone on to exercise itself with special bolduess throughout the first fifty years of the present century , and the result of it has been the abolition of many abuses and oppressions hoary with age , the introduction of new principles of liberty into many existing constitutions both of church and state , the severing of long clanking fetters of servitude and cruelty , the overturning of thrones , the deposition of kings , and the establishment of free charters and constitutions . The record of the declarations of independence , the overthrow of monarchies , the adoption of new and freer constitutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken place during the present century , is one to astonish any reader of it . In Europe alone , where at the beginning of the century there were but eleven constitutional governments , there are now no less than forty-seven . From the lonian Islands to the States of Central and South America , and even to the islands of the Pacific , the tide of free thought and civil equality and freedom has rolled its course till it has nearly belted the globe . It is true indeed that we have been made occasionally to witness a retrograde movement , and the course of free thought and free principles has seemed at times to meet with a check . But this is the way of almost all improvements . They come like the rising tides , in alternate waves of advance and recession . The enthusiastic desires and purposes of individuals or of collective masses carry them at times somewhat too far , or cause them to act before all is ripe for action . Nevertheless all that was gained is not lost again in these relapses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of things may sometimes be restored , the inward spirit remains changed . Though a king comes back to sit on a throne reared upon the wreck of a republic , it is yet a different throne from the one which stood there before that republic was called into being . The attentive and close observer will see that , amid all the apparent alternations of victory and defeat , the masses have been continually enlarging the area of their freedom . The human mind has become more and more free , and conscious of its worth and capacities , with every rolling year . The officia1* of power may watch it , a political censorship may threaten it , ecclesiastical authority may endeavor to awe it into silence and to frighten it with priestly threats , but having once tasted freedom , the mind will evermore hunger and thirst for it ; having once tried its new fledged powers , it can never again be induced to fold its wings except as it is wearied in the long flight of free discovery , and pauses to regain its strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidences of advancing freedom in the different portions of the earth . The story of the various revolutions of the fifty years just passed is a familiar one . We have witnessed the different people of the continent of Europe achieving one degree of political freedom after another . Indeed nothing has more decidedly marked the first half of this century than the widely extended ackiiowledgment of the equality of men in point of rights , and the essential worth of man as man . As both the fruits and evidences of this , the history of England records the passage of the bill for the abolition of the slave trade the act of Catholic emancipation , the reform bill , the emancipation of the slaves in her West India possessions , the abolition of the corn laws , and the repeal of the navigation act . In our own country too , free as we have been called and as we have claimed to be from the first , progress has yet been made on the side of liberty . The present century has abounded in discussions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political rights of man , The minds of men , here as well as elsewhere , have been led to contemplate , as never before , the inherent dignity and worth of man as an individual , and as a spiritual being . The pulpit has held him up in the light of the gospel and in the light ot immortality , and exhibiting what man is made for and what a future opens before him , has caused his present worth to assume an importance which has never before been accorded to it . Everything that contributes to human comfort , everything that tends to educate the human faculties and develop their proper power , has consequently assumed a new importance in the general estimate of men . // The old distinction of color too has lost in no inconsiderable degree its former power to shut out a large portion of the race from the sympathy and from the rights to which they were entitled by their creation . Humanity is no longer , in the degree it once was , supposed to be dependent upon a white skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in common with Great Britain and other countries , we have abolished the slave trade and declared it to be piracy . And we are fast getting to think that , if the selling men from abroad into slavery is piracy , the 1ioldin* ' them in slavery can be but little , if at all , better . Our fathers , in forming our federal constitution , saw and felt the incongruity between the unqualified assertions of freedom and equality in our declaration of independence , and the existence of chattel slavery within our territorial limits . Accordingly , they refused it so much as mention by name in the constitution , treating it as an intrusion or an accident in the body politic , and in itself an evil and a wrong not to be countenanced by the laws or the spirit of a free people . The mass of the delegates , including many who came from the midst of slaver , y , were unsparing in their denunciations of human bondage , as a thing disgraceful to man and offensive to God . Mason of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England in his expressions against it . A large number of the convention were disposed to abolish it at once , if in no other way , by refusing to recognize it as an object of public sanction or protection ; and they only yielded to what seemed to them . a present necessity , when they agreed to guarantee to the slaveholder the right to retake a fugitive from bondage , while , in the same breath , to indicate their sober judgment on the subject , they agreed that the slave trade should cease in twenty years from that time , supposing of course , and expecting it to be understood , that the abolition of the slave trade would deal the deathblow to slavery . The difficulties which then beset the matter were these . In the first place , a constitution was , it possible , to be formed , which should be acceptable to thirteen different sovereignties , all having their peculiar and , in some cases , antagonistic interests .. Of course this disposed that patriotic body in convention assembled , to the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , secondly , there were few probably , if any , in the convention , who were quite satisfied that a black person could have the full complement of human faculties as well as the white . That is a conviction which belongs to the present century , and one that is and ever will be an honor to it . We ought not , indeed , to expect to find it in manifest existence sixty years ago . All honor to our fathers of that age , that they had , at least , // a true theory of freedom , even if they did not fully discern or recognize all its applications . Be it ours , with the education which they have given us , and another half century of experience , to be as true to principle and freedom as they were . The world is progressive , and we ought to be in advance of the eighteenth century in the application , if not in the discovery , of truths and principles . But there was still a third occasion of difficulty in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America , the English people were divided into two great parties . On the one side were the puritans ; on the other the king , the nobles , the hierarchy and those who sympathized with them . The one party were the champions of freedom and equality of rights ; the other stood for privilege and monopoly , and civil and ecclesiastical orders . From the puritan side went out those who settled New England . From the party of the court and the established church went out those who colonized the more Southern States . And now , though their common wants in a new country , where they were surrounded by hostile tribes of savages , mitigated of necessity the spirit of hostility that embroiled the parties at home , yet they could not forget on which side of the dividing line of principles and feelings they were properly ranged . As late as the formation of the federal constitution , the men of the South boasted their descent from the cavaliers of the time of Charles the First . They possessed , too , some taint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the church of James and of Charles . Their ideas of life and society were those of ( different ranks and orders in church and state , of privilege on the one side and disability on the other , of nobility on the one hand , and of serfdom , qualified at least , on the other . To them , therefore , the servitude of the African had not the repulsive features and character that it had in the eyes of the sons of the puritans . They had little scruple in asserting their right to hold , as chattels , a body of black servitors and retainers . They asserted it with the same innocent ignoring of the moral principle involved , which not a few of the feudal lord8 of South Carolina and Mississippi are tainted with to this day . No wonder then that the point was yielded for the time , and twenty years allowed slavery to begin to die . The point was yielded for the sake of peace . The point was yielded as a temporary concession , but in the confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the part also of a large portion of the South , that human bondage in this country was soon to become extinct , and we have no warrant for saying or believing that but for such an expectation the point would have been // yielded as it was . That expectation has been disappointed . The invention of the cotton-gin and the spinning-jenny have hitherto given the grand staple of the Sonth such a value , that pecuniary interest has been added to natural feeling as an incentive to the continuance of slavery . But the half century just closed has , after all carried out the principles of human liberty in a fuller , juster application than was before known or deemed obligatory . The right of property in man has been called in question , sifted , and extensively pronounced no right , but a robbery and an usurpation wherever found . The free spirit and principles of the pilgrims  --  the God-fearing conscience of the pilgrims , yet live in their sons . The cries of millions of souls , for whom Christ died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the world , have broken upon the ears of Christians throughout the land , and touched the Christian conscience and the Christian heart , and the conviction has become established that this foul oppression must cease . The first half of the nineteenth century has not indeed seen its power relaxed or its limits visibly curtailed , and the last half of the nineteenth century possibly may not see this land perfectly free-free to the black as to the white . But as the principles embodied in our constitution . ariA on which it rests are true , as the principles of our pilgrim fathers are true , yea , as the word of God is true , and he has purposed to redeem this world , so we may not doubt that this outrage upon humanity , this mockery of God , will come to an end . And so everywhere , the rights of man as man , the rights of freedom and equal laws and just government , are asserted and maintained as never before . China is restive under her celestial scheme of civil polity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her in subjection . Turkey is not quiet under the rule of the Sublime Porte . Hungary , we know her story . Austria , Prussia , Denmark , Italy , France ,  - -  where is there a spot in Europe that is not ready even now to be rent asunder by some outburst of the pent-up forces of freedom ? Yes . Man is no longer to be the bauble or the serf as he has been , of his brother man , whom intrigue or prescription may have seated in the throne of power . Man is to be free . Men are to be equal in the enjoyment and security of their equal rights . The law of the strongest is to give place to the law of truth and justice , the law of nature and of God . Closely allied to the advancement of civil freedom and the development of the new ideas and principles which have already been noticed as marking the last fifty years , *mre those various reformatory movements which have been so abundant . Those voluntary associations for the melioration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their birth in the present century . The various peace societies , for the mitigation and abolition of war ; the prison discipline societies for the reclamation of criminals ; the temperance societies , and the various other reform associations of this and other lands , most of them have sprung up within the memory of many of us . And what a glory has been shed upon the age in which we live by our hospitals and asylums , our various beneficent associations and institutions , and the noble company of the so-called charities , which have sprung up so thickly in this and other lands during the period under review ! The lunatic sits again clothed and in his right mind , the deaf hear , the blind see , and the maimed and diseased are made whole again . The different educational movements of tfre period now before us , are eminently worthy also of being named in this connection . Those who judge the rest of the world by the condition of our own country in re8pect to education , know little of the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have always been , from the time when Moses furnished himself with the wisdom of the Egyptians , and the scholars of Greece resorted to Alexandria , until now . But education , as we understand it , the education of the masses in distinction from the privileged few , this is a thing almost exclusively of the present century . And while it is interesting and important to note the increase in number and the improved endowment of colleges and the higher seminaries of learning which have taken place during the last fifty years , it is in its relation to the masses of the people that the subject of education preeminently demands attention , and becomes a distinguishing feature of the age . We need not speak of our own country , where the education of the people , the whole people , is universally regarded as a first duty of the State . But if we look across the ocean , it is only a recent thing that any attempt to found a system of schools for all classes has been made in Great Britain , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the attention of the public is so awakened upon the subject , that even the thieves and vagabonds of London are gathered into their ragged schools . Ireland is just laying the foundation of a school system , despite the natural opposition of the IRomish church . And if we pass over to the continent , we find in Prussia a system of schools , as rigorous in its embrace of the whole people as the system of taxation itself . Forty years have so far perfected what is called the Prussian system of education that we have deemed it worth our while to import some of its excellences into this land of common schools . France has had a system of schools supported by law for nearly twenty // years , for which she is much indebted to her former minister of public instruction , liVE . Guizot . Belgium , Holland , and Denmark likewise possess a public school system . Sweden has none as yet , though she is awake to the importance of public education , and we have made her queen of song a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last eight months , for the avowed purpose of establishing a school system in the Scandinavian kingdom of Korthern Europe . Half a million of scholars of all grades are said to belong to the public schools of Russia . Spain and Portugal are yet in the slumber of priestly indolence and ignorance . Italy , however , is awake in part to the importance of popular education , and even Turkey is talking about it , while Greece , since the achievement of her independence , is attaining a stand on this subject worthy of her name . For the rest , the history of popular education in Asia , Africa , and Southern America , we must leave for the retrospect of the last half of the nineteenth century . But no one will gain a just idea of the educational movement which has been and is now going on here and in Europe who does not take into consideration the press and the post-office . The one , no longer pulled slowly by hand , but driven by the agency of steam , and shooting off from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking them up , and on its cars and swift-cleaving boats , hurrying them to every man 's fireside , he who runs may read , and the most scantily furnished cabin of our western frontier , or the humblest cot in England 's glens , needs not lack the furnishing of the mightiest minds of present or of ancient time . And when our postage system gets perfected , by sea and land , so that a penny will enable any one to speak to any other , however distant , on the face of the globe , then there will be at work an educational power which no force or schemes of despotic authority or hierarchical opposition will be able to withstand . We have left ourselves no room to speak as we designed to do of what is most important of all , the peculiarly and more manifestly religious history of the past half-century . We can only say , in a word , that it is but since the beginning of the present century that the church has seemed to have it as a settled conviction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Lord Jesus Christ , and that the church has had it for her direct and practical work to bring the whole world to a knowledge of Christ as a Redeemer from sin . Accordingly this has been , in a special sense , the missionary age of the world . It is but about fifty years , within the memory of many of us , that the first movement of much importance was made in this direction . It is but forty years , and hardly that , since the first com // pany from New England went forth to preach the Gospel to the heathen . And now let the Sandwich Islands , become already an important member of the family of states and kingdoms , and even while we write presenting themselves and asking admission into our confederacy of states , and let the various civilized and christianized places of heathendom , tell what has been accomplished now that the church has become somewhat in earnest for the salvation of the ignorant and barbarons millions of the earth 's inhabitants . " Lo , what hath God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obvious religious aspect of the world now with what it was when the century began . Heathen lands are everywhere open to the preacher of the gospel , and Christendom already includes more than a third of the entire population of the globe . In Christian lands a better tone of piety prevails . Sects have learned to be more tolerant of each other 's peculiarities of doctrine and order . Evangelical and Christian alliances have been formed . Even now the Pope suffers a protestant chapel to open its doors under the shadow of St. Peter 's , and the head of the Protestant Anglican church in turn allows Cardinal Wiseman to occupy the precincts of Westminster Abbey in the name of the Pope . The principle of toleration is in the ascendant as never before-the principle , which demands that all shall be equally free to believe and to preach the word of God , trusting that where there is most of truth there will be most of success . The Queen of Englaud in her replies to the many loyal addresses recently sent her by reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats of legal expulsion , but studiously admits the right of all her subjects to worship in undisturbed freedom . This shows , as nothing could better show , the progress of religious freedom , and the confidence which the world has come to place in truth . Nor should we fail to mention here that the last half-century has done more than all previous ones together in furnishing a reliable interpretation of the less obvious and intelligible portions of Scripture , and in settling the true philosophy of religion . Fifty years ago there were but few commentaries on the Bible worth being purchased , even if any were able to purchase them . With some exceptions all professed expositions of Scripture were worthless just where some worth was expected of them . Now the poorest apprentice may read his Bible with all the helps which the lifelong labors of the best scholams in this and other lands can afford . Such then , in brief , is the religious history of the last last halfcentury . Religion has become better in its tone , more in harmony with natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skepticism . Religion has become more extensively recognized // as the one great business of life , or rather as the life itself ; than ever before . It has also girded itself as never before , at least since the age of the Apostles , for the spiritual conquest of the world . It has entered into alliance with all the discoveries of modern science and made them tributary to the accomplishment of its grand work of salvation . But time forbids us to go farther in this review . The history of a half-century ! And such a half-century ! Volumes would be requisite to give a proper account of it . The compass of our pages , therefore , can only serve to call np the merest outline of the great subject . Many matters of importance must even be omitted entirely . And yet may not even such a review as the one through which we have now been taken do something towards impressing us with proper ideas of the field which we have surveyed and prepare ns to reap advantage therefrom for the future ? ilave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-century recently completed , reason for hope and encouragement ? Science , arts , liberty , religion , all have been going forward , and advancing , like the orbs of heaven , in the strictest harmony with each other . There has been no going back ; all has been onward . Every conspicuous event has made some contribution to man 's temporal or eternal happiness . Every invention and discovery has poured new comforts into his lap , or given him a lesson of everlasting wisdom . The gospel has shown its power , as never before , in mitigating the evils of depraved habits in enlightened lands , and in civilizing and christianizing the barbarous tribes of heathendoin . The word of God has met all the objections that could be brought against it , arising out of the discoveries of modern science and the most impartial laws of interpretation , and it has met them triumphantly , and now commands a more unhesitating reception and belief than ever before . The pulpit has , during the last half-century , manifested more power than before and has better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodicals which have sprung up within comparatively a few years , and the tracts and volumes of our benevolent societies , have given divine truth a wider range and a more searching application to the hearts of men than has*ever been the case hitherto . False forms of religion are giving way continually in all portions of the world , and Christianity never had the air and power of a universal conqueror , not even when she took possession of the throne of the Ca*sars , as she has at this opening of the second half of the nineteenth century . Equally encouraging is the state of the world in other respects . The physical comforts of life were never more widely diffused . The civil rights of man were never before so well // secured and so generally acknowledged . The mind of the race was never before so well informed . The means of a true education , in the completest sense , were never so abundant as now . And so , wheresoever we look , we see the amplest evidence that , during the last fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and advancing more rapidly than at any former period . Let us then derive hope and encouragement from the past . As Christians let us hope with new confidence in the final and complete triumph of the cross . As men let us believe that , under the guidance of divine providence , and in the light afforded by the gospel , the sorrows and degradations of sinful humanity are to be cured , and the whole family of man are to bear again the undefaced image of God .
