THE DEBATE IN THE U. S. SENATE ON TONNAGE DUTIES , AUGUST 23n , 1852 . THE amendment of Mr. Douglas , brought in at the close of the grand annual conflict over the River and Harbor Bill , elicited from Mr. Smith , of Connecticut , a speech so felicitous in manner , and so forcible in illustration and argument , we have been led , by our admiration and satisfaction with the effort , to make it the subject of a general article . Some portion of the details , too bulky and statistical for the pages of a popular journal , we have found it necessary to omit . These details embody the provisions of various bills brought before the Senate in former years , showing that the West and Southwest have been invariably favored above all other parts of the Union , in the appropriations for the improvement of navigation . For example , in the bill under discussion , $1.55*7,090 was advised by the House of Representatives , of which only $17,000 was for New-England , and for all the rivers and harbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , by amendment , $530,000 , of which the Westera and Southern harbors were to get $346,500 . Such has been also in former times the general system of distribution : New-England and the Middle States , the principal movers and supporters of the bill , receiving a very small portion of the appropriations . Inequality of distribution was not , therefore , the cause of Western and Southern opposition ; though , in the face of facts and figures , we are annually annoyed with ignorant or malicious assertions to the contrary . With these remarks we pass over the latter half of Mr. Smith 's speech , which is a statistical demonstration of the truth , without further remark or examination . The debate came unexpectedly upon the Senate . The amendment , intended apparently to destroy the bill , was a general proposal to give up the whole matter to the States ; the General Government to furnish occasional aid , as long as it might be wanted . The contest over the River and Harbor Bill has illustrated for many years the causes of party strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fhctions . The proposition of Mr. Douglas , to commit the entire care of River and Harbor Improvements to the State Legislatures , by an amendment to a bill providing for their improvement by national appropriations , was supported by a strong body of Democratic Senators . The nominee of the Democratic Convention for the Vice-Presidency , SENATOR KING , was one of those who supported the measure . His vote is recorded in its favor . Testy Senator Mason also sustained it . This discontented gentleman , who seems to be angry and suspicious upon all legislative occasions , as if it were a point with him to demonstrate at every turn the redness of his blood , and the pellucid whiteness and innocence of his understanding , made himself quite positive in support of it . Mr. M. wished to " test " the thing , he said , and when Mr. Douglas , acting upon the wise caution of Mr. Cass , who saw through the absur4ity of the scheme , withdrew it for reconsideration , Mr. Mason was grieved , and praised Mr. Atchison for renewing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken . Senators Atchison , Borland , Broadhead , Brooke , Butler , Charlton , Dawson , De Saussure , Dodge , of Iowa , ( I ) Douglas , Hale , ( ! ) Hunter , Jones , of Iowa , ( ! ) KING , Mallory , Mason and Soul6 , voted in its favor . Senators Cass and Hamlin were opposed to it . Mr. Cass , especially , made it appear ridiculous . Here then is a new issue . If Pierce and King are elected , th' next Democratic Administration will veto River and Harbor bills , and advise Congress to give a general permi*sion to the States to shift for themselves , and look after their own navigation . We shall presently show that they can not do this without violating the Constitution , the Territorial Ordinances , and the compact made severally with all the Western States , on their admission to the Union . It is a sad prospect for the West and South . Intelligent readers have already pene // trated the heart of this project , and understand its motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed upon the Western and Southern States . Congress is to give the States a general permission to levy tonnage duties . Tonnage is an indirect taxation of commerce , in which the quantity and not the quality of goods is taxed . A load of Western produce , corn , flour , pork , lard , lumber , &amp;e. &amp;c. , filling the capacity of the vessel in which it is carried , is taxed by the weight of goods , and not by the value , the tax being upon the tonnage , which may be , as on canals , a tax upon the weight of goods carried , or on the capacity of the vessel , the empty vessel paying as much as the full . By the wording of the amendment , no restriction is placed upon the States . If a canal is made , or the channel of a river enlarged , the charges may be laid either upon the vessel , or the cargo , under the name of " tonnao-e . " Let us observe the operation of the system , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw produce passing from Michigan to New-York , would probably have four or five tonnages to pay , of ten cents each , at the various points where improvements were going on . Arriving *t New-York , this ton of produce will have cost 40 or 50 cents more in consequence of the tonnages ; in anticipation of which , the merchant will have deducted that amount from the price paid per bushel or per hundred weight , to the farmer who raised it . The producer would lose about one fiftieth of a cent on every pound of produce , of every description . The price , of produce is regulated by he English market , a consequence of our present Anti-American system . The merchant can not add this fiftieth to the price at New-York , or New-Orleans , and he must consequently deduct it from the farmer 's profit . The farmer consequently pays all the tonnages , and bears the entire cost of internal improvement . And now , following the argument of Senator Smith , let us answer the question , " Who pay the tonna*es @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same persons who paid those on exports . Foreign manufactured goods , carried to the West in exchange for produce , are five , ten , and even a hundred times more valuable , bulk for bulk , than raw produce . Tonnages , compared with values , will consequently be light upon these ; and if the foreign manufacturer , or the importing merchant , was obliged to pay them , the tax would be small , compared with that paid by the farmer on his bulky produce . The farmer knows that he must pay all the cost of getting his goods to market ; that is to say , they must all be deducted from the price at New-York or NewOrleans , the small remainder being his . Very naturally , he expects to have some portion of this loss fall upon imported goods : but no , he must pay also the tonnage upon the goods he buys , as well as upon those he sells ; for to reach him by the way either of the river or of the lakes , they must run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Internal Improvements , to be paid for by the farmers . Another view of the case presents itself . Mr. Douglas declares that the Internal Improvements of the West require an annual expenditure of " five millions ' * by the General Government . Mr. Douglas thinks very little of expending sixty or eighty millions upon a war of annexation , and has openly announced himself in favor of the purchase of Cuba " at any price . " Cuba would not cost less than 50,000,000 . If gained by a Spanish war , three times that sum , for Mr. Douglas is also in favor of enlarging our steam navy , to be on a par with England ; and yet he shudders at the thought of an annual expenditure of five millions upon improvements , which , he says , ought nevertheless to be made . Now , if even 20,000,000 tons of produce were annually sent by the Lakes and the Mississippi , at ten cents tonnage , it would only yield $2,000,000 for the construction of rivers and harbors . This would be all that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tonnage . Double the tonnages , and you have $. * , 000,000 for rivers and harbors , expansively collected *nd distributed over a hundred different enterprises , of which only a few would be of positive utility . The first result of this system would be a suspension of all appropriations by the General Government . This would be followed by the imposition of tonnages at so many points as to create general dissatisfactioa throughout the West . Improvements woul4 go on more slowly than ever , or be entirely suspended Congress would be petitioned // for heavier internal taxes on navigation . Now would start up over all the West companies borrowing funds to invest in schemes of internal improvement , guaranteed by the State , the tonnage duties pledged for the interest on loans . Congress would be besieged , session after session , for higher and higher tariffs on the lakes and rivers . Can any thing be imagined more lamentable and ruinous than such a state of things ? And yet this is what we are to have if Messrs . Pierce and King are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , to illustrate the whole . At the mouth of a small river emptying into the Mississippi , ( there are hundreds on that river and on the lakes , ) a company of enterprising speculators have resolved to have a commerce with the interior . They apply to the Legislature of their State , under the new law , and get permission to levy tonnage duties for the improvement of their river . They open roads , rail-tracks , and river-channels , with funds borrowed on the strength of an embryo commerce , predicting vast results to follow their improvements . Meanwhile , similar enterprises are going on all around them ; and though commerce is increased , in some degree , by the opening of new channels , the proportion which comes their way is too small to pay the mere interest on the loans . The whole speculation , railroad , river-channel , plankroad , bank and all , becomes insolvent , and pays in paper . Now imagiae two or three hundred of these enterprises sustaining each other , and clamoring at Washington for the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be , " Give us more tonnage , 20 , 30 , 40 per cent . We shall fail else . " And fail they would , as a matter of course ; and great would be the crash of their failure ; years upon years of bankruptcy and distress for the West . It is enough for our purpose to know , however , that this amendment was intended as a final and fatal blow to the system of appropriation by the General Government . " The mode in which these tonnage duties are to be laid and collected , and the money expended , and the plan of improvement to be adopted , will of course be left to the several State Legislatures . I may be permitted to suggest , however , that so far as the question relates to the improvement of harbors there can be not the slightest difficulty . The proposition is , that each State may authorize the public authorities of any town or city to levy the duties ahd make their own harbors . This pro . ceeds upon the principle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging what improvements are necessary in their harbors , and what amount of money is necessary to be expended for such improvements , and what plan is best adapted to accomplish them , than the Bureau of Topographical Engineers at this place , who have no local knowledge upon the subject , can possibly be . " Mr. Douglas either does not understand the duties of the Topographical Engineers , or , in the spirit of a demagogue , he misrepresents them . The duty of a national engineer is not to say where an improvement shall be made , but when its necessity has been pointed out by the local authorities , as by a petition from the merchants and underwriters , to see that it is executed in the best manner . " Sir , I make no assaults upon the Topographical Corps . I simply say , that there is one thing which science , taught at West Point or elsewhere , has not demonstrated  --  and that is , what effect will be produced in navigable water by works intended to control or restrain its channel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a thing , the result of which can not be foreseen , or demonstrated by the application of any scientific principle , because there are so many shifting bars and currents affected by every storm or flood , which can not be subjected by any known rules . These bars and currents are generally formed or diverted by substances beneath the surface , which are invisible to the eye , each dependent upon causes peculiar to itselt The only men who can tell what effect the sinking of a buoy , or the construction of a pier will have upon the channel , is the pilot , captain , or owner of a vessel , who , for twenty years , has been in the daily habit of watching the effect of storms , currents , andtempests upon these shifting bars and varying channels . You must have local knowledge , the result of long-continued observation , in order to make your money , when appropriated , of any considerable value to this great navigating interest . I say that all experience has proven , that that local knowledge does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topographical Corps , It can not be found in any efficient body of men known to the laws of our country . It can only be found in those men whose lives have been devoted to navigation , and whose observations have been daily directed to the subject . " Mr. Douglas affects to depreciate " science . " He prefers a hearty , rough , good-hearted boatman to a scientific engineer . Now , these fine , hearty , and brave men are doubtless the cream of creation , and their experience in running upon snags , sinking cargoes , and steering sharp to avoid a fiat , is not to be questioned on this side of the Alleghanies ; but because a man has had the good fortune to sink a dozen steamboats , it does not follow // 1852. that he is the best man to clear away the this power , they would choose men who felt an insnags . It is with these excellent and * terest in the improvements that were to he made ; and you would have men selected whose hearts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as pecuniary interests , were enlisted in the with Mr. Douglas himself . Admirable in success of the enterprise . You would have careful destructive legislation , excellent in running and well-devised plans ; you would have strict the ship of state among the snags and rocks economy in the expenditure of the money ; and of annexation , it does not follow that he what is more , you would have every steamboat captain , and pilot , and owner , interested in reportthereby earns for himself the fame and skill ing any wasteful extravagance in the expenditure of a progressive and constructive legislator . of the money , or in pointing out any obstruction But let us hear Mr. Douglas again : that might interpose itself to the navigation of the stream . You would have the most strict account " The Mississippi river extends more than two ability and rigid economy in the application of the thousand miles from north to south , with nine money to the objects for which it was colleeted ? ' States hordering on its banks . I presume that qwq improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening new ones , and may collect tolls upon new openings and channels , and for no other purpose ; the tonnage duty not to exceed ten cents on the ton , and the portion diverted by a compact of two or more States foi- improvements of new channels , not to exceed four cents the ton ; the tolls to he reasonable , and no surplus or profit allowed . Congress was also to give permission , by this amendment , that a iiver being entirely or in part within the limits of any one State , all boats and vessels navigating the same within those limits might be compelled to pay a tonnage duty by authority of the Legislature of that State ; the tonnage not to exceed ten cents , and to be wholly applied to the improvement of navigation . The last section of the amendment gives authority to any number of States to combine for the impi-ovement of common waters , the duties of tonnage and their application limited as above . On the 12th January , 1848 , a similar measure was introduced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina ; it was rejected by the House . In Mr. Rhett 's bill it was ordered , that every State should transmit an annual account to the Treasury of the United States , and that nothing should be done by a State or States inconsistent with the rights of foreign nations guaranteed by treaty . At a convention of citizens of the United States , held at Chicago , July 5th , 1847 , the question of tonnage duties was discussed with great clearness and ability , and the articles summed up in a memorial to Congress . This memorial condemns the whole project as inadequate and fallacious , as a plain violation of the Constitution , of the ordinance of 1787 in regard to territories , and of the compacts made with the Western and Northwestern States on their admission to the Union . The memorial shows that all the navigable waters entering the lakes and the MississipI ) i " are for ever exonerated from the imposition of any such burthen , " and that too by solemn compacts , which are the fundamental law of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements can only be accomplished by the authority and at the expense of the General Government , inquires whether it would be just or expedient to favor the navigation of the great interior waters which are now shielded from the power of the States , while the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Muxico are neglected ; exact and equal justice requiring an equal distribution according to the wants of the commerce of every State . After completely demolishing , by unanswerable arguments , the whole project of tonnage duties , the memorial remarks : " For f*ar of overcharging the picture , we will say nothing of the interminable discussions likely to arise respecting the application of the collected duties . If the wit of man were taxed to devise a scheme utterly destiuctive of all commerce , trade and navigation upon these waters , a better one for the puipose than this of artificially obstructing them by hosts of collectors of tonnage duties , imposed by local legislation , could not be framed . " The experience of Germany is shown by the memorial to have proved the injuriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignties . The greatest progress in commercial reform in Germany has been the Zollverein , or commercial union , established for the sake of uniformity in duties on the frontiers ; and the Germans have been striving , for many years , to apply the American principle of confederation to their navigable waters also . " What a singulni- , and may we not say , humiliating spectacle would our Republic present , if we weic now to retrograde to a system of local duties similar to those established in barbarous ages by petty despots , and maintained by feudal violence l " The memorial , after enumerating a vast variety of mischiefs which would arise from the tonnage system , shows also that it would lead to combinations by which certain portions of the Union would tax for t eir own benefit , under pretexL of improvement , the products and industry of their neighbors . So much in preparation . The speech of Mr. Smith is probably the last of any importance that will ever be made in opposition to the system of tonnage duties , for the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any person who attempts to bring forward the measure , after having read that speech , will do it for demagogical purposes alone , in the face of every principle of popular legislation , and of the fundamental laws of the Union . The incasure // will indeed be offered , if Pierce and King are elected , but it will be pushed through by force , without argument mont . Mr. Smith expressed his surprise at the extraordinary atteml ) t of Mr. Douglas to spring this measure of tonnage duties upon Congress during the two or three last days of the session . It was well understood that the amendment would destroy the bill . The Constitution provides , sec. 9th , art . 1st , that " no State shall , without the consent of Congress , lay any duty of tonnage . " Another provision of the Constitution , in the same section , is that " one State shall not enter into any agreement or compact with another State or with a foreign power . " But it may do either of these with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorize a compact between any two States , as , for exampie , between Massachusetts arid Carolina in regard to colored seamen . Congress might authorize an agreement between Pennsylvania and New-Jersey regarding improvements on the Delaware , or the building of bridges . Congress may authorize the State of New-York to levy a hospital tax on seamen and emigrants . This power has been conferred upon Congress in order to meet particular exigencies ; but it is not competent for Congress to assign over in perpetuity any portion of the soverei* , n power of the whole people , as defined by the Constitution , to any portion of the people , or to a State or compact of States . Congress can not abdicate , more than the Executive can abdicate . Any general power of the Central Government resigned by the Congress of a certain year , falls back , by the unalterable power of the Constitution , into the Congress of any succeeding year . There can be no division of the sovereignty : this is the national doctrine as opposed to nullification . The amendment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities of any city or town within its limits to levy duties of tonnage ; and this under a general permission from Congress to all the States . The amendment does not propose , that after a State shall have passed a law in regard to tonnage duties , Congress shall permit that law to take effect , for certain exceptional reasons and for a specified time , but that the Central Government shall resign one of its most important functions , namely , the power over commerce , by the simple act of a majority , and without consultation with the people . Such was the effect of Mr. Douglas 's amendment . Let us now review the arguments of Mr. Smith . The power of collecting the tonnage duties , it was proposed by Mr. Douglas , should be conferred by a State upon the authorities of any city or town which might consider itself interested in the navigation passing through its limits . " Who , " inquires Mr. S. , Kre the authorities of a town l Can any one tell l Perhaps the Senator contemplates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like to have him explain his meaning . We have here a singular state of things- he assent of Congress to the assent of a State to the levy of tonn* go duties by a high constable , or somebody , we know not who , called the authorities of a town . " The amendment does not distinctly provide by what rule the duties sh 11 be levied ; it merely authorizes the selectmen , or whoever the authorities may be , to regulate the commerce of the town , or rather , the commerce passing through the town , for the sake of constructing dams , break-waters , or whatever they may please , under the general name of internal improvements . And this was the kind of legislation that proceeded from that popular and rising politician , the Douglas of Illinois ,  --  a man , as is well known , short in stature , but supposed to be of a broad and solid understanding . The most remarkable incident of the dialogue in the Senate , preceding the delivery of the speech which we are reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the delivery of any speech on the subject , by any Senator , after the lucid developments of Mr. Douglas . Mr. Cass said that the people of America understood the question so well , it was , a mere waste of breath , and of the valnable time of the Senate , for Mr. Smith to speak upon it . Popular Senator from Michigan I Wise Senator from Illinois ! A pair of Presidential candi-dates ! For our own part , we do not believe that all the people of the United States are thoroughly versed in Constitutional questions or in political economy ; and we begin now even to suspect that there are members of Congress , Presidential candidates even , who need to be enlightened . // " Perhaps , " continued Mr. Smith , " the Honorable Senator contemplates a number of local Congi'esses " to fix the rule for tonnage duties . It is a fundamental principle of popular government that all rules in regard to the collection of revenue shall proceed either directly from the people or from their immediate representatives . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would observe that the Senator provides for the execution of these works by a combination of States through the instrumentality of compacts . " " Nothing is said , " he continues , " in the Constitution , about a compact between a number of States , more than two ; such cases are purposely excluded ; for if several combine for one purpose , though it be by the approval of Congress , they will soon unite , for other purposes , without such approval . " In the course of the argument the Senator from Connecticut establishes the principle that the consent of Congress for the " levy of duties by a State must . be subsequent to the act making levy . " " The Constitutioa does not contemplate the granting of a general power of attorney , but a law is to be enacted and laid before Congress . We should then have something tangible , and be able to decide whether it should go into operation . " Mr. Douglas , in supporting his amendment , produced an array of precedents , showing the assent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties by the States ; these , however , as Mr. Smith affirms , were cases of assent to a law passed , and not a general conferring of powers . Mr. Douglas then showed , in turn , that in some instances the assent of Congress had been given in advance ; to which Mr. Smith replied that these were exceptional cases , but that the general course of legislation had been the other way ; that laws of the kind may have slipped through , but that they did not affect the principle . " Let us suppose , " said Mr. Smith , " the States of Kentucky and Indiana were to enter into an arrangement to repair the Cumberland dam , and levy tonnage duties for that purpose . " Here opens a new branch of the argument . " On what commerce would they levy those duties ? Why , Sir , on the commerce of Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Virginia , as well as on that of Kentucky and Indiana . Now should not the citizens of the three States first named have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dam would be of any use , and whether a burthen should be laid on their commerce ? The States may , if invested with a general power , undertake improvements to the last degree improvident ; they may undertake improvements which conflict with each other , or which are incapable of execution , or if executed , worse than nothing . " " There is another provision of the Constitution , " said Mr. Smith , " which should arrest the attention of the Senate , being the sixth clause of the same section , as follows : Nor shall vessels bound to and from one State be obliged to enter , clear , or pay duties in another . ' How can the Senator carry out his scheme without violating this clause ! Suppose a wheat grower of Illinois should load a vessel with produce at Alton , and send it to New-York via the mouth of the Mississippi ; can Louisiana , consistently with this provision , compel him to pay tonnage duties to deepen the channel at the mouth ? " New-Orleans would be a foreign port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the commerce of Alton , and generally , of all the States north of Louisiana . She would tax the commerce of Arkansas , of Missouri , of Iowa , of Wisconsin , of Michigan , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , Virginia , Kentucky , Tennessee , and Mississippi . In the appendix to the printed speech of Mr. Smith , we find the following : " Another great impediment to the progress of the navigation and commerce of Europe , in fact , of the whole world , is the Sound dues of Denmark , obliging every vessel to pay a heavy duty which passes the Sound from either the Baltic or the North seas . Against this unjust Sound due , against this impediment of navigation upon the great highway of the world , our merchants and shipowners protested , and made funny a just complaint . And whilst our government is endeavoring to remove these obstacles , some of our own legislators of this great and free country wish to establish tolls upon our extensive internal lines of navigation , and try to inflict upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe for centuries , and kept the people in serfdom . " The above was written by a German . We were present on a certain occasion in Tammany Hall , when a speech was delivered explaining the policy of that party of which // Mr. Douglas was to be the candidate . The speaker developed with considerable power the injustice and tyrannical oppression of the King of Denmark inflicting black mail upon the commerce of the Baltic ; and if we remember right , he was ready to compel the discontinuance o* this oppression . He supported the nomination of Mr. Douglas , and put him forward as the advocate of liberal principles , of ideal republicanism . We were pleased with many of the patriotic sentiments attributed to Mr. D. , and the writer of this article regarded him , excepting always his British prejudice in regard to free trade , as one of the staunchest supporters of American republicanism . We even regretted that so promising a politician was not also a Whig . ft was a vain regret . Mr. Douglas is emphatically a Democrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done yet with the argument of Mr. Smith , nor has Mr. Smith done with the Honorable Senator from Illinois . " His scheme is violative of the fourth article of the Ordinance of 1 ' 78 ' 7 , which provides that The navigable waters , leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence , and the carrying places between the same , shall be common highways and for ever free , as well to the inhabitants of said territory as to the citizens of the United States and those of any other States that may be admitted into the confederacy , WITHOUT ANY TAX , IMPOST , OR DUTY THEREFOR . " ' Thus it appears that the amendment sprung upon the Senate by Mr. Douglas not only proposes a resignation of one third the power of the Government over commerce and the violation beside of an express prohibition of the Constitution , but attacks fundamental ordinances of the whole nation , established to maintain the equilibrium of the Union , and more sacred if possible than the Constitution itself . Again and again we can not help admiring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut was wasting his time in speaking upon a subject so well understood by the people of the United States . We have adverted to the compacts entered into between the United States and the several States situated between the Mississippi and the Lakes , on their admission to the Union . Thus , by the act for the admission of Louisiana , quoted by Mr. Smith , it is provided as a condition , that " the river Mississippi and the navigable rivers and waters leading into the same , and into the Gulf of Mexico , shall be common highways , as well to the inhabitants of said State as to the inhabitants of other States , without any tax duty or impost or toll therefor , imposed by the said State . " This agreement was concluded April 8th , 1812 . By the act of March 1st , 1817 , for the admission of Mississippi ; of March 6th , 1820 , for the admission of Missouri ; of June 15th , 1830 , for the admission of Arkansas ; of March 3d , 1845 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the admission of Wisconsin , the same compact was entered into . That with Wisconsin , however , including the great lakes as well as the rivers , and therefore covering all the rights proposed to be violated by the Senator from Illinois ; and in regard to which Mr. Cass informs us that the people of the United States are so well informed that it is not proper to talk to them upon the subject . Much less proper was it then to bring forward a proposition like that of the Honorable Senator from Illinois . It would seem , however , that the peopk are much better informed upon the subject than the Senator . This gentleman has lately acquired the title of the Little Giant . We confess that at one time the strong movement in his favor among a number of active and intelligent men in the Democratic party , impressed us strongly with an idea of his importance ; but this specimen of statesman ' . ship which would have passed quietly over , and been forgotten in the confusion of the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr. Douglas , so thoroughly exposed and ridiculed by the Senator from Connecticut , has powerfully contracted our imaginations of the Little Giant , and forced us to class him amongst the decidedly young Americans . After having cut up*the scheme of Mr. Douglas , Mr. Smith , somewhat unnecessarily , we think , is at some pains to set forth its impracticability . He inquires how these tonnage duties are to be collected . He wishes to know whether every State is to have a posse of Custom House officers , who are to throng all the avenues of commerce ; whether every steamboat is to be boarded on all the waters of the United States , at every boundary and port , by State officials , demanding toll . He wishes to know if forts will have to be erected to compel steamboats // to come to and pay toll . The steamboats would run by in spite of all opposition . An immense fleet of steam revenue cutters would be required to put these odious laws in execution , of which the expenses , to say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sedition law , would consume , five-fold , all the money that could be collected by any system of tonage duties . To the attack of Mr. Douglas on the United States corps of Topographical Engineers , in which he intimates their incapacity for these numerous works of improvement , Mr. Smith very properly replies by the rejoinder : " If they are not able to complete these works , who will undertake them with ability Are the woodmen and log-choppers of the West , the prairie men of Illinois , and the bar-room politicians of the Western cities , as they would be the collectors , be also the employers and engineers of this new system of internal improvements l Why , under such a system there would be a dam on every river , toll-gates at the mouth of every harbor ; cutters on creeks , and tonnage excise-men , with rifles and bowie-knives , lining the shores of all the intenor waters of the Union . " Is it possible that any man , born on American soil , with two great organs of causality projecting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish and abominable project ? Mr. Smith remarks that he takes it for granted that the prairie Senator contemplates " something practical , and that he has something more in view than to display himself and his subject before the country . " Now it was a mere act of politeness in Mr. Smith to say that he takes any such thing for granted . The solid and substantial sense of the Senator from Connecticut is not of the kind to take any thing fur granted . He has applied the dissecting knife to the scheme of our prairie legislator , and could doubtless have applied it with equal talent to his motives if be had chosen to do so . Senator Douglas undoubtedly wished to display himself and his scheme before the country ; there is nothin xxio* in that . It is necessary to display e *cheme if we wish the people to adopt it dii necessary to display ourselves if we wish to have the benefit of our own talents . The peoj le are well and justly pleased with a man who displays himself and his scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a display of himself ; or rather of that powerful intelligence , the groundwork of American prosperity , with which he is so lar0ely endowed . He has come down upon the scheme of Mr. Douglas with the weight of a mill-stone , and ground it in pieces ; and had therefore no occasion to penetrate the political motives of his antagonist . Mr. Smith says , " I do not understand that the Senator proposes to oust the United States of all jurisdiction . I understand from the concluding portion of his remarks , that in the plenitude of his condescension he is willing to receive a proper contribution for this great national object from the strong box of Uncle Sam , at least until his scheme could go into operation. ** But the most important question in connection with this subject is , who is to pay these tonnage duties ? Mr. Smith demonstrates that the producer will pay them ; that is to say , these tonnage duties will come out of the pockets of the Western farmers , which is all well enough and right if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We will suppose that a farmen in Northern Illinois raises 500 bushels of wheat , which he sends to the New-York market . On arrival at Chicago , some taxgatherer , or pubhican , as they were called in old time* , makes a grab at it in the nature of tonnage duties , to improve the harbor of that place . At the St. Chair flats , another pubhican makes another grab , to open a channel there . At Buffalo , another grab for the use of the harbor ; and finally at Albany , another grab to subdue the ovenslaugh below that city . How much of the wheat of the poor farmer would remain after running the gauntlet of all these tax-gatherers ? Or if the farmer of Northern or Middle Illinois chooses to ship his wheat to New-York , via New-Orleans , how much will remain after being taxed to - improv6* the harbor of St. Louis , to clear the sna*s and sawyers out of the Mississippi from St. Louis to New Orleans , and even to clear out and deepen one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not which way the freight is going ; if going down to the ultimate market , I can demoustrate that every shilling of the duties upon produce is to come out of the pockets of the farmers ; and I can demonstrate also that every shilling levied upon freights the other way , such as tea , coffee , sugar , woollen arid co*ton goods , will also come out of the pockets of these same farmers . Yes , Sir , // 415 the pre*mptioners and the br-cabin boys are thus to be visited by the hand of oppression and taxation . The Honorable Senator has proposed to go into every log-cabin in the Northwest , with his system of tonnage duties , and levy them on the hard-working and hard-fisted boys of that country . " Mi ' . Smith 's demonstration is a very simple one , as follows : " When the wheat of Illinois , or any other Western State , shall have run the gauntlet of all these tonnage duties , and arrives at New-York or NewOrleans with ten or fiteen per cent . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties , it finds itself in competition with the wheat of other parts of the country which has not been subjected to these exactions , and is nearer the market ; theWestern farmer , therefore , ivill find it impossible to indemnify himself , and after paying the tonnage duties , must continue to sell his wheat at the same price as if they had not been exacted . He , or his agent , it matters not which , if the speculator in corn purchases from the farmer , he will be obliged to deduct the tonnage duties from the price . The European consumer will not pay them ; the exporting merchant will not pay them ; the broker , the jobber , the speculator , the miller , will not pay them ; and therefore the farmer will pay them , or he will not sell his grain . In a word , the effect of these tonnage duties will be a reduction in the selling price of every species of produce in the West to the producer , and an increase in the same region of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of tonnage duties ; that will not be the only charge : important channels of communication will be entirely closed by such a system . " Let us suppose that a farmer in the State of Illinois is able to make a choice between two channels of communication , one to the South , another to the East , he will prefer that upon which the tonnage duties are lightest ; and where there is a choice of way , the improved way will be sometimes closed up by its own mprovements ; whereas if the price of these improvements is paid by the General Government , the improved way will be taken in preference to the other . Mr. Smith remarks that , " From the course of the honorable Senator , Mr. Douglas , taxation and dutypaying is regarded as a sort of luxury in the Northwest ; but I am inclined to think there are some at least who will incline to take a different view of the subject . " In other respects , too , the system would be grossly unjust in its operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Missouri and Illinois have to tax vessels descending the Missouri and Mississippi , to make improvements in the harbor of St. Louis , to be balanced perhaps by other improvements at some point on the Illinois border ? A vessel loaded with pork , corn , &amp;c. , passing by the harbor of St. Louis , would be subject to a toll for improvements at that point , just as vessels passing into the Baltic are obliged to pay a toll to the King of Denmark . Nothing could be more unjust , and certain to be resisted . " But , perhaps , " says Mr. Smith , " some may he disposed to inquire why the rule in case of charges on goods freighted one way operates differently from goods freighted the other . The reason is obvious . " We have seen that the produce of the West will have to compete in the markets of the Atlantic and of Europe with abundance of other produce of the Atlantic States and other parts of the world ; and its price will be regulated by that competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the law of trade and the rule of the market , and it would be vain to contend against it . Foreign produce , on the other hand , carried to the West , manufactured cottons , silk , iron , will not only seek the cheapest way in going thither , but when it arrives at its Western market , will find no competitors there , and will add to its price whatever tonnage duties it has been compelled unwillingly to pay , in addition to all other charges . Thus the farmer will be doubly taxed . " Let Illinois manufacture for herself to some extent her iron , woollen , and cotton goods ; then , when the people of England , or even of New-tugland , appear there with similar projects , they will be obliged to sustain the charges or some part of them . " But now there is no competition , because there is no adequate tariff for the protection of manufactures in the West . Mr. Smith then called the attention of the Senate to a remarkable feature in this proposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader will recollect that it was introduced by way of amendment to a bill for the Improvement of lRivers and Harbors , to be paid for out of the Treasury of the United States ; that is to // say , by tariffs . Mr. Douglas was in favor of that famous bill , so long impeded by Southern jealousy , because of its almost universal popularity in that part of the country which he represents . He nevertheless affixed to it an amendment , by which a three-fold was substituted for a single system of taxation . First , certain improvements , provided for in the Bill , were to be made and paid for in tariffs upon imported goods . These tariffs , it is well known , are paid in great part by the consumer ; the only check to that evil being the competition of home manufactures , which throw back a portion of the taxation upon the foreign producer and manufacturer . Here is one item to be paid by the farmer : the second item was a system of tonnage duties upon goods going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down . A three-fold system of taxation , invented by the Senator of Illinois , to be paid by his constituents . A triple system of tariffs by a Democrat , for the oppression of Western farmers . This is surely the most remarkable piece of free-trade legislation which we have ever heard . Where was Mr. Douglas born ? By what Government is he employed ? Is it certain that he is an American ? Ought not the Young American party to look a little more narrowly into the pretensions of their candidate ? Will he be available in 1856 ? Moreover , by the plan of Mr. Douglas , the wealthy inhabitants of the sea-coast and the cities of the Atlantic States would be finally relieved from all share of taxation for the internal improvements of the West ! The cities of Boston , New-York , Philadelphia and Baltimore are to go scot-free . " I will not say , " says Mr. Smith , " that the Senator really intended any such result ; but it is , in my judgment , a ground of serious complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of his measure . " Mr. Smith supposes that there are not , for example , much less than 750,000 persons residing in the city of New-York and its vicinity , maintained by its industry and commerce , and owning perhaps one fifth part of the surplus wealth of the country . Mr. Smith inquires , very justly , whether it is proper that all the burthen should be thrown upon the West , which is so much less able to pay , and the merchant princes of the great emporium of commerce be exempted from contributions to objects of such vast importance . If tile construction of internal improvements is to be paid for , as it must be , by the General Government , let not the benefit be cancelled by an unjust distribution of taxes ; let the wealth and luxury of the Atlantic States bear at least their fair proportion , distributed by a proper system of tariffs . " Why should not revenue derived from such a source , " " derived from the enjoyment of every luxury that human heart can desire , ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor in the West and Northwest , " " especially when the benefits of this . system are ultimately to redound as well to the benefit and prosperity of the merchant as of the farmer ? , " The merchants of New-York , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , and other cities , have been for the last quarter of a century selling large quantities of goods to the transmontane regions of the United States , at large , not to say exorbitant profit . In the mean time the people of the West have been engaged* in paying for their farms , building dwelling-houses , school-houses and churches , opening roads , and making a thousand improvements indispensable to a new country . Then comes in the Honorable Senator with his notable scheme , and says , Let these sons of toil bear all the burden of harbor and river improvement . " But we have already detained the reader too long upon this heavy and repulsive topic of tonnage duties .

It is precisely , however , in the dreary and labyrinthine regions of finance argument that the sense of the people is oftenest led astray by wily politicians .
