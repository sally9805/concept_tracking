FILLIBUSTERING . IN the year of grace 1685-we are informed in the naiive narrative of the Sieur Raveneau de Lussan  --  a jolly company of freebooters in the " South sea** ( the Pacific west of the isthmus ) , of which he was one , descended upon the town of Granada , on the southern shore of Lake Nicaragua , in Central America . On the 7th of April , of that year , three hundred and forty-five men , chiefly English and French , and all of them very anxious to extend the benefits of French and English civilization to the Spanish and Indian inhabitants of the country , " went ashoar on a fiat Coast , " and were led by a good guide through a wood , marching night and day until the 9th , when " sharp Hunger " compelled them to rest in a great sugar plantation , four leagues distant from Granada . " It belonged to a Knight of St. James 's , who , upon our arrival , we failed to take prisoner , our Leggs being at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him . " On the 10th , they saw two ships upon Lake Nicaragua , carrying all the wealth of the town to an island two leagues off ; and , after brief consultation , " we exhorted one another to fall on bravely , " and advanced at a " round pace " to the attack . The freebooters lost but four men killed and eight wounded ; " which , in truth , was very cheap . " Thereupon , they repaired to the church and sang Te Deum , and then detached a party " to go and find out some women , " to be ransomed ; and finally sent word to the Spaniards that they must ransom the town , or it would be burnt . The Spaniards did not trouble themselves to answer ; " which at last constrained some of us to set fire to the Houses out of meer Spight and Revenge . " The pirates partly intended to pass through the Lake to the " North Sea " ( Caribbean Sea ) , but wanting the facilities to do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tropical forests , and deadly disease , reaching the shore again upon the 26th of the month ; and so " got out of those parts of the World , which , though very charming and agreeable to those who are settled there , yet did not appear to be so to an handful of Men as we were , without Shipping , the most part of our time without Victuals , and wandering amidst a multitude of Enemies , against whom we were obliged to be continually upon our Guard , and who did all that in them lay to deprive us of subsistence . " The artless tales of such earlier missionaries of human progress and the superior races in Central America , closely resemble those of their successors with whom we are contemporary . The Sieur de Lussan 's foray upon Granada , read in quaint old type , has a little air of unreality , and the crime is so remote that it becomes almost romantic . But the same relation of the same transaction by a vagabond of our own time , told in yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . The old pirates were outlaws in an outlawed region . The inhabitants of the Spanish Main had been themselves robbers and spoilers . The provinces they occupied were subject to Spain , but Spain cared only to strain their treasure from them , drop by drop , like blood , to bloat her coffers . England and France were at war with Spain , and the easiest strokes they could deal , and the most deadly , were those upon the American possessions . For a century the shores of the Gulf of Mexico had been debatable ground . Removed from the neighborhood of any power which could make its laws respected in detail , the whole Central American region was convulsed with strife , as deadly and continuous as the elemental fury of the tropics . It was the arena of the world . Superstition and religious rage burnt there more wastingly than volcanic fires . The Holy Church of Rome sent over shiploads of racks and thumb-screws to allure the Indian lambs to the fold , and the pure religion and undefiled of the English Church withstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aboriginal inhabitants of the country  --  a mild and tender race-were the victims of all sides , and were ruthlessly conquered and enslaved by every victory . Gold was the object , and blood the means of the long sanguinary struggle which makes up the history of Central America ; until , within a century , the torpor of pure exhaustion paralyzed the land , and it has lain for years upon the equator , moribund . After the French revolution , both the // patrician and plebeian classes in Spanish America desired to separate from Spain . The former , because it feared that the reforms imposed upon the Spanish monarchy would be transplanted to the provinces , and destroy the patrician prerogative of absolute oppression ; the latter , because the movement of North America and Europe had even stirred the stagnation of despotism in which the provinces were slowly decaying . In 1821 , therefore , Spanish America became independent . Since that date , its internal history has been a record of constant differences , jealousies , and insurrections . The states have been ceaselessly fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tfmeymade a confederation and dissolved it . Phe world has not even heard the incessant quarrel , much less heeded it . But suddenly , in our day , the Central American States have again become of vast importance , and their affairs challenge daily interest and attention . At this moment ( March , 1857 ) there is a freebooter in one of those states , in much sorer plight than the old pirate de Lussan , when he and his friends sacked Granada , or the earlier pirate , Morgan , who burnt Panama ; and , although nearly two hundred years have passed-and even two hundred years ago in England , at war with Spain , the citizens of London did not publicly assemble to express their sympathy for de Lussan-yet , in New York , to-day , in the chief city of a country that has nominally some especial Christian and democratic claims , the citizens are summoned to express , publicly , their hopes of the victory of de Lussan 's successor , who has ordered the same Granada to be burnt to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deums , the new ones consecrate theirs with poor sentimentality about the progress of the Saxon race and democratic equality . At least , the old murderers of the Spanish main had the merit of cutting throats without canting . They wanted plate , and pieces of eight , and they said so plainly , and they butchered the inhabitants until they found them . Being anxious for information , and pressed for time , on one occasion , Lolonois , a French buccaneer of the seventeenth century , drew his cutlass and cut open the heart of one of the Spaniards who did not reply quickly enough , and . " pulling out his heart , began to bite and gnaw it with his teeth , like a ravenous wolf , saying to the rest , I will serve you all alike , if you show me not another way. * * Walker had other objects than present booty merely ; but the sufferings he has occasioned are a thousand-fold more dreadful than those usually recorded as the consequences of the old forays . And to what end Month after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been shipped by responsible agents in New York and New Orleans to Nicaragua , and for what purpose ? Hundreds have gone-not three hundred remain above groundby whose means  --  to what end ? Was it a scheme of colonization in good faith ? We have not seei*a solitary man who believes so ; but assuming it , then it has failed so disastrously that every city and village in the country should warn anybody , who intends to emigrate , of the facts . Was it a scheme of assistance to one of two contending parties , in good faith ? Then why are both those parties in arms , to a man , against the invader ? Having fulfilled his mission , or failed in it , why is he still lingering ? Is all this blood , and grief , and desolation of a country , the consequence of commercial ambition ? Then merchant princes are as inhuman as Indian caciques . Is it all part of an agitation to be used for the benefit of the great Christian blessing of slavery ? Then its facts should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker , himself , is an adventurer in whose whole career there is not a solitary indication of ability . He is , we understand , a Tennesseean , aboutthirty-six or eight years of age ; who has studied law and medicine ; has edited newspapers in New Orleans and San Francisco ; practiced law in Marysville , California ; and , in the year 1854 , at the head of fifty or sixty missionaries of human progress and democratic equality , proclaimed himself President of Sonora , a small Mexican State bordering upon California . His presidency was very brief , and ended in a trial in California for a violation of the Neutrality Laws . He was acquitted ; for the California of four years ago naturally judged such lapses lightly , and his services in the van of empire were not required again until he received , in the spring of 1855 , a commission , as general , in the army of Nicaragua , and a // grant of 58,000 acres of land . On the 5th of May , in that year , he sailed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loveliest of tropical states ; rich in natural products , and , upon its Pacific slopes , not unhealthy in climate ; while , through its lake and river , it offers a convenient and rapid transit from sea to sca . Its government is nominally republican ; but the languor and ignorance of its inhabitants , who are of mixed races , keep it in a semi-barbarous condition , without manufactures or industry , or any practical improvement of its natural advantages . It has been constantly embroiled in civil wars since the dissolution of the Central American Confederacy , in 1838 . It is not necessary to state the details of these struggles . It is enough to know that , in the month of May , 1854 , there had been a battle which resulted in the assumption of two governments in the country  --  the liberal , which had its headquarters at Leon , the old capital of Nicaragua , and the legitimist ( as the government party called itself ) , which centred at Granada . The latter faction held th' southern portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle , in May , 1854 , the liberals besieged Granada for ten months ; but , in February , 1855 , retired , and , pursued by the legitimists , a bloody battle was fought between the factions , at Massaya , which was disastrous to the liberals . In May , 1855 , Walkcr and his fiftysix men arrived from California , and , at the end *of June , marched , with two hundred Nicaraguan liberals , upon Rivas , a city upon Lake Nicaragua , occupied by the legitimists . The attack was repulsed . Walker and his fifty-six men had taken up their position in a house , which the enemy fired , and the ex-president of Sonora and his men cut their way back to the coast of San Juan del Sur . There was some skirmishing during the summer ; and , in October , at the head of two hundred Americans , and two hundred and fifty natives , Walker took possession of one of the Transit Company 's steamers , at Virgin Bay , sailed to Granada , which lies upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , while the enemy were expecting him at Rivas , forty miles distant . A treaty followed between the two parties , and a government selected from both sides was constitut ed . Don Patricio Rivas , who had been an official under the legitimist rule , was made provisional president for fourteen months : Walker was commaimder-in-chief of the army ; Corral , the legitimist general , was minister of war ; Parker H. French , an ex-California editor* minister of the Hacienda ; Don Firmin Ferrer , a gentleman of Granada , minister of public credit ; and General Maximo Xeres ( who had been the predecessor of Walker in the command of the liberals ) , minister of foreign affairs . This government was recognized by Mr. Wheeler , minister of the United States , the only foreign minister then resident in Nicaragua . But , unfortunately , the new government commenced by shooting its mini* ter of war , who was detected in treasonable correspondence with the enemy ; and by sending Mr. French to Washington as minister , who was not recognized by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ambassador to Costa Rica , to propose a treaty of amity , which that state answered by declaring war upon Nicaragua -- doubtless , regarding Walker as the small European states regarded Napoleon , as no less dangerous a friend than enemy . These steps were not auspicious ; but the Rivas-Walker government was not inactive . In the year 1849 , the State of Nicaragua had granted a right of way through the country to a steamship company , upon certain conditions . Of course , during the incessant internal wars this steam-ship company 's property was liable to heavy taxation , and it naturally desired peace . It was noticed in this country and in England , that Walker had used the ships of that company for his transport upon the lake . Some kind of mutual intelligence was , consequently , inferred ; but in February , 1856 , to the amazement of everybody , and especiamily of Nicaragua stockholders , the Rivas-Walker government seized the property of the company , upon the ground that the conditions of the compact between it and the state had not been observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300,000 , and its property at $200,000 , and thereupon transferred the grant to other parties , supposed to be commercial rivals of the original grantees . The representatives of the old grantees applied for aid at Washington ; but the // United States Government proffered no consolation in the premises . Meanwhile the Costa Ricans had marched into Nicaragua , and were in possession of Rivas , one of the chief towns of fhat State . Here a disastrous battle was fought in April , 1856 . Both armies were nearly destroyed . The Costa Ricans tottered home again , and Walker fell back upon Granada . A decree had been issued granting two hundred and fifty acres of laud to every emigrant who would come and settle upon it ; and , under this pretense , hundreds of men left the United States , although the president issued his proclamation against the violation of the Neutrality Laws . At length the other states of Central America began to take up arms , apprehending an application of fillibusterism to their own territories . Fully to secure the ultimate purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivas-Walker Government to be sustained by the United States , and Mr. French having failed to be received* a priest of Granada , and a native Nicaraguan , the Padre Vijil , was sent to Washington , and was recognized there as minister . Actual relations were now established with the United States . The army was under command of Walker ; all the foreign intrigue in the state , of course , passed through him ; he hnd perfect intelligence with the Transit Company , and with the emigration that poured in under its auspices , to encourage which , a free passage was , at one time , offered from New Orleans and New York to Nicaragua-the American newspapers , especially at the South , were loudly celebrating this emancipation of Central America from ignorance and despotism ; the subject excited profound political attention ; all kinds of political possibilities began to glimmer in the future , simultaneously with the tragical debate of the extension of slavery in Kansas ; inchoate ideas filled many minds ; theories of the indomitable Saxon race , the march of empire , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the sentimental variations of manifest destiny-meaning " to get what you can , and hold what you get " - became very conspicuous in newspapers and conversation . They became so conspicuous that President Rivas took the alarm at last , as Costa Rica had done at first , and being the head of the government , of which he had been named provisional president for fourteen months , by the treaty of peace , dated October 23 , 1855 , and so in good faith to continue , " unless the president , in full council of ministers , should resolve to call an election before the end of the time , " ( Art . II. , of the Treaty ) , he resolved to assert his rights as chief of the government ; and , naturally suspecting the intentions of the commander-in-chief , Walker , President Rivas , with his minister of war , Salazar , departed to Leon in the month of June , 1856 , and declared the government to be removed to that city . This was irregular , because , by the second " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government was to reside in Granada ; but it was a justifiable measure of public safety , Walker being at that time in treasonable correspondence with a Cuban adventurer . Upon Rivas 's retirement to Leon , Walker proclaimed him and his minister-at-war , Salazar , traitors , and ordered a new election for president , which was held on the 24th of June . Walker was elected , as Louis Napoleon was elected Emperor of France ; and , a few weeks afterward , he caused Salazar to be put to death at Granada . The pretended election of Walker reduced the country to the precise condition in which the Fillibuster found it , upon his arrival thirteen months before . Since June , 1856 , there have been two governments in Nicaragua ; the one composed of foreigners headed by Walker , and the other , of native Nicaraguans and other Central Americans , chiefly Costa Ricans , allies of their neighbor Nicaragua . On the 19th of August , Walker 's government was recognized by Mr. Wheeler , who had acknowledged the Rivas-Walker government . The Padre Vijil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mr. Oaksmith and Don Firmin Ferrer , who hnve been successively sent by him to Washington , have not been received by our government , which , to the honor of Mr. Marcy be it said , has declined officially to countenance an adventurer in a foreign state , merely because he chanced to be born an American . From the moment of his election as president to the present , William Walker being thrown entirely upon his // own resources , without the favor of the United States government , without the support of a Nicaraguan party , which has entirely deserted him , or of the steam-ship company , which is practically powerless for the time , its boats being seized by the native army , has exposed to the whole world the measure of his capacity . The man , who , a year since , having the semblance of right upon his side , was the active agent of the government which held the capitals and controlled the resources of the country , has discovered that that semblance of right was his whole power . Totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he now ( March , 1857 ) skulks along the road between the Lake and the Pacific , a conspicuous criminal , a forlorn adventurer , the contemptible captain of a hundred wretched men , starved , demoralized , and utterly miserable ; himself the direct occasion of an extremity of human suffering , the story of which is like that of the plague in Napoleon 's army at Jaffa . And grave men and grave journals contemplate the ridiculous , and , in respect of others , tragical career of this incompetent Bombastes. and philosophize about the destiny of our country in overspreading the continent . Mr. William Walker 's personal views are as important as those of the old pirate Morgan , or his compeer Lolonois , or Roche Brasiliano , or Bartolomeo Portugues , or Captain Kidd ; but any such man , used as a tool , becomes immediately important , and it is , therefore , quite worth while to know what was the meaning of this descent upon Nicaragua , if it meant anything beyond a personal scrabble for power and booty . Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established in Nicaragua in the autumn of 1855 . On the 11th of January* 1856 , Walker made a contract with a Captain F. A. Lain* , agent of Domingo de Goicouria , " sole holder and depository of the goods and chattels belonging to the cause of Cuba , consisting in money , a vessel , and munitions of war . " To this contract , Walker agrees firstly , to help Cuba and " her liberty , " after he has " consolidated the peace ' ' of Nicaragua ; secondly , he makes common cause of the resources of Nicaragua , with those of the revohi tionary party of Cuba ; thirdly , he requires a full statement of the Spanish resources upon the island ; and fourthly , he and Capt . Lain* accept the whole as the preamble of a more elaborate contract . In consequence of this agreement , in the following March , Domingo de Goicouria went to Nicaragua , and was made Brigadier General in Walker 's army ; Walker having made these promises without the knowledge , so far as appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already that state  --  and afterward declaring the government invalid , when it was removed by President Rivas to Leon , in consequence of such treachery as this . We are far from supposing that Walker necessarily meant to keep the ' contract , because he signed it . His first necessity was munitions of war and money , and he was , doubtless , very willing to purchase them upon such easy terms as his word . If he did mean to keep the contract , it proves the ultimate intention which other events revealed ; if he did not , it illustrates the quality of his honor . The Cuban movement in the United States , as explained and justified at Ostend by His Excellency , James Buchanan , the Hon. Pierre Soul* , and Mr. Mason , is no secret . It is notoriously a movement for the extension of slavery . It is not surprising , therefore , that some time subsequent to the signing of this contract , between Goicoui'ia 's agent and Walker , that eminent American citizen and lover of liberty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with the Fillibuster . By this time  --  the summer of 1856 -- the great contest between slavery and freedom upon this continent had been brought to open battle . For the first time in our political history , a vast party was organized upon the fundamental principle of no further slavery extension . The difference came to blows , and blood , and anarchy , in the territory of Kansas ; and to the most searching and solemn debate and vote , throughout the country . The slavery party , accustomed to victory , were amazed at the vital earnestness of the struggle , and could with difficulty uiiderstand how a people , which had only made mouths at the fugitive slave law , and had only murmured protests against the repeal of the Missouri // Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska bill , should so suddenly take a lofty moral ground in politics , and declare that they valued the soul more than the body of the Union . In view of such surprising developments , the slave party naturally thought it might become necessary to relax their speed a little ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , but the great policy of slavery extension must be sustained , even at the cost of a rupture of the Union . A general doctrine has long been current among sagacious slave-politicians that the extreme southern slave states might , one day , find it necessary to change their confederated relations , and form a slave republic , consisting of those states and the old Spanish provinces of Central America , which should abandon the northern states , and perhaps Canada , to the blight of freedom , while they advanced in a career of humanity and the Christian graces which slavery in the tropics would naturally develop . The Cuba movement is a fruit-let us rather say , a blighted blossom-of this theory , and , naturally , those who preferred their own tyranny to that of the Spaniards in Cuba , would wish well to the Walker war in Nicaragua ; and the midsummer of 1856 , therefore , finds Messrs . Soul* and Gdcouria in full intelligence with the Fillibuster-the object of all , of course , being to extend the blessings of American laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1856 , Goicouria was appointed by Walker , who had elected himself president in June , as his minister to England . A letter from Walker to Goicouria , then in New York , fully explains the general intention of the Central American movement . It is dated in Granada on the 12th August , 1856 . Walker tells his agent that he can propitiate English favor by showing the English government that the Nicaraguan movement does not mean annexation- " You can make them see that the only way to cut the expanding and expansive democracy of the North is by a powerful and compact Southern federation based on military principles . " He reminds him that the arrangement of the Mosquito question " is necessary to the work we have on hand after our Central American affairs are settled . " The prospect elates " General " Walker . " Tell he must send me the news , and let me know whether Cuba must and shall be free '  --  but not for the Yankees . Oh ! no ! that fine country is not fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in the island ? " The tone of this letter , with collateral circumstances , probably Induced Golcouria , who was a native Cuban , to consider whether cats ' - paws were altogether extinct . He delayed . Walker was impatient , and heard suspicious storieswrote him a curt letter eight days after the one from which we have quoted ; was asked for satisfaction by Goicouria , and that gentleman was deprived of his mission on the 27th of September . Thereupon , Goicouria withdrew*ntirely from his complicity with Walker , and was replaced by Mr. Henningsen , who had been a soldier in Hungary and Spain , and had married in this country a southern widow , with possessions . Henningsen is the only man of the Walker crew who has shown any military ability . He was sent by the " General " to burn Granada , and , being surrounded by the enemy , he fought with skill and spirit . During the month of September , 1856 , it was well known that Mr. Soul* had been in Nicaragua , and it was announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very credible ; for , by two decrees-one of the 22d April and the other of the 16th July , 1856  --  the property of " the enemies of the country " had been contiscated by Walker , and it was estimated that five millions of dollars ' worth of valuable property would be sold within three or four years , in consequence . of these decrees . This meant , simply , that Walker had ejected the propertyowners and seized their land . We are not apprised of the truth of the story that Mr. SouI6 really bought lands ; but his name , as a friend of the slave system , was well known , and the mere rumor that he had invested in Nicaragua would inspire confidence in many minds that the waste places of Central America would , under Walker , be taught to blossom as the rose , with the system so graciously designed to lead Africa to the Lord . The intent and spirit of the rumor were confirmed on the 22d of September , 1856 , by a decree annulling all the acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a con- // stituent part until she withdrew in April , 1838 , and which acts , when she withdrew , she confirmed as still authoritative . The reason given by Walker for annulling the laws , was the safe one that they were unsuited to the present condition of the country . Now the simple history of this important matter is this : The Central American states became independent in 1821 . In 1823 the federal constituent assembly met , and in April , 1824 , abolished slavery and declared the slave-trade piracy . In 1838 , the confederation was dissolvedeach state became again independent and sovereign  --  but each recognized all the federal laws which were not incompatible with their own state constitutions . Those old laws had , therefore , precisely the same authority as the new ones . But the old laws were never " codified , " and , consequently , there was great difficulty in knowing in detail what they were . Mr. E. George Squier , General Taylor 's minister to Nicaragua , who has written a book about the country which contains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the land with his heart hankering and his mouth watering for it , and clearly in a constant droll panic , lest England should eat it up before America bit it-Mr . Squier writes to the London Times that " General " Walker has only " washed his slate , " and that , by abrogating the federal decrees , he had not restored slavery , for slavery can only exist in virtue of positive laws . Now , whatever confusion there may have been in knowing the old laws , one law was simple and supremethe one abolishing slavery  --  and it ' Walker had meant really to help the cause of human liberty , he would have excepted that , or would immediately have restored it . He did neither . Probably he thought-certainly his partisans in the United States thoughtthat , as slavery had always existed in those states by the Spanish law , the original status of the slave recurred by the abrogation of the law of abolition . This was , doubtless , his intention . His decree was dated in Granada on the 22d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. John L. Richmond , to put beyond all question what the views of Walker were , writes from the same Granada to the Hon. Charles S. Morehead , of Kentucky , a very long letter , in which he describes the charms of the country , and the happy advent of the good " General " Walker among the barbarians of that region . In a strain of the purest philosophical piracy , which would have edified the Sieur de Lussan , who did not trouble himself to write letters when he tarried in Granada , Mr. Richmond states : " I have said , and it is the opinion not only of General Walker , but of those at the head of affairs here , both in the civil and military departments , that there is no power in Central Amarica that can unseat General Walker , or retard the onward progress of this government to the permanent establishment of a republican government upon the model of the United States ; and we have an abiding faith that our brothers at the North , being of a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government-will not permit the rude hand of European tyranny and p ower to blot out light of liberty that comes to redeem this land and the people from the horrors of civil war , and the worse than savage barbarism and rule that wholly forbids the idea of the establishment of any permanent good government . It requires neither prophecy nor divination to foresee that the permanent establishment of a good republican government in Nicaragua involves the establishment of a similar government in the other Central American states . Should such be the case , I leave to you , sir , the pleasing task of tracing the beneficent results that must follow to humanity , and the impetus that must be given to republican principles . ' But , immediately forgetting that he had left to Gov . Morehead " the pleasing task of tracing the beneficent results that must follow to humanity , " etc. , Mr. Richmond proceeds to trace them himself , and invites the consideration of his co-heirs of " the heritage of liberty " - who , with him and Mr. E. George Squier , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of liberty that comes to redeem this land , " and of which " General " Walker is the inextinguishable torch  --  to these facts : " I enclose you a list of property to be sold on the 1st of January next ( under the decree of confiscation ) , with an annexed valuation at very low rates , which I hope you will have published , as I think it will give to young Keatuckians , and , indeed , to all who wish to do so , an opportunity to procure estates intrinsically snore valuable than the best of the southern portion of the United States . ' And again : " I must also mention , that gentlemen from southern states , wishing to emigrate to this country with their slaves , are invited to come ; and a decree has been issued by this government giving to all persons the privilege to do so , the object being to invite slave labor , without which the resources of the country can never be fully and profitably developed ; upon // Fillibusterng. this subject you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sub-secretary of state , and speak by authority . " Quite unable to repress his enthusiasm , at the prospect of the liberty that is to accrue from the invitation of slave labor , and immigration of gentlemen from the southern states with their slaves , the sub-secretary of state indulg*s himself in conclusion , with one natural reflection , to which Captain Canot , in the barracoons of  --  the African slave coast , rejecting slaves bloated with gunpowder , might cordially , and with the same propriety , respond : " Thank God , it is not only the privilege , but the peculiar province and pleasure , of American minds to reform , and elevate , instead of mourning and lamenting , and they come to elevate this land and peopTh from their degeneracy and fallen condition . " The position of the supporters of Walker in this country showed clearly enough what they understood by the Nicaragua war . Directly after the publication of this decree , the New Orleans Delta , the most logical and able of all the pro-slavery journals , stated that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Walker wished to consolidate and perpetuate his government , and added : " We also alluded to significant assurances we had received from authorized sources Ithe reader will remember that the Hon. Pierre Soul6 lives in New Orleans that Walker designed , as soon as he could prudently do so , to publicly legalize slavery within his dominions , and invite slave-holders to immigrate thither with their slaves . We knew , some weeks since , that a decree to this effect had been drawn up , and we now learn that it has been promulgated . * * * * " * Numbers of slave-holders have already written to us to know if they could safely take their slaves into Nicaragua , to cultivate sugar , coffee , rice , indigo , or chocolate plantations , as the case might be . We have always assured our correspondents that , though slaves were not recognized by law in Nicaragua , we had no doubt they would be secured to their owners during Walker 's administration , and that , ultisnately , slavery would have an existence there of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that but one thing is wanting to the millennium in Nicaragua , and that is the African slave-trade . With that blessing , and " African slavery conducted on humane principles , " the country would be quite perfected into a little heaven below . But " General " Walker , and Mr. John L. Richmond , and the Delta forgot to state one fact to our southern friends , who pro-April , pose emigrating to Nicaragua with slaves . The federal law abolishing slavery , is , indeed , abrogated by " President " Walker ; but the state constitution of Nicaragua , adopted on the 12th of November , 1838 , which is still the supreme law of the land , declares , that " every man is free , and can neither sell himself , nor be sold by others , " and all persons , who traffic in slaves , or who are privy to such traffic , forfeit their citizenship . In these two last points , we have no hesitation in saying , that the constitution of Nicaragua is superior to that of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central American states , it was modeled . The fundamental law of Nicaragua , at this moment , prohibits slavery , and yet , the citizens of New York were publicly summoned , a little while since , to express their profound sympathy with a stranger in that country , whose conduct had put him beyond the range of any other feeling , than that he might suffer the extreme penalty of the law , and who , despite the law of the land , and of justice , had openly declared , through his sub-secretary of state , that he desired to promote the immigration of slave-owners and slaves into the country . This meeting , ludicrously worthy of Walker in its character and results , was taken in charge by several hack politicians of the democratic party , and the American democracy were invited by Messrs . Duff Green and Isaiah IRynders , in speeches , and by Mr. Thomas Francis Meagher , in a highly florid letter , full of poor rhetoric about tyranny and oppression , to send instant aid to the discomfited missionary who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tyrannies , and who , with the express intention of propitiating England , of which the democratic party and Mr. Thomas Francis Meagher are so fond , had instructed his agent there to show to the Government , " that the only way to cut the expanding and expansive democracy of the north is by a powerful and compact southern federation , based on military principles . " The Tabernacle meeting was the last spasm of public interest in the present movement in Nicaragua . The steamer , which sailed at the end of February , did not carry a single recruit ; and the agents , with a tender reverence of the Neutrality laws , which , considering their antecedents in the Walker war , was truly edifying , requested the United States district attorney to take particu // lar care that no improper passenger had smuggled himself on board . By the time our article is published , " General " Walker will hardly be found , in the impassioned and picturesque words of Mr. Sub-secretary of State Richmond . " knocking at the doors of Costa Rica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries done to the State of Nicaragua , " but , quite on the other hand , those states will , probably , have thrust the " General " out of doors . Such is an outline of the facts of the Walker foray into Nicaragua , which has so much occupied the newspapers during the last year , and has suggested so many reflections upon the destiny of this country . The chief mischief of the business is the fearful suffering which Walker 's imbecility has entailed upon his followers . The destitution , starvation , agonized deaths , by loathsome diseases and mortified wounds , are dreadful to consider . There are no more piteous tales , in the history of any campaigur , than those told by impartial passengers across the country from California , as the result of their own observation . The motiv*s of the movement were , undoubtedly , many and complicated . It is fair to presume , upon a general knowledge of the spirit of trade and commercial rivalry , that the steam-ship company , acting through its immediate agents , persuaded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case there can be little doubt that their agents had an understanding with him after he landed in the country ; and his seizure of a steamer to transport his forces from Virgin Bay to Granada could have been no surprise to them , and his finding a large sum of money upon the steamer , none to him . It is clear enough that he lent himself to the intrigues of rival interests in the transit , and that somebody was outwitted . But , during all this time , Walker must have had his own views , and was subject to political as well as commercial influences . He went to Nicaragua , as a soldier of fortune goes everywhere and anywhere , to do the best he could for himself He , doubtless , used others , and others certainly used him . He had upon his side the appearance of a fair invitation . But every sensible man is ajudge , whether a Central American party would , unless especially incited to the step by a strong outer influence , be likely to invite , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his favor . He led the allies and conquered a transient peace ; went through the form of making part of a new government ; and was almost instantly , by his own word , a traitor to it . Of course , Walker 's objects were , first , William Walker ; second , the party of his natural predilections and their principles . The steam-ship company was shrewd , but the political influence was sagacious . The main end for Walker to hold constantly in view , was not dividends to a company , but advantage to a great political party , which divided the Union at home , and upon which his claims would be vast and patent . The steam-ship company was useful to supply money and men , and must be propitiated , because the hope of Americanizing Nicaragua greatly depended upon the favor of the transit company , then S possession . But this was all secondary . The gentlemen about the Bowling Green in New York were only tools thinking themselves handles  --  a fate which has befallen merchants before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the government of Nicaragua , under a fair appearance of legal right ; to be supported by the official recognition of the United States Government , by the pecuniary interest of a commercial company , by the popular sympathy of a spurious philosophy of manifest destiny , and the necessity of a short road to California , and by the general indifference of all who were not especially interested in the success of the effort . Thus Nicaragua was to be impregnated with American influences and interests ; and , in the fullness of time , as a practically American state , comprising the shortest and safest transit to our western possessions and the vast Pacific commerce , she was to ask annexation and admittance into the Union , care having been taken from the beginning , that no " psalm-singing Yankees , " but good Christian slaveholders , should have control of the elections and the stat. constitution . This was , doubtless , the general intention , developing itself , of course , imperfectly , and modified by various circumstances . And , equally beyond doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery in this country , which , for the moment , and in Nicaragua , is disappointed . The plan includes Cube and the islands of the Gulf , with Central America ; and it implies war with Europe and a dissolution of the present // Union . Its object is the extension of slavery into regions deemed more suitable to the institution than some of the cooler slave states , and in which a languid climate will be the most subtle ally of the sophistries and sins of the system . It is easy to see , for instance , that slavery would flourish much more luxuriantly in the ignorance of the Tropics than in Virginia begirt with intelligence and freedom . This is the great object ; and its philosophy is the doctrine that the superior Saxon race , leading the van of civilization , must and ought to overspread the continent and displace the barbarism of Central America as it supplanted the savages of North America . That it is the design of Providence to subdue this continent and the world to intellectual and moral light and liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , in accomplishing its designs , are often inexplicable , we equally believe . That God is present in history , and that no great event occurs without that presence , is as much a necessary faith as that no sparrow falls to the ground without his c*re . All this is simply to say that God is God , and rules in the universe . But to assume that it is the divine intention a thing should be done , because we can do it , is a little dangerous . Such a doctrine is dear and convenient to every wrong-doer , and is as good an argument in the mouth of Cain as in that of the Holy Inquisition . It is very evident in history that the race , has gradually advanced from the East toward the West , its moral condition improving with its march . The great experiment of popular government about to be tried , the new world was discovered , and the pilgrims arrived upon its shores* Belonging to the superior race they were , in the divine order , to supplant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrim who , having helped to entrap the Indians into a war , then went to Saybrook and helped slay the Pequots , was less a murderer - he the individual Pilgrim who shot the individual Pequot-because , in the order of Providence , the Saxon race was to o*verspread this continent ? If the argument is valid , every crime is ju*tifled . If a man is found murdered in his room , it was , doubtless , the divine design that the man should be murdered . Shall we then regard the murderer as the instrument of God ? The best civilization of the race now Fillibustering . April , occupying the North American continent will , undoubtedly , gradually stretch all over it . But while that is a philosophical dream of the thoughtful American , it is his practical duty to hang pirates . If the Lord intends to carry civilization across the isthmus , via Nicaragua , we take leave to doubt if he proposes to give it in charge to slaveholders , going to make Nicaragua a slave state . We do not say that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the methods of progress have been as strange and inscrut* able as that . But if he has implanted an instinct of faith in his purposes , however dark his way to them may be , so he has given us an instinct and a command of conscience to resist*.ppression . It may be in the order of Providence that a man should break into your house ; but it is equally in that order that you should shoot him if you can . So it may be in the order of Providence to extend civilization by suffering slavery in other regions of this continent than those it already curses . But it is equally in that order , that every humane and religious man should resist that extension to the end . Until , therefore , a conscientious man can coOperate with clean hands in what he conceives to be the design of God upon this continent , he may be very sure the moment for his coOperation has not arrived . It is not necessary that we should get to San Francisco within any specified time ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie , and steal , and murder . If , as a people , we can not be just-if we can not even pretend to be just , it might be as well to postpone our observations upon Providence and the progress of humanity . The practical present question in the matter of Nicaragua is this : Nicaragua being a state as independent of us as Great Britain , what is the best arrangement we can make with her to pass over to the Pacific and California , if we conclude to go that way ? The answer is plain enough-we must negotiate for the right of way , which Nicaragua will gladly enough concede upon proper terms , and she must agree to protect the passage , or to let us protect ourselves , each power being amenable to the other for infractions of the agreement , according to custom and international law : and , as the stronger power , we must in // honor see that we are not the offenders . To this England says , that she is greatly interested in the transit and wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just , and Mr. Dallas did perfectly right in admitting it , and making it the basis of the joint treaty . And what is the objection ? Simply this : that England has no right at all in the matter , that she is always thrusting herself forward , and that she is a universal cormorant of advantages and possessions . Now the famous Monroe doctrine is nothing but the application of this very British policy to American affairs . It was simply taking the refusal of this continent . England had the start in the East , and so America asserted its claim to the West . On the ground of principle , in the matter , both nations stand precisely alike . America assumes the right , and , perhaps , only bides her time , to treat Cuba and Central America precisely as England treated India . In the present case , the claims of Great Britain to a practical interest in the question have already been allowed by us in the Clayton-Bulwer treaty ; and evcn had they not been so , the interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities of commercial communication , is sufficiently evident . Beside this general interest , the curious inquirer will learn , that England has long enjoyed distinctly conceded rights in Honduras , and that the chief commerce of all the neighboring states of Central America is almost monopolized by her . By its situation , and peculiar formation , Central America is one of the most important points in the world . Every commercial and enterprising nation on the globe is directly interested in the impartial settlemerit of the right of way through the country . England justly resists any exclusive claim of any foreign power upon that soil ; and the treaty of Mr. Dallas , so far as it is known , fairly expresses the sentiment of the intelligent and patriotic mass of the American people . There is still , happily , a moral sentiment in this country , which is distinctively American , and honors that name so much , that it would willingly fight rather than see it desecrated . That sentiment was fully aroused and interested in the recent presidential election , and will not again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular institutions has a conscience , represented by a considerable body of voters , that country is safe . Within the last two years-as we believe-we , as a people , have passed the greatest peril with which we were ever threatened . The repeal of the Missouri Compromise , and the Kansas-Nebraska bill , were the high-water marks of a slave despotism . Those waters were happily driven back , before the harvests of the future were totally submerged . The shock , which the good sense and patriotism of the country received , showed itself in the vital excitement of the presidential eJ* ction , and scored itself upon our history in that prodigious combined vote of the opposition , amounting to more than two millions , against the eighteen hundred thousand that elected Mr. Buchanan . The great battle is still to be fought , day by day , but that shock will keep the public conscience alive . Men who have hitherto scorned politics will now consent to mingle in them , conscious that politics can be purified only by mingling principle with them . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a representative ; which loves its country as the great means of future civilization and human progress ; and that patriotism would fight to the death rather than that country should , by a single meanness or crime , dishonor its divine intention , and disappoint forever the secret hope of humanity . We repeat , the great battle is still to be fought ; and , if we thought so last summer , how much more so now , after our new President 's inaugural and the decision of the Supreme Court o* the United States in the Dred Scott case . The maddest dogma of Mr. Calhoun has now received the deliberate sanction of the highest official legal authority in the land . That decision was the true inaugural of the first President ever elected by a sectional vote in the country . The result of that decision is tho loss of respect , in all manly minds , for a republican tribunal which , in spirit , decides against humanity , and , conse quently , against God .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
