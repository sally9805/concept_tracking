ART . 111. - THE EARTH AND MAN . The Earth and Man . Lectures on Comparative Physical Geography in its relation to the history of mankind . By ARNOLD GUYOT , Professor of Physical Geography and History at Nenchatel , Switzerland . Translated from the French by C. C. FELToN , Professor in Harvard University . Boston : Gould , Kendall and Lincoln . IT is a very unpretending little volume , the title of which we place at the head of our paper ; but it possesses unusual interest in several particulars , and we feel anxious therefore to bring it to the knowledge of all our readers . Without engaging in any discussion of its topics , we would point out , in 5O1Ti* detail , those views of the author which seem to us to embody the principal merits of an admirable book . Both the author and the subject of the work are somewhat new to us . Of the writer 's personal history our only knowledge is derived from some of the notices which accompany the volume . From these we gather that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Neuchatel ; and that he had pursued his investigations , and formed his views , of these subjects , under the stimulus of intercourse with the highest authorities , Humboldt and Ritter . We should be glad to know something more of the circumstances which have removed him from those congenial and attractive scenes to a residence among us , but , in the absence of any such information , can only conjecture that his removal may have been one of the disastrous results of the political commotions , by which that canton has been recently so seriously agitated . The volume itself was prepared for the press under circumstances of peculiar interest . It was originally spoken , and formed a course of lectures , in the French language , in Boston . The author 's views awakened so much interest in that community as to call forth a general and urgent request for their publication in English . This labor the author was encouraged to undertake by the generous proffer of assistance from a most competent quarter , Prof. Felton ; who has thereby laid the American public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture of the evening was thus on the next day written by the author , and then translated by his kind coadjutor . We have seldom known an incident more favorable to the reputation of that community for an elegant and genial culture , than the prompt appreciation of scientific merit which demanded this work , and the courteous and friendly aid which brought it before the public . // The general subject of the work too , is essentially recent ; and the author 's particular view of it is altogether original . Physical geography , though by no means unnoticed hitherto , has yet been studied only in certain of its incidental relations . Under the hands of savans yet living , it has expanded into a body of independent facts alrnady very vast , and daily increasing in number . It must , we think , strike most students , that there is among the facts of this science as hitherto developed , somewhat less of connection than is in every way desirable , for either the acquisition or the remembrance of them . At least the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other physical sciences . Indeed we are disposed to think that the facts do not , in the present state of our knowledge , admit of the same methodical and convenient classification . This difficulty Prof. Guyot 's work seems especially adapted to remedy . Without presenting by any means so detailed an enumeration of facts as the late work of Mrs. Somerville , and without tracing the facts to any such minute and specific consequences as Humboldt in his Cosmos , it yet gives a most intelligible and comprehensive selection from the mass of them ; and binds them together by ingeuious and profound generalizations which give to the result a more philosophical aspect , and greatly increase the reader 's command over the knowledge he acquires . The author discusses in the first half of the volume the general facts relating to the earth 's surface ; the continents , with their different forms , and their diversities of altitude or relief ,  --  and the ocean , with its varieties of indentation and of depth . These topics suggest many interesting observations , and are illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trace the process by which the earth has received its present form . Beginning with the earliest periods of which geology gives any account , he illustrates the successive upheaving of the European and American continents , by maps which picture the several changes with pleasing distinctness to the eye . Europe at first appears as a mere group of islands , slightly elevated , and detached from one another ; as the process advances , the elevation increases , the islands coalesce , and the familiar features of the continent come to view . After developing the gradual character of the changes which have given to the continents their present forms , the author discusses the changes of climate and condition which accompany the process . He establishes , by an induction of numerous and decisive observations , the fact that the characteristic of the oceanic climate of the present era , is uniformity , constancy , while that of the land is variety , and eccess ; and this opens an ingenious view which shows the author 's power of binding several distinct classes of facts in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mildness and constancy // of temperature , results in an abundant but monotonous growth . The species , both animal and vegetable , are in such localities scanty , while the mass is profuse arid exuberant . rThe continents , on the other hand , originally diversified in soil and structure and having these differences enhanced by great varieties of exposure and elevation , produce more varied types of life , and greater concentration of vitality in the animal and vegetable kingdoms . Hence the larger and more vigorous animals of high organization belong , even now , only to the continents , and the islands immediately connected with them . We have no lion or tiger in any of the truly oceanic , or as the author terms them , pelagic islands . The ocean then , is the domain where the inferior races reign by their mere number and mass ; but its characteristic in this respect is limitation in the variety and excellence of its types . As , in the earlier epochs of our planet , the ocean was the prevalent element , nature assumed then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of it wear now . Exuberant vegetation , in a limited number of forms not of the highest type , and inferior races of animals massive , monstrous and innumerable , these were the characteristic productions of that era . This beautiful development of the analogy of the present to the most remote past in the history of our planet seems to unite , as every student of geology will at once perceive , a great number of apparently nnrelated j'acts ; and develops an admirable connecting link between the two sciences . The currents of the air , and those of the ocean are next described , concisely indeed , but with quite sufficient minuteness for the general student ; after which the author reverts to the continents , and sketches very ingeniously their physical characters and contrasts . America , he observes , stretches iu all its length through a far greater extent of latitude than the eastern continent , and the circumstance that its principal mountain reliefs extend from north to south gives to its vast plains a gradual and imperceptible change , and a practical commingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence the distribution of species is on this continent through wide zones of latitude . " It is not without surprise that the European landing on these shores sees the humming bird , that diamond of the tropics , glancing in the sun in a country which winter clothes , during long months , in a thick mantle of snow and ice . " On the other hand , the vast mountain ranges in each division of the old world , the Himmaleh for instance , extend from east to west ; and give to the countries on either side of them a character of violent contrast . The nations and the climates are those of the south and the north . " The traveller who passes the Alps , abandons the severe landscapes and firs of the north , to descend by a single day 's journey into the ever verdant gardens and orange groves of fair Italy . " But it is // amid these sharp contrasts that nature loves to diversify her forms . These sudden and complete oppositions of relief , exposure and climate , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finer development , and more ample variety of particular types of plants , animals , and even of men . That is the world therefore of origination and development-it is physically , as it has been historically , the seed bed and the nursery of , the organized races which people the earth . Another grand contrast between the old world and the new , arises from their respective exposures to the moisture of the ocean . The new world has its great reliefs on the western shore , and hence it is exposed through its whole width to the trade winds of the ocean , which , in consequence of the earth 's rotation , blow steadily from the east . Moreover , its position , between the two great oceans , secures to it abundance of rain , and gives it thus a climate essentially insular . Then too its vast rivers , and its mighty lakes , powerfully enhance the humidity of its atmosphere . Let our author himself explain in his own animated way the results of this comprehensive fact . " Thus , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , that half of its lands are exposed to the tropical sun , but that , all the conditions being equal , America is , on the whole , a little less warm than the old world , and we shall have the essential features of its climate . The oceanic climate-this is what America owes to the fundamental forms and the relative disposition of its lands ; while the old world is indebted to the predominance of the dry and continental climate . " * * * * " The warm and the moist , these are the most favorable conditions for the production of an exuberant vegetation . Now the vegetable covering is nowhere so general , the vegetation so predominant , as in the two Americas . Behold , under the same parallel where Africa presents only parched table lands , those boundless virgin forests of the basin of the Amazon , those sylvas , almost unbroken over a length of more than 1,500 miles , forming the most gigantic wilderness of this kind that exists in any continent . And what vigor , what luxuriance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , calling to mind that of America herself , boldly uplift their heads 150 or 200 feet above the ground , and domineer over all the other trees of these wilds , by their height , by their number and by the majesty of their foliage . Innumerable shrubs and trees of smaller height fill up the space that separates their trunks ; climbing plants , woody-stemmed twining lianos , infinitely varied , surround them both with their flexible branches , display their own flowers upon the foliage , and combine them in a solid mass of vegetation , impenetrable to man , which the axe alone can break through with success . * * South America and particularly the basin of the Amazon , is the true kingdom of the palm trees ; nowhere does this noble form of vegetation show itself under a greater number of species . This is the sign of the preponderating development of leaves over every other part of the vegetable growth ; of that expansion of foliage , of that leafiness which is peculiar to warm and moist climates . America has none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Holland . The Ericas or heather , so common , so varied , so characteristic of the flora of the Cape of Good Hope , is a form unknown to the new world . There is nothing which resembles those metrosideri of Africa , those dry myrtles ( Eucalyptus ) and willow leaved Acacias , the flowers of which shine with the brightest colors , but whose narrow foliage turned edgewise to the vertical sun casts no shadow . Every where long and abundant leaves , an intense verdure , a strong and well nurtured vegetation , these are what we find in tropical America . " - pp. 188 , 189. // This exuberance of vegetation seems however scarcely favorable to the finest development of animal life . Accordingly the inferior types are in America most numerous , varied and controlling-those which subsist in connection with the aqueous or the vegetative element . The author proceeds : " Hence nothing is more splendid , more sparkling , than the insect world in South America . The inexhaustible variety of their species , the brilliancy of their colors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful ornaments of those regions . Here live the Hercules beetle , the largest of the Coleoptera ; and those brilliant butterflies with broad wings , the Menelaus , the Adonis , the Achilles , whose varying colors glitter in the sun like diamonds . " * * * * " Among the vertebrates , no family is so largely represented as that of the reptiles , for moisture is their element , and the rivers and temporary lagoons of the rainy season are peopled with Caimans , the crocodiles of the new world ; the Iguanas , the most gigantic of lizards ; the Basilisks , and other species which multiply in the warm and still waters . The forests harbor in great numbers those serpents of every form and figure , even to those monstrous boas , that are the terror of the natives themselves . " " But among the superior animals development seems to be arrested ; it is incomplete . The prevailing types are at the same time the inferior types . * * In the order of the Pachyderms , instead of the elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old world , the feeble and harmless tapir and peccary . In the ruminants , instead of the camel and the dromedary , the lama of the Andes , only half their size . Instead of the lordly lion of Africa , and the ferocious tiger of the Ganges , the ounce and the jaguars of the forests of Brazil , which are scarcely more than large cats . In the monkeys , finally , those with a prehensile tail , which are peculiar to America , are reckoned among the least perfect , the lowest of their order in the scale of organization . " . - p. 191 . We have quot&amp;d these passages from Prof. Guyot 's work because it was impossible for us otherwise to indicate the variety of independent facts which his striking and brilliant generalizations combine . The general characteristics of the continents , which he has indicated , seem to express almost with the ease and beauty of an algebraic formula , the results of an extended investigation . The vegetative and the animal life of both continents seem presented in a comprehensive symbol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be received with delight , and to impress itself permanently upon the memory . After delineating thus the physical structure of the Earth 's surface , and the peculiarities of organized nature consequent upon it , Prof. G. remarks U*Ofl the distribution of the human species over the globe . The same philosophic habit of thought here discloses itself , and develops some quite novel , and to us very interesting results . He presents , in two simple but well executed plates , the prominent varieties of the race . A careful study of these varieties in their geographical distribution , indicates an unexpected and gratifying result . Observation shows us that organized nature increases in the beauty and strength of its development as we approach the tropics . There the species of plants , insects , and birds , are most // numerous ; there each attains its highest perfection , till animal life assumes a near relation to the human form itself . The lower races improve in organization from the poles to the equator , with every increase of temperature , so as to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there the law fails . Man 's origin is not within the tropics ; and the man who is indigenous there , is of the humblest organization of his species . It appears conspicuously that the most perfect type of the human race is found in the region of the Caucasus . From the peculiar characteristics of this type , the others all depart , in different degrees , toward those which are inferior  --  the hue of the complexion becomes less varied and bea**tif**l , the symmetry of the form less elegant , and the development of intellect*ial , and even of physical vigor , inferior ; till in the extreme varieties man seems almost of a different species , a being who can scarcely claim relation to his more favored brother . Of the questions and speculations to which these diversities have given rise , our readers need not be informed . Suffice it to say , that by some the specific identity of the varieties has been denied altogether ; by others  --  and this seems the latest phase of that side of the question  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these races , is called in question ; while a host of speculators , from the author of the Vestiges to Theodore Parker and the Patent Office Commissioner  --  to whose merit as philosophers we have not time to do justice-stand ready to account for the origin of the race from the inferior tribes , with theories which it is not worth our while either to dispute or to detail . Prof. Guyot presents to our notice a fact bearing upon this subject , which he observes has not received from scientific observers the notice which it merits . As we depart from this center in any direction the types gradually lose their beauty , precisely in proportion . to their geographical remove . This principle is illustrated in a very striking manner . Commencing with a very ivi arked and beautiful face , drawn from a Circassian in the suite of the Persian Ambassador at Paris , and proceeding to the south , the author shows us a head evidently inferior , that of a well characterized Arab ; next he presents us a negro of Mozambique ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marks the extreme point of this descending scale . Again departing by a more western course , though still to the south , we have the European , the Algerian ALab , the Senegal chief and the Congo negro , exh ibitin* a similar series of departures from the primitive type . Eastward , the Mongolian , the Malay , and the New ilollander make up another well marked series ; while afourthchart , **47;823;TOOLONG latitudes of America . The fact that the races depart from their // finest type precisely as they are removed geographically from the spot where that type is found , is certainly full of important bearing upon the origin of these varieties . rllhe diversities however marked , and even extreme , seem all to stand in visible relation to a central type , precisely as the localities are grouped around the central locality . By the supposition of their original unity this fact is accounted for ; but we feel that no other theory offers any similar explanation of it . Mr. Guyot proceeds to show that the dispersion of the race from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth-place of man upon the Earth , could scarcely fail to be attended with deterioration . Removed to the sterile north , man n-inst deteriorate in the long struggle with nature for his hare subsistence ; while toward the tropics , he must be enervated by the abundance which nature supplies , and the temptations to a sensual and animal life which this abundance begets . Indeed , when undertaken with any thing less than the highest advantages , the mere process of emigration itself to an untamed portion of the earth , is one involving physical hdrdship and moral degradation . And on the other hand is it not amid the growth of those original moral influences , by which the Creator signalized the origin of man on the Earth , that his original status would be most probably preserved ? Atiother view of this subject we must quote in the author 's o'vu words . " Western Asia is not only the geographical center of the human race , but it is moreover the spiritual center ; it is the cradle of man 's moral nature . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most cultivated communities in the world regard as their dearest treasure , and every man who loves the true , acknowledges to be Truth itself ? Was it not there that the chosen people lived , to whom they yore given in trust to preserve for the world until the time appointed by Supreme Wisdom ? Was it not there that the Savior of all the members of the human family appeared , and the gospel of grace and liberty was preached in the lowly valleys of Judea-thatgospel which recognized neither Jew , nor Greek , nor Gentile , nor barbarian , and which invites all the races of the Earth to salvation without distinction ? Is it not from the height of that sacred mount where He died upon the cross for all , that Christ bids every human soul , whatever be the ephemeral form of its earthly covering , to a spiritual union which he will consummate in his glory ? And these great facts , gentlemen , interesting to every human being , these facts whose blessed consequences surround us on all sides at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any historical unbelief can ever strike out of the annals of mankind . " This direct reference to the spiritual nature and history of our race , as bearing upon just views of the origin of man , we quote with a very high degree of pleasure . Simple , appropriate , and commanding , as it undeniably is , some of our scientific reasoners upon this subject will probably be surprised that it should find a place in a purely scientific work , so entirely have faith and piety been severed often from speculations of this kind . We would not willingly cast a reproach upon science-it were a violence to all // our feelings to do so  --  but we are constrained to say that the most obvious characteristics of man 's moral nature , nay the very fact that he has a moral nature , have been forgotten in some of the speculations which have been suffered to pass for science among us , on this subject . All human history has been overlooked , and men speak with a coolness and readiness of belief which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby that the most numerous portion of mankind has positively no relation , by lineage or kindred , to the moral development over which Infinite wisdom has been watching from the first . Theories have been formed on this subject , not under pressure of resistless evidence , but freely and with no reluctance , which would not satisfy a rigid demand for proof , if the question were only between two analogous species of ruminants or of reptiles . Diversities which would not be inconsistent with the specific identity of two moles are allowed to build heaven high the barrier which is to separate forever two races of men . Differences between science and religion heretofore , have been such as bore with no peculiar weight upon the moral ties which bind man to his fellow over the wide earth . Science may occasionally have set her dicta in opposition to some accepted declaration of the Bible , but questions of the age of the world , or of the stability of the earth in the solar system , could not be alledged to possess any important bearing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether a black man or a red man is of the same species with him into whom originally God breathed the breath of life-whether the same blood , or some baser fluid flows in his veins-whether his nature is specifically the same with ours in its boundless wealth of thought and feeling and language-whether he has the same interest in the fall of Adam and the redemption of Christ , or is an utter stranger to the covenant of promise-whether his futurity is the glorious immortality of the redeemed children of the fall , or something allied , one knows not precisely how far , to the destiny of the beasts that perishthen other questions which touch the highest moral relations of men , are involved in the decision . To determine these , no ingenious theories of the distribution of animals over the globe *vil1 altogether suffice ; no petty difference in the number of teeth or of toes , even could such be pleaded , would avail to sever the ties in which every instructed conscience binds man to his fellow man . Any hasty adoption of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a topic , is very much to be deprecated for the sake of science itself . For science will become a reproach and an offense , if , instead of bearing meekly her high honors , she puts herself in conflict with those earnest and benevolent impulses in which the Christianity of the present age is seeking to develop a better brotherhood among men . Before those resistless im // pulses , all Jewish , all Grecian , all Roman philosophy went down twenty centuries ago ; and if we inquire the reason we find it in part given us by an Apostle in words which would seem not to have lost their application- " these be they which separate themselves . " We earnestly hope that scientific men will approach this subject in the most reverent and religious spirit ; no subject within their sphere can call for it more imperatively . If they proceed thus , we must abide the issue , and we are entirely prepared for it ; but if they fail to do this , science will inevitably expose itself to the reprobation of every right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epitaph will one day be written by some negro on the banks of the Niger , as he consigns its conclusions to that Miltonian limbo which it seems scarcely respectful to mention in such a connection . We honor Prof. Guyot , therefore , for the manliness with which he has held so high his religious faith , above any theories of science . Assuredly whoever does so will find that his science will grow up to be the support of his faith , to fill up whatever vacancy may lie between them . Beautiful as his work is in the breadth and force of its reasonings , it is yet more attractive to the instructed conscience and the enlightened soul , than it can be to the cultivated intellect alone . In no aspect is science so lovely as when acknowledging the high claims of humanity and religion ; and never can scientific investigation be so delightful , fascinating though it always is , as when the student is permitted to bring , from strange investigation through new fields , a thought which shall vindicate and honor that gospel which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth . " Our author 's view of the continents and their relation to the development of the animal races , is certainly in striking harmony with the recorded progress of man upon the earth . Man , originating in western Asia , removing thence to eastern Europe , and still with each westward movement gaining sonic new developmerit-this is the course of all history . There letters , however originated , first stimulated human thought ; then comes the noble Hebrew literature , next the refined and profound Greek , then the elegant and practical Latin , and still later the medireval and modern thought . Empire we need not describe in its march . But civilization has pursued the same path , originating in the same orient , so fruitful of all germs , developing itself in the same Europe , so genial in its stimulating influences ; moving still toward the west , and gathering some new element at each remove . First religion appears on the plains of Palestine ; next art , on the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome ; finally liberty , on Europe 's farthest west , where new elements are yet stingglin g to burst forth to find a home in a west yet more remote . // How marked in all history is the progress which the physical structure of the lands themselves seems adapted to secure . The process of origination once sufficiently matured on the plains of Asia , the races receive their development on the broken and varied shores of Europe ; and then in the fullness of time a new world is thrown open , fitted not to originate a finer type of manhood , not to afford a more genial development , but to furnish a field where all that distant climes have originated , and previous ages matured , may expand and multiply and accomplish its mission . This process through the past , our author traces tip to the point where , with a redundant population . and exhausted institutions , Europe pauses in her career . Then Providence lifts the curtain , another world comes into view , and the developed man and the domesticated animal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjugation of the new . We can not follow our author through all the beautiful detail into which he carries these views , lie shows that sitice here is to spring tip a more beneficent social state , it was to no mere adventurer that the possession of this continent could be granted , but to those only who sought here a home . Formed to accomplish a work , nay the work of the future , no ties of race or of nation must confine them . This is to be the universal home , where all Europe 's children are to work out in harmony the problem of the world 's next and better civilization . Conceding the justness of these views as our author develops them , we turn with a very deep and devotit interest to observe the hand of a divine providence in the distribution of the new world among the races of the old . Where nature is so luxuriant , and on so miiighty a scale , no single nation , no single race of men could hope successfully to encounter her . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and execute it according to their several capacities . National ambition must stimulate to rivalry , that Spain and France and Britain may hasten to fill its vacant and solitary valleys with btisy life of men . Africa too must send over her unxvilliug children , and those whom no allurement could entice to the scene , must be dragged hither by force , and pointed by the finger of authority to their contest with nature amid the cane-brakes of the southwest . This work tolerably well accomplished , an extremer vest begins to invite men ; and for that the teeming millions on the farther shore of the Pacific even now stand prepared . China shall send her laborious and patient children across a wider ocean to people valleys less inviting , and to extract a yet richer wealth from a more cheerless and forbidding soil . In vain may the " celestial sovereign , " the " sire of ten thousand years , " issue his ne excat , and seek to retain the poverty-stricken and famishing horde upon their insufficient shore . The almighty providence hath pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them now ; and the prohibition xviii prevent the transfer of nought but their religion and their institutions . While thus the various nations of Europe are contending with Asia and Africa for the possession of this ample and fair inheritance , it becomes a question of surpassing moment , to which of them shall it be given ? Who shall found these new corn monwealths ? Who bold the reins of control and direction over the mighty and rushing energies which are here to spring into life ? What institutions , what language , what literature , what religion , are to mold and sway this continent , itself so vast , and soon to be so powerful iu its influence over the rest ? It is not difficult to read the answer ; each shall do the work and exert the influence to which he is physically , intellectually , morally , and socially , competent . The African shall subdue the wide savannahs of the southwest , and tame the luxtiriant wildness of nature near his native tropics . Asia shall supply the mechanical ingenuity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newest west it ) tO the peaceful and attractive homes of civilized men . The peasantry of Europe , of whatever nation , trained only to frugalfly and toil , and aspiring to little else than such a destiny , shall spend their strength in reclaiming the soil , and developing its productiveness . The Irishman , evicted from the xvretched hovel where he was content to dwell , upon the border of starvation , shall smooth over hill and valley the path of trade and travel , and open communications from river to river . But these shall not give character to the language and thought of the new people , nor bring their unblessed institutions to expand and strengthen upon this virgin soil . rI*hese shall not found the seminaries which are to educate the people , nor fill the pulpits that are to instruct the land , nor in anywise stamp their moral likeness upon the generations of the future . The language of this nation is to be that which contains the literature of freedom , and of the gospel . Its institutions are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its literature , its religious faith , its expanding influence , these are to be given to the hands , scarcely less favored than was Israel of old , of those whom God prepared and tested in the fires of religious persectition two hundred years ago in England , then the freest and most religious of the nations . Raised up to develop these , her noblest children , she was afterwards hardened to expel them ; that their matured love of liberty and the gospel might find a more fitting home , take a purer and finer tone , and gain a wider influence over the nations in this land of promise , which the Lord their God bath given them to possess it . Whoever else may share its blessings with them  --  and those blessings are offered with magnanimous welcome to all-be he // Huguenot or Lutheran , or whatever else he may he must be joined in spirit to this " peculiar people . " For the rest , Providence is saying , and he that hath ears to hear let him hear it , " Strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alien shalt be your plowmen and your vine-dressers ; but ye shall be named the priests of the Lord-men shall call you the ministers of our God . " Like Israel of old , that race shall possess " great and goodly cities which he builded not , houses full of all good things which he filled not , wells digged which he digged not , and olive trees which he planted not , " and all that he enjoys , he , by virtue of his superior moral manhood , shall repay an hundredfold in the intelligence , freedom , and security , which he dispenses to all around him ; and in that hallowed type of piety for which he so freely bled , which he alone knows how to appreciate and to vindicate , and which it is his manifest destiny ' to perpetuate , and to extend among men . But it is by no private and personal right that he holds these privileges , and for no selfish and exclusive ends . If more than all others the Puritan is entrusted with command over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is because he has some better adaptation than others for that work , in his love of freedom and of God . In faithfulness to his high position , he is to evangelize and elevate the humbler races which God is here gathering at his feet . He is to plant in each fertile valley , which the toil of others reclaims from the wilderness , the sanctuaries of his earnest piety . He is to sanctify by his simple , rational , and scriptural faith , the powerful mental development of what is to be the earth 's greatest and freest people . Freely he has received , freely must he give , of all that can emancipate the soul from sin , and ally the earth to heaven and God . Accomplishing this work , his influence shall stream forth as wide through the earth , and as grateful to the nations , as the light of the morning . Then shall each inferior race learn according to its measure , whatever is valuable in the freedom and piety which bless this land ; and each shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh . ' Missionaries of every nation , here instructed to know the truth , shall bear it back again to the lands they left ; till Protestant Europe shall feel a new stimulus , and Catholic lands be traversed through all their extent by the heralds of a purer and more ancient Christianity . Africa 's children shall return to her degraded soil with the means of dignity and emancipation for her ; and the Asiatic shall find in the fresh civilization and the living piety of the present , the weapons with which to destroy those petrified systems that have been an incubus so long upon society there . Hence shall go forth each race that Providence leads hither , themselves here enlightened and made free , to bear freedom and light to older lands , till they shall become the heritage alike , of all . // Nor is this the end of these beneficent reciprocations . Man , in his finest moral and social type , coming into conflict here with the grandest development of nature , engages in a struggle which Will task his energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor by such sustained exertion . Called to adapt each beneficent institution of the past to the exigencies of a new condition , called to form fresh organizations for exertion , and devi*e new safeguards for liberty and happiness , he will produce by . his efforts more efficient forms of law , of polity , and of faith . Institutions breathing more of the spirit of freedom and fraternity , will return to repay our debt to society in the old world . The church unfettered here by bondage to the state will claim there too her freedom . Governments will learn from our endeavor and our success , how much wiser and safer it is to govern the people for their own welfare than for the petty interests of a class . Institutions will spring up among us recognizing rights which the Magna Charta did not assert , nor the habeas corpus secure , to be propagated where these time honored safeguards of liberty had their birth . Constitutions that will secure coming generations from marauding ministers of finance , and demolish patents of monopoly against which never parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remove mountains of taxation , will be among the births of our future ; and , devised and tested amid our freedom , they will become the securities of a better liberty in the world 's older civilization . But we must not prolong our remarks . We have wished chiefly to exhibit Prof. Guyot 's labors to the public eye , and to contribute our influence to place him in his just position in public esteem . This volume promises a series of books of instruction from his pen , for which we shall look with much interest and hope . Meanwhile we perceive that the University Regents of the State of New York have secured his services temporarily for the arrangement of the very complete system of meteorological observations now organizing over that great state . A glance ( which has been kindly permitted us in advance of its publication ) at the Report of Prof. G. to that body , affords evidence of the thorough character and scientific value which through his agency those observations will be made to possess .
