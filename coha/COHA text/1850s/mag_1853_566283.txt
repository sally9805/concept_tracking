txt ART . 11. - FASHION IN RELIGION . Memorials of Christian Life , in the Early and Middle Ages . Including his " Light in Darkness . " By Dr. AuGusTus NEANDER . Translated from the German . By J. E. RYLAND . London : Henry G. Bohn , 1852 . WE can not but regard with favor , the circulation of this admirable book . It is full of historical pictures , representing Christian life as it clearly ought to be , and as it was prior to the degeneracy which it early suffered by forming alliances with the world . These pictures portray the beauty of genuine Christianity . They illustrate the virtues , domestic and social , which were the natural and ordinary growth of piety , so long as the personal influence of Christ and of his apostles was felt . The book contains also graphic sketches of the lives of heroic Christian men who stood manfully for the truth and purity of religion , during the centuries subsequent to this early period , after Christianity had become greatly corrupted , even down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men and missions by which Ireland , England , and Central Europe were visited with Evangelical influences from the time of Patrick , patron Saint of the Celtic people , down to the fourteenth century , is a fine exhibition of the spirit that should animate the missionary at the present day . It is an eloquent exhibition of the self-sacrificing philanthropy and heroic faith which , not missionaries alone should cherish , but equally those who send them , Christians in every walk of life . He who can rise from its perusal without being quickened in his missionary spirit , and quickened in // every Christian grace , must have wandered nearly beyond the sphere of the Saviour 's attraction . He can not fail at least to gather from it this lesson , that whatever degeneracy Christianity suffered by the growth of Hierarchy , and other causes , however far it departed , from a true spiritual worship , and a true spiritual life , yet wherever and whenever it was left to develop itself freely in auspicious circumstances , it elevated and adorned the character ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redeemer ; it produced an earnest assiduity in doing good . In reading this volume we naturally inquire why it is , that Christians at the present day illustrate these virtues no more frequently and eminently ? Doubtless a variety of agencies contribute to deteriorate modern Christianity , to impede its progress and depress the character of its developments . One of these we propose to consider in the present article-we refer to Fashion . In accuracy of conception , a fashionable Christianity is no Christianity at all . The element of Fashion , however , may assume such prominence in circles professedly Christian , as to justify the application of this epithet to their religion . There is actually in some circles of Christian society , such an approximation to it , and in others such eager and unscrupulous aspiration after it , as to demand the attention of the friends of spiritual Christianity . There are bearings of this subject on the salvation of the world , especially on the interests of Protestantism and of Religious liberty , too vital to be disregarded by those who are set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , acquainted with the history of Puritanism , how it set up the pillars of our cherished institutions , what obstacles it encountered , and how at length it worked itself clear of the last vestige of ecclesiastical tyranny , imported with it from the Old world , will not deem it quite worth while to survey whatever currents of influence are imperiling his dearest interests ; imperiling the purity and progress of spiritual Christianity , indeed religious liberty itself ? Among these none is more mighty and dangerous than that of fashion . Every increment of wealth contributes to swell this current , and will do so , unless the piety of the country demonstrate that wealth has a far more rational and religious channel to flow in than that of ostentation and arrogance . Certainly wealth may be put to better uses than to carry on a rivalry in extravagant and luxurious living . Certainly by the votaries of a religion whose fundamental mandate is " deny thyself and take thy cross , " it should be put to a better use . We need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fashion . But we must first fix the standard of true Christianity , for our criterion and measure of what , especially in the higher circles , arrogates this sacred name . We must taste the sweet water of life just as it flows from the fountain , that we may better judge how excessively adulterated is that which too frequently is offered in its stead . What then is the only worthy conception of Christianity , as a power and principle intended to penetrate and fill social life ? We draw our reply not from the Bible alone , but from the volume before us . The conception formed by the early Christians was in our view the true conception . To represent it they borrowed the imagery of the military oath and discipline . Christians were the soldiers of Christ , bound to him by solemn oath and pledged to the most unhesitating obedience , to the hardships and conflicts of the military calling . They took also the scriptural images of the priesthood and of the family relation . As priests unto God they felt the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the obligation to obedience and love , both to him and to one another . Their conception of the Christian life we may also learn from the emblems of which they made much use . A favorite one was the emblem of the shepherd carrying a lamb on his shoulder . This , often seen on their goblets , was expressive of their gratitude to the Redeemer who thus rescued them . Another was a dove , symbol of the Holy Spirit ; another a ship sailing towards Heaven , to represent the Christian Church ; another a lyre to signify joy in the Holy Spirit , or the Christian living to the praise of God ; another an anchor , or the Christian hope entering within the veil . In these images , says Neander , with which Christians were most familiar , we perceive the direction of their thoughts to heaven , their childlike love to the Redeemer , and their consciousness that they could do nothing of themselves , but were indebted to him for everything . In delineating the Christian life of the early centuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as follows : " Christians are not separated from other men by countries , nor by language , nor by customs . * * * With regard to dress and food and other matters of every day life , they follow the customs of the country , yet they show a peculiarity of conduct wonderful and striking to all . They dwell in their own native land as sojourners . They take a part in everything as citizens , and yet endure all things as if strangers . Every foreign country is as a father-land , and every father-land as a foreign country . * * * They live in the flesh , but not according to the flesh . They pass their time on earth , hut they are citizens of heaven . They obey the established laws , and yet raise themselves above the laws by their lives . They love all , and are persecuted by all . " We thus gain a tolerable conception of the piety of primitive Christians . How simple and yet earnest ! This will be still // more apparent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we glance also at the simplicity of their worship , and at the sympathy and care bestowed by them upon the poor . Worshiping by the river side as at Philippi , or in the great Temple of Jehovah garnished by the glory of those " immortal lights that live along the sky , " or in dismal catacombs , or in the unadorned Basilica , the forms of their devotion were of the most simple kind . Despising the luxury and voluptuousness of the rich , they equally shunned the arrogant ostentation of the titled and great . Content they were to love one another with a pure heart , and worship together with prayers , scriptural readings , and spiritual songs . To doing good as they had opportunity they were equally devoted . This will appear from the sympathy and care they bestowed on the poor and the sick . The duty of providing for their poorer brethren , says Coleman , was not left to the gratuities of private individuals , but devolved on the whole community . Nor was it regarded as a burden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentions to this labor of love that they made the light of their liberality so shine as to command the admiration of the cold and selfish heathens around them . It was their custom to bring under public notice the case of a brother or sister , in necessitous circumstances , arid a donation was forthwith ordered out of the funds of the church , funds which the voluntary contributions of the faithful supplied . The care of the sick was delegated to the female members , and worthily was this pious office filled . Every moment that could be spared from the prior claims of their own households was by the Christian matrons devoted to errands of mercy . They listened to the widow 's tale ; they visited the aged in their hut of poverty ; they sat by the bedside of the afflicted , and those that were ready to die . And though moving themselves amid the comforts of domestic life , some of them ladies of the highest rank , not inured to labor , they scrupled not to perform the meanest and most servile offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety . Beautiful the characters thus moulded by Christianity in the early centuries . They illustrate what it is in its appropriate developments ,  --  what type of character it was wont to develop when Bible precepts rung freshly in the ears of the faithful , when the influence of Christ and his apostles yet lingered in its power over the disciples , and ere the fashion of this world had first allured , and then , grown proud and potent , driven the faithful astray . They may accordingly be taken to illustrate what Christianity ought forever to be , in its social developments . They may furnish us with our conception or ideal , with our // standard or criterion for estimating the Christianity of the present time as developed in circles of factitious and fashionable life . We are now to determine , if possible , what departure from this meridian of the cross , this ideal of Christianity , has been made by modern churches ; especially by those which are most exposed to the influence of wealth and fashion . We are to ascertain whether Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired with sentiments , kindred to those which we have seen belong to Christianity , and characterized the early disciples ; whether they still cherish such mutual love , perform such philanthropic services , addict themselves to such ministries of charity , despise in like manner the mandates of fashion and the barriers of social caste , whenever interfering with the natural development of Christian life in the soul . Or whether they have not , to a deplorable degree , bowed their necks to the yoke of a despotism , which is no less a foe to the real elevation of society , than to true religion . And here it may be well to remark , in passing , that Christianity has nothing to apprehend from true refinement ; a refinement that consists in a cultivated condition of the mind , the taste , the manners and the heart ; a refinement that measures men by their intelligence and character rather than by their dress , or by their pecuniary condition ; a refinement that is independent enough to accord , to whatever individual , the consideration to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is above despising honest labor , above neglecting or wounding the feelings of true merit , even in the humblest walks of life . Such a refinement will neither degrade nor impede Christianity . On the contrary , it is its appropriate fruit . It thrives best in a sanctified heart , adorning the individual , and ennobling society . There is , however , another and very different idea of refinement abroad in the community . It is this which has wrought the evil we are contemplating as prevalent in the church . It is this which , like the secret power of a magnet , has been attracting Christians toward the world , which has erected a false standard of Christian duty and character , which is impeding and imperiling the salvation of the world , leading off Christianity like a wandering star , into the unillumined regions , the frost arid death of a returnless distance from the Sun of Righteousness . Hollow itself as the sepulchre , and equally moving disgust , heartless , selfish , and enslaved , professing and not practicing , seeming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while // honoring much that merits only to be despised , it is destitute of a single redeeming feature . The indications of what is thus , by a sad misnomer , termed refinement , are numerous ; we are sorry to add , extensive too , even among nominal Christians . We shall , of course , do nothing to countenance such a use of so good a term as refinement . A more appropriate name by far would be vassalage to fashion . That to which we refer is indeed little else . And this will appear , we think , when some of those indications and fruits of it to which we have adverted are adduced . Wherever it gains foothold , it penetrates and pervades the social and religious life of the individual . And so it has come to pass that we have a type of piety , especially in the upper ranks of society , immensely differing from that of the primitive Christians , a type which , however it find currency and favor with fallen humanity , will at once be condemned as counterfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meek and lowly in heart . How extensively is it advertised in the personal dress and bearing of many a Christian professor ! Instead of naturalness of manner , what artificiality ; instead of gentleness and simplicity , what assumption , arrogance , and ostentation ! Instead of sincerity , what duplicity and selfishness ; instead of honest friendship , what hollow profession ! A few changes , rung upon select expressions , caught from the truly cultured and Christian , a factitious and effeminate manner of life , an exhibition of extravagant expenditure in style of living ,  --  upon this small capital , what numbers , even in the church , undertake to carry on the business of mnking a display , audaciously arrogating to themselves the consideration , which , however due to real refinement of feeling and character , is not due to polished language and polite manner alone . By their fruits this class may readily be known . In the matter of dress , they do not follow fashion , but lead it ; they do not regard so much comfort and good taste as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in social circles , and in the sanctuary , so much to receive and impart benefit , as to exhibit a new or rich attire . How many , and their number is yearly augmenting , continually advertise their vanity by their airs , demonstrating that they have not the reality of refinement , but only the pitiful resemblance ! These of course must be catalogued with our specimens of " fashionable " Christianity . Another particular indication appears in the domestic life of the votaries of fashion . When , for example , the effeminacy of professedly Christian parents has reached a point at which no trouble can be endured , when pride has inflated them with false // notions of dignity , so that labor is despised as degrading , when in order to avoid the trouble and toil they commit their infant children to hireling domestics , to obtain from this source , not simply the care which infancy requires , but also their earliest ideas of religion , and to imbibe the superstitious notions and deceitful ways of ignorant , priest-ridden papists ; when they so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive an affection for these hirelings beyond what is , or naturally would be felt for a mother who has thus sundered the cord of love by which she might have drawn her little ones to the Saviour , and lost by the decay of a natural affection , whose instincts have been so cruelly outraged , and by the decay of a piety whose promptings have been so repressed , all disposition to draw them thither ; when the domestic life and training of any class of society is like this , mothers so indolent and effeminate , so addicted to gayety and enslaved to fashion as to stanch the outflow of maternal tenderness in themselves , and the outflow of filial affection in their children ; when it is found that these mothers are more fearful of the frown of the fashionable , than of the frown of God , more shocked at a fancied vulgarity than at sin , and throw such an atmosphere of intense worldliness about their homes as to destroy in unnumbered instances the souls of their children ; shall they not be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term fashionable is more appropriate than any other ? How many originals of such a picture may be found in the circles of wealth ! Who can regard them as illustrating loyalty to Christ ? Is it not rather loyalty to fashion ? If it have received the baptism of a nominal piety , that of the spirit it can hardly have known . But let us pass beyond the confines of the nursery . What intellectual and moral influences will this counterfeit Christianity throw subsequently around it ? Transferred from the nurse to the governess , by what an atmosphere is the child now enveloped ? Do the most essential qualifications of the hired teacher embrace a knowledge of God ? Do the most essential duties relate at all to the heart and character , or to mind and manners alone ? Why are the public school , the boarding school , and even the Sabbath school , avoided ? Why , except lest the model child come into contact with the children of poorer classes ? And what are the instructions , if any , which it receives directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , not the laws of God , but the lessons and laws of the fashionable code . There is something about teaching even religion which is felt to savor so much of drudgery , and to be so unfashionable , that , although they are professedly // Christian , they must be excused from attempting it . And so the unfortunate child advances toward maturity , breathing an atmosphere charged with sickly elements , educated to regard high social position as the chief good , and the rules of religion as quite secondary to those of polite society . What a departure from the standard of the early Christians ! How unlike the mothers of Gregory Nazianzen , Chrysostom , Augustin , and Theodoret ! low unlike Eunice , and Lois , and Hannah , of scriptural times " Christian mothers , " says Neander , in his life of Chrysostom , " animated by the spirit of the Gospel , sacrificed the ruling passions of their sex to a life of retirement within the bosom of their families ; meritoriously exerted themselves in the education of their sons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tender years from the contamination of surrounding vice. ** It is not denied that mothers of this sort are to be found at the present day . They are , however , it is believed , particularly rare in what are termed fashionable families . In these , so far from influences like those which , by the pious mothers of Antioch , were thrown around the juvenile mind in its development ; so far from influences adapted to form it to purity and noble principles , and then , on these as a foundation , to a cultivated taste , elegant manners , and refined sensibilities , we discover influences which directly reverse this order . We have those which exalt a polished speech and bearing to the first importance , which exalt wealth as though it were the chief good , which enjoin the sacrifice of everything to appearances , educate the love of display into a master-passion , deem obedience to fashionable usage a sacred duty on no account to be violated , convert Christian dwellings into mere show-houses , and Christian professors into mere showmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus form character to a soft and silky selfishness . But if the existence of a " fashionable " type of Christianity is , to any extent , apparent from this view of domestic life and training among the higher circles of wealth , so is it from a view of their social life . Do we not see lines of social distinction run through the community other than those which indicate intellectual and moral worth ? What can true Christians have to do with this ? Is it compatible with a self-denying , meek , and lowly heart ? Will Christians at all enter the scramble of social caste ? Will they catch the inspiration of arrogant exclusiveness , and pay deference to the uncultured and coarse , because forsooth glossed with satin , and glittering with gold , // while at the same time treating disdainfully the intelligent and good , because clad in vile raiment and living in hired chambers ? Will they fail to recognize as a brother each fellow believer , however illiterate and poor , whatever his color and apparel ? Will they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for themselves , and to cause their sympathy , kindness , and honest respect to flow forth toward him ? Will their hands be opened for every luxury and ornament , while shut against the charities of the Lord ? Will Christians suffer fashionable usage to control their observance , or rather non-observance , of the Sabbath ? Feasting themselves into stupor , will they rob God of a moiety of his sanctuary worship , or allow a degree of effeminacy which is wearied out by the morning 's services , and must have repose in the afternoon ? Will they allow a style of dress , and an arrangement of hours in social gatherings which can not but affect injuriously their health , or a style of living , extravagant beyond their r*sources , leaving nothing for a deserving child of want , and for the sacred enterprises of philanthi-ophy , and destined possibly to end in bankruptcy , if not in fraud ? Will they surrender themselves to romance and gossip , gayety and amusement , the ball-room and the opera , wasting in aimless existence godlike capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their equals , to the glad flow of social life ? Admitting this to be possible , what shall we say of such a Christianity ? Certainly its distinctive epithet should be the term fashionable , rather than true . But , in this examination , we must also survey the religious life of circles of fashion . There exists indeed , between the view already taken and that to which we now turn , a relation so intimate that whatever facts bear on any single aspect of the subject , bear upon all . For this reason a few remarks on the exclusively religious and ecclesiastical bearings of fashionable life , will be presented . When those who profess a supreme loyalty to God , exemplify absolute vassalage to conventional rules in respect to dress and manner of life , honoring individuals for distinctions that are independent of moral worth as well as of intellectual and esthetic culture , and not honoring " all men ; " when they neglect and wound their poorer and humbler fellow believers , carrying even into the sacred presence of the Maker of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their exclusiveness , they will not suffei- the door keeper in the House of God to introduce into their pew a sti-anger in humbl.e apparel ; when they clamor for opera music in the sanctuary , and for popular oratory , beauty , grace of manner , imagination , and poetry , rather than piety in the pulpit ; when , preferring these // things to sound doctrine , they are impatient of plain dealing with souls on their way to a day of doom , reexhibiting precisely what was rebuked by the Apostle James ; in short , when religious worship is rated according to its stateliness , and individuals according to their dress , their equipage and the price of their pew , shall we not accept the obvious conclusion , viz : that Christianity has received into its bosom the element of fashion , and come sadly under its control ? But this conclusion will become still more undeniable , if we consider facts like the following . Not seldom are Christian pastors thrown aside by the Churches when their only crime is a few gray hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the highest demand whose only recommendations are a sonorous voice , polished manner , and powerful imagination ; men who , so far from preaching , praying , and pleading with sinners to be reconciled to God as becomes an ambassador of God , so far from unfolding his whole counsel and leveling at men 's consciences the great truths of immortality and retribution , select for Sabbath themes those which are appropriate rather to week day occasions , or to a literary magazine , than to the pulpit . Not seldom , especially in our large cities , preachers so far prostitute their characters , and the sacreAllness of their profession , as to cater to a depraved taste of this sort . Some there are who rarely pass a month of professional labor without a flourish of trumpets in the advertisements of the daily press , announcing strange themes , whose nbvelty , and incongruity perhaps with the place and the occasion , constitute the main element of their attractiveness . What better is this than borrowing the artifices of business and politics ? What but religious wire-pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some portions of the religious world by fashion . Why indeed is there any temptation to a resort like this ? We can not say less than that it is a prostitution of the pulpit . It is unworthy of the sacred profession , a development of Christianity of which the term fashionable is a better descriptive epithet than scriptural , since , in common with the ordinary indications of obsequiousness to fashion , it despises the substance while pursuing the shadow , chooses the glittering bauble while it contemns solid gold . We come now to present our views as to the origin and causes of this degenerate type of piety . This we shall do in a single paragraph , content with little more than naming them and leaving the subject to the contemplation of our readers . Some agency is doubtless exerted by the example of superficiality and formalism in religion constantly before our American public-an // example which they see in the myriads of nominal Christians from countries of the old world whose Christianity is little else than formalism-an example which numbers , from the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by all classes , in those * travels , and which is beheld rejecting the faith of our hierarchical " Dissenters , " who , Puritan fathers , have imported and adopted the forms and liturgies of foreign Churches . This example is everywhere patent and powerful . But a far mightier agency is attributable to that depraved conditron of humanity to which it appeals . Depraved humanity is marked by excessive vanity and pride , by sloth and various selfishness , just the qualities which prompt it to enlist in the train and accept the yoke of fashion and form . A third agency is apparent in the great accumulation of individual wealth , resulting from the general prosperity of the country , and the immense influx of the precious metals . Wealth , unless intelligence and piety keep pace with its accumulation , will urge its possessor toward effeminacy , vanity , ostentation , and exclusiveness in social life , as also toward formalism and fashion in what appertains to religion . It places an incubus on the soul ; it urges the growth of natural , depraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depraved habits , by supplying ample means for the indulgence of every craving . And then lastly , if we consider that a Christian , in proportion to his conformity to the world , loses the disposition to cultivate the spiritual element in worship and religion , the disposition to enliven with it all his forms of devotion ; if we consider that , in just this proportion , he is rebuked by the spirit of Christianity , and accordingly prefers not to enter its presence , but rather to seek for something which , in the garb and name of religion , will quiet his religious instincts , so far from wondering that there is to some extent a " fashionable " Christianity even in the land of the Puritans , we shall wonder that there is no more . Dismissing then at this point our brief notice of the origin and causes of this type of religious development , we take up , to discuss more at length , the evils which result from it . A late eminent writer , whose life , passed among the circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had brought him much in contact with the elegant manners , cultivated taste , and Christian benevolence of true refinement , has thus expressed his views in regard to the mischievous agency of Fashion , whether in the church or out of it . " I should be sorry to see the laboring class turned into men and women of Lashion . Fashion is a poor vocation . Its creed , that idleness is a privilege and work a disgrace , is among the deadliest errors . Without depth of thought , or earnestness of // feeling , or strength of purpose , living an unreal life , sacrificing substance to show , substituting the factitious for the natural , mistaking a crowd for society , finding its chief pleasure in ridicule and exhausting its ingenuity in expedients for killing time , fashion is among the last influences under which a human being who respects himself , or who comprehends the great end of life would desire to be placed . " In its personal bearings , whether on a Christian or on other individuals , the dominion of fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It prevents the free expansion of the soul . It reduces the indi*iidual to a condition of slavery , binds him a lire-long apprentice to the trade of making a display , a vassal to the usage of the fashionable . Nothing like a manly independence is possible . or course he will suffer the natural consequences of such a bondage . His faculties will achieve but a distorted , diminished expansion . He can not think independently on questions , social , moral , and religious ; thererore he can not think well , and will not think to any good purpose . He can not act freely , and therefore will not act manfully . Freedom is necessary to variety , and this variety to the exercise and discipline of the mental powers , a process essential to intellectual development . The mere vassal or fashion is nothing but an imitator . In the items of dress and furniture , for example , not the fashionable consumei , but the pattern-maker and manufacturer gain whatever intellectual discipline the procurement of these things may involve , while in matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious sympathy , not those who take their cue from fashionable life will reap the benefit of original , independent examination and decision , but those whose minds in these particulars bow not to man but God . And this suggests another thought in relation to these deplorable personal bearings of fashionable religion , if it operates thus injuriously on intellectual development , so likewise on the heart and character . What observer of the usages and maxims of the higher circles of fashion can for a moment hesitate to acknowledge this ? What Christian can encounter the influences he is sure to meet in these circles , especially can live in the midst of them , yield habitually to them , acknowledge and advocate them , without deep injury to his whole character ? What , indeed , are some of the influences that will surround him here ? Let us see whether the malaria of this moral atmosphere is likely to piove harmless . Is there nothing in the social life in which he moves hostile , for example , to the sacredness of truth , nothing fitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanctity of truth may be found among all classes . Certainly there is much in the hardships even of the Christian poor , to ply them with temptations to // deceive . Still it can not , we apprehend , be said that the very genius of their social position so powerfully favors duplicity and deception as that which rules in the factitious life of the vassals of fashion . Their whole fabric is based upon the false assumption that things are what they seem . Their fundamental maxim , if it may be so called , is to place appearances above realities , and maintain them at all hazards . They recognize , at the outset , a false standard of social consideration . Discarding practically intellectual and esthetic culture and moral worth , as their basis , they rate an individual according to his jiroperty and style of living . They employ their ingenuity to convey to others an idea of their wealth , familiarity with good society , with the proprieties of elegant refinement , of their freedom from the cares and drudgery of life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , or at least accordant with the punctilios of rigid etiquette , beyond what they know to be true . Characteristic doubtless , not a little , of every social class , this elaborate deceit is yet a more prevalent evil in that to which we particularly refer . As a personal and domestic evil , how often this sacrifice of truth finds illustration in the homes of the fashionable ! The domestic is instructed by the lady of the house to say to an unwelcome caller , that she is not at home , that she is indisposed , or engaged , neither of which , perhaps , is true . Not rarely is this done . Nay , it has almost risen in some circles to the dignity of an established custom . What , now , must be the influence of such a habit ? What on the lady herself , whose only apology is her undress , the disorder of her rooms , or her desire for quiet ? What on the domestics , what on the children ? Is the sanctity of truth in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimation and habits of the entire domestic circle ? Nor will the unhealthy , moral influence of a single usage like this affect the domestic circle , simply in lowering their regard for truth , and loosening their practice in respect to it , but it will extend to their whole character . But further . How can fashion set up a false basis of social consideration , without exerting a deplorable influence both on the individual and on the family ! How compel the honoring and treating of individuals according to a standard of distinction , independent of true merit , if not repugnant to it , without working moral deterioration ! How foster a spirit of exclusiveness without fostering pride ; how separate society into castes without raising the spirit of caste , a spirit utterly opposed to the spirit of Christ ! And with this spirit , how many evil passions are excited , which , scarce by any possibility , can be quelled . // 184 Fashion in Religion . That these passions are excited is no marvel . For whatever exalts property , apparel , equipage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , industrial , and religious , whatever denies , or fails to recognize the dignity of labor , and the true elevation of a virtuous and cultured soul , offers an insult to humanity . It throws fire brands all abroad . Alienating man from his brother , it inspires him with envy , jealousy , ill will . It arrays the higher and lower classes in mutual antipathy , not to say antagonism , setting the rich in the attitude of arrogant exclusivenes* toward the poor , and the poor in reciprocated hostility toward the rich . In short , it engenders the worst passions of our nature , passions which agitate and convulse society , and , when so produced , fosters and urges their growth . What now must be the mischief effected by an element which thus operates ? Is it surprising that it should desolate , in so many instances , the homes where it has been suffered to dwell ? If it undermine the principle of strict veracity , and compel to the adoption of a standard of social consideration at which every principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster pride , vanity , and various evil passions in the parents , as the centre of home influences , and from them , by example , by perceived sympathy and instruction , propagate them through the circle of the household , what is it but a dangerous corrupter ? Among the evil passions , thus fostered and propagated , let the following receive a moment 's attention . The whole genius of modern fashionable life is intensely selfish . No individual can accept the unwritten code of its laws , without becoming selfish beyond the ordinary standard . No parent can put on the yoke of Fashion without becoming effeminate and vain , and by uniform , if not necessary consequence , selfish . Of course the selfish element is developed in all characters , and seen in all domestic circles , not however equally . In some it is repressed , in others suffered to attain a natural growth in the character of each member ! In others actually , though doubtless unintentionally , cultivated ! And what we now advance is the opinion , that servility to Fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode in which it operates to do this , it would not be difficult to exhibit . Enough to say , however , that by training one 's self and others to sacrifice the internal to the external , that is , the intellectual and religious to voluptuousness and display , the equilibrium of the moral nature is lost . As appearances take rank above reality , so comfort takes precedence of conscience . Selfishness is the resultant of the various forces which play upon and around the heart of the votary of // Fashion . The whole domestic circle comes under the influence of Lord Chesterfield 's school of manners , of which duplicity and selfishness are the essence . If we recur to observation , our remark , on this point , seems to find ample corroboration . Whoever goes in search of the most exemplary families , where mutual affection and emulous kindness sweeten all domestic life , seeks them not in the higher circles of fashion . Whoever goes in search of the most self-denying and philanthropic citizens , our munificent donors to objects of public charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there a noble exception , in these circles . He goes rather to those whose claims to social consideration rest on intelligence and piety , which , when united together , and adorned by a self-sacrificing liberality , constitute the highest type of society . Next to this selfish element , whose baneful operation on individual character and domestic life is enough apparent , may be mentioned the evils which relate to intellectual and moral training . What mischief results from the misconception into which even Christians , who have become servile to fashion , too generally fall in regard to education ! What mischief from the consequent misdirection of their own faculties , which should be gathering force with every passing year from observation , business , and books ? What mischief in the misdirection of the faculties of their children ? Think of accomplishments exalted above substantials in intellectual culture , while the moral nature is left to develop itself as it may ! To shine is deemed of more importance than to act , to seem than to be . Accordingly , instead of being educated under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view the soul 's salvation is deemed of paramount importance , or in schools distinguished for their successful development of the intellectual powers , giving force of thought , and uplifting the soul in all that constitutes true elevation , they are sent to institutions which expend their strength upon mere accomplishments . As if the builder should paint his timbers , unhewn and unframed , even the bark unremoved ! As if mahogany and rosewood , unsawn and unshaped , should be smoothed and varnished in the log ! Who is ignorant of the fact , that under the influence which we are considering , many parents disregard almost entirely the moral and religious atmosphere of a seminary , where they think to place their children ? They place them , it may be , in a Roman Catholic institution , or in one where every serious thought will be expelled , elegance of manner and of diction , with proficiency in other accomplishments , take rank above godliness , nay , occupy the mind , and engross the heart to the exclusion of religion altogether . How // many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandates of fashionable life , as to fall into this error and sin , have mourned at the last , perhaps when sorrow was unavailing , perhaps amid the reproaches of their offspring , agonized , as they sink into an early grave , by the remorse of a misspent life . In our notice of the evils of fashionable - Christianity , in their personal and domestic bearings , we shall present but one thought more . The supremaqy of Fashion , fostering as it does , instead of frowning on selfishness , and generating the cold atmosphere of ceremony , freezes all domestic life . From the head of the family to the footman and domestic , not an individual but is heavily taxed in the item of his personal happiness . Every action , word , habit , alike at table , by the fireside , and in the parlor , indeed every thought , every genial outburst of emotion , must pass through the freezing mixture of ceremony ere it find expression . Just as if nature could brook this restraint . Just as if the comfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed . In their very nature they can not endure such a tyranny . They perish beneath it . They must have leave to bubble up as freely and naturally as the waterspring . But fashionable life denies them this . It puts the straitjacket of the madman upon the child , that with ardent , affectionate nature , is prompted to embrace its parent , sister , brother , unseasonably , and in violation of rigid etiquette . It carries this despotism , indeed , into all the retirement of domestic life , lest what is contraband in circles of high fashion , allowed there , should peradventure break in at other times and in other places . This bane of home , of course , operates wherever a family is enslaved to fashion , though we are contemplating its influence particularly in Christian households . Thus viewed , indeed , it appears the more deplorable , since these are the places , which , by the suppression of selfishness , and the culture of self-forgetful kindness and affection , ought to be the fittest types of heaven . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presented by these fashionable homes . Homes ? They merit no such sacred name .. They are homes just as much as a corpse is a living body , or a marble statue a breathing man . No , indeed . A serpent has bitten and poisoned whatever deserved a name so dear . Ceremony has coiled around the dwelling , and crushed out the genial life of what had else perhaps been indeed a home . We have not thus far in contemplating the evils of fashionable Christianity , these personal and domestic evils , spoken of the sin which it involves . Of course this is the crowning evil . No such alliance of Christianity with fashion , no such servility of the former to the latter , can exist without sin8 So that we // might have well illustrated our present point , by confining ourselves to this single view . To think of one great sin , allowed in a Christian household , nay , advocated and enjoined , not indeed consciously perhaps , but by example and by l ) recePt , from which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the mischief of a course like this be over-estimated ? In regard to the evils of this type of Christianity in their social bearings , our limits forbid enlargement . The topic however is a fruitful one . We shall dismiss it with a paragraph or two . Evidently what has been said , under the former topic , bears also upon the present . For the individual and the home are the centre of society , of the nation . To pollute the fountain is to pollute the stream . So here the evils of fashionable Christianity , felt primarily on personal and domestic character and habits , flow directly through the social system . Social influences take their direction from those of home . It will not surprise us therefore to find that if , under the evil influences before us1 the individual suffer in regard to a healthy moral development , if his character take a lower grade in virtue and self-denying philanthrophy , society must reap its portion of the evil . Its own intellectual development is of course proportioned to the development of the individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If again the individual and family , ad*nitting the supremacy of fashion , relinquish personal and domestic independence , this will operate to dethrone religion , and put fashion in its place ; if they accept the unwritten code of popular usage , parents allowing their children no liberty of opinion and of practice in regard to its demands , the spirit of intolerance ) thus fostered , must become rife , outside of the circle of the family . So indeed we find it ; they , who , fearing the frown of the fashionable , scarce dare affirm that their souls are their own , allow in turn no independence in others . This leads to detraction and denunciation . They are like the subordinate ranks in the scale of Russian or Turkish despotism , each being the slave of all its superiors , and the tyrants of all below it . And this intolerance , growing out of vanity and pride , shields the soul from every influence which militates against the cherished practices of the fashionable . Christian professor or not , what to him are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the opinions of the poor minister ! Let him know his place , nor dare repeat such audacity . What docility , what humility , what spiritual improvement , what salutary social influence will be attained in such circumstances ? And then there are the alienations , jealousies , rivalries , extravagances , and detraction , which not confined to rival circles in // the higher classes , extend also through every social caste . Christians can not enlist in circles of fashionable life without a participation in these social evils , flow natural for the successful aspirant , now on the topmost round of the social ladder , to become inflated with the spirit of arrogant exclusiveness ! Equally natural is it for his unsuccessful competitors to become filled with envy , and fall into a carping mood alike reprehensible . Society is full of slander , even Christian society , of which no small part of the social evil and sin is attributable to the spirit of fashion . Indeed , with human nature as it is , to insult humanity by recognizing social distinctions , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pious , benevolent disposition , will of course inflame the bad passions of the heart , acting and reacting through society to multiply mischief . It is scarcely necessary , after what has been presented , to advert to the agitation and upheaving of the social forces , as a third social evil , resulting from the cause now under consideration . Society is convulsed ; her forces are , apparently at times marshaling for combat . For , when we consider the supercilious attitude of fashionable exclusives toward the poor , we can not wonder that this latter class in turn become unreasonable in their spirit of hostility and complaint . What an evil , what a sin ! Happy if the church had not already become largely represented in both these alienated classes . Happy if there were no allowed and cherished servility to fashion , operating to augment this evil ! How does Christianity frown upon a social attitude like this ! How does it enjoin the meekness and gentleness of the master , his lowliness of heart , his genial philanthropy , his assiduous effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rich and the poor , that the Most High is the Maker of them all , that they are his offspring , redeemed by his Son , that Christians especially are all brethren ! Surely , so far from pride on the one hand , and reciprocated ill-will on the other , a social attitude both unnatural and suicidal , it were well for both classes to reflect upon their mutual dependence , mutual capabilities , and common interest . Mutual consideration and helpfulness is clearly the dictate of enlightened reason , as it is of Christianity . And the rich and cultured can in no better way prove their real elevation , as they can in no better way prove their piety , than by assiduous effort to elevate the poor . With what pleasure the eye lights upon an occasional example of our ideal of a refined Christian ! How instinctively we write highest on the social scale , those whose refinement has only been elevated and adorned by the additions which Christianity supplied , and which has given to the church individuals // like XVilberforce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of some of our Christian merchant princes , whose untiring munificence , and personal codperation in every good enterprise , demonstrate the greatness of their hearts , and prove them innocent of this subservience to Fashion . We dismiss then our consideration of the social evils of Fashionable Christianity , with one more thought . Its influence in the social system is analogous to what has been contemplated in the domestic . By its operation , the intercourse of Christians , which else might contribute largely alike to their enjoyment , growth , and usefulness , is frozen with ceremony . The genial flow of Christian love and Christian sympathy is dried up . Bearing one another 's burdens to fulfill the law of Christ , is forbidden . The hands of the vassals of fashion must always be gloved . They can take hold of nothing . Their hearts must beat and swell according to icy rules . And worse than this . If we descend from that law of religion which enjoins love to one another out of a pure heart , if we survey the so-called friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions of respect and attachment ring hollow on the ear . Indeed , whatever hypocrisy , whatever sinister avowals of regard there may be in other social names , here we think influences , tending to aggravate the evil , are . peculiarly intensified , and accordingly the evil itself proportionally increased . Another branch , in our discussion of the evils of fashionable Christianity , remains . Perhaps , as being of prime magnitude , it merits a more extended notice than our limits will allow . It is certain that this type of Christian development , so mischievous in personal , domestic , and social life , is equally injurious in its bearing on the extension of Christ 's kingdom . Whoever reflects upon the influence of fashion , to dwarf individual piety , to extinguish the religious element in families professedly Christian , and to repress its operation on social intercourse , can hardly fail to perceive this . Especially if he consider , that at the same time it inflames many of the worst passions , and fosters many of the worst habits of our nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful friends . She finds coldness and neglect , if not scornful opposition , in those on whom she relied for efficient aid . She needed all her talent and intelligence , but much of it has been tampered with , and can not be relied on . She needed all her wealth to build hospitals and asylums , to found educational institutions , and send her sons to preach the Gospel to every creature , but neither can this be obtained . Her most affluent members , forgetful of the wants of perishing millions , are in // competition one with another , regarding the splendor and costliness of their style of living . God 's charities must be stinted by those who pay a thousand dollars for a single dress , and thirty thousand for their jewelry . They must be stinted by the limited surplus of such extravagance , and by the yet more limited disposition to bestow it . Viewed as a power for the extermination of the kingdom of darkness , as a power that should hurl itself with concentrated column against the enemy , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does it scatter the forces of the militant church ? Instead of the ball and bomb , breaking their way through all opposition , we have but scattering shot that fall short of the foe . Nay , the forces of the church , so far from being concentrated against the kingdom of Satan , are found in mutual antagonism ; if not working one another 's destruction , at least barring progress . Indeed , so long as the spirit of arrogant exclusiveness , offspring of the union of Fashion and Pride , shall break up society , running its lines of social caste without reference to intellectual and moral elevation , a working Christian unity is impossible . Not only will the different denominations of believers remain as now , more or less mutual impediments , but no single denomination can make its moral power entirely available . Certainly none , if the Roman hierarchy be excepted . If , for example , we enter a sanctuary , where this fashionable element has been admitted , is not the identical vice apparent which the Apostle rebuked , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Christian assemblies , to the man who entered as a Christian worshiper in vile raiment , and him whose gold ring and goodly apparel bespoke him a man of wealth ? And can Christian harmony exist along with this unblushing exclusiveness ? What concord hath Christ with Belial ? So long as the spirit of true religion is outraged in the persons of its poorer disciples , harmony can not exist , nor the forces of the Redeemer be marshaled for the conquest of the world . The true elite who unite the Christian element to the intellectual and esthetic , who live to honor the Saviour and bless society , can exert but a diminished agency for the elevation of mankind . Enterprises of philanthropy and benevolence can receive but the partial support of the church , and consequently advance but at a laggard pace . The genial philanthropy of the cross is made to encounter an iceberg , towering to the clouds and reaching to the depths , so as to chill and bar every attempt to bless society . The elements of the strength of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for Christian // 191 unity , and concentration of moral power , we find isolation . Where we look for enthusiasm , we find apathy . Where we look for truth and prayer , for purity of life and zeal in the propagation of the Gospel , we find religious sentimentalism , and a Christian profession from which little of the aggressive power of Christianity on the civilized and heathen world can be secured but the name . Individual believers are mutually estranged , and Christian bodies as well . Under these circumstances , how is a working Christian unity possible ? It can not be . And so this too must be catalogued among the evils of Fashionable Christianity , that by preventing unity it retards greatly the period of the universal triumph of the Gospel . But let the subject be viewed in another aspect . The element of fashion is essentially foreign and hostile to true religion . No compromise can be made between them . Not so , however , with intellectual and esthetic culture , not so with refinement of feeling , character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refiner . It elevates too while it refines , and refines by elevating . But let fashion usurp a dominant influence , or the attempt be made to effect a compromise between religion , Christianity , and fashion , and the result is deplorable . Character is wrenched and deformed ; Christianity polluted and rendered inoperative . From a living , dominant principle , developed into all that is lovely , it degenerates into mere obsequiousness to usage and form . It decays till only a body of forms is left . Formalism , to which there is so potent a tendency in man , usurps both its place and name . Clearly the influence of the fashionable element is to foster this tendency . A most significant , as it is an undeniable fact ! Fond of display and addicted to an excessive regard for appear ances , the devotees of Fashion clamor for forms of worship , less simple than those of apostles and early Christians . If we open anywhere the pages of history we find this remark illus- , trated . Not the simple forms of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the more imposing rites of the church of Rome . Catholicism , rather than Protestantism , has been the religion of kings and nobles . Its pomp and circumstance of worship afford a natural expression to the devotional sentiment of a nature enslaved to Fashion . It is not then we think , too much to say , that the tendency of what we have called fashionable Christianity is to cut the vital nerve of Protestantism . It is to do away with spiritual religion and introduce formalism in its stead . A literary Christianity is a thousand times preferable to a fashionable one . A philosophic , or rational Christianity , is preferable . Neither , // indeed , are genuine . But the literary ' and the rationalistic elements do not especially patronize formalism . With the fashionable element , however , it is otherwise . Accordingly Christians and churches , who are friendly to the spiritual Christianity of the Reformation and of the Puritans , should not so far forget or fail to scan this tendency of which we speak , as to foster an element which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formalism , will sweep our youth and less established professors toward Episcopacy , or the church of Rome . There are various other effects of this element , equally illustrative of its mischievous religious bearing . For example , it discards humility and self-denial ; it forgets , or ignores the fact , that Christianity has to do with the little things , personal , domestic , and social , that make up life . Impatient of the drudgery of doing good , scorning it even , as partaking of the nature of that labor , which it affects to despise , it employs agents for this purpose . This is done either to satisfy conscience or bow to pharisaic pride . It offers money rather than service to the cause of philanthropy . Too often it withholds even this . And so it comes to pass that religion suffers a loss of those who might be its ablest auxiliaries , while their example of sacrificing principle to pride , operates to abate Christian activity through every inferior social rank . But the mischievous operation of the fashionable element is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of God must prophesy smooth things ; he must not rebuke conformity to the world when in the direction of luxury , extravagance , effeminacy , fashion , but only when in the shape of more vulgar sins . The Christian professor who . expends thousands of dollars in rich dress , costly jewelry , and magnificent palaces , and nothing comparatively in charity , must not be admonished . Who would be so audacious ? This fashionable element , too , demands that the ministry shall pass by such themes as the terrors of the Lord , lest they shock delicate ears . They must not speak of a wrath that burns to the lowest Hell . They must regale the ear polite with sweet modulations , the fancy with beautiful imagery , the taste with ornate and fluent periods . They must preach to please , rather than to profit . Worship must be ostentatious and inflated , and themes presented and discussed less to save souls than to prevent the tedium of public worship . Thus a mighty influence is exerted to spoil the ministry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where finery may be exhibited and something done to while away the Sabbath . // Happily there is nothing in true refinement , nothing in a cultivated , intelligent , tasteful condition of* society , or of the individual , to exert this deleterious influence . The evils of which we have spoken are attributable to an unreasonable and excessive servility to the usages of the opulent . We have no fears that the taste of Christians will be too highly cultivated , that the proprieties of social intercourse , delicacy , and politeness , will be too highly regarded , that the conveniences and elegancies of life will be too extensively multiplied , or accumulated about our homes . The more the better , provided only the intellect and the heart be proportionably developed , provided the moral and religious element be woven everywhere into the woof of social order . Then the result will be , not pretence to refinement and religion , but the reality . The rich , instead of contemptuously eying the poor , keeping aloof in arrogant exclusiveness , will warmly sympathize with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will accept the principle of honoring all men , and this , not according to the abundance which they possess , but according to their elevation of soul ; not according to their color or apparel , but according to their mental and moral worth . The highest type of society may exist without the tyranny of fashion . It does exist in Heaven . But under this tyranny it can never be realized . Unquestionably society , whether on earth or in heaven , will always be characterized by various ranks . Men possess different degrees of sagacity , industry , energy . sanctity . Of necessity , therefore , they assume various positions in the social scale . But whatever a man 's position , there is an obvious propriety in his cherishing the sympathies of a common humanity , and cooperating , as lie may , for the universal good . Discarding the counterfeit , and cultivating the genuine in social refinement , Christianity will not only preserve its celestial purity , but contribute unceasingly to polish and elevate mankind . Mutually helpful , the high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soonest see the salvation of God . In regard to what may be done to arrest the growing evils which result from the element of fashion in religion , we can only submit a few hints , and leave them to the reader 's reflection . First , then , let the genius of Christianity be more carefully pondered . Let its divine spirit be recognized , and applied to all personal , domestic , an ( l social questions , questions which are now , for the most part , decided according to the mandate of fashion . 1'his will operate to bind together at least the regenerate portion of humanity . It will open their hearts in kindly sympathy toward the poorest and humblest follower of Christ . von . - xi. 25 // It will fix the only proper standard for the estimate of one 's social position , and discourage every other . It will make Christians feel that any mind , which is truly cultivated and consecrated to God , belongs to the elite of the universe , and will be so estimated in celestial circles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular custom be pondered , and every thing judged according to its merits , not according to the capricious notions of shallow and selfish fashionables . And finally , let the idea of man 's immortality be fully grasped , and the fact that as Creation placed all on a level of destiny , so Redemption has placed them on a level of opportunity and grace . Were these ideas exalted to their appropriate prominence , there would at once be reared in the church a standard against the evils which have passed under review . The outflow of Christian philanthropy , unchilled by custom and ceremony , would more gladden the benevolent enterprises of the day , and pour its refining , elevating influence , more abundantly into hearts and homes . We have only to add in closing , that this remedy of fashionable Christianity must be applied all along through the processes of education . As the mischief begins to be felt in the nursery , so the remedy should be applied there . The child and the youth should be taught the dignity of labor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be frowned upon . All should be trained to the conviction that true dignity never suffers by deeds of philanthropy , nor is true refinement scandalized by the drudgery of doing good . They should be trained to feel that generosity , kindness , condescension to the lowly , and such likesentiments , do but demonstrate their title to the highest social consideration . And this because they show that their refinement is not counterfeit , but genuine ; that their elevation is not owing to the accident of dollars and cents , or of birth , but to the development , adornment , and uplifting of the soul ; that the fashions they follow are not of this world , which pass away , but those which will obtain in the society of heaven .
