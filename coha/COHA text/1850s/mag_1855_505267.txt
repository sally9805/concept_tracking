It was a copy of the latter that the little songstress unrolled before us . She passed in and made way for the Coffin , or Golden Bed , as some call it , upheld by monks in white hoods and cassocks . " A dead Christ " lay on it . It was partially covered by a rich counterpane . " The three Marys " followed weeping , dressed in long russet gowns and close hoods , and handkerchiefs in their hands . Their halos seemed made of bobbin wire , and might any where else have been taken for the frames of caps or bonnets . Next came Saint John and Mary Magdalene ; she is one of the preceding trio , being twice represented . In the Carmo procession the Prophets always attend as mourners .

The person of this actor lOJEsMAN AND LiON . was swelled by stuffing , and , from the vibration qwq lion to the gaze of the civilized world . Speaking , therefore , with authority regarding these two animals , we can devote more space to their description than to those of inferior importance . The Western Continent has hen exempted hy Providence from animals of the most destructive kinds , as the lion is a native of Africa , and the tiger of India ; the ounce , the ocelot , the leopard , the lynx , and the cougar are more diffused , hut are never met in sufficient numbers to occupy a prominent place in natural history .

The most remarkable illustration of this habit is given in an account of a cat owned by a gentleman living on Elk Run , in Virginia . It would seem that the plantation was much infested by snakes , which were protected by stone fences and thorn hedges . The cat having killed one of the reptiles , it devoted its energies to their extermination . In time it extended its field of operations to the adjoining woods , distant perhaps a mile , and would often return home with a snake many feet in length in its mouth . The fondness of cats for certain sweet-scented herbs is well known , valerian being their favorite perfume . They are also highly susceptible of every change in the atmosphere , becoming gloomy and hypochondriacal in damp and rainy weather , and buoyant and playful on bright and sunny days .

The voice of the domestic cat is peculiar ; and unlike all its species , in being very flexible , its cry frequently approaching the tones of the human voice . It was these mysterious sounds , joined with its unsocial characteristics , that made the cat an object of superstitious veneration among our ancestors ; at the present day it holds an envied place at the fireside , and divides with the faithful dog the attentions and caresses of the social circle , from which all other quadrupeds are rigorously excluded . The Wild Cat is common to almost every country , and is celebrated for its ferocity ; it is distinguishable from the domestic cat not only by its superior size , but by the shortness of its tail , which shows that it is of another species . In the THz DOMSSTIc CAT . The Household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a universal favorite ; it is so neat in its habits , so beautiful in form , graceful in gesture , and so useful withal ; for without the cat , our houses , in many cases , would not only become uninhabitable on account of vermin , but it is safe to say that sections of country would he overrun with rats , and rendered unfit for the residence of man . Although the cat is not distinguished for its intelligence , still , when closely observed , it will be found to possess great sagacity ; but it seldom exerts its faculties except for selfish purposes . The cat , as a general rule , shows no attachment to persons , only to places ; yet it is one of the few dumb creatures that take an interest 2 in their young after they are able to provide for themselves . In European countries it is qwq trees , near the ground , and is so ingenious in disguising its location that it is rarely discovered .

In hunting the cat , the creature has been known to display a great deal of intelli0ence in its efforts to escape the hounds . It will , when hard pressed , run up and down the trunk of a tree several times , and then , climbing to the topmost branches , take a flying leap to an adjoining monarch of the forest , and thus endeavor to destroy the trail . As a last resort for safety , it will take to some gigantic and heavenward-lifted limb , from which it will look down upon the dogs below , and snarl and growl defiance . Tormented by an occasional discharge of bird - shot , it will finally leap from its airy l ) erch into the very jaws of the hounds , and throwing itself on its back , do more hard fighting with its claws and teeth , in a given length of time , than any other animal in the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggeration of the Western bravado , who , among other things , professes himself perfectly able " to whip his *veight in wild cats . " We had an acquaintance , some years ago , who , upon a business trip , left the crowded streets of New York , and threaded the then halfwild wastes of Northern Mississippi . While riding along , he heard in the road what he supl ) osed to be a stray kitten , and upon examination discovered , among some dried leaves , a juvenile wild cat , that could scarcely walk . Without reflection , he transferred the little creature to his coat pocket , where it kept up its cries . Suddenly the gentleman was startled by a growl in his rear , and to his horror he discovered the infuriated mother , fierce with rage , and ardently bent upon avenging the attempted abduction of her young . Striking spurs to his already jaded horse , he dashed along the road as best he could , the while finding it perfectly impossible to pull the kitten out of his pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lining . Each moment seemed more imminent with peril ; twice did the " varmint " nearly succeed in fastening upon the haunches of the horse , bu4 as good fortune would have it , the appearance of a plantation , and the sound of dogs , alarmed the cat , and she beat a retreat . It was many months before our friend got entirely over his " scare , " and was relieved of dreams that he was pursued by a dread phantom that resembled that terrible cat . In the early settlement of Kentucky , a schoolmaster was sitting alone in his log-cabin , when he was surprised to see a large cat enter his premises . Ignorant of the prowess of the animal , he shut the door , and commenced the attack . The battle was long and bloody , the man being nearly torn into shreds ; and when discovered in the morning , he was found with his hands upon the cat 's throat , his knees upon its Vor , . X.-No .

The Ocelot is the tiger-cat of Peru and Mexico . It is beautifully marked , and is altogether a very attractive and playful little animal . It is quite common among the Indians in a half domesticated state ; and is often led about the streets by a string , and , thus feebly guarded , offered for sale . Its principal food , when wild , is the monkey , which it rivals in activity and stratagem . The Caracal of Asia and Africa , and the Lynx of North America , are animals strongly resemTHE LYNX . fir TIlE OCELOT. // qwq England by the Hudson 's Bay Company . The Chetah is one of the most beautifal animals , not only of the feline family , but of the world , and is common to India and Africa . In the former country they are domesticated , and trained to pursue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hoodwinked upon the field , where they are brought as nigh as possible to the place where deer and antelopes may be feeding ; the eyes of the chetah are thea exposed and directed toward the game . The moment that the animal understands the wishes of its master , it leaps from the cart , and creeps along as it does in its wild state , hiding behind intervening bushes and stones , precisely like a cat when attempting to THE LEOPARD. catch a bird . Nearing the vicinity of The Leopard , though smaller than the tiger , when wounded is considered but little less formidable by its enemies . The usual method of capturing it is in traps . People having the greatest knowledge of its habits refrain from confining it in a cage , hut fasten it by a thong around the loins , and a chain attached to a post , just as they are every where represented in Pompeian paintings . In this state of semiconfinement the animal best displays its wonderful grace and action . The leopard is without difficulty trained to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its whole family . Among the branches of trees , while at their play , THE cHETAH. they spring about so swiftly that the eye can scarcely follow their movements . Inthe unsuspecting herd , it singles out its victim , dividnals have become quite celebrated for their reaches it by two or three tremendous leaps , and intelligence and good-nature . An Englishman brings it to the ground . in India owned one , named Sal , that went at pleasure about the house , and seemed to find the greatest amusement in looking at the street scenes out of a certain window . If the children of the family wished to occupy his place , they unceremoniously thrust him aside . He was full of play , and was by no means averse to a practical joke , such as knocking over his attendant if he got asleep , or perhaps jumping upon the hack of the servants as they would be stooping down to clean the floor . Sal was passionately fond of lavender water , a predilection accidentally discovered ; on one occasion , while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal , who was sitting by , tore it out of his hands , and continued rolling over with it until it was reduced to fragments . Before TilE OL ' * a // his social qualities were known , he escaped from the yard where he was kept , and rushed round the ramparts , creating consternation in his course . The castle gates were closed , the officers , who had doors to their apartments , shut them , and the sentinels , who had none , ran away . The playful creature was thus left to complete his frolic by himself ; and at last permitted his keeper to quietly lead him back to his cage . Sa:i was finally carried to England . On the voyage he got ducked in the sea , which seemed to nearly break his heart , and he suffered terribly from sickness . His daily allowance of food was a parrot a day , hardly enongh to keep him from starving . On his arrival in England he was presented to the Duchess of York . One morning his new mistress called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his usual health , but at evening he was found dead . Sal , after he once became civilized , showed for his benefactors all the affection and faithfulness of a dog , and illustrated , in a most remarkable degree , that in natural disposition the leopard is far less cruel than the other representatives of the feline family . The Romans , in celebrating the feast of Bacchus , used to have a pageant , drawn through the streets , consisting of a pair of leopards attached to a car , in which rode a human representative of the infant god . The Jaguar is a native of America , and very closely resembles the leopard . It follows in the track of wild herds of cattle and horses , and thus finds its principal subsistence . Its mode of killing its prey differs from that of the other felidce , which is to seize by the throat . The jaguar , on the contrary , is said to spring upon the back of its victim , and , by its arms and with a sudden jerk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable it to drag the body of a horse a great distance . Unlike the other members of the cat family , it readily takes to the water , and not only swims rivers , but is successful in catching fish in shallow water , of which it seems to be very fond . It is related that , many years since , a jaguar took possession of the church of Santa Fi , and killed the padre . The priest 's absence caused suspicion , and a coadjutor went into the church , but , to the people , was as unaccountably delayed as his predecessor . After some time another priest entered the church , and was instantly attacked by the jaguar , but he managed to escape and give the alarm . No one now could be found brave enough to enter the building , so the people unroofed a corner of the church , and shot their enemy from a safe distance . A jaguar penetrated a squatter 's hut in search of food , and the wife , the only human occupant at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spring , which obliged her to keep her fingers between the lid and the side of the chest , lest she should be suffocated for want of air . The jaguar soon discovered the hiding-place , and tried to push his head into the chest , but he could not raise the lid , nor could his paws obtain entrance . Presently he discovered the woman 's fingers , and began to lick them with his rough tongue . Not being able to accomplish any thing at the side of the box , he jumped on the top , and by his weight broke his poor prisoner 's fingers . For a long time he continued his efforts to obtain his prey , but at last , finding all of his endeavors useless , he went away . The woman at daybreak released herself and alarmed the neighbors , and , on the return of the husband , a search for the jaguar was commenced , which resulted in finding a pair , together with their cubs . It is hardly necessary to say that these " varmints " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American lion-at least it bears a closer resemblance to that noble brute than any other of the feline family , for it is destitute of the stripes of the tiger , the sl ) ots of the leopard , and the rosettes of the jaguar ; but when full-grown possesses a tawny-red color , almost uniform over the whole body , and hence the inference that it is like the lion . Some naturalists call it the puma ; the Anglo-Americans the panther , or " painter , " as it is gener THE JAGUAR . // ally termed in the back-woods . Cougar is a corruption of the Mexican name , and such we please to term it . The animal is remarkable for the extensive range of country which it inhabits , for it has been found in all the intermediate space between Paraguay and the great lakes of North America . In form it is less attractive than the generality of its species , there being an apparent want of symmetry ; for it is observable that its back is hollow , its legs short and thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature has invested the cougar with other qualities as a compensation , the most remarkable of which is an apparent power to render itself quite invisible ; for so cunningly tinged is its fur , that it perfectly mingles with the bark of trees-in fact , with all subdued tints  --  and stretched upon a limb , or even extended upon the floor of its dimly-lighted cage , you must prepare your eye by considerable mental resolution to be assured of its positive presence . We knew a party of hunters , on the prairies of Louisiana , who spent a portion of a day under qmte a small and perfectly leafless tree , and never suspecte*d , until it leaped to the ground , the presence of an immense cougar , that was all the time a few feet above their heads in the naked branches ; and then so quiet were its movements that the interruption would have passed for afleeting shadow of the sun , had not the animal been discerned as it moved away upon the open plain . The cougar , which is not nufrequently killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than six feet in length ; and fortunately-for they are very destructive-they are but seldom seen in any inhabited part of our continent ; but we notice that one was recently slain in California which measured nine feet , including the tail , which is about one-third of the whole . Their habits are exceedingly solitary , and they never approach the residences of human beings except when impelled by hunger-preferring the most retired passes in the mountains and the deeper gloom of the swamps . hunting only for game in the night , and possessing , as we have already stated , an extraordinary power of concealment , they are strangers every where , and their appearance throws neighborhoods into excitement , for the mystery attending their movements ever exa*gerates the idea of their power to injure and destroy . The cougar reaches the top of a tree with almost the ease of a bird-dependin* upon his claws to retain the momentum in his favor rained by his first spring . Selecting a lower limb of souse gi*antie tree that overhangs a watering-place , or a " salt-lick , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along his perch , looking-upon the most critical examination of a spectator-more like a line of dried moss , or an excrescence on the bark , than a blood-thirsty beast of prey . Here he keeps his vigil-his eyes alone are moving ; but even their fires are partially quenched from observation by silken lashes , which , like the lantern of the thief ; darken the light that it may not betray . Most animals of the forest drink at night , and at particular places ; thus finally the deer , the elk , or even the lordly buffalo appears , and ere it has slaked its thirst , the cougar has dropped from his nestlingplace and descended as quietly as a dried leaf upon the neck of his victim . But now all is changed  --  the cougar instantly becomes the active fiend-his claws and teeth sink into the quivering flesh , and away flies the fated victim with the speed of an arrow . In vain it rushes against the trunks of trees , or scours throogh the inhospitable cane-brake to brush off the destroyer-the cougar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the wild race continues , drinks up the warm and throbbing blood . Life , tenacious as it is among the ruminants of the forest , is soon sapped by the remorseless appetite of the destroyer ; and as the victim falls and expires , the cougar stealthily extends himself along the body , suspiciously glances around , as if challenging a dispute for the prize , and then satisfies for the moment his insatiable appetite . Excited now , rather than appeased , he rushes back to his eyrie , resumes his watching , and darts down again upon some helpless animal , accompanying his acts with ten-fold ferocityblood rather increasing than appeasing his lust . Thus passes the night , until the butcher is literally covered with gore . The first streak of the morning sun that illumes the horizon sends him to his hiding-place . With the stealthy , cowardly step of the midnight assassin and murderer , he seeks obscurity , and calms his passions by cleansing his soiled coat of every stain , and at the close of the labor sinks into disturbed sheep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests upon the earth . There are times , however , when a destroyer more terrible than the cougar himself is on his path . The hunter has brought the well-trained dogs to assist him on the scent , and already the deep bay of the excited hound is yelping forth the desire for blood . The wild beast  --  a short time before so relentless , so powerful , and in his domain so apparently omnipotent-feels that Isis doom is sealed . Strange as it may he , he has an instinctive dread ; the lord of the creation is upon him ; the breath of powder unnerves his muscles of iron ; and the cougar flies - flies with even more terror than the helpless deer that has suffered in his grasp . As a last resort , lie mounts a tree ; the unerring scent of the dogs shames the sight in its knowledge , and betrays the presence of the now immolated destroyer . The sharp ringing of the rifle is followed by the body of the lifeless cougar coming helpless to the ground ; for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gave man dominion over every living thing that moveth upon the face of the earth . It is a singular fact regarding the cougar that his fleshs is used by some people as an article of food , and it is represented as tasting , under the charms of the culinary art , like any thing // but " cat . " In stock-raising countries , where the cougar is most frequently found , its thefts are mostly confined to stealing young heifers for food . A poor fellow , living on the prairies of Opelousas , who was suspected of such acts , was once surprised with various quarters of supposed beef hanging pendent from the rafters of the veranda of his house ; nay , more , it was smoking upon his table , and giving out any thing hut unsavory fumes . Upon being charged with taking what was not his own , he showed first his title to what he possessed in the characteristic document of an old rifle , and as dress makes the animal as well as the man , he farther confirmed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which belonged not to the drove of the servile brutes of the voches-ie , but to the wilds ; and were the property of the hunter who possessed the strong arm and unflinching bravery to slay them , and set the mark of ownership where by nature all was free and untamed . A hunter on the Rio Grande , who was invariably unsuccessful , became so much annoyed by the taunts of his companions , that he determined to adopt the Camanche Indian fashion of hunting , and accordingly dressed himself in a deer-skin , and ornamented his head with huge antlers . Thus equipped he sallied out , and took his place at a favorite " stand . " A few moments only elapsed before a cougar , perched in the limbs of the tree above , thinking that he saw " a sure enough buck , " leaped from his airy abode plump on the hunter 's back , at the same time burying his claws and teeth deeply into the dried skin . A yell of fright and astonishment greeted the cougar , such as never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping his game , the animal and the hunter took different directions , it being a matter of uncertainty , even to this day , which of the two was most alarmed . An American lady , Mrs. Jane Swisshelm , furnishes the world with a description of the cougar that is thrillingly interesting . She says that at a certain time past , her husband bought in Arkansas a cougar , six months old , which had been caught while a kitten in the woods . The creature was brought home , and remained a prisoner four years , at the end of which time he died . Tom , such was his name , was nine feet in length , of a gray color on his back and sides , and nearly white on the belly and throat . His back was generally perfectly straight , his form symmetrical , and his movements lithe and graceful . If in exceeding good humor he would purr ; but if he wished to intimidate he would raise his back , erect his hair , and spit like a cat . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth to the full extent of his limits , ever and anon uttering a short , piercing shriek , which made the valley reverberate for half a mile or more in every direction . Mrs. Swisshelm says these sounds were the shrillest , and at the same time the most mournful she ever heard . They might , perhaps , be likened to the scream of a woman in an agony of terror . The natural ferocity of the panther was at length so far subdued , that his fair mistress sometimes ventured , when he was in good-humor , to stroke his head and feel his paw . On one occasion , indeed , when he had broken his chain , and all the men in the house , with the exception of Mr. Swisshelm , had fled to the barn for safety , she seized him by the collar as he took refuge in the dining-room , and held him until her husband took effectual measures to secure him . At length , however , the lady was thrown from a carriago , and so severely injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says : " When we appeared on crutches we inadvertently went quite near the cougar , and were warned by a low growl that he was regarding us as his prey . We turned and found him crouched within five or six feet of us , ready to spring - his eyes green and blazing , and the tip of his tail moving from side to side . We kept our eyes fastened on his ; there was no one within call , and we tried to make him remember us by talking to and naming him . " Tom-poor Tom ! ' but Tom 's eyes lost none of their fire , and the tail kept up its regular motion . " Then we tried to intimidate him , as we had often done before , by assuming a voice of command . Tom ! Tom ! Down Tom ! ' but Tom kept his hostile attitude , and we-in doubt as to whether his chain was long enough to reach us , or strong enough to resist the spring we saw he intended making-kept our place and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us a long time , trusting to the power of the eye to keep him still , we set our crutches , and still speaking to him , threw ourself backward a step . The instai*t we moved he sprang , but the chain held him , and being too short , lie rebounded against a post , and fell to the floor some eighteen inches from where we stood . " It is no wonder that a woman possessed of such nerve should become a champion for her sex . The Royal Tiger is a native of Hindostan , and although it has been hunted from time immemorial by the native princes , and in recent times by numberless Europeans , still nothing is known cf this most formidable animal beyond the incidents connected with its destruction in the jungles . No one has followed it to its den , or watched its nocturnal adventures . Its habits remain , therefore , matters of speculation . The ferocity of the tiger 's disposition has been exaggerated ; but although capable of being made quite gentle , they are unreliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt the gratification of a blood-thirsty disposition . Keepers of menageries , however much confidence they may feel in the friendship of the " king ot beasts , " are always nervous about the tiger , and cautious in their movements . We think it was Van Amberg // who was unexpectedly set upon by a tiger , when the lion came to his rescue , and actually threw the tiger down , and held him fast until the man escaped . The circumstance is still familiar with the public , where the " Lion Queen , " at Wombwell 's menagerie , England , fell a victim to the sudden irritability of the tiger . While going through the daily performance , and in presence of hundreds of spectators , this young lady was forced to chastise the tiger for some disobedience of orders , when the animal suddenly turued upon her and grasped her throat , and although , when she was rescued , no perceptible injuries were visible , yet life was extinct . In a wild state the tiger is more dreaded than . the lion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known to put whole flocks of domestic animals to death after his appetite had been gorged to repletion . The tiger grows to an immense size , and is sometimes heavier than the largest lion . His strength seems amazing . A peasant in the Sundah Rajah 's dominions , had a buffalo foundered in a quagmire , which could not be removed by the united strength of many men . Upon going for more assistance , the party on their return were surprised to discover that a tiger had pulled the buffalo out of the mud , and throwing it across his back , was bearing it away to his den . Tiger-hunting is pursued in the East on the back of elephants , and every thing depends upon the firmness of these naturally timid animals , particularly when they meet the tiger . The manner of training them is difficult , and is managed as follows : A tiger deprived of his teeth , claws , and with his mouth sewed up , is fastened to a stake by a strong rope about thirty feet long . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the tiger springs upon their trunks with the greatest ferocity , and is beaten back , or thrown into the air upon the formidable tusks . In this way the elephants , escaping injury , are deceived into a false confidence , and afterward face the wild animal with the same courage as they did the one so cruelly deprived of the power of effective defense . Captain Basil Hall , while in India , witnessed very many of these tiger fights , and describes one where the animal was urged into the netted court of the exhibition by a handful of lighted squibs and crackers . On reaching the centre of the ring , he was greatly bewildered by the shoutings , drummings , and shriekings which , coming from the spectators , resounded on every side ; and was farther put out by the evolutions of some donkeys within the ring , to the tails of which were fastened blown bladders filled with dried peas . On finding all retreat to his den cut oW the tiger flew at the wooden figure of a man that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in an instant . Discovering the cheat , he first tore the image to pieces , and then made a dash at the netting in front of his cage , up which he scrambled until his fore paws were already on the roof and in another half-minute he would have been among the assembled crowds . Fortunately a brave lad , about twelve years of age , had perched himself on the cage , and the moment the infuriated tiger showed his head above the ropes , the boy , with a short club , struck him such a rap on the nose that the animal fell back head over heels into the inclosure . After long badgering the order was given to put the tiger to death . One of the native chiefs discharged a great number of arrows into the animal 's body , s* that it bristled all over like a porcupine 's . At last , the English officers , disgusted at his lengthened tortures , begged leave to try the effect of a musket-ball , which laid him dead instantaneously , although several arrows had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any visible effect . A gentleman who participated in a tiger-hunt kindly furnished us a detailed sketch , from which we make the following extracts . After describing the hunting party , as it set out for the jungle , he says : " A quarter of an hour brought us to the place where the tiger was first seen ; and sure enough in the vicinity lay the remains of the poor brute the animal had carried off . While we were contemplating the gnawed and halfconsumed body , one of the elephants that had lingered behind began to trumpet aloud with his trunk , a sign that he perceived the vicinity of the tiger . It was plain , therefore , that we were near the foe , and that he was concealed in the thicket . Cautiously we urged our elephants toward the jungle , the footmen meanwhile keeping up a continual hallooing , which , with the trumpetings of the half-frightened elephants , caused the welkin to resound with a commingled noise // sufficient to daunt even a tiger , in all the consciousness of his solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously spent , when one of the old hunters suddenly cried out Sher ! sher ! bahl bah ! ' when we saw the jungle violently agitated all along the straight line leading toward the swamp ; and a couple of rifles were discharged from the gentlemen on the nearest elephant , which served to Produce a more rapid advance of the moving body , when in a moment , breaking cover , out the tiger sprang into the clear swamp and made for the opposite wood . " On went the crowd in pursuit , the Europeans urging their drivers to get the elephants into a run ; three shots were fired , but apparently without effect , before the tiger reached cover . ' The hunters soon crossed the swamp , and the beast was again roused . Shot followed shot in quick succession , until at length every thing except the report of our arms was as still in the jungle as if naught hut the hand of Nature had ever ruffled its surface . Captain Angew , my companion , exclaimed , By Jove , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty rupees to the man who first draws his body forth ! ' This last sentence was uttered in Hindoostanee , and our footmen spread themselves about in all directions , each anxious for the honor of the discovery , as well as impelled by the hope of reward . To our former well-organized system of action succeeded a scene of hurry and confusion , overweening confidence , and careless movements , which baffles description . A few moments were occupied by this species of search , when a low growl , followed by that subdued noise which all the feline tribe are accustomed to make when irritated , suddenly struck our ears , and the footmen commenced scattering in all directions . A poor servant , belonging to a gentleman of the party , was running away in great confusion , when he was encountered by the enraged monster , and before any of us could collect our confused senses , he was seized by the tiger with both teeth and claws , and desperately wounded in the neck , shoulder , and breast . The tiger , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey ; but abandoning it he moved , with great rapidity , toward that part of the jungle most clear of the fugitives , which , by good luck , led back to the swamp . " Back again we all followed , and the elephants having by this time become familiarized with the tiger 's appearance and smell , with admiral ) le sagacity , now began to understand the object of the morning 's excursion ; and , putting out their strength , they advanced with so much speed that we were up with the enemy before he got half way across the swamp . I had just raised my rifle to my shoulder , and was on the l ) oint of pulling the trigger , when , good heaven ! I saw him suddenly turn , and with two or three bounds , as quick as lightning , he literally flung himself through the air , and alighted on the upper part of the neck of an elephant , and there attempted to cling with teeth and claws . The elephant roared , and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were surrounding him , were fearful of discharging our pieces , in consequence of the danger our friends on his back were in , of receiving their contents . The tiger was at length shaken off after having almost torn the poor animal 's trunk from his head . The moment that he was on the ground a couple of rifle-balls entered him , one in the shoulder and one in the breast . Streaming with blood , and desperately wounded , the animal then rushed upon the elephants ; in the second charge , he actually buried his claws in the huge saddle of the animal on which we were seated , and I shall never forget the sight of the savage as he hung suspended from its back . I looked over the edge of the howdah in which I was seated , and caught sight of his eye-balls , rolling as if in a sea of blood , so suffused did they seem with mingled pain and rage . One of my fellow-companions had the honor of giving him the fatal shot , the ball hitting the forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way during the conflict , but they now all hastened to the spot where the tiger lay , carried him to the edge of the jungle , and laid him on the grass . He was a full-grown royal tiger , measuring four feet seven inches from the nose to the insertion of the tail at the rump . Unlike the miserable wretches we see in our menageries , with collapsed abdomens , loose skin , and dull , dirty , ill-defined colors , his belly was round , large , and well distended , the muscular development in his shoulders and thighs magnificent , and the stripes were as clear and vivid as if the fleshy integuments they covered were still boiling with the intemperate spirits to which they are said to owe their brilliancy . The poor man who was wounded , died soon after he was borne to the native hospital . We rested from the scene of our labors a couple of hours , made a plentiful repast of cold meats , cheese , bread , and bottled porter ; and amidst the heartfelt thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud congratulations of all the sporting men attached to our force , we entered camp with our magnificent trophy just as the sun was declining in the west . " By the common consent of naturalists and historians , the Lion stands as the head of the feline tribe ; recent discoveries , however , are calculated to give the noble animal a distinct place in the creation , and disconnect him from the association . The lion possesses great individuality ; he is the most noble of all brutes , and cnn not with strict justice be confounded with the tiger , leopard , and ounce-species which seem to be the least removed from the lion , yet are so little distinguishable from each other that they have often been confounded together by travelers and intelligent classifiers . Bulfonwho was one of the most agreeable of enthusiasts-gives a description of the lion which is so calculated to raise the animal in your estimation , that if one were to rer*l it on Mount // he overcomes almost every beast of the forest , however superior in weighl* or stature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or after it sets . He approaches the fountain as if deeply conscious that he is happy in possessing the cooling draught . Extending himself with ceremonious precision upon theground , he stretches out his powerful arms before him , and brings his chest close to the ground ; these things being accomplished , he gives a few laps , and then rests as if to more perfectly enjoy the luxury . Cumming relates that he has often heard them lapping within twenty yards of where he was encamped , yet , from their tawny color , he was never ahle to distinguish their outline . This confirms the general idea that the lion TIlE LION . has no sceiit ; for he would no ap proach so near an cuemy , if he Atlas , o qwq haunts , and tells of love , daring , success , and defeat , iu the wonderful modulations of his orchestral voice . A lion troop is an opera in which the instruments are attuned hy nature ; the theme destruction , defiance , victory , death . Hence there come the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers over the slain ; then the deep-toned , solemn roars follow in quick succession , like , the rapid discharge of heavy artillery-growing louder and louder , they seem to engulf the surrounding world , and threaten to shake the elements into chaos ; then follows the finale of sobs , of groans , so appalling , because so indicative of human woe . The lion is supposed hy naturalists to have the average life of thirty-five years , yet this seems very inconsistent with the well-known fact , that one was kept in the Tower of London over threescore years and ten , and no one knew the age of the animal when it was first made a prisoner . By a kind arrangement of Providence , lions and other destructive animals are never numerous . A certain areais necessary for their support , and they destroy each other if the prescrihed limits are interfered with . Gerard , the French lion hunter of Algeria , calculates that there are thirty lions now living in the colony , and that the Arabs pay an annual trihute of twenty-five cents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty cents to the lions , in the destruction of their horses , mules , sheep , and camels ; so it would seem that the reign of the king of heasts , like that of all other kings , is rather an expensive luxury . In the life of the great missionary , Judson , occurs a story of a starving lion , which has all the elements of a fearful tragedy . Confined in prison hy the Burman authorities , Judson was electrified hy the news of a British victory over his oppressors . This increased the severity of his treatment . Just before the war between Burmah and the English , the king had received a present of a majestic lion , which had become a pet in the palace , particularly with his majesty . After the defeats of Bandoola , some of the courtiers discovered the fearful resemblance between the king 's favorite and the insignia on the British flag , and the regal beast was looked upon as a demoniac ally of England , and he was finally cast into prison . The cage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been expected . And now commenced to the unhappy prisoners with whom Judson was confined a new and fearful scene of misery . The unhappy men had seen their own friends starved , and beaten , and smothered , and strangled to death , and then dragged by the feet from the door , and thrust like dogs into some shallow pit , or left to be devoured by jackalsand they thought they had gained a familiarity with every species of wretchedness . But there was something almost superuatural in their new horror of a starving lion . Day after day the noble beast writhed in the pangs of hunger , parched with thirst , and bruised and bleeding in his fearful struggles , while his roarings seemed to shake the prison to its foundations , and sent a thrill of indescribable terror to the hearts of its occupants . The jailer said that it was the British lion ineffectually struggling against the prowess of the conquering Burmans . Sometimes , after dark , a compassionate woman would steal to the cage , and thrust a mouthful of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the powerful beast , and only seemed to increase his ravings . At other times , one of the keepers would throw water over him , which would be greeted by almost human shrieks of pleasure , though it only seemed to lengthen for a little his term of suffering . At last the scene was over : the skeleton of the unhappy beast was dragged from its cage , and buried in the earth . In endeavoring to perfectly comprehend the habits and natural history of the lion , Cumming 's adventures in Africa are calculated to give the most vivid idea . He presents many new pictures , all of which elevate the king of beasts in the reader 's estimation , and involuntarily suggest a comparison between man and the lion , as a destructive animal . The noble quadruped pursues his way through the interminable wilds , kills from necessity , and , having satisfied his hunger , leaves the remains of his repast for the weaker animals that follow in his path . Wantonness or cruelty he never displays ; on the contrary , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blow , except for the benefit of his own existence and those dependent upon him . Cumming , on the contrary , stalks through the wilderness more blood-thirsty than a thousand lions-he seems to literally revel in blood ; without any other reason than to gratify his destructiveness , he disfignres the vast plains with the mountain carcasses of elephants and giraffes ; antelopes , gnoos , zebras , and buffaloes fall before his pestiferous saltpetre , as if he were a breathing pestilence . At nightfall , the wolf and the jackal swarm on his track , and screech and yell as if the fiends were unloosed ; at daybreak , the eagle and the vulture darken the air over his head , and gorge their unholy appetites in the victims of his prodigality of God 's life . Surely the lion , by comparison , is the being of humanity , and his bloody deeds pale before the records of his Christianized rival , as a destroyer on the face of the earth .               @ @ @ @ @ @
