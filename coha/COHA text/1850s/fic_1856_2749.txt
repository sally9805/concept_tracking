CHAPTER I. UNCLE STILLINGHAST . " Do you think they will be here to-night , sir ? " " Do n't know , and do n't care . " " The road is very bad , "  - -  after a pause , " that skirts the Hazel property . " " Well , what then ; what then , little May ? " " The carriage might be overturned , sir ; or , the horses might shy a little to the left , and go over the precipice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is it not dreadful to think of , sir ? " " Well , I do n't know ; I should be sorry to lose the horses --  " " Oh , sir ! and my cousin ! Did you forget her ? " " I care nothing about her . I suppose my forefathers must have committed some crime for which I am to suffer , by being made , willy-nilly , the guardian of two silly , mawkish girls . " " But , sir , you have been very kind to me , and it shall be the endeavor of my life to prove my gratitude . " " Very fine , without being in the least consoling ! I 'd as lief have two African monkeys under my care -- do n't laugh -- it exasperates , and makes me feel like doing as I should do , if I had the cursed animals --  " " How is that , sir ? " " Beat you . I hate womankind . Most of all do I hate them in their transition stages . They are like sponges , and absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , until they learn to be young **38;1101;TOOLONG . " " Oh , dear uncle ! has such been your experience ? Have you ever met with such women ? " " Have I ever met with such women , you holy innocent ? I have never met with any other . Now , be still . " " Oh ! Uncle Stillinghast --  " " What ! " " I pity you , sir ; indeed , I pity you . Something very dreadful must in times past have embittered you --  " " You are a fool , little May . Do n't interrupt me again at your peril . " " No , sir . " And so there was a dead silence , except when the rain and sleet lashed the window-panes , or a lump of coal crumbled into a thousand glowing fragments , and opened a glowing abyss in the grate ; or the cat uncurled herself on the rug , and purred , while she fixed her great winking eyes on the blaze . The two persons who occupied the room were an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour-looking , as he sat in his high-back leather chair , with a pile of ledgers on the table before him ,  - -  the pages of which he examined with the most incomparable patience . A snuff-colored wig sat awry on his head , and a snuff-colored coat , ornamented with large horn buttons , drooped ungracefully from his high , stooping shoulders . His neckcloth was white , but twisted , soiled , and tied carelessly around his thin , sinewy throat . His legs were cased in gray lamb's-wool stockings , over which his small-clothes were fastened at the knees with small silver buckles . His face was not originally cast in such a repulsive mould , but commerce with the world , and a succession of stinging disappointments in his early manhood , had woven an ugly mask over it , from behind which glimpses of his former self , on rare occasions , shone out . Such was Mark Stillinghast at the opening of our story : old , cynical , and rich , but poor in friendship , and without any definite ideas of religion , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a terra incognita , towards which men rather stumbled than ran . Opposite to him , on a low crimson chair , as antique in its pattern as the owner of the mansion , sat a maiden , who might have passed her seventeenth summer . She was not beautiful , and yet her face had a peculiar charm , which appealed directly to the softer and kindlier emotions of the heart . Her eyes , large , gray and beautifully fringed with long , black lashes , reminded one of calm mountain lakes , into whose very depths the light of sun and stars shine down , until they beam with tender sweetness , and inward repose . There was a glad , happy look in her face , which came not from the fitful , feverish glow of earth , but , like rays from an inner sanctuary , the glorious realities of faith , hope , and love , which possessed her soul , diffused their mysterious influence over her countenance . Thick braids of soft , brown hair , were braided over her round , childlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , was in admirable harmony with her peculiar style . Her proportions were small and symmetrical , and it was wonderful to see the serious look of dignity with which she sat in that old crimson chair , knitting away on a comfort , as fast as her little white fingers could shuffle the needles . For what purpose could such a fragile small creature have been created ? She looked as if it would not be amiss to put her under a glass-case , or exhibit her as a specimen of wax-work ; or hire her out , at so much per night , to fashionable parties , to play " fairy " in the Tableaux . But the wind howled ; the leafless branches of the old trees without were crushed up , shivering and creaking against the house ; the frozen snow beat a wild reville on the windows , and May 's face grew very sad and thoughtful . She dropped her knitting , and with lips apart listened intently . " Thank God ! They are come . I am sure I hear carriage-wheels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course ; I knew they would come . There was to be no such good luck as their not coming , " said Mr. Stillinghast , looking annoyed . " One sister ran off -- married a papist -- died , and left you on my hands . I was about sending you off again , when news came that your father had died on his voyage home from Canton , and been buried in the deep : so here you stayed . Brother -- spendthrift , shiftless , improvident -- marries a West Indian papist ; turns one ; dies with his wife , or , at least , soon after her leaving another ne'er-do-weel on my hands . I wish you 'd all gone to purgatory together . To be shut up in my old days with two wild papists is abominable ! " muttered the old man , slamming the ledgers together , until every thing on the table danced . He pushed back his chair , and in another moment the door opened , and a tall , slender , beautiful girl entered , clad in deep mourning , with a wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She came with a graceful , but timid air , towards Mr. Stillinghast ; and holding out her hand , said in a low , sweet tone , " My uncle ? " " Yes , I have the misfortune to be your uncle ; how do you do ? " " I am well , sir , I thank you , " she replied , whilst she cast down her eyes to conceal the tears which suffused them . " I wo n't pretend , " he said , at last , " to say you are welcome , or that I am glad to see you , because I should lie ; but you are here now , and I ca n't help it , neither can you , I suppose ; therefore , settle yourself as quickly as possible in your new way of living . She will show you what is necessary , and both of you keep as much out of my way as possible . " He then took his candlestick , lighted his candle , and retired , leaving the poor girl standing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . For a moment she looked after him ; then a sharp cry burst from her lips , and she turned to rush out into the wintry storm , when she suddenly felt herself enfolded in some one 's arms , who led her to the warmest corner of the sofa , untied her bonnet , folded back the dishevelled curls , and kissed the tears away from her cold , white cheeks . It was May , whose heart had been gushing over with tenderness and sympathy , who had longed to throw her arms around her , and , welcome her home the moment she entered the house , but who dared not interfere with her uncle 's peculiar ways , or move until he led . " Do not mind him , dear Helen ; it is his ways : he seems rough and stern , but in reality he is kind and good , dear , " she exclaimed . " You are very kind ; but , oh , I did not expect such a reception as this . I hoped for something very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill me , " she sobbed , struggling to disengage her hand from Mary 's . " Yes you will , dear , " pleaded May . " Uncle Stillinghast is like our old clock -- it never strikes the hour true , yet the hands are always right to a second . So do try , and not to mind . " " Who are you ? " " I ? " asked May , looking with a smile of astonishment at her . " I am your cousin , May Brooke ; an orphan like yourself , dear , to whom our uncle has given house and home . " " Are you happy here ? " " Very happy . I have things to contend with sometimes which are not altogether agreeable , but I trip along over them just as I do over muddy places in the street , for fear , you know , of soiling my robe , if I floundered in them ! " said May , laughing . Helen did not understand the hidden and beautiful meaning couched under May 's expressions ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her early childhood , and had almost forgotten that she was " to carry it unspotted to the judgment-seat of Christ . " " I am glad you are here -- such a nice , soft-voiced little one , " said Helen , passing her long , white hand over May 's head . " I am glad , too ; so come with me , and take something warm . Your supper is on the kitchen hearth . Come , " said May , rising . " Where -- to the kitchen ? Do you eat in the kitchen ? " " I lunch there sometimes ; it is a very nice one . " " Excuse me ; I do not wish any thing . " " But a cup of hot tea , and some nice toast , after your fatiguing , wet journey , " argued May . " Nothing , I thank you , " was the haughty reply . " Perhaps you wish to retire ? " " Yes ! Oh , that I could go to sleep , and never wake again , " she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear , " said May , gently , " and then it will soothe you to reflect that each trial has its heavenly mission ; and the thorns which pierce us here give birth to flowers in heaven , which angels weave into the crown for which we contend ! " " I am not a saint ! " was the curt reply . " But you are a Catholic ? " asked May , chilled by her cold manner . " Yes , " she replied , languidly , " but I am too ill to talk . " Refusing all aid , after they got into their chamber , Helen disrobed herself ; and while May 's earnest soul was pouring out at the foot of the cross its adoration and homage , she threw herself on her knees , leaned her head on her arm , and yielded to a perfect storm of grief and fury ; which , although unacknowledged , raged none the less , while her burning tears , unsanctified by humility , or resignation , embittered the selfish heart which they should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May slept but little that night . The low sobs and shivering sighs of Helen , disturbed and troubled her , and she longed to go to her , and whisper in her ear all those arguments and hopeful promises which she felt would have consoled her under the same circumstances ; but it was a wild , defiant kind of grief , which she thought had better exhaust itself , so she lay quite still until towards dawn , when it ceased , and the sound of low regular breathing , assured her that she had fallen asleep . She rose up gently , wrapped her wadded gown about her , lowered the blinds , and closed the shutters , that the light might not disturb Helen ; then laid an additional blanket over her , for it was bitter cold , and placed the candle which she had lighted behind an old-timed Chinese screen , that formed a sort of a niche in a corner of the room , which she , in her pious thoughtfulness , had converted into an oratory . A small round table , covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , a porcelain shelf for holy water and her prayer-book . Over it hung an old and rare crucifix of carved ivory , stained with color which time had softened to the hues of life , while the features wore that mingled look of divine dignity and human woe which but few artists , in their delineations of the " thorn-crowned head , " can successfully depict . It had been brought from Spain many years before by her father , with a cabinet picture of Mater Dolorosa , which now hung over it . Both were invaluable , not only on account of their artistic excellence and age , but as mementos of her father , and incentives to devotion . Thither she now went to offer the first fruits of the day to heaven in mingled thanksgiving and prayer . Almost numbed with the intense cold , she felt inclined to abridge her devotions , but she remembered the cold , dreary journey of the holy family from Nazareth to Bethlehem -- the ruggedness of the road , and the bitter winds which swept through the mountain defiles around them -- then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shepherds beside the manger where Jesus Christ in the humility of his sacred humanity reposed . She pictured to herself the Virgin Mother in the joyful mystery of her maternity , bending over him with a rapture too sublime for words ; and St. Joseph -- wonderfully dignified as the guardian of divinity , and of her whom the most high had honored , leaning on his staff near them . " Shall I dare complain ? " thought May , while these blessed images came into her heart warming it with generous love . " No sweet and divine Lord , let all human ills , discomforts , repinings , and love of self vanish before these sweet contemplations . With thee , in Bethlehem , poverty and sorrow grow light ; and the weariness of the rough ways of life no more dismay . Let me follow with thee , sweet mother , after his footsteps , until Calvary is crowned by a sacrifice and victim so divine that angels , men , and earth wonder ; let me , with thee , linger by his cross , follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrection . " Do not let us suppose that May , in the overflowing of her devout soul , forgot others , and thought only of herself ; oh , no ! that charity , without which , all good works are as " sounding brass , " animated her faith ; as tenderly and lovingly she plead at the mercy seat for her stern old guardian ; and although she knew that he scorned all religion , and would have given her rough jibes and scoffs for her charity , she prayed none the less for his salvation ; and now she sought Heaven to strengthen and console the wounded and bereaved stranger who had come amongst them . By the time she left her oratory , she had laid by a store of strength and happiness , more than sufficient for the trials of the day . Yet May was not faultless . She had a quickness and sharpness of temper , which very often tempted her to the indulgence of malice and uncharitableness ; and a proud spirit , which could scarcely brook injustice . But these natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty sense of responsibility to Almighty God -- a feeling of compassion and forgiveness for the frailties and infirmities of others , and a generous and discriminating consideration for the errors of all . When Mr. Stillinghast came down that morning , everything was bright and comfortable in the sitting-room . A clear fire burned in the grate ; the toast and coffee sent up an inviting odor ; and the table was spread with the whitest of linen , on which the cups and saucers were neatly arranged . The morning paper was drying on a chair by the fire , and over all , flickered the glorious sunshine , as it gushed like a golden flood through the clustering geraniums in the window . " Good morning , sir ! " said May , blithely , as she came in from the kitchen with a covered plate in her hand . " Good morning , " he growled ; " give me my breakfast . " " I thought you 'd like a relish for your breakfast , sir , and I broiled a few slices of beef ; see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plate , and placing it before him . " Humph ! well , do n't do it again . I can not afford such extravagance ; I must curtail my expenses . ' Gad ! if I should have another beggar thrown on my hands , we must starve , " he said , bitterly . May did not relish this speech at all ; up rose the demon , pride , in her soul , instigating her to a sharp retort , and vindictive anger ; but she thought of Bethlehem , and grew calm . " I hope not , sir , " she said , gently . " You have cast bread on the waters ; after many days it will return unto you -- perhaps in an hour , and at a time , dear uncle , when it will be much needed . " " Fudge , fudge ! " he said , testily ; " I -- I cast bread on the waters , do I ? Well , I am doing what is equally as foolish -- it is truly like throwing bread into a fish-pond ; but where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorly last night , and I would not awaken her this morning , " said May , diverted in spite of herself . " How do you know she did n't sleep , pray ? did she tell you so ? " " No , sir ; I heard her weeping all night , and , indeed , sir , I hope you 'll speak kindly to Helen when you come in this evening , because she feels so very sorrowful on account of her recent losses , and -- and --  " " And what , Miss Pert ? " " Her dependence , sir ! " said May , bravely . " She 's no more dependent than you are . " " No , sir ; but -- but then I am happy somehow . It is the state of life Almighty God has chosen for me , and I should be very ungrateful to him and you if I repined and grumbled , " said May , cheerfully . " If He chose it for you , I suppose he chose it for her too ; for I did n't . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal sitting up to watch people crying , and tell what's-her-name to rise when you do ; she 's no better than you are ; and let her take her share of the duties of the house to-morrow , " said Mr. Stillinghast , surlily . " Helen will soon feel at home , sir , no doubt ; only do -- do , dear uncle , try and speak kindly to her for a few days , on account of her lonely situation . " " Fudge ! eat your breakfast . Hold your plate here for some of this broiled beef , and eat it to prevent its being wasted . " " Thank you , sir , " said May , laughing , as he laid a large slice on her plate , which , however she did not touch , but put it aside for Helen ; then observing that Mr. Stillinghast had finished his breakfast , she wheeled his chair nearer the fire , handed him his pipe , and the newspaper , and ran upstairs , to see if Helen was awake . But she still slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments by her pillow , to gaze at her . " She is like the descriptions which the old writers give us of the Blessed Virgin , " thought May ; " that high , beautifully chiseled nose ; those waves of golden hair ; those calm finely cut lips , that high , snowy brow , and those long , shadowy eyelashes , lying so softly on her fair cheeks , oh , how beautiful ! It seems almost like a vision , only -- only I know that this is a poor frail child of earth ; but , oh ! immaculate Mother , cherish , guard , and guide her , that her spirit may be conformed to thine . " " I suppose , " said Mr. Stillinghast , when May came down , " that you 'll go trotting presently through the snow and ice to church . " " No , sir ; I fear I can not go this morning , " said May . " Can not go ? well , really ! I wonder if an earthquake will swallow me before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawing on his boots . " I trust not , sir ; I 'd be happier to go , but Helen is a stranger , and she might awake when I am gone , and want something . To-morrow we will go together . " " So , there 's to be a regular popish league in my house , under my very nose , " he growled . " Which will do you no evil , dear uncle , in soul , body , or estate ; but you had better wrap this comfort around your throat ; I finished knitting it last night for you , " said May , in her quiet , cheerful way . " For me , eh ? It is very nice and soft -- so -- that does very well , " said Mr. Stillinghast , while one of those rare gleams , like sunshine , shot over his countenance . " I shall be very happy all day , sir , " said May , gathering up the cups and saucers . " Why ? " " Because , sir , I thought -- you might --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , eh ? I shall do neither ; I shall wear it . I have not forgot that confounded attack of quinsy I had last winter , nor the doctor 's bill that followed it , and which was worse on me than the choking I got , " said Mr. Stillinghast , while the old , grim look settled on his face again . He went away , down to his warehouse on the wharf , to grip and wrestle with gain , and barter away the last remnants of his best and holiest instincts , little by little ; exchanging hopes of heaven for perishable things , and crushing down the angel conscience , who would have led him safely to eternal life , for the accumulated and unholy burthen of Mammon . And May , singing cheerily , cleaned , and swept and rubbed , and polished , and touched up things a little here and there , until the room was arranged with exquisite taste and neatness ; then took her work-basket , in which lay a variety of little infant 's socks , and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pure and soft that even she touched them daintily , as she lifted them out to find her needles , and sat down by the fire . " Now for a nubae , " she said , throwing on stitch after stitch ; " ladies who frequent theatres and balls find them indispensable : this shall be the handsomest one of the season -- worth , at least four dollars . " CHAPTER III . THE MORNING ERRAND . After the slender ivory needles had traversed the fleecy mesh backwards and forwards some three or four times , May suddenly bethought herself of Helen , and laying her work carefully down in her basket , she ran upstairs to see if she was awake . Turning the knob of the door softly , she entered with a noiseless step , and went towards the bed ; but a low , merry laugh , and a " good morning , " assured her that her kind caution had all been needless . " Dear Helen , how are you to-day ? " " Very well , thank you , little lady , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Half-past nine . You need your breakfast , I am sure . Shall I fetch it to you ? " " Just tell me , first , have you a fire downstairs ? " " A very nice one ! " " And we ca n't have one here ? " " Decidedly -- no . " " Decidedly , then , I shall accompany you downstairs , if that horrid old man is gone . Oh , I never was so terrified in my life ; I thought he 'd beat me last night . Is he gone ? " " Uncle Stillinghast has been gone an hour or more , " replied May , gravely . " Do tell me , May , does he always jump and snarl so at folk as he did at me ? " inquired Helen ; seriously . " I see that I must initiate you , dear Helen , in the mysteries of our domicile , " said May , pleasantly . " I must be plain with you , and hope you will not feel wounded at my speech . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , disagreeable things ; and his manners , generally , do not invite affection . But , on the other hand , I do not think his health is quite sound , and I have heard that in his early life he met with some terrible disappointments , which have doubtless soured him . He knows nothing of the consolations of religion , or of those divine hopes which would sweeten the bitter fountains of his heart , like the leaves which the prophet threw into Marah 's wave . His commerce is altogether with and of the world , and he spares no time for superfluous feelings : but notwithstanding all this there is , I am sure , a warm , bright spot in his heart , or he never would have taken you and me from the cold charities of the world , to shelter and care for us . Now , dear , you must endeavor to fall in with his humor . " " And if I should happen to please him ? " inquired Helen , sweeping back the golden curls from her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of duties well done , " replied May , looking with her full , earnest eyes , in Helen 's face . " It is a bad thing , dear , to stir up bitterness and strife in a soul which is not moored in the faith and love of God ; as it is a good work to keep it , as far as we can , from giving further offence to heaven by provoking its evil instincts , and inciting it , as it were , to fresh rebellions . But I am sure , dear Helen , you will endeavor to do right . " " Yes , " said Helen , slowly , " it will be the best policy ; but , May Brooke , I feel as if I am in a panther 's den , or , better still , it 's like Beauty and the Beast , only , instead of an enchanted lover , I have an excessively cross and impracticable old uncle to be amiable to . Does he give you enough to eat ? " " Have I a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; I confess you look in tolerably good plight . Do you ever see company ? " " Not often . My uncle 's habits are those of a recluse . When he comes home from the bustle of the city , it would be a great annoyance to have company around him : in fact , I do not care for it , and , I dare say , we shall get on merrily without it . " " I dare say I shall die . Have you a piano here ? " May laughed outright , and answered in the negative . " Well , how in the name of wonder do you manage to get on ? " asked Helen , folding her hands together , and looking puzzled . " Just as you will have to , by and by , " she replied ; " but come , pin your collar on , and come down to breakfast . " " I must say my prayers first , " said Helen , dropping down suddenly on her knees , and carelessly blessing herself , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got up , saying :  --  " But you keep servants , do n't you ? " " I have heretofore attended to the domestic affairs of the house , " replied May , shocked by her cousin 's levity . " Oh , heavens ! I shall lose my identity ! I shall grow coarse and fat ; my hands will become knobby and red ; oh , dear ! but perhaps you will not expect me to assist you ? " " And why ? " asked May , while the indignant blood flushed her cheeks , and her impulse to say something sharp and mortifying to the young worldling 's pride , was strong within her ; but she thought of the mild and lowly Virgin , and the humility of her DIVINE SON , and added , in a quiet tone , " Uncle Stillinghast will certainly expect you to make yourself useful . " " And if I do n't ? " " I fear you will rue it . " " Well , this looks more civilized ! " said Helen , after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful those geraniums are ; and how charming the fire looks and feels ! " " Here is your breakfast , dear Helen ; eat it while it is warm , " said May , coming in with a small tray , which she arranged on a stand behind her . " Thank you , dear little lady ; really this coffee is delicious , and the toast is very nice , " said Helen , eating her breakfast with great gout . " I am glad you relish it ; and now that you are comfortably fixed , if you will excuse me , I will run out for an hour or so ; I have some little matters to attend to down street . You will find a small bamboo tub in the next room , when you finish eating , in which you can wash up your cup and saucer , and plate . " " Yes , dame Trot , I will endeavor to do so ! " said Helen , with a droll grimace . " The tea-towel is folded up on the first shelf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said May , laughing , as she took up her work-basket , and went upstairs to get her bonnet and wrappings , and make other arrangements ; then drawing on her walking-boots , and twisting a nubae around her throat , she went out , with a bundle in her hand , and walked with a brisk pace down the street . She soon approached a gothic church -- a church of the Liguorian Missions , and at the distance of half a square , heard the solemn and heavenly appeals of the organ , rolling in soft aerial billows past her . She quickened her steps , and pushing gently against the massive door , went in . A solemn mass was being offered , and a requiem chanted , for the repose of the soul of a member of the arch-confraternity of the Immaculate Heart of MARY . " I thank thee , dear Jesus , for giving me this opportunity to adore thee , " whispered May , kneeling in the crowd , " for all thy tender mercies , this is the most touching and consoling to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touching robes of propitiation , to offer THYSELF for the eternal repose of the souls of thy departed children . " The crowd increasing , and finding it impossible to penetrate through the masses in the aisle , she quietly edged her way along , until she came to the steps leading to the side gallery , which she ascended , and happily obtained a place where she had a full view of all that was passing below . On a plain catafalque , covered with black velvet , in front of the sanctuary and altar , rested a coffin . It was made of pine , and painted white . A few white lilies and evergreens were scattered among the lights which burned around it ; and May knew that some young virgin had gone to her espousals in the kingdom of the LAMB . Half of the coffin-lid was turned back , and as she looked more attentively on the marble features , turned to strange and marvellous beauty by the great mystery -- death -- she recognized them . They belonged to a poor crippled girl , who had suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been almost dependent on the alms of the faithful for her daily support . " What a change for thee , poor Magdalen ! " whispered May , as she gazed down through her tears . " I look on the pale vestment of clay in which you suffered , and know that for you the awful mystery is solved . Thorns no more wound your heart ; poverty and disease have done their worst ; while far up , beyond the power of earth and evil , your destiny is accomplished . A poor mendicant no longer , the King of glory himself ushered you into the unrevealed splendors of that region which mortal eye hath never seen . You have beheld the glorious face of the sacred humanity of Jesus Christ ; your eyes have seen the Queen of heaven ; and the veiled vision of the Eternal Father has greeted you . Oh , what cheer ! Oh , what hope , to make joyful the purifying sufferings of purgatory ! and now , on your altar , Jesus , the high-priest and powerful Lord , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedy liberation and admission into the beatific vision . Oh , Magdalen ! how art thou exalted ! how beyond all imperial splendor and royal power art thou lifted up ! " And while the divine mystery approached its consummation , still upward arose the voice of the church in plaintive chants , interceding for the departed , who , in the " suffering church " rejoiced with a mournful rapture amidst its patient agony which would ere long be exchanged from dreary Calvary to an eternal Thabor . But now the awful moment arrived ; the Lord Jesus had come ; and although they saw him veiled under the form of bread , they knew HE was there ; they felt that august presence thrilling down like a still , small voice , into their souls , It is I ; and the aspirations of that kneeling crowd went forth in solemn adoration ; and returning sweetness filled each devout mind with benediction , which flowing thence again to its divine source , offered worthy homage to the LAMB . A ray of wintry sunlight stole through a curtained window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dead virgin , as she lay an image of heavenly repose . May felt that it was a type of the brightness which would soon crown her ; and while a flood of warm and joyful rapture flowed into her soul , she exulted in the thought that she , too , was a member of the household of faith . It was a profitable time to May ; for death was suddenly stripped of its thrilling horrors ; its gaunt outlines were softened and brightened , and she thought of him as a tireless and faithful guide , who led souls beyond the dark tide , over the lonely and shadowy ways , and through the fathomless abyss , to the very portals of eternal rest . She had almost forgotten the object which brought her out that morning , so absorbed was she in the contemplation of the scene she had witnessed ; until on rising to leave the church after the divine rites were over , her bundle fell to her feet . She snatched it up , ashamed of her carelessness , and , slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Picking her way through snow and ice , she came to a neat fancy store , and went in . Behind the counter stood a neat , pleasant old lady assorting worsteds , who smiled a welcome the moment she saw who it was who had entered . " Ah , my dear Miss May how do you do ? come near the stove and sit down . It is not yet our busy time of day , and we can have a nice chat . " " You will please excuse me now , dear Mrs. Tabb , I have been away much longer from home than I expected , and must hurry off , as I have another errand to do . I have brought more of those little zephyr worsted shirts , four pair of socks , and two or three mats -- lamp mats , " said May , unfolding her bundle . " Bless me , dear child ! you are making a fortune . I have sold all that you left with me two weeks ago ; and after deducting my commission , here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclaimed May , joyfully . " Every one , and more ordered . The way was this . Two fine ladies , who both have infants , came in one day , and both wanted the things ; but both could n't have them , and neither would purchase a part ; so at last one offered two dollars more than the other , and got them , " said Mrs. Tabb , deliberately taking a pinch of snuff . " Oh , Mrs. Tabb ! dear me , it was more than they were worth . " " Not to her , my child . She would have given ten dollars rather than not get them ; and she 's so rich she do n't know what to do with her money . So these will just do for Mrs. Osmond , who , I expect , will call this very day for them . " I do not feel quite satisfied , " said May ; " but as it was all voluntary on her part , I suppose there 's nothing very wrong in it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , then paid for her pride and ostentation , which is the way with all worldly people , and which , thank God , I am not responsible for . " " Thank you , dear Mrs. Tabb ; you are very kind to take so much trouble for me . I must run away now . I shall knit up all my worsted this week , so please have another package ready for me when I come again . Good by . " " Good by , Miss May . I declare , if you do n't hop about through the snow like a robin ; there -- she 's gone . Now , I should like to know what business old Stillinghast 's niece has to be doing such work as this ,  - -  the nipping old miser ; and I 'd like to know what she does with the money . " And so should we ; therefore , we will leave Mrs. Tabb to her cogitations , follow May , and find out . CHAPTER IV . AUNT MABEL . Fearing she would not have time to accomplish all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascertain the hour ; but it was only half-past twelve , and , with a light heart and fleet step , she treaded her way through the hurrying and busy crowds , crossed B --  --  Street , then in the height of its din , uproar , and traffic , and soon found herself among the dark , narrow thoroughfares , and large gloomy warehouses of the lower part of the city . Turning a corner , she looked up and down , but finding herself at fault , hurried into another street , where she encountered quite a procession of merchants , old , young , and middle-aged , on their way to the Exchange , to learn the latest European news , which a steamer , just arrived , had brought in . Many passed her with a glance of surprise ; some laughed , and gazed into her face with looks of insolent curiosity : while others regarded her with unconcern and indifference . " It is strange , " thought May , shrinking back into a doorway , " I was so sure of the way ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how am I to get on ? Sir , " she said to a benevolent-looking old gentleman , whose white hairs and respectable appearance were a guarantee of protection to her , " will you be so obliging as to direct me to the wood-yard of Carter &; Co . I believe I have lost my way . " " Certainly , my dear , " said the old man , with a pleasant smile ; " I am on my way to the Exchange , and shall be obliged to go right by it , so if you will walk by my side , or take my arm , I will leave you at their office door . " " Thank you , " replied May , as with a feeling of safety she laid her little hand on the fatherly arm , so kindly offered . Some ten minutes ' walk brought them to the office of Carter &; Co. , and while May stood an instant , with her veil lifted , to thank her conductor , she saw a face approaching through the crowd -- then lost , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . The cold , stern eyes were turned another way , yet she felt that they had recognized her ; but it passed on , without seeming to notice her . " Uncle Stillinghast ! " thought May , while her little fluttering heart felt an icy chill pass over it ; " what will Uncle Stillinghast think ? Oh , how stupid I was , not to wait until they all got by , then look for the place myself . Oh dear , dear ! I hope he did not see me . " " What will you have , ma'am ? " asked the clerk , coming forward , more anxious to shut out the cold air from his comfortable snuggery than to effect sales . " I wish to purchase a quarter of a cord of wood , sir . " " Oak , hickory , or pine , ma'am ? " " Oak , if you please . " " It is just now six and a half per cord , " insinuated the clerk . " Yes , sir ; here is the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " If you can wait until it is carted , ma'am , certainly , " replied the young man , taking the half-eagle she offered him , and returning the change . " I will wait , and you will oblige me by sending a sawyer also . " The young man went out to give the necessary orders , and in a little while a sawyer made his appearance at the door , and announced that " all was ready , if anyone would be after telling them where to go . " " You will follow this lady , Dennis , " said the indefatigable clerk , pointing to May . " Where to , ma'am ? " inquired Dennis . " To the north-western section of the city . I shall stop at one or two stores in Howard Street , but you can go on slowly , and I will overtake you . " May then made a few inquiries of the young man ere she bade him good morning , and went away , glad to escape from a portion of the city where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrow streets , filled her with apprehension . When they came to Howard Street , May stepped into a shoe-store , and purchased a pair of warm carpet-shoes , nicely wadded inside ; then flitted out , and ran into a drygoods emporium , where she bought a cheap , but soft woolen shawl , of a brilliant scarlet yellow , and black palm-leaf pattern , and a pair of long yarn stockings ; then gathering her bundles close together on her arm , she hurried away to overtake the wood . When the carter came to Biddle Street , he stopped his horse , and declared " he would not go a step further with such a small load unless she paid him something extra ; he had come a mile already . " " You have not much further to go , " plead May . " I wo n't go another step , " he said , with an oath . " And I will not submit to extortion , " said May , speaking gently , but firmly , while she fixed her calm , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cart , and informed myself at the office of the charges you are authorized to make , and if you do not proceed , I will complain of you . " Intimidated by her resolute manner , the baffled driver muttered and swore , while he applied the whip to his horse 's flanks , and pursued the route indicated by May until they came to the very verge of the city limits , where grand old oaks still waved their broad limbs in primeval vigor over sloping hills and picturesque declivities . Near a rustic bridge , which spanned a frozen stream , stood a few scattered huts , or cottages , towards the poorest of which she directed her footsteps . Standing on one of the broken flags , which formed a rude sort of pathway to the door , she waited until the wood was emptied near by , and paying the man , requested the sawyer to commence sawing it forthwith ; then lifting the latch softly , she entered the humble tenement . It contained one small room , poorly furnished , and with but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few coals on the hearth , trying in vain to warm her half-frozen extremities . " Why , Aunt Mabel , have you no fire ? " said May , going close to her , and laying her hand on her shoulder . " Oh , Miss May ! Lord bless you , honey ! You come in like a spirit . No , indeed , honey ; I ai n't had none to speak on these two days . " " And your feet are almost frozen , " said May , with a pitying glance . " They 's mighty cold , misses ; but sit down , and let me look at you ; it will warm me up , " said the old woman , trying to smile . " Let me put these on your poor old feet first , " said May , kneeling down , and drawing off the tattered shoes from her feet , while she chafed them briskly with her hands ; then slipped the soft warm stockings and slippers on them , ere the old creature could fully comprehend her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the bowed and shivering form . With a blended expression of gratitude and amazement , old Mabel looked at her feet , then at the shawl , then at May , who stood off enjoying it , and finally covered her face with her hand , and wept outright . " Now , indeed , Aunt Mabel , this is not right ; why , I thought you 'd be pleased , " said May , lifting up her paralyzed hand , which lay helplessly on her knees , and smoothing it gently between her own . " Pleased , honey ! I am so full I 'm chokin ' , I b'lieve . What you do all this for Miss May ? I 'm only a poor old nigger ; I got no friends ; I can never do nuffin for you . What you do it for ? " she sobbed . " Just because you are poor , because you are friendless , because you are old and black , Aunt Mabel . And more than that , I shall be well paid for my pains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said May , cheerfully . " I used to hear buckra parson read out of the Book , when I was down in the plantation , that whomsoever give to the poor lend it to the Lord ; is that it , honey ? " she asked , wiping the tears from the furrows of her swarthy cheeks . " That is just it , my dear old aunty , so you have found out how selfish I am , after all . You are the creature of God as well as I ; in His sight your soul is as precious as mine . We are truly brethren in our eternal interests . Then you are very old and helpless , which makes me pity you . Now , let me have some wood in here , and make you a fire -- a regular , rousing fire . " " Maybe so -- maybe so , " said old Mabel , thoughtfully ; " but , look here , Miss May , what that you say ' bout wood , eh ? You gwine out to cut some of the trees down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing and chuckling , highly diverted at the idea . " No , ma'am , for there is a load of good wood at your door , which is now being sawed for your benefit . " " Did you do that too , Miss May ? " " Never mind who did it , " said May , who ran out and gathered up a few small pieces of wood , which she hurried in with , and soon kindled a bright blaze on the hearth : after which , she requested the sawyer to bring in two large logs to lay behind . " Now , Aunt Mabel , are you comfortable ? " she inquired , as she drew a low chair up by the old woman 's side , and seated herself in it . " Ah , honey , if you could only know how good the warm blood feels creeping up to my shaky old heart , you would n't ask me ; and this beautiful shawl , Miss May ! it ' minds me so of the bright swamp flowers in old Ca'lina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had good times then , honey ; but I ca n't say nuffin . I feel it all here , and I hope your heavenly Father will make it out , and pay you back ten thousand times , " said old Mabel , laying her shrivelled hand on her heart . " Your Father and God too , Aunt Mabel , " said May , leaning towards her , and lifting her sunshiny face close to hers . " No , missis ; I ai n't good enough . He do n't think of the likes of me . " " Oh , Aunt Mabel , you must not say that . You are his creature , and from him proceeded your life and soul : for you , as well as me , his divine Son died that we might inherit eternal life . He knows no distinction in the distribution of his divine charity ; the humblest slave , and the most powerful king , are alike the objects of his tender solicitude . And if I , a poor frail child of earth , pity and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , the sweet and merciful Jesus , regard with tender compassion the soul for whose salvation he has shed his precious blood . " " Do your religion teach the same to every body , honey ; or is you only sayin ' so of your own ' cord ? " inquired old Mabel , wistfully . " Our holy religion teaches it to all . Into her safe and ancient fold she invites all ; and when we know that this fold is the kingdom established on earth by Jesus Christ himself , how we ought to fly , and never rest until we are gathered in . In this divine faith we are taught to ' love one another , ' without regard to race , color , or nation , and bring forth fruits unto righteousness ; which , if we fail to do , we disobey ,  - -  we bring scandal on it , and the love of God is not in us , " said May , earnestly . " Fruits unto righteousness , which mean good works , I reckon , honey ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ du n no , but it do seem like ' tinkling cymbals , ' and ' sounding brass ' to go preaching the gospel to poor sufferin ' folks like me , and telling of ' em to be patient and resigned , and suffer the will of Heaven , and all that , if they do n't give the naked clothes to cover ' em , and the hungry food to nourish ' em , and to the frozen fire to warm ' em . I tell you what , Miss May , such religion ai nt no ' count it ' pears to me , and jest minds me of a apple-tree used to grow in ole mass'r 's garden ; it would get its leaf and blossom ; like the rest on ' em , but never a sign of apple did it bear ; so one day ole missis tells him he better cut it down for firewood -- and so it was , and split up , and sent to my cabin ; and I tell you what , honey , I was glad , ' cause somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Aunt Mabel , if the true love of God is not in us , we are like fruit-trees cursed with barrenness -- only fit to be cast into the fire , " said May , sighing . " Well , honey , I never was a professor , ' cause I never yet heard professors agreein ' . The Baptists hated the Methodists ; the Methodists hated the Presbyterians ; the Protestants looked down , like , on all of ' em , and they all hated each other . I never could understand it , so I thought I 'd go to heaven my own way . " " Well , Aunt Mabel , leaving these to their discords , " said May , smiling at her rude but truthful description , " did the thought never enter your mind that Jesus Christ might have established a faith and rule on earth to guide souls , which would be upheld and governed by His Holy Spirit until the end of time ? " " I often thought he ought to , honey ; but I 'm a poor ignorant creetur -- what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did , Aunt Mabel ; and from the time he established it until now , during eighteen hundred years it has never changed ; it will never change until it exchanges for eternity its reign upon earth . All other religions were founded by men ,  - -  wicked , blood-thirsty , ambitious men , who wanted a broad license to sin , and who reserved only such fragments of our divine faith , as would give plausibility to their new doctrines without fettering theirs with responsibilities to spiritual tribunals . This is why all these discords , exist among professors . In leaving the one faith which acknowledges one Lord and one baptism , they have hewn out for themselves ' broken cisterns which hold no water . ' But do you understand me ? " " Yes , honey , that I do . But I 'm too old and ignorant to hear larning and argumentation . I want the faith of Jesus Christ ; and it ' pears to me that I never he'erd the true story until now . Whatever it is , your religion suits me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gwine down , honey , to the valley and shadow of death , and the way 'll be mighty dark without the help of the Lord . " " He will be your guide and staff , Aunt Mabel , when the dark hour comes , " said May , dashing a tear from her cheek . " But I must go away now , and I want you to think a great deal about Almighty God , until I come again ; then tell me if you think His word and promise are worthy of belief . Turn it over in your mind ; view it in every way , and let me hear the result . I see your grandchild coming with a bundle of faggots ; here is a little change to buy something -- tea , or whatever you want . " " Good by , missis . Lord bless you and reward you . " But May was out of the cot , going at full speed towards home , which was not very far distant . Mr. Stillinghast had purchased the house some thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city . It was then a villa , and had been built by a French refugee , who , in those days of courtly customs , was famed for his elegant hospitality . One of the old noblesse , and but little acquainted with the practical management of business affairs , he became embarrassed , and was finally compelled to dispose of his elegant house and furniture , and retire to a life of obscurity and poverty . But the city was growing around it rapidly ; in a few more years it would be hemmed in and walled around by streets and houses . Mr. Stillinghast fretted and chafed ; then calculated its increased value , and grew almost savage at the idea that he would be dead and forgotten when heaps of gold would be paid down for the few feet of earth it covered . When May went in , glowing with exercise and happiness , she found Helen moping over the grate , in which the fire was nearly extinguished . " Why , Helen , it is very cold here , is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why on earth did you not step into the next room and get coal ? There is a hod full on the hearth . " " I am not in the habit of fetching coal and building fires , " she said , haughtily . " And supposing that I was , I presume you waited for me , " said May , with a feeling of exasperation she could not control . Then laying off her bonnet and wrappings , she went out and brought in the hod , emptied it into the grate , let down the ashes , and put up the blower ; and by the time she finished , the recollection of the fire which she had kindled that morning in old Mabel 's cottage came like a sweet memory into her heart , and the bitterness passed away . " When do we dine ? I suppose the ogre of the castle will be in soon ! " said Helen . " My uncle generally dines down town ; and I beg , Helen , that you will speak more respectfully of him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes ? " screamed Helen . " Yes , " said May , laughing at her cousin 's consternation . " We can dine now . I have some cold roast beef , bread and butter , and a pie , left from yesterday . " " Oh , heavens ! what a bill of fare ; but let us have it , for I am famishing . " " Before you get even that , my dear , you must help about a little . Here , spread the cloth , and cut the bread ; I will do the rest . " " Spread the cloth , and cut the bread ! I do n't know how ! " " Learn , " said May , half diverted , half angry with the selfish one , as she handed her the tablecloth , which was put on one-sided , while the bread was cut in chunks . When May came in from the pantry , a butler 's room as it used to be in the time of the old marquis , Helen was crying over a bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slice the bread . " This is a bad business , " said May , binding it up . " Helen , I really feel very sorry for you . You will have so many disheartening trials in your new way of life ; but keep a brave heart -- I will learn you all that I know , if you are only willing . " " Thank you , May , that is very nice . I do n't care much about learning such low pursuits ; but give me something to eat , " was her polite reply . May crossed herself when she sat down , and asked the blessing of God on the food she was to partake of . Helen fell to , without a thought of anything but the cravings of hunger . They conversed cheerfully together ; and while Helen rallied her cousin on her long absence . May thought , more than once , with sad forebodings , of her encounter with her uncle down town that morning . But she determined to keep her own secrets ; for she well knew that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of old Mabel , her visits , and be perhaps furiously angry at the traffic she was carrying on with Mrs. Tabb . CHAPTER V. PAST AND PRESENT . The day waned ; and that soft , silent hour , which the Scotch so beautifully call the " gloaming " was over the earth . Subdued shadows crept in through the windows , and mingled with the red glow which the fire-light diffused throughout the room , and together they formed a phantasmagoria , which seemed to ebb and flow like a noiseless tide . And with the shadows , memories of the past floated in , and knocked with their spirit-hands softly and gently against the portals of those two hearts which life 's tempest had thrown together . Helen wept . " Do you remember your mother , dear Helen ? " asked May , while she folded her hand in her own . " No and yes . If it is a memory , it is so indistinct that it seems like a dream ; and yet , how often at this hour does a vision come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding kneeling child against her bosom , to whom she taught a whispered prayer to the madonna ! And the child seems me -- and the lady , my mother ; but it flits away , and then I think it is a dream of long ago . " " Angel mothers ! Oh , how beautiful the thought -- angel mothers ! " said May , in a low , earnest tone . " Do you know , I think with so much pleasure of going to mine ! Even when I was a little child , it was sufficient for my old maummy to say , ' Ah , how grieved your poor mamma would be , if she was here ! ' " " Do you remember her ? " " Not at all . She died when I was a little wailing infant . Four months afterwards , my father , who was an officer in the navy , died at Canton . He never saw me . " " And you have been here ever since ? " " Ever since . A faithful servant of my mother 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in my helplessness to my uncle for protection . But he , unused to interruptions , would not have received me , only the news which came of my father 's death , left him no alternative ; so my old maummy remained to nurse me , and keep house for him . I can never express how much I owe her . She was ignorant in worldly knowledge , and only a poor slave ; but in her simple and earnest faith , she knew much of the science of the saints . With a mother 's tenderness , she shielded me from spiritual ignorance and error , and led my soul to the green pastures of the fold of Christ . " " Had you no other instructor ? " inquired Helen . " Oh yes . Father Fabian . He instructed me in the divine mysteries of our holy faith . He has been my director ever since I was a little child . But how was it with you , dear Helen ? " " I have lived a great deal with Protestants , May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father was a major in the army -- the only brother of the old man here . He was a Catholic , but he was always so full of official business that he had very little time to attend to religion , and all that kind of thing . His official duties engrossed his time entirely . But he always impressed it on my mind that it would be extremely dishonorable not to avow myself a Catholic when occasions demanded it ; and I believe he would have been pleased to see me practise my faith . I was sent to a convent school in Louisiana when I was ten years of age , but was suddenly removed , to accompany my father to Boston , to which place he was ordered . There I was surrounded by persons of fashion and position , who made eyes at me when I told them I was a Catholic , and declared I would lose caste if I went to a church which was attended only by the ' low Irish , and servant girls . ' Then I heard Catholics derided as superstitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew ashamed of being one . My father was too busy to think of me ,  - -  he always saw me well-dressed and in good company , and imagined that all else was going well with me ; while I , proud , flattered , and enjoying the world , fancied that it was of little importance while I was so young . My poor father was a brave and gallant officer ; and I think when he sometimes declared with a dignified air that ' he and his daughter were Catholics , ' it was more from the feeling which makes a soldier swear by his flag , than any higher motive . This has been my religious training ; but my dear , indulgent father is dead -- gone for ever , and I am here -- here -- Oh , May ! " and Helen wept on May 's shoulder . " And how , dear Helen , did my uncle die ? " said May , in a tone of tender sympathy . " Very suddenly . He was not conscious from the moment he was taken ill until he died , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her heart was filled with a strange horror at the idea of that sudden and unprovided death . She could have cried out with anguish for that soul , which , in the midst of its careless pride and criminal indifference , had been summoned by an inexorable decree to the tribunal of judgment ! where it appeared alone -- alone -- alone , to be weighed in the balance of justice . " But , perhaps , sweet Jesus ! " she whispered ; " oh , perhaps , Thou didst in the last struggle hear it from its abyss of misery plead for mercy ; perhaps , through thy bitter passion and death Thou didst rescue him from eternal woe --  " " What are you saying , May ! No doubt I have shocked you ; you are so very pious ! " " Pained me , dear Helen ; but you will do better now . You feel , I am very sure , that a life of prevarication and indifference does not answer for a Catholic ; and now there will be nothing to hinder you . " " Perhaps so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , in the name of mercy , is that noise ! " cried Helen , starting up . " It is Uncle Stillinghast coming in . He is beating the snow from his feet , " said May , lighting the candles . By this time Mr. Stillinghast had thrown off his wrappings , hung up his hat , and come in . He was evidently in no amiable mood , and to the greetings of his nieces condescended no reply . " It is colder this evening , Sir , is it not ? " said May , flitting around the tea-table . " Yes . " " Shall I get your tea now , uncle ? " " Yes . " " Here it is , sir ; it is very nice and hot ; every thing is ready . Come , Helen , " said May , placing the chairs . They took their seats in silence . " What 's your name ? " Mr. Stillinghast said abruptly , turning to Helen . " Helen . " " Can you make bread ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Learn , d'ye hear ? " " Yes , sir . " " Can you sweep -- make a shirt -- wash -- iron ? " he burst out . " No , sir , " she said , trembling . " What are you good for , then ? " he inquired , sternly . " I do n't know , sir ; I can play on the harp , " faltered Helen . " Play the devil ! You are a pretty , curly wax doll -- good for nothing , and cumbering the very earth that you live on . " Helen said nothing , but tears rolled over her cheeks . " But I will have no idlers about me . You shall learn to be useful and industrious . D'ye understand ? " " I will try , sir . " " Very well . And now , miss , what were you doing parading about with old Copeland down town ? " he said , turning suddenly to May ; " a man I detest with all my soul . " " I do not know any individual of that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquired of an old gentleman who was passing the address of a person I had business with . Then he offered to show me , as he was going past the place , " said May , lifting her clear , truthful eyes , to his face . " And what business , pray , led you to a part of the city so little frequented by the respectable of your sex ? " " If you will excuse me , sir , I would prefer not telling you , " she said , gently . " I insist on knowing , " he exclaimed , angrily . " You will excuse me , sir , when I tell you that it was quite a little affair of my own , " replied May , in a low voice . " Very well , madam ! " said Mr. Stillinghast , bowing with a sneer ; " but depend o n't I shall sift this matter -- it shall not rest here . " " I am grieved , dear uncle , to have offended you , " began May . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you were engaged in one this morning . Go , answer the bell ! " Glad to escape , May stepped the hall to open the door , and ushered in a tall , fine-looking man , who said he had business with Mr. Stillinghast . He bowed with a well-bred air to May and Helen , then to Mr. Stillinghast , who invited him to be seated . " My name is Jerrold , sir -- Walter Jerrold , and I have come to bring you rents due for the property belonging to you which I occupy . " " Which of my houses is it ? " inquired Mr. Stillinghast , gruffly . " One on C --  --  Street , sir ; and the warehouse on Bolton 's Wharf . Here are the bills , which I hope you will find satisfactory , " replied the young man , handing him a roll of notes , which he inspected carefully one by one . " All right , sir : but the fact is , Mr. Jerrold , this is a very irregular way of doing business . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the old man , folding the notes away ; after which he wrote a receipt , and handed to him . " Many things might happen : you might , have been robbed on your way hither ; I may be robbed to-night . " " We young fellows are sadly deficient in prudence , Mr. Stillinghast , but your suggestions shall not be lost on me , " replied Mr. Jerrold , pleasantly . Although Mr. Jerrold 's visit was ostensibly one of business , he was not at all inattentive to the presence of the cousins . His eye lingered on the faultless face of Helen , until she lifted her large brown eyes , and caught his glance , when a soft blush tinted her cheeks , and the long fringed lids drooped over them . May dropped her handkerchief , which he picked up , and handed to her with a courteous bow . " I fear , ladies , that my awkward visit has interrupted some domestic arrangement , " he said , observing the tea-table . " Not at all , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand pardons if I have ; but good evening -- good evening , Mr. Stillinghast . I shall beg your permission , sir , to-morrow to consult you about the investment of some funds I have lying idle . " " Of course , sir ; " said Mr. Stillinghast , following him to the door . " A rising young man ! Come , come , make haste , and clear off the table ; I have accounts to look over . " " Come , dear Helen , it will be better for you to help a little , " whispered May . " Here is the evening paper , sir , and your pipe when you are ready , " she said to her uncle . " Humph ! " was the only reply she received . When every thing was finished , they bade him good night , and ran up to their chamber . " Where were you to-day , May ? " inquired Helen , as soon as May closed the door . " I was at church -- down town -- up town -- then I came home , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think proper to disclose . But let us prepare for bed . Dear Helen ; we shall have to rise early in the morning , and you must get all the sleep you can . " " May , my firm impression is that this sort of life will extinguish me , " said Helen , solemnly ; " that horrid old man will certainly tear me to pieces , or bite off my head . Indeed -- indeed , I am more afraid of him than any thing I ever saw . " " What nonsense ! It will do you good . You will soon learn to have an aim in life ; it will drive you for comfort where only comfort can be found , and you will learn patience , forbearance and meekness , long-suffering , and charity . " " Like yourself , I presume ! " said Helen , with a slight sneer . " Oh , no ! oh no , dear Helen ; did I say any thing like that ? I did not mean it , for I am very often angered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; but I do n't . " " And why do n't you ? Do you expect to inherit the old man 's gold ? " " Helen , I never think of it . I have a higher motive , I trust . My peculiar trials give me so many opportunities of learning the rudiments of Christian virtue ; therefore , after the first sting is over , I feel thankful and happy . " " Help us all ! I shall never attain such perfection . " " Nor do I ever expect to arrive at perfection . Oh , no ! I am too imperfect ; too full of infirmities and faults ! " said May , earnestly . " But shall I read the night prayers , or do you prefer reading them alone ? " " Oh , read them by all means ; but do n't begin until I get on my cloak -- it is freezing cold here , " said Helen , shivering . May read the beautiful prayers and litany of our Blessed Lady with such fervor and piety that Helen was touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at the De Profundis , she thought of her dead father , and wept bitterly . " I am very , very sad , May , " said Helen , when May kissed her good-night . " To-morrow , dear Helen , we will seek a heavenly physician ; He who comes to the lowly and repentant , and dispenses healing and divine gifts from his throne -- the altar ! " whispered May . Helen sighed deeply , but made no reply . CHAPTER VI . HELEN . The great bell of the cathedral was just tolling the Angelus , when May , laying her hand softly on Helen , awoke her . " Rise , dear Helen ; it is six o'clock . " " It is not daylight yet , and I sha n't rise , I assure you , " she said , in a fretful tone . " Yes you will , I am sure . Uncle Stillinghast will be quite displeased if you do not . He said yesterday morning that you should rise when I do , and lo ! you have slept an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up in the cold , but you 'll soon become accustomed to it . " " I declare , May , you are as bad as your uncle . Heavens ! what a pair to live with . One as exacting as a Jew , the other obedient as a saint , and obstinate as a mule ! I never was so persecuted in my life ! " exclaimed Helen , rising very unwillingly . " That is right , " said May , laughing , " be brisk now , for there is a great deal to do . " " What is it , May ? Are you going to build a house before breakfast ? " " Come and see , and I promise you a nice time . The fire is already made in the kitchen-stove . Hurry down , I want you to grind the coffee . " " Grind the coffee ! What is that ? " asked Helen , with amazement . " I will show you . Really , I would not ask you , only I have rolls to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bake , for that horrid old man --  " " And ourselves . I tell you what , Helen , he could get on vastly well without us , but how we should manage without him I can not tell , " said May , gravely , for when occasion offered , she could so inflate and expand her little form with dignity , and throw such a truthful penetrating light into her splendid eyes , that it was quite terrifying . " Go on , then ; I shall follow you in a few moments . I have some prayers to say . " Helen 's prayers were soon over . Religion was no vital principle in her mind . It is true she held the germs of faith in her soul , but they were like those bulbs and grains which are so often found on the breast of mummies -- which , unless exhumed , and exposed to sunlight and air , never develop their latent life . So with her ; swathed , and wrapped , and crusted over with evil associations , artificial feelings , and the maxims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repentance should reveal to her the pearl she held , and lead her beyond the vestibule of faith . She had looked no farther ; poor Helen ; to the splendors , the consolations , and rapture beyond , she was a stranger . It is not remarkable , then , that when she encountered the stern changes and trials of life , the burden galled and fretted her . " How are you , ma'am ; you are very welcome ! " laughed May , when Helen came down ; " come near the fire , and while you warm yourself , take this coffee-mill on your knees -- turn the handle so , until all the grains disappear , then begin the second stage . " " The what ? " asked Helen , tugging at the handle , which she turned with difficulty . Her hands , unaccustomed to work of any kind , held it awkwardly ; while May , with her hands in the dough , which she worked vigorously , laughed outright at her fruitless efforts . " It 's no use , May , " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and I 've a mind to throw the thing out of the window and run away . " " Where , dear Helen ? " " I do n't know . I will hire out as lady's-maid , companion , governess -- any thing is preferable to this sort of life ! " she exclaimed , flushing up . " You would find greater difficulties than a harmless coffee-mill to contend with , I imagine ! " said May , quietly , while she shaped her rolls , and placed them in a pan . " What shall I do ? " cried Helen , in a tone of despair , after another fruitless effort . " Grind the coffee . Come , you are quite strong enough ; put it on the table , here -- steady it with one hand , and turn with the other -- so ; now it goes , " said May , pleasantly . " How ridiculous ! what now ? " said Helen , laughing . " The second stage ! " replied May , looking mysterious ; " pull out that little drawer , and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I have just scalded -- that is it ; now pour on a little cold water ; put in this fish-sound ; fill up with boiling water -- there , that is enough . Now comes the third , and last stage . Set the pot on the stove , and watch it ; when it boils up the third time , throw in a small cup full of cold water , and take it off to settle . It is ready then for immediate use . " " Gracious ! what an indefatigable , old-fashioned little thing you are , May , " said Helen , obeying her directions , and , after all , rather enjoying the novelty of the thing , than otherwise . May 's cheerful face flitting about ; the bright sunshine gushing in ; the warmth of the room , and the feeling that she had really done something useful , inspired her with a healthful sentiment of enjoyment which she had never experienced before . Breakfast was ready ; the rolls were light , and nicely browned ; the coffee was clear and fragrant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Helen . " My uncle has not yet returned from market , and we can run in and arrange the sitting-room , " said May . And they flitted round , dusting , brushing , and polishing up , until they were both as merry as crickets . The morning paper was opened , and spread on the back of a chair to air ; the cushioned arm-chair was wheeled into its accustomed corner ; and , just as every thing was complete in their arrangements , Mr. Stillinghast came in . Helen was in the hall when he came in with a well-filled basket on his arm . " Shall I help to draw off your coat , sir ? " she asked , timidly . He looked up a moment , and she seemed such a vision of loveliness that his cold , dull eye , opened and brightened with astonishment . It was the first time he had really looked at her . A low , chuckling laugh , burst from his lips , which Helen thought frightful , and he handed her the basket , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen . " She dared not excuse herself , but holding it with both hands , and feeling as if her wrists were breaking , she passed through the sitting-room with such a doleful countenance , while a red angry spot burned on her forehead , that May could not forbear laughing even while she went to assist her . Mr. Stillinghast 's humor was not quite so rasping as usual that morning , although he cast more than one angry look towards May , and scarcely noticed the remarks she made to him . When she told him that Helen had made the coffee , he nodded towards her , and with a grim smile told her that " she had made a good beginning ; " but to May , never a word was uttered . Notwithstanding which , it was very evident that a pleasant thought , by some rare chance , had taken possession of his bleak heart , like birds , which , sometimes in flying , drop from their beaks the seeds of beauteous and gorgeous flowers into the crevice of some bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's adventure down town , and she hoped he had forgotten it ; but he was one of those who never forget . At half-past eight , all her domestic affairs in order , May and Helen prepared to attend the 9 o'clock mass at the cathedral . Helen 's worldly heart was pleased with the grandeur of the building , the dignity with which the ceremonies were conducted , and the appearance of the congregation , who appeared to belong to a better class than she had been accustomed to see in the Catholic churches North . And so they did . They were mostly individuals of fortune and leisure , who had their time in command . And there were those whose age and infirmities would not permit them to come out at an earlier hour ; feeling thankful to know that He , the wonderful and humble Jesus , would be there to receive their homage , and dispense His blessings to their waiting hearts . Her old feelings would have triumphed , had she attended the earlier masses , when the artisan , the toil-worn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil of earth ; the tattered poor , who were ashamed to come out into the full light of day ; the halt , the cripple , and the blind , led by little ones ; the widow and orphan , the bereaved , who seek to hide their anguish from all eyes but His who can heal it ; the dark children of Ethiopia , the slave , the outcast , had congregated there ; all equal in HIS eyes , as they will be in the valley of Jehosaphat when the judgment is , to receive the divine manna and the vital heavenliness which His presence afforded ; when , like pilgrims refreshed by pure water in the desert , they went forth to encounter again the heat , the simoon , the thirst and weariness of the way , but with renewed courage . " Shall we go in to see Father Fabian a moment ? " said May , after mass . " No , not now , May . I think , perhaps I shall go to confession soon ; and I do not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she replied , shrinking back . " Let it be soon , very soon , dearest Helen ! " said May , pressing her hand . " Perhaps , " she answered , vaguely . " Now , dear Helen , can you find your way back ? I have to go a little way on business , " said May , when they came within two squares of home . " Oh , yes ; but really , you seem to have a great many mysterious visits on hand ! " observed Helen , rather sharply . " You shall come with me soon , if you wish to ; " replied May . Then they separated ; Helen dissatisfied , and a little angry , and May rejoicing like a miser who goes to visit his treasure . Full of happy thoughts , she went on until she came to old Mabel 's cottage , at the door of which stood a small , close carriage . The door was ajar , and she went in . There were two ladies in silks , velvets , and plumes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excited tone . " A Roman Catholic ! " they exclaimed . " Yes , misses , " was the meek reply . " Why , do n't you know you peril your eternal salvation , by becoming a papist ? " " No , misses , I do n't know it , neither does you . I been living on and on , and never was a professor , and I 'm gwine to do jest what is right at the ' leventh hour . It 's a ' ligion that 's older than all , and was know 'd and practised afore any of yourn was ever thought on . " " Did you ever hear such preposterous ignorance ! " exclaimed one ; " why , old aunty , who has been tampering with you ? " " Nobody , honey , only them that 's got a ' ligion that larns them to give bread to the hungry , warm clothes to the freezing , and fire to keep life in their bodies ; and tells the poor ole nigger that God loves her soul as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gwine to be one , " replied old Mabel , striking her stick on the hearth . " You are a poor , benighted creature , and I hope God will pity you on the score of your ignorance , " said one of the well-meaning ladies . " I hope he will , misses , I hope he will , " she said , humbly . " We had some things for you ; but , of course , we can not leave them now ; the papists must take care of their own poor -- we have enough of our own , " observed one . " Thank'ee , misses . " " Downright impudence ! " they muttered , flouncing out to their carriage , without seeing May , who had taken refuge behind the bed , which was hung round with some faded patchwork , to keep out air . " And so you 're bearing testimony for Christ already , Aunt Mabel , " said May , coming towards her with outstretched hands . " Bless your dear face , honey , it seems best for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall ' quire all the help I can get in this world and the next . Them ladies , honey , is well-meaning , I reckon . They ' tended me a little while last winter , but they wanted to send me out yonder -- I would n't go ; I 'm mighty poor and helpless , Miss May , and was friendless then , but I could n't go thar ! " " Where , Aunt Mabel ? " " To the poor-house , my child . But , honey , after you went away yesterday , I all at once remembered a Catholic woman -- she was a half-Indian , half-nigger , from the West Indies -- that I used to do a good turn for now and then . She was dying with consumption , and she used to talk to me about the saints in glory praying for us , the blessed mother of Jesus Christ , and purgatory , in her broken lingo , till I b'lieved every word she said . I was trying to recollect , after you left me , and it all come pat into my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holy doctrines , Aunt Mabel ; but tell me if you are satisfied that the Roman Catholic Church is the true Church of God ? " said May , smoothing her withered hand . " I ca n't ' splain myself , honey ; but thar 's something in here that tells me it is , " said the simple old creature , laying her hand on her breast . " And that something is a great and glorious gift , Aunt Mabel -- the gift of FAITH . But hear what our dear Lord said , before he ascended to his Father ; here is your old Protestant Bible , which your good mistress used to read to you so long ago . I will find it in this , " said May , taking down the shattered old copy of the Scriptures from its shelf . " First of all , our Lord established his Church on earth . It was the object of his divine mission . Then he endowed his apostles with heavenly gifts and authority to do even as he had done ; and declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the gates of hell should never prevail . ' " " And his word and his promise never fail , honey , because he is the Lord God , " said the old woman . " No , never , never fail , " said May , fervently ; " and now listen . Here He , Infinite Truth , tells us himself why this Church can never be overcome , or err , or do wrong : ' I will pray the Father ! ' said Jesus Christ to his disciples , ' and he will send you another comforter , that he may abide with you for ever -- even the SPIRIT OF TRUTH ; ' and again he says : ' When He , the Spirit of Truth , is come , he will guide you in all truth . ' And this spirit was the Holy Ghost -- the Spirit of God ! Oh , Aunt Mabel , only think ! the Spirit of the Eternal God -- promised not only to the disciples , but to the Church for ever ! Do you understand me ? " " I understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , and will be for ever . Oh , no , Satan , you ca n't break up your master 's inheritance ! You may worrit His sheep , and steal off His stray lambs now and then , but , bless God , you 'll get no furder , ' cause the Master is thar hisself . Oh , Miss May , lead me in , quick as you please ! " cried the old woman , while tears streamed over her face . " Dear Aunt Mabel , your wish will soon be gratified . I will see Father Fabian to-morrow morning , after mass , and he will come to visit and instruct you in many things , which it is necessary for you to understand . Were you ever baptized ? " " No , honey ; my mother was a Baptist , and they do n't baptize babies ; and after I growed up , I did n't like ' em , somehow , and so it 's never been done . " " In this case , I am glad it was not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after due preparation , you receive holy baptism , your soul will be washed white and stainless as that of a Christian babe . You will have a clean and beautiful banqueting room to receive the Lord Jesus when he comes to you , under the sacramental veil ; and , being near the end of your pilgrimage , it is not likely that it will be again defiled by sin . Oh , how happy is the thought of going up through faith and repentance , without a stain , into the presence of our divine Lord ! " " Me , Miss May ! all that for an old crippled nigger like me ? " exclaimed Aunt Mabel , wiping her eyes . " Yes , all that , and more -- ten thousand times more . But now , Aunt Mabel , you must begin to examine carefully your past life ; to remember the sins which have blotted it , and beg of Almighty God the grace of true repentance , sincere , humble repentance , that you may make a good general confession . And here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hanging it around Aunt Mabel 's neck , " say the little prayer on this a hundred times a day , if you can remember it : ' Oh , Mary , conceived without sin , pity me , a poor sinner , who have recourse to thee . ' It is a medal of our Blessed Lady , who will obtain from her divine Son , for you , all that you may need . Can you say the prayer ? " " Oh , Mary , conceived without sin , pity me , a poor sinner , who have recourse to thee , " repeated the old woman . " Say it over and over again , until you know it perfectly , " said May . " I got it in here , honey , fast , " replied the old woman , pointing to her heart . " That is right . Now , can I do any thing for you ? " " No , my misses , only call my grandchild as you go ' long . I let her go out to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will send her to you ; and to-morrow I think you will see Father Fabian , " said May , before she closed the door . And she went away , wrapped as with a royal mantle , in the blessings of the poor . CHAPTER VII . THINGS OF TIME AND ETERNITY . In a small and elegant boudoir , which opened into a conservatory , and was crowded with articles of taste and vertu ,  - -  the gleanings of a tour through Europe ,  - -  a lady , somewhat past the prime of life , leaned over an Or-molu table , arranging with exquisite touches , a quantity of splendid flowers in a basket of variegated mosses which stood on it . There was a look of high-bred indolence about her , and an expression of pride on her countenance so earthly , that even the passing stranger shrunk from it . And , while with a fine eye for the harmony of colors , she blended the gorgeous flowers together , weaving the dark mosses amidst them , until they looked like a rare Flemish painting , the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother -- kissed her on the cheek , and threw himself with an easy air into a fauteuil . " You see how busy I am , Walter , and until I am disengaged , look over these new engravings . They are just from Paris , " said the lady . " I see , dear mother , that you have the affairs of a nation on your shoulders . I hope , for your health 's sake , you have no other momentous concerns to look after this morning , " he said , playfully . " One more , Walter ; my goldfinch is half-starved , and the mocking-bird is really on his dignity , because he has not had egg and lettuce for his breakfast ; but , apropos , what success had you with old Stillinghast ? " " Faith , mother , it is hard to tell . He is a tough personage to deal with . I got in , however , and saw the two nieces . " " Well ? " " One of them is extremely beautiful . I shall have no objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old miser makes her his heiress , " interrupted Mrs. Jerrold . " Exactly . The other one is a nice , graceful , little thing , with such a pair of eyes ! She has a spirit of her own , too , I fancy . " " I have been thinking over our plan to-day , and it really seems to be a feasible one , Walter , if you can only win Mr. Stillinghast 's confidence . How do they live ? " " I presume they consider it comfortable ; it would be miserable to me . The old man appeared quite flattered this morning , when I got him to invest that money for me ; and shook my hand warmly when I inveighed against the present mania for speculating in fancy stocks . " " You have tact enough , Walter , if you will only use it properly and prudently . The mortgage on Cedar Hall has nearly expired ; I have not a solitary dollar to pay it , and the consequence will be -- a foreclosure , unless some miracle occurs to redeem it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing on your capital ! " said Mrs. Jerrold , pressing the yolk of a hard-boiled egg through the gilded wires of her mocking-bird 's cage . " I 'll move heaven and earth , mother , before Cedar Hall shall go out of the family . If I can bring things to pass with old Stillinghast , I might , on the credit of marrying one of his heiresses raise the money at a ruinous interest . At any rate , Cedar Hall , goes not from the Jerrolds , " he exclaimed . " But , Walter , I understand that both of those girls are Catholics ? " " That 's bad ; but I fancy I shall be able to put down all that sort of thing , in case I win the lady , " he said , twirling an opal seal . " And who are they ? I have a horror of low families . " " Make yourself easy on that score , they are our equals , I imagine . I am very certain that none of them have been hung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been more gentlemen in the family , than self-made men , from the simple fact , that both of those girls have been left quite penniless , and dependent on their uncle . I believe , however , that the father of one was a major in the army ; the other , a captain in the navy , " said Mr. Jerrold , laughing . " I am glad to hear it . I assure you that family is no unimportant consideration with me , " observed the lady . " Dear lady mother , I had not the remotest suspicion that it was ; but I must be off , " he replied , while he consulted his watch . " I got a private despatch this morning from New York , giving me the very pleasant information of a failure in the coffee crop ; and I am going to attend a sale at ten o'clock , and expect to purchase largely at the present prices . At one , my investment will double its value . " " You were fortunate , indeed , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " good-by , " and was gone . Neither mother nor son imagined they had been saying or doing any thing contrary to the laws of honor or morality . Had any one suggested such an idea , he would have felt grossly insulted ; and that red spot of pride on her forehead would have glowed into a flame of resentment . They were only keeping a sharp eye on their interests . Thus , at least , they would have defined their plans . Protestants , practical and nominal , think of the judgment as an idea too remote to influence the acts of their daily life . They have no confessionals for ever reminding them of the right principles of a true rule of faith ; and no spiritual guides , whose duty it is to probe the erring conscience , and heal , with divine gifts , the repentant soul . But we will leave Mrs. Jerrold 's recherche boudoir , and accompany May from the Cathedral to Father Fabian 's parlor . She was disappointed at not finding him there , but determined to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent for just as mass was over , to carry the Holy Viaticum to a laborer who had fallen from a scaffolding in the next square , and was dying from the effect of his injuries . " I will go Into the church and wait . Will you please to call me when Father Fabian comes in ? I have something of importance to say to him , " said May , while awe and tender charity filled her heart . " I shall certainly call you , ma'am , " replied the respectable domestic . And May went back and knelt in her accustomed place near the altar -- that altar , which , to her clear faith , was a throne of majestic and clement love , where the Shepherd of souls was for ever present , to make intercession for those who , through His bitter passion and death , hoped for eternal life . Earnestly she besought His mercy for that soul in its last sudden agony . She besought the Queen of Sorrows , by the pangs she endured on Calvary , to come to his aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good death ! She implored the saints , who had gone up through much tribulation , and who pity those who suffer and weep in this valley of tears , to pray for him , that he might not be overcome in the hour of trial by the enemy of souls . In her earnest charity she took no heed of time , and was startled when the servant , kneeling beside her , informed her that Father Fabian had returned , and would see her . When she went in , he was taking a cup of coffee and some toast , which it was very evident , from his pale , excited countenance , he needed . His Breviary was lying open near him . " Ah , my dear child ! " he said , holding out his hand to May , " I am very glad to see you . How are you ? " " Quite well , father . But do not let me disturb you ; you need refreshment after the late melancholy scene , " she replied . " Melancholy , indeed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Fabian , while his eyes filled up . " We priests , like physicians , are called on to witness a great many distressing scenes , which many a time appal our weak human nature , and almost overcome our charity by terror . This affair was truly heart-rending . When I arrived at the spot , I found the poor man lying on the sidewalk , crushed , and almost speechless . A crowd , collected together by curiosity , surrounded him . I asked a physician , who was examining the extent of his injuries , ' whether or not he could be removed ? ' ' He has not fifteen minutes to live , poor fellow , ' was his reply ! I threw on my stole , requested the crowd to stand back a little , and knelt on the bricks beside him , and bowed my ear close to his lips . He had recognized me , and his eyes already dim , lit up with joy ; and in faltering and whispered words , he made his short confession . Happily , his conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my penitents , and I knew how regular and pious his daily life had been . Quickly I gave him absolution , after which I administered the Holy Viaticum , which he received with great fervor . ' I am resigned ; but , sweet Jesus , pity my little ones , ' he whispered . Then , in a little while , with our dear Lord to conduct him , he passed into eternity . I doubt not that his sentence was full of mercy . " There was a pause of several moments , during which May dashed more than one tear from her cheek . " But who , think you , I saw , when I lifted my eyes from that dying countenance ? " " I can not imagine , father . " " Your uncle . Yes , indeed ! he stood watching the scene with a most intent and singular expression of countenance , " said Father Fabian . " It is , I believe , one of the first practical fruits of the Catholic faith he ever saw , " said May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably ! " said Father Fabian , smiling ; " but tell me now what is it you want . I have to run away out to the north-western limits of the city . " " That will suit precisely , dear father . It is a poor , paralytic old woman , I wish to direct you . She has determined to become a Catholic , and wishes to see you . She needs instruction ; but her faith is so docile , that I do not think you will hesitate long to grant the ardent desire of her soul , which is , admission into the church of God . " " And where does our neophyte live ? " asked Father Fabian . " In the first of those small cottages west of Howard 's Woods ; but please , Father Fabian , do n't mind any thing she may say about me , " said May , blushing , and looking embarrassed . " She is so very grateful , that she imagines that I have done a great deal for her , and really makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended to her . Will you give me your blessing , father ? " " I shall certainly go , my dear child -- meanwhile , pray for me , " said Father Fabian , as she rose up from receiving his blessing . " Will you pray for my uncle 's conversion , father ? and , oh ! I had almost forgotten ! My cousin has arrived ; shall I bring her to see you soon ? " said May , standing at the door . " Whenever you please to ; " and May went away , feeling quite happy . Mr. Stillinghast had not forgotten May 's refusal to explain the cause of her appearance , the day before , on the wharf ; and being determined to discover it , he stopped , on his way down to his counting-house , at the wood-yard office , and inquired " if a young lady had been in there to purchase wood yesterday ? " " Well , sir , I hardly know how to reply to your question ;  - -  but I believe there were several young ladies in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking highly amused . " But there was one who came with old Copeland ; she had on a purple merino dress -- and -- something , I do n't know what else she had on , " said Mr. Stillinghast , feeling ridiculous . " Was she very small , sir , with bright hazel eyes ? " " I know nothing about the color of her eyes , but she 's something higher than my walking stick , " replied the irascible old man . " The same , sir . She came with Mr. Copeland ; and if her eyes did n't make me dance in and out , it 's a wonder ! " observed the clerk . " Well , what in the deuce did she want here ? " " She bought a quarter of a cord of oak wood , and paid for it ! " " What did she want with oak wood ? " cried Mr. Stillinghast , becoming more impatient every moment . " To burn , I presume , " replied the young man , paring off a chew of tobacco ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask her . We always take it for granted that people buy wood to burn . " " Who does know any thing about it ? " was the sharp response . " The sawyer , I fancy , if he can be found . I have not seen him about to-day , however , " said the young man , with a broad grin , which he speedily changed , when his strange visitor burst out with , " When he comes , send him to me.  - -  My name is Stillinghast . " " Certainly , Mr. Stillinghast , certainly . Excuse me , sir , for not recognizing you , " stammered the clerk . " I 'm determined , " muttered the old man , going out and slamming to the door , without noticing the young man 's apologies , " I 'm determined to sift this matter . If I had a feeling of humanity left , it was for that girl -- papist though she be ; if I loved or cared a tithe for any living being , it was she ! I intended -- but never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll find it out . She has tried to deceive me , but I 'll convince her that she has mistaken her dupe . Where did she get the money to buy wood with ? " And at that thought , such a fierce , sudden suspicion tore through that old , half ossified heart , that he paused on the flags , and gasped for breath . " My God ! " he murmured , " has she robbed me ? " And during the remainder of that miserable day , his ledgers were almost neglected . Foul and ungenerous suspicion held possession of his mind ; and inflamed with a malicious anger , he plotted and schemed his revenge until he had defined a plan that well suited his present mood . " If she plots , " he muttered , rubbing his dry , yellow hands together , with grim delight , " I will counter-plot . It is not the wrong , but the person who inflicts it , that stings me . But the serpent 's tooth has been gnawing these many years at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had obtained no clue to the mystery , which increased his anxiety , and made him more fretful and testy than usual . He allowed no opportunity to escape , to make May feel his displeasure . Bitter and contemptuous speeches , coarse allusions to her religion , fault-finding with all she did , and sudden outbursts of unprovoked fury , were now the daily trials of her life . Trials which were sore temptations , and full of humiliation to a proud , high spirit , like May 's ; and sharp were the struggles , and earnest the prayers , and many the scalding tears she shed , ere she subdued the storm of wild and indignant resentment , which swept like whirlwinds through her soul . But her talisman -- the Cross of Jesus Christ -- was her safeguard . Its splinters inflicted many a sharp wound ; but none so sharp , that the balm it distilled could not heal and beautify them . Helen , in a fright , kept as much as possible out of sight . Towards her , Mr. Stillinghast 's manner was inconsistent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , at another , captious and surly . Sometimes he called on her for every thing , and perhaps the next moment threatened to throw whatever he had ordered , at her head . Once he told her , in bitter tones and language , that " but for wishing to make use of her to effect certain ends , he would turn her into the street . " He had a new lock and key , of a peculiar construction , fitted on his chamber door , which he locked every morning carefully , and carried the key away with him . " This is awful , May . How can you bear it as you do , for you do not seem the least afraid of him ? " said Helen , one morning . " I am afraid of offending our Lord by spitefulness , and returning injuries to one who is my benefactor , " replied May . " You do feel spiteful , then , sometimes ? Really , it is quite refreshing to know that you are not perfect , " said Helen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very often . I am full of imperfections . I am not patient , or humble , or even forgiving . I am only outwardly -- outwardly calm and silent , because I do not think it right to fan up resentments , and malice , and bitterness , all so antagonistic to the love of God . I hope ! oh , I hope my motive is , singly and purely to avoid offending Him , " said May , humbly and earnestly . " I heartily wish the old wretch would die ! " exclaimed Helen . " Oh , Helen ! so unprovided as he is for another world ! Unsay that , wo n't you ? " cried May , clasping her hands together . " No , May ; I mean it . I think he is as much fit to die now as he ever will be . He has doubtless spent his life in tormenting others , and it will only be fair when he is tormented in his turn . But , spare those looks of horror , and tell me , who do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bowed ? " " I can not tell , " said May , sadly . " That handsome Jerrold . I hope he may prove a knight-errant , and deliver me from Giant Despair 's castle , " said the frivolous girl , while she twisted her long , shining curls around her fingers . " Take care , Helen . Romance does very well in books , but it is a mischievous thing to mix up in the real concerns of life . " " My dearest May , I shall never want a skull to grin ghastly lessons of morality at me , while I have you , " replied Helen , with a scornful laugh . " Pardon me , Helen ; I fear that I do say too much ; but let my good intention be my excuse , " said May . " Yes , it is intolerable . My old Tartar of an uncle swearing and scolding down stairs , and you preaching and praying , up . It is more than human nature can bear.  - -  Where are you going ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " Very well ; but , my dear ' wee wee woman , ' do n't stay long , for I believe this rambling , musty old house is haunted . " " Come with me , then ? " " Not to-day ; I have an idea of exploring it , and should like , of all things , to get into the very room which Blue Beard keeps locked up . Is there any possible way of getting in ? " " Yes . " " How ? tell me , quick ! " " Ask Uncle Stillinghast for the key , " said May , while a flash of merriment lit up her eyes . " Excuse me , ma'am , " said Helen , curtseying : " I leave all such exploits to people who are anxious to become martyrs . I have no such ambition . " CHAPTER VIII . TROUBLED WATERS . " Where are you gadding to now ? " said Mr. Stillinghast , who had encountered May and Helen at the hall-door , on their way out to church . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to mass , sir , " said May , in her usual quiet , pleasant way . " One of you stay in . I wo n't have the house left so ; do you stay , for you are for ever gadding , " he said sharply to May . " I will remain at home , Uncle Stillinghast , " said Helen , quickly ; " do you go , May . " " Do you go , miss , and let her stay at home ; d'ye hear me ? " he exclaimed . " Indeed , sir , I wish to remain at home . I have no desire at all to go this morning , " expostulated Helen . " Ar' n't you a papist ? " he inquired , turning suddenly , and confronting her . " I am a Catholic , sir , but -- but , " she stammered . " But what ? " he asked , sharply . " I do not care so much about going to church as May does , " she replied , lifting her handsome brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclaimed May , with an imploring look . " This is quite my affair , " said Helen , with a haughty air . " You 've got more sense than I gave you credit for , " said Mr. Stillinghast , with a low , peculiar laugh . " Do n't go any more unless you choose . " " No , sir . " " Oh , uncle ! " cried May , losing all dread of her uncle 's displeasure , and laying her hand on his arm ; " you are tampering with her soul ! Helen ! Helen , you are trampling under foot your birthright in the Church of Christ ! " " Fool ! " exclaimed Mr. Stillinghast , shaking her off . " Be silent . Go your ways , but dare not interfere with her . " " I can only pray , sir , for you and for her , " said May , after her first wild and indignant emotions had subsided . Another low mocking laugh sounded in her ears , then she found herself alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she murmured , as she went out ; " but Father Fabian says , that trials are divine and royal gifts ! If I lived only for this life I would never -- I could not bear it , but living for eternity , I can not afford to lose a single lesson of the rudiments of perfection . " " That girl , " thought Mr. Stillinghast , " is a mystery . She is either a profound hypocrite , or an honest Christian . This scene , however , has fixed my resolves . That Helen may be a fool , but she 's not much of a papist . Odds , it will hardly require the temptation of a handsome husband , and a splendid settlement , to make her forswear her creed . I will see Jerrold this very day . " When he arrived at his counting-house , he went directly to his desk , and penned a note , which he directed and sealed , then handed it to his porter to take to Mr. Jerrold . Then he perched himself on his high writing-stool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the business of the day . But there was something unquiet tugging at his conscience , which did not allow him to do so . He paused frequently , with his pen poised over his inkstand , or paper , and fell into reveries , which ended with expressions which burst out like shots from a revolver . It was now " Pshaw ! " then , " I hate it worse than I do the synagogue ; " or , " it is not injustice ! Have I not a right to do as I please with my own property ? " and " I 'll do it as sure as my name is Mark Stillinghast . " " Mr. Jerrold was away at bank , sir , " said the porter , who had returned ; " and , sir , I left the note . " " All right , Michael . Business is the master we must serve first , and best . Hoist out those bales there ready to ship . " " The devil ' ll fly away wid that ould haythen some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever hard of the day of judgment and the Master that 's to take an account of how he 's been sarved . I reckon , bedad , he 'll find out thin , if not sooner , that he 's the one that ought to had a little waitin ' on , " muttered Michael , rolling out a heavy bale of cotton . Ere long Mr. Jerrold , anxious to conciliate the millionnaire , and full of curiosity , did not lose a minute after he read the note in going to him . " Good morning sir . I hope I have not kept you waiting , " he said , holding out his hand to Mr. Stillinghast . " No , sir ; you are in very good time , " he replied , shaking hands , and offering his guest a chair . " I see that you are not one who will let grass grow under your feet . " " I have my fortune to make , sir , " replied the young man , laughing ; " but can I serve you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No , sir -- no --  Here Michael ! " cried Mr. Stillinghast . " Here , sir , " answered the porter at the door . " I wish to have a private conversation with this gentleman , and do not want to be interrupted ; do you hear ? " " Bedad , sir , I 'm not deaf no more than the next one ; but suppose somebody comes to pay up rents , et cetera ? " " Well -- well , they can wait , " he replied . " And supposin ' they wo n't ? " persisted Michael . " In that case , rap at my door , and I will come out . Now , be off . " " I never waste time , Mr. Jerrold , " said Mr. Stillinghast , after he had closed the door , and resumed his seat ; " I never waste any thing -- time or words . I am blunt and candid , and aboveboard . I hate the world generally , because I have been deceived in every thing I ever placed faith in . I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your life has been without reproach , sir , " observed Mr. Jerrold , who wondered what strange revelation was to be made . " No compliments ; they nauseate me . I sent for you this morning to propose something which you may , or may not , accede to , there being a condition annexed that may not be altogether agreeable . But however it may be , I wish you to understand distinctly that I do it to suit my own ends and pleasure , and if I could do otherwise I would . " " I am very confident , sir , that you will not propose any thing to me incompatible with honor and integrity , " said Walter Jerrold . " No , sir . No ; it is a fair bargain -- a fair , honest , business transaction I offer , by which you will gain not only credit , but profit . In view of this object , I have been for two days engaged in an investigation of your character . " " Really , Mr. Stillinghast ! " began the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I have made inquiries of your friends and foes concerning your habits , your business associations , your antecedents --  " " For what purpose , sir ? " inquired Walter Jerrold , flushing up . " To see if I might trust you . " " And the result of this strange procedure ? " " Is favorable throughout . I congratulate you , sir , on being without reproach in your business relations . You will suit me to a nicety . I lost two years ago the old man who sat at this desk for the last forty years . He was the only friend I had in the wide earth . He was my prop and support , and now that he is gone , I feel tottering and weak . I want some one to assist me in the cares of my immense business ; a partner , young , active , and possessed of just the requisites which you have . " Walter Jerrold 's eyes lit up with an expression of wild triumph . He could scarcely believe his own ears ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stillinghast -- the bitter , inaccessible old man , should offer him something so far beyond his most sanguine hopes ; advantages which he had intended to intrigue , and toil unceasingly for , but which were now thrown into his very hands . " Do you understand me , Mr. Jerrold ? " " I hear you , sir , but really fear you are jesting at my expense . " " I never jest , sir . It has been so long since I jested that the word has become meaningless to me . But , as I said , there is a condition --  " " Allow me to hear it , Mr. Stillinghast , " said Walter Jerrold , fearing at least it might be something dreadful and impossible . " I have , " said the old man , as if talking to himself , " I have gathered together large sums . I scarcely know the exact amount myself . There is principal , interest , and compound interest , still heaping up the pile . I do not intend it shall be squabbled over when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapacity of lawyers . I shall dispose of my concerns while I have reason and health , in such a way , by Heaven ! as Heaven itself can not interfere with my plans ! " Why did not that boastful , gold-withered , shrivelled up old man , pause ? How dare he throw such defiance in the face of Almighty God over his unrighteous gains ! yes , unrighteous gains , for mammon held them in trust . None had ever gone into the treasure-house of God to relieve the suffering , or aid the indignant . The few good acts of his life had been wrested from him , and the recollection of them filled him with bitterness instead of joy . " That is wise and prudent , sir , " observed Mr. Jerrold . " Of course it is . But now to the point . I will take you into partnership on condition that you , as my successor , marry my niece , Helen Stillinghast , and promise on your honor to endeavor to overcome her Catholic tendencies . She is not very strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a considerable amount of property , I do not wish it to go to the support of a creed I detest -- not one copper of it . What do you say ? " " What amount of capital do you require , Mr. Stillinghast ? " " Whatever you have , sir . If it is much , well ; if nothing , it makes no difference : but , do you hesitate ? I suppose the girl is an obstacle . " " None in the least , sir . But I am overwhelmed by your generosity , sir ; the advantages you offer place me in a position which it would have taken me years of toil to attain , and I must confess , that I am quite thrown off my balance . Will you allow me at least a few hours to think ? " said Walter Jerrold , highly excited . " Your caution is no discredit to you . I see that I am not deceived , " said Mr. Stillinghast , with a grim smile . " To-morrow evening I shall expect an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and take your tea , and look at my niece . " " You will certainly see me then , sir , and hear my decision . " And the young man , with steps that scarcely felt the earth he trod on , hurried away , nor paused an instant , until he reached home . Mrs. Jerrold was standing on her marble carriage-step , just ready to get into her luxurious coach to take a drive . He whispered a word or two to her ; the carriage was dismissed , and mother and son went up stairs to analyze the sudden promise of fortune which had burst , like the bow of heaven , around them . And together we will leave them -- the worldly mother and the worldly son , to grow elate , and almost wild , at the prospect which Mr. Stillinghast 's eccentric liberality had opened to their view . At any rate , it was eligible in every respect , with , or without a matrimonial appendage ; and Cedar Hall was secured to the Jerrolds . Father Fabian , true to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well disposed , and of such docile faith , that he had promised , as soon as he finished her general confession , to give her holy baptism . Two or three times a week he dropped in , and was much edified by the fervor and humility with which she received his instructions . It all seemed like a new world dawning around her , as if through the chinks of her lowly dwelling bright visions of heaven stole in to gladen her , while her soul in its humble love traversed back and forth with angel messengers . May had not seen her for some days , and now went to take her money to pay the rent of her poor cottage , and purchase a supply of provisions . Mrs. Tabb had disposed of her fancy knitting , and sent her son early that morning with the proceeds , some six or seven dollars , to May . Rejoicing in the power to do good , and leaving all her vexations and trials at home , she sought old Mabel 's lowly dwelling , to impart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nellie , fetch that stool over thar for Miss May , " exclaimed the old woman , as soon as the door opened . " How is you , honey ? " " I am quite well , Aunt Mabel . I think you are looking better , " replied May , sitting down beside her . " Oh , honey , it 's blessed times with me now . I bin blind all my life ; I never see nuffin till now . Ah , honey , that good priest you send me ai nt like the buckra parsons I used to know . He ai nt too proud to sit down by a poor nigger , an ' take her lame hand in his'n , and rub it with some sort of liniment he fotch . And thar 's a bottle of wine he left ' cause the doctor said I must have some . He do n't stand off as if he was afeard I would pizen him , and fling the gospel at me like stingy people throws bones to dogs . He makes me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white folks , by treating me like one , honey . " " I 'm very glad , Aunt Mabel , that you are comforted by Father Fabian 's visits , " said May , smiling at her unsophisticated statement . " Yes , he comforts me mightily , Miss May ; and he talk so simple and beautiful , that I understand every word he says . " " What does Father Fabian tell you , Aunt Mabel ? " " He read one thing to me out of my ole Bible thar . You know I ca n't read myself , Miss May , but I keep it ' cause it belonged to my missis . He asked me if I ever been baptized ? ' I told him , ' No , sir . ' Then he ask me how I knew , and I tell him that too . Then he read what Jesus Christ said , ' Unless you be born again , of water and the Holy Ghost , you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven ; ' and , honey , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then he told me about the power our Lord left with his Church to forgive sins , and I did n't dar doubt it , ' cause who can be so presumptuous as to contradict Jesus Christ when he lays down the way and the truth ? But oh , Miss May , when the day comes for me to receive in my ole heart the dear Lord hisself -- my poor ole tired , aching heart -- then I lived long enough , ' cause the glory of God will be with me . " " It will be a most happy day , Aunt Mabel , " said May , dashing a tear from her cheek . " Now tell me something about our Immaculate Mother . Do you ever think of her ? " " Oh , Miss May ! how can I think of Jesus Christ -- how can I love him , without thinking of , and loving her ? If I go down to the manger , thar she is , watching over him , or holding him on her bosom ; if I go through Salem 's marble city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine Son ; if I go to Calvary , what do I see ? " said old Mabel , lifting her shrivelled hand , and dim eyes to heaven , while tears flowed over her swarthy cheeks ; " I see the Son of God , and the Son of Mary -- Jesus Christ , hanging on the rough wood ; his head , his hands , his feet , his side , dropping blood from the torn flesh . I see him dying for me ; and down at his feet , his mother suffering with him . Ah , honey , it was a heavy burden she bore that dark day ! The suffering of her son -- her own pangs -- the sins of the world , for which both suffered , as it ' pears to me , was too much for one human heart . Oh , do n't any body talk to me ' bout not loving the Blessed Virgin ! With one breath , I say , ' Have mercy on me , sweet Jesus ! ' with the other , I say , ' Pray for me , Virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I say at night , and the first I say in the morning . " " But you do n't worship the Blessed Virgin , Aunt Mabel ? " said May , with a smile . " Worship her , honey ? No ! but God honored and loved her . SHE was the mother of the dear Jesus ; the ' mount of her sufferings was for him and us , and I love her -- I honor her , and I go to her like a little child , and ask her to pray for me , and ask Him , who never refused her any thing , for what I want . " " She is a tender friend -- the refuge of sinners -- the health of the weak -- the help of Christians ! " said May , astonished at old Mabel 's language ; " and I am glad you have recourse to her . She will lead you along until all is well with you . Shall I read to you now ? Father Fabian requested me to read over the catechism to you . To-day I will read the instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear too much , Miss May , " said the old woman , leaning forward to listen , with an eager and anxious expression . May read , and explained , until she heard the cathedral bell toll the Angelus . It was time for her to go ; so kneeling down , she said with heartfelt devotion the beautiful prayer , which celebrates so worthily and continually the wondrous mystery of the Incarnation . After which she left her purse with old Mabel , containing the amount of her rent , which would be due the next day , and promising to send her tea , sugar , and other necessaries , called little Nellie in , and telling her to sit with her grandmother , hurried away with a lighter heart than when she came out . She made her purchases on her way home , and left directions where they were to be sent . After assuring herself that there would be no mistake , and obtaining a promise from the clerk who weighed the groceries that they should be delivered in the course of an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evidently determined to avoid all conversation on the event of the morning . Two or three times May endeavored to expostulate with her , but found herself rudely repulsed . That night , when Mr. Stillinghast came in , Helen officiously placed his chair in its usual corner , and handed him his slippers . May made two or three observations to him in her own cheerful way , but he barely replied , and desired her not to interrupt him again . Her heart swelled , and her cheeks flushed , but she remembered the aim of her life , and was silent . " Do you play on the piano ? " said Mr. Stillinghast , abruptly , to Helen . " No , sir ; I play on the harp , " she replied , amazed . " Do you play well ? " " My master thought so , sir . " " I will order one for you to-morrow . I expect company to tea to-morrow evening , so put on any fandangos you have got . " " Yes , sir , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can never thank you , sir . " " I do n't want you to , so be quiet , and do as I bid you , " he replied , roughly . " Poor Helen ! " thought May ; " poor -- poor Helen ! ' they seek after her soul , ' and she , oh , weak one ! how will she resist without the sacraments ? " After Mr. Stillinghast retired , and they were left alone , Helen again opened a French novel to resume her reading , without exchanging a word with her cousin . Thoughts and emotions were flooding May 's soul with impulses she dared not resist . She must warn her . She must stretch out her arm , weak though it was , to save her . " Helen ! dear Helen , listen to me ! " she said , kneeling before her , and throwing an arm around her neck , while she laid her hand on her cousin 's . Helen , astonished , dropped her book , and remained passive , while May besought her by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession , or go alone , as both could not leave home together ; then set before her in eloquent and soul-touching language the peril into which her prevarications were leading her . " You are mad , May.  - -  decidedly mad ; I intend to better my condition if I can , and be a Catholic too . I am only conciliating this crusty old wretch , who has us both in his power ; then , you know , we may bring him around after awhile , " she said , carelessly . " Oh , Helen ! we can not serve two masters , even for a season ; nor can we handle pitch without becoming defiled . Believe me , this kind of conciliation , as it is called , is fraught with evil , " said May , earnestly . " You are right about the pitch , May . He is truly as disagreeable as pitch ; but , indeed , I will endeavor to handle him with gloves on , " said Helen , laughing ; " and I wo n't go to confession until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle 's opinions and principles , for , Helen , he is an unbeliever ! " said May , sighing , as she turned away to go up to bed . " Do n't make any more scenes , little dear ; really , you startle one almost into spasms , " continued the heartless and beautiful one . " I have a very strong , high spirit , and a will ; no iron or rock is harder . " " Be warned , Helen ! I have a will , too , and shall not cease to admonish you -- to warn you -- to pray for you , until life ceases . " " Pshaw ! you are a fanatic . Good night , my dear . " CHAPTER IX . TRIALS . When May awoke the next morning at her usual hour , she discovered , to her great surprise , that Helen was up and dressed ; but how occupied she could not conceive , until rising , she saw her sitting beside her open trunk , with a lighted candle on a chair near her , looking over various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small hand-glass she tried the effect of jet and pearls in her ears ; of black velvet , or satin rosettes , in her soft wavy brown hair ; of white crape and illusion on her throat and wrists -- glancing all the time with an expression of pleased triumph at the reflection on her faultlessly beautiful face . " Thank God , I am not beautiful , " thought May , without a dash of envy . " I might -- yes , I am so weak -- I might worship myself instead of God . " But she said nothing , and performed her morning devotions , and made her meditations as usual ; then dressed quickly and neatly , and asked Helen if she was ready to go down . " I declare , May , you are a perfect little mouse . I did not know you were up . Yes ; I am ready now . I had quite forgotten that it was my morning to make breakfast , " she replied , returning the things to the trunk without the least possible hurry . " If you have any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not said your prayers yet , I will go down and get things in train for you , " said May , timidly . " Thank you , May , but I keep my own conscience . I have no time for my prayers now -- after breakfast will do , " she replied , carelessly . " Dear Helen , consider --  " " Dear May , I wo n't consider , " she interrupted her , " for I am in such a ferment of delight , what with the idea of company , and having a harp once more , I am really half wild , and could not pray for the life of me -- at least , as people ought to pray . Oh , what different times we shall have ! Really , May , I have an idea that I shall have our old savage dancing the Tarantula before to-morrow night , " she exclaimed , almost shrieking with laughter . " Helen , " began May , but checked herself , and burst into tears , which she endeavored to conceal -- such tears as angels shed over the derelictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not observe them ; giddy and selfish , she derived amusement from that which was luring her soul further away from God ; and , while May wept over her peril , she thought only of the transient and fleeting enjoyments of the present . Gayly humming the Tarantula , she ran down to the kitchen , where she got breakfast , or , rather claimed the reputation of getting it , by assisting May , who was really the practical cause of its being made at all tolerably . " What sort of gimcracks must one have for supper ? I have invited a friend with whom I have business relations of some importance , to tea , and I wish to know what is usual , " said Mr. Stillinghast , addressing Helen , after breakfast . " I do n't know , sir , " she said , looking down , with the half-frightened expression her face always wore when he addressed her ; " people generally have cake , and other nice things . " " Very well , make a supper to suit yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note . " We ought to have silver forks , sir , " she suggested . " Silver devils ! well , wait --  " He went up to his chamber , and returned with a package , which he laid carefully on the table , saying , " There they are -- be careful with them , " and went out without noticing May even by a look , who felt the neglect more keenly than any trial he had ever caused her . To find that Helen , who hated as much as she feared him -- whose life was so aimless and useless -- preferred before her , caused sharp and bitter emotions . The flagrant injustice of his treatment galled , as much as his unmerited contempt humiliated her . For a little while her feelings bore her along on their rough but silent torrent , while the hot winds of evil heated her veins with fire , and caused a hot flush to burn on either cheek . Ho ! how exulted the tempter now ; he had long laid in wait for her soul , and now , while it oscillated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his lurid brow towards the Almighty , while he spread out the snare for that tempted , trembling one ! but let us listen -- for angels guard her , and watch , with sorrowful eyes , the dread conflict , while they pray for heavenly strength to sustain her -- let us listen to the words which go up from that heart , so stilly and whispered that they scarcely reach our ears , while in Heaven they ring out clear , and sweet , and sorrowful ,  --  " Sweet Jesus ! merciful Jesus ! suffering , calumniated dying Jesus , pity me -- rescue me , " she murmured , folding her cold hands together . Far away fled the powers of darkness , and left only the sweetness and peace of that potent deliverer , JESUS , in her soul . Once more the angels of her life looked up rejoicing , and spread their wings of light about her way . Without , there had been an exterior calm ; but it was like that gray , sad stillness , which mantles the storm . Now there was sunshine as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Helen , who had been reading the paper . " We must try and make a nice supper , as my uncle wishes , Helen . I will make waffles and tea-biscuits , if you wish it , and we can order cake from Delaro 's . I think this , with chipped ham , tea , and coffee , will be sufficient . " " Thank you , May . I am so ignorant ; if you will only do it all for me , I shall be so obliged to you . You know I shall have to dress , and it takes me so long to arrange my hair gracefully . I wish , sometimes , that I had none -- it is so troublesome , " said the selfish girl . " Yes , " said May , after a little while , " I will attend to it . My dress is such an every day affair , that I shall be able to have every thing ready , to take the head of the table in time . " " The head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preside . " " Possibly . If my uncle wishes it , Helen , I will certainly resign it to you ; but , as I have always sat there , I shall continue to do so until he requests me to do otherwise , " said May , with becoming firmness . " Oh , of course ! It is quite indifferent to me , my dear ;  - -  but what have we here ? " said Helen , taking up the bundle which Mr. Stillinghast had laid on the table . " See , May , what splendidly chased silver forks ! How heavy they are ; and see ! here is a crest on them . " " They are very old , I presume , " said May , examining them with interest . " As old as the hills ! Where on earth has the old curmudgeon kept them all this time ? " exclaimed Helen . " Do you think he bought , or inherited them ? " " Inherited them , doubtless . My mother had the same crest on her silver . Our grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen , they require a good cleansing and rubbing . I will go to mass now , after which I will attend to your commissions . While I am out , you had better get down the old china , which you will find on that closet shelf , with some cut glass goblets . You can wash them up with the breakfast things ; or , if you would rather wait until I return , I will assist you , " said May . " Oh , no ! I like such work ; but , May , could we not hunt up your old maummy , if she is not too old , to come and wait ? " asked Helen . " She died two years ago , Helen , " said May , turning away her head with a quivering lip . " How unfortunate ! But , May , have you any fine table linen ? " " Yes ; a number of fine damask tablecloths . " " And napkins ? " " None . " " Thank fortune , I have some four dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table this evening . But hurry on , May , I wish to clear up to make room for my harp ; I expect it every moment . " That evening , if Mr. Stillinghast had looked around him , he would scarcely have recognized the sitting-room as the one he had left in the morning . The round table , just large enough to seat four comfortably , was elegantly spread with fine white damask , and crimson and old gold china , of an antique and elegant pattern ; sparkling cut glass , and silver . Two wax candles burned in the old-fashioned silver candelabras in the centre , on each side of which stood two clusters of geranium leaves and winter roses , arranged in small rich vases . The grate looked resplendent , and a harp , of a magnificent pattern , heavily carved and gilded , stood in a conspicuous place . Helen looked exquisitely lovely . Her dress was the perfection of good taste , and well did its elaborate simplicity suit her style of beauty . A single white rose , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jet brooch , which fastened the velvet around her throat , were the only ornaments she wore . But Mr. Stillinghast came in growling and lowering as usual , and without noticing any one , or any thing , threw himself in his arm-chair , which May had taken care should be in its place ; drew off his boots , and replaced them with the soft warm slippers she had worked for him some months before ; then called for the evening paper , and was soon immersed in the news from Europe , and the rise and fall of stocks . About a quarter of an hour afterwards the front door-bell rung , and May , who happened to be in the hall , went to admit the visitor , who was no other than Mr. Jerrold . He bowed courteously , and " presumed he had the pleasure of speaking to Miss Stillinghast ? " " My name is May Brooke , " said May , with one of her clear smiles . " And mine is Jerrold -- Walter Jerrold ; not so harmonious as yours , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak which was folded gracefully around him . " Life would be a sad monotone if every thing in creation resembled each other ; there would be no harmony . But walk in , Mr. Jerrold , my uncle expects you , " said May , throwing open the door . " How are you , sir ? " said Mr. Stillinghast , turning his head , but not rising . " My niece , Helen Stillinghast . Take a chair . " He did not introduce May , or notice her , except by a frown . Feeling the tears rush to her eyes at this new mark of her uncle 's displeasure , she flitted back to the kitchen , and commenced operations with her waffle irons . While engaged with her domestic preparations , she heard the gay , manly voice of Mr. Jerrold , in an animated conversation with Helen , who now , in her right element , laughed and talked incessantly . Again welled up the bitter fountain in her heart , but that talismanic word dispersed it , and it was gone , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she placed the supper on the table , she moved around with such calm self-possession -- such an airy , light motion of modest grace , that Walter Jerrold , who had seen much of the world , and lived in the best company , was struck by the anomaly which combined so much real grace with what , he considered , domestic drudgery . And May 's appearance justified his remarks . A dark , rich merino dress ; a small , finely embroidered collar , with cuffs of the same ; a breast-knot of crimson and black ribbon ; and her waving , glossy hair , falling in broad bands on her fair cheeks , and gathered up at the back of her head , beneath a jet comb , completed her attire . It was her usual holiday dress , and did not embarrass her . Her eyes looked larger , brighter , and darker than usual , and a faint tinge of rose stole through the transparent fairness of her cheeks . But , with all , May was no beauty in the ordinary acceptance of the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the soul like a pleasant , beneficent idea , and satisfy its longings with something calmer and holier than mere worldly friendship ; for there was that within May 's soul -- the hidden mystery of faith and religion -- which , like a lamp in a vase of alabaster , shone out from her countenance with an influence which none could withstand ; it won -- it led -- it blessed those who yielded to its power . She presided at the head of the table that evening with quiet grace , and attempted once or twice to converse with her uncle , but his looks and replies were so harsh that she turned to Helen and Mr. Jerrold , and in a short time found herself amused at his persiflage and Helen 's repartees . " I have writing to do , Jerrold , " said Mr. Stillinghast , after tea ; " and if you will excuse me , I will go up to my room . You can drop in , and look over those papers before you go . However , stay as late as it is agreeable for you to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen 's beauty and worldliness , his decision was made . Very soon was heard through the silent mansion strains of music , which startled the echoes in its silent and deserted rooms , accompanied by a voice of such thrilling sweetness and volume of tone , that the solitary old man , in his cold and cheerless apartment , threw down his pen , and sprung to his feet , to listen . It was Helen singing wild cavatinas from Norma , and solos from Der Freischutz , and looking so splendidly beautiful the while , that Walter Jerrold thought with pride and exultation of introducing so much loveliness to the world as his bride . May was silent , and wondered at it all , and felt , rather than reasoned that somehow Helen was bartering away her eternal interests for gain , and that these scenes were integral parts of the ruinous scheme . So she was not much surprised when Mr. Jerrold , on taking leave , asked permission to call the next day with his mother ; to which Helen assented graciously , and May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they would be pleased to see Mrs. Jerrold . " " Where shall I find Mr. Stillinghast , Miss Brooke ? " " In the room , sir , just at the head of the staircase . It is the first door , a little to the left . " " Thank you . Good night , again , fair ladies , " he said , bounding up the steps . " Come in , " said the voice of Mr. Stillinghast , in answer to his low tapping . " Aha ! well ? " " Have you the necessary papers ready , sir ? " inquired the young man , eagerly . " Here they are . Are you ready to sign them ? " " This moment , sir . Give me the pen . " " No , sir ; read them first . I 'll have no such head-over-heels doings in any transactions in which I am concerned . Here they are ! " said Mr. Stillinghast , in his saturnine , rough way . Walter Jerrold read the papers , which were worded according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt more than satisfied . " All right , Mr. Stillinghast . ' Faith , sir , your niece requires no golden chains to her chariot . She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld -- accomplished , and elegant in form and manners . Give me the pen ! " he said , earnestly , as he spread out the parchment , and prepared to sign his name thereto . " Clouds are beautiful with the sunshine on them , " said the old man , with a sneer ; " so is a mirage in the desert ; so are the apples on the shores of the Dead Sea . But she is yours . You 'll find no trouble in winning her , even at the sacrifice of her creed . She is of the earth earthy , and will willingly escape from such a miserable home as this . " " Mr. Stillinghast , I do not wish to feel that this is quite a barter . Your niece would grace a throne , and I am vain enough to think that I have qualities which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All mankind are fools ! But leave me -- goodnight . Make your arrangements to move to my counting-house to-morrow . " " My fortune is made . The ' Cedars ' will not pass into other hands , " thought Walter Jerrold , as he left the house . The next day May went to see old Mabel , who was quite sick ; and while she was gone , Mrs. Jerrold called with her son . The proud , worldly woman , was enchanted with the elegance and beauty of Helen , and , ere she left her , had engaged her in a round of engagements ; soirees -- the opera , and dinner parties , rung like music in Helen 's ears , who , half wild with joy , could scarcely repress her emotions from breaking out in some ill-bred expressions of delight . Without a moment 's reflection , she consented to attend St. Paul 's Church the next Sunday morning , at eleven o'clock , and hear the well-meaning Protestant clergyman who officiated there . " You will see the best people in town there ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By the best people , Mrs. Jerrold meant the leaders of the town , and had not the remotest idea that she was holding out a false inducement , or saying any thing at all incompatible with the spirit of Christianity . " I will call for you in my carriage , Miss Stillinghast , with Walter , " continued the lady , touching Helen 's cheek with her lips . And after this Helen quite withdrew herself from the domestic cares of the house to attend exclusively to her toilette -- her music -- her walks and drives with Jerrold , and visits to his mother . Mr. Stillinghast seemed not to observe what was going on , and May , anxious to shield her from his displeasure , which she supposed would be excited by this neglect , went on in her old routine , as if nothing had ever occurred to interrupt it . Thus weeks rolled by , and Helen was the affianced wife of Walter Jerrold ; forgetful of the demands of religion , and turning a deaf ear to the whispers of conscience , and a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scornfully hushing May 's expostulations , she thought only of the realization of her ambitious and worldly dreams , and plunged into the gayeties of life with a zest worthy of a better cause . May , all this time , was cheerfully climbing step by step ; sometimes fainting -- sometimes stumbling -- sometimes falling , but ever rising with renewed strength up the steep and narrow way of Calvary . Her uncle 's distrustful manner -- his harsh language -- his angry looks , with Helen 's apparent apostasy , and haughty demeanor , were trials which required the constant replenishing of grace in her soul , to bear with patience . But Father Fabian bid her to be of good cheer ; the divine sacraments of the Church strengthened and consoled her by their sweet and mighty power ; and like waters returning cool and purified to their source , or dews gently falling to the earth from which they had risen , in blessing and refreshment , her daily visits to old Mabel , so full of charity and good-will , filled her with indescribable happiness . Mrs. Jerrold insisted on furnishing Helen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive furniture for a house her uncle had settled on her , with permission to furnish it without regard to cost , on condition that she was married by a Protestant minister . She was telling May , with great glee and pride , about her purchases , when she suddenly paused , and exclaimed , " You need not look so grave , May . I presume my marriage will be as legal and respectable as if the ceremony was performed by a priest . " " As legal as any other civil rite . But , Helen , you know that the Church acknowledges no such marriages amongst her children . Her precepts teach that marriage , to be legal , must also be sacramental . It is a sacrament ; one which is held in high esteem and respect by the Church , and no Catholic can contract it otherwise , without censure . In case you persist , your marriage will not be recognized by the Church as valid , or your offspring legitimate . " " I shall have a great many to keep me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea of submitting to every thing ; Jerrold would not , I am sure , consent to being married by a Catholic priest , and I do not intend to thwart him , as I consider it a matter of very little importance . " " Helen , listen to me . You must listen to me . It shall be the last time , if you will only be patient . There is an hour coming , if you persist in your present course , when you will wish you had never been born ; an hour when all human aid must fail , and all human interests and splendor drop away from you like rotten rags ; when your soul , affrighted and shrinking , will go forth , obeying the inexorable laws , of the Creator , to meet its Almighty Judge . When the shadows will fall darkly around your way , Helen , and phantoms of darkness lie in wait , until the irrevocable sentence is spoken , which will consign you to utter woe ; when , stripped of all , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give evidence against yourself . Oh , Helen ! dear Helen ! how will it be with you then ? how will you escape , oh faithless daughter of the Church ! " " May ! " cried Helen , while her face grew deadly white , and she grasped her cousin 's arm ; " hush ! how dare you speak thus to me ? It is cruel ! Henceforth utter no such language to me while we both live . If I am on the brink of perdition , I alone am responsible for my acts -- not you . " " I will try to obey you , Helen , so far ; but I will pray for you -- I will do penance for you -- I will offer frequent communions for you -- I will intercede with our tender and Immaculate Mother for you . I will fly to Calvary , and at the foot of the cross beseech our suffering Jesus , by his bitter passion and death to have mercy on you . You can not stop me -- you can not hinder me in this , for , oh Helen ! it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptismal robe , trampling underfoot the seals of the Church , and rushing away from her fold of safety to eternal -- eternal woe ! " cried May , wringing her hands , while big tears rolled over her face . Helen turned away to brush off a single tear that moistened her eyes , but through it she saw the glitter of a diamond bracelet , which Walter Jerrold had just sent her , with a bouquet of hot-house flowers -- all rare and costly , and the poor tear was dashed off with impatience , and a haughty curl of the lip . " You act finely , May , but drop all this , and tell me what you will wear at my bridal , " said Helen , clasping the bracelet on her arm , to try its effect . " I shall not be there , Helen . I can not even wish you joy , for there can no joy ever come in disobeying the Church , whose voice is the voice of God himself . " " As you please , " she replied , coldly ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird of ill-omen to me . " May sighed , and retired to her oratory , to say her night prayers . CHAPTER X. THE WARNING . One morning Mr. Stillinghast was sitting alone in his counting-room , when Michael , the porter , came in , and informed him that a man wished to speak to him . " Tell him to come in , " he replied , moodily . " Here he is , sir , " said Michael , returning in a few minutes with a man , who had a saw slung over his arm . " What is your business with me ? " said Mr. Stillinghast . " And did n't your honor sind afther me ? " " I never heard of you in my life before , " he stormed . " And then , sir , you may blame the ommadhauns that sent me ; for , by this and by that , they tould me at the wood-yard , foreninst , that your honor was inquiring for me , " replied the man , slinging his saw up over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is too late , now -- it makes no difference , " said Mr. Stillinghast , speaking slowly , and frowning . " I 'd have come before , only the day afther the young lady took me to saw wood for the ould nagur , I got the pleurisy , and did n't lave my bed these five weeks , " said the man , lingering about the door . " Come in here , and close the door , " said Mr. Stillinghast , while his stern , forbidding countenance wore a strange look of anxiety ; " do you remember the young lady ; and can you direct me to the place where you sawed the wood ? " " Oh , yes , your honor . I shall never forget her to my dying day . She was a little , bright-eyed lady , with a smile of an angel on her , by dad ! " " May , " muttered the old man , " there is only one May . But I have a reason , " he said , turning to the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you conduct me to the place ? " " I 'm at your service intirely , sir . It 's a good stretch , though , " said the man , who looked weak from his recent illness . " Is it near an omnibus route ? " " Yes , your honor , it is close by where they stop . You 'll not have to walk far . " " Leave your saw here , then , and let us go . I have no time to spare on walks , " said Mr. Stillinghast , in his peremptory way . His real object , however , was not so much to save time , as to afford the man an opportunity to avoid a long and fatiguing walk . " Tell Mr. Jerrold I will be back in the course of an hour , " he said to Michael , as he passed out . " Very well , " replied Michael , heaving , with Titan strength , a bale on the truck ; " and there goes a pair of ' em . My boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like one hisself , and it 's hard to tell ' tother from which ; " and he planted his brawny hands on his thighs , and looked after them , with a broad smile on his honest countenance , until they got into the omnibus , and were whirled out of sight . At the depot , which is in the northern part of the city , they got out , and the two men pursued their way in silence . It was one of those cold , but calm , bright days in winter , when the very air seems filled with silent ripples of gladness ; when the sunshine rests like a glory on the leafless trees , and bright-eyed robins chirp and peck the moss , as they hop from bough to bough ; when the light of heaven is so over all , that even the dun-colored earth , the decayed leaves and rotten branches , which the autumn blast has laid low , look beautiful , and seem to whisper resurgam ; when a cold , bracing wind sends the warm blood bounding through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we bless it , as we do the strong hand which leads us in childhood ; and we listen , with docile tenderness , to its teachings , for it tells with pathos , of suffering in the hovels of the poor , and want , and poverty , and bids us thither like a winged angel . Down , beneath the rustic bridge , boys were shouting and skating on the frozen stream , their laughter echoing like music through the old woods ; anon , the sharp crack of rifle , or the distant barking of dogs , rung on the still air , while the bells of the city , and the hum rising up from its crowded streets , blending with the clear echoes , made a concert of merry and harmonious sounds . Mr. Stillinghast paused on a knoll , and looked around him . There lay the rolling country , with its undulations of hill and vale , all interspersed , and adorned with picturesque cottages and elegant villas . Towards the east , up rose the splendid city , with up-hill and down-hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great deeds ; its magnificent domes , raised in honor of the Most High God ; its lofty towers , its princely mansions ; while far beyond , stretching to the verge of the horizon , slumbered the quiet and beautiful bay , sparkling like a sea of ultramarine and diamonds , over whose waters hundreds of sails were hovering like white sea-fowl . Towards the north-western boundary of the city , he saw the dark , massive founderies and manufactories , which , from their palatial-looking walls , sent out the never-ceasing clang of labor , and the tireless song of steam , to which thousands of stout arms and brawny sinews kept time . And far beyond these , out on the quiet hills , the scene terminated in a Marble City , 1 where , beneath trees of centuries growth , its inhabitants slumber silently through the long , cold night of death , until the revivifying beams of the resurrection day shall dawn on the earth-mantle that wraps their clay . But over all shone the glad beauty of the day . It poured down its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of the living ! Mr. Stillinghast had not looked on the like for years , long , dusty , dreary years ; and he felt a tingling in his heart -- a presence of banished memories , an expansion of soul , which softened and silenced him , while gradually it lifted from his countenance the harsh , ugly mask he usually wore . " Here we are , " said the man , pointing to old Mabel 's cottage ; " this is the place . " Then it occurred to Mr. Stillinghast , for the first time , that he had come there without any particular object in view -- he had obeyed an impulse which he did not pause to analyze , and now , somewhat embarrassed he stood still , uncertain what to do . " You may return , " he said to the man , to whom he gave a dollar ; " this will pay you for the time you have lost . " The man thanked him , and went his way , rejoicing in the reward of such pleasant and easy labor . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am here on a fool 's errand , after all . But why not enter ? If this old beggar is so destitute , I can leave her something to buy a loaf ; but what business is it of mine ? A plague on it all ! What do I here -- why are you here , Mark Stillinghast ? " Then he opened the door very softly , and , as he did so , he heard these words repeated in a clear , sweet voice ,  --  " For what shall it profit a man , if he gains the whole world , and lose his own soul ! " then he saw May seated beside the old negro , reading from some pious , instructive book , of Christian doctrine . And those words came ringing down into his soul like the blast of ten thousand trumpets ! He staggered back ; his old , withered cheek , grew pallid , and he turned away and fled -- but they pursued him . " Profit -- gain -- loss . Profit -- gain -- loss . Profit -- gain -- loss . I understand them ! " he gasped . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share ; and now , at the eleventh hour , it is summed up , and what is it -- yes , what is it ? IT IS LOSS . For all that is mortal , I have toiled my best hours away ; for all that is immortal , not one hour have I spared . It is loss -- loss -- eternal loss . " And so he went on muttering -- back to his den in the city , where the leaden waves of business again came surging , breast high , around him ; but through the dull , heavy sounds , the warning still rung , like distant knells , through his soul . On his homeward way that night , the farther he receded from the noise of the city , the more it distinctly sounded , with its requiem wail , through the dreary chambers of his heart ; and , somehow , he suddenly remembered , as he paused to rest , that it was on this very spot that he had seen Father Fabian administering the last rites of the church to a dying penitent ; and he trembled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . May was sitting up alone for him ; and when she opened the door , and the rays from the hall lamp fell on his features , she saw that he looked ill and weary . " Let me assist you , dear uncle , " said May , taking his hat and returning to help him draw off his coat . " I fear you are not well . " " It is very cold , " he replied , shivering , and yielding to her wishes . " You will soon feel better , sir ; see what a nice fire here is -- and I have a piping-hot cup of tea and hot muffins for your supper . " " May Brooke , " said the strange old man , while he laid his cold , heavy hand on her shoulder , " stop ; answer the questions I shall ask you , truly and honestly . " " I will endeavor to do so , sir , " replied May , lifting her clear , bright eyes to his . " You can , and must . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , on the outskirts of the city ? " " I pity her , sir , because she is poor and helpless , and do it , I hope , for the love of God , " she said , amazed , but quiet . " Very well . And now , for the love of God , answer this , " he said , with anxiety ; " tell me how , you provide for her -- how you get means to buy wood and necessaries ? " " Dear uncle , I am sorry you have found it out . I do not like to speak of it -- indeed , I would prefer not -- it seems -- so -- yes -- it seems like boasting , or talking too much about myself , " said May , while her cheeks flushed crimson . " Go on ; I will know ! " he said , harshly . " Yes , sir . I earn a trifle every two or three weeks by knitting fancy articles , which Mrs. Tabb on C --  --  Street , disposes of for me --  " " And then --  " " And then , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but please , dear , dear uncle , do not forbid me to continue doing so ; pray allow me the privilege of earning a trifle for her benefit while she lives ; and then , sir , never -- never speak of it to me or any one else , after this , " she implored . " I shall not hinder you , child , " said Mr. Stillinghast , repressing a groan of anguish which struggled up from his heart . They went together into the sitting-room ; and May spread his supper before him , but he only drank his tea , and pushing his plate away , came and sat in his armchair beside the fire . " You have taken nothing , sir ; pray try and eat this , it is very nice . " " I have such an infernal singing in my ears , that I can not eat . I can hardly see . Ding , dong -- ding , dong . Great Lord ! if this should be eternal ! " he exclaimed , forgetting the presence of May . " You are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put your feet upon this cushion , so that the soles will be towards the fire , and while you smoke , I will read the paper to you , " said May . " For what ? " he asked , turning his fierce , gray eyes upon her . " Because you are not well , sir , " she said , looking calmly into them . " Do you know that I have made my will ,  - -  cut you off with a few paltry dollars , not enough to feed you , and left that Helen -- that trifler -- that waif , a princely fortune ? " he asked , savagely . " You have a right , sir , to do as you please with your own . You have sheltered , schooled , and fed me -- I have no right to expect more , " she said , gently . " And if I should be sick -- die -- what then ? " he asked , impatiently . " Dear uncle , you alarm me . Do you feel ill ? If so , oh , dearest uncle , attend first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet day , and enter into that fold whose Shepherd is Jesus Christ ; where one Lord , one Faith , one Baptism reign ! " exclaimed May , grasping his hand . " Be silent , you incorrigible papist ; what need is there of flying off at such a tangent ? " said Mr. Stillinghast , with a grim smile ; " I did not mean that , but what will become of you when I am dead ? " " I have a head , sir , and hands , and great faith in Him , who has promised to be a father to the orphan . I shall never want . In honest exertion I shall be happy and content , " she said , earnestly . " And you do not regret or envy the fortune ? " Not on my own account , sir . " " On whose , then ? " " There are many , sir , who might be benefited by it , if properly applied . I think , now , if I had a fortune , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd do harm , May Brooke -- you 'd do harm . You 'd squander it -- you 'd encourage pauperism , and worthlessness , and beggary ! " he burst out . " I shall never have it to do good or evil with , uncle ; but if I had , I would endeavor , for God 's sake , to bestow it where it was needed ; and because it would be offered for the love of Him , my works would not fall useless or fruitless to the earth . HE would bless and aid me . " " Profit -- gain -- loss , " again muttered the old man . " But , as you will never inherit a fortune , I suppose your good intentions must suffice . " " Yes , sir , for the present . " " And , now that you have nothing to expect from me , of course you will feel quite independent of me and my wishes . If I should be ill , I suppose you 'd take off and leave me to my fate , " he said , bitterly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but words and professions are mere sentences written in sand -- the first wave washes them out . I do n't want a fortune . I would not have gold , as I live , sir , except as the minister of my good purposes , the slave on which I could set my heel , unless it served me to lay up treasure in heaven . And should you be ill , dear uncle , I trust you will find no disposition in me to shrink from my duty . " " There it is again , " he murmured , as he got up , and walked to and fro . " Profit -- loss -- gain . Give me my candle ; I must go to bed -- I feel very weary and tired . " " Shall I get anything for you , sir ? " " No , " he replied . " I shall wait for Helen , sir , and if you want anything , just rap on the floor , or call , and I will come up instantly . " " Go to bed -- go to bed , child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , as he went out into the hall to go up to his room . 1 Greenmount Cemetery . CHAPTER XI . THE MIDNIGHT MESSENGER . May listened , and heard Mr. Stillinghast moving to and fro in his room with slow and regular footsteps for a while , then all was silent , and she supposed he had gone to bed . Still waiting for Helen , she recited the rosary for his conversion . She knew that all things are possible with Almighty God , and that dear to him , and precious in his sight , is the conversion of sinners . She also knew that Jesus Christ ever turns a propitious ear to the intercession of his Immaculate Mother , and it was with tender confidence , and earnest faith , that she implored her to obtain from her Divine Son the conversion of her uncle . At last a carriage stopped , and May heard Helen 's voice at the door conversing gayly with Walter Jerrold . She wrapped her shawl about her , and went out to admit her . She sprang into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without stopping , flew to her harp , and ran her fingers over the strings , preluding brilliantly , " Oh , May , you should have been there -- the most divine opera ! Sontag sung like an angel . " " Dear Helen , " said May , interrupting her , and laying her hand on her arm , " do n't ! you will disturb Uncle Stillinghast ; he is not well . " " You do n't say so ! " exclaimed Helen , turning her face towards her , while a gleam of almost ferocious pleasure shone in her eyes . " Oh , you do n't say so ! Is he very sick ? " " A slight cold , I believe ; at any rate , do not let us disturb him , " said May , surprised and shocked at her evident pleasure . " What nonsense ! " cried Helen , laughing hysterically ; " he 'll live until you and I are both dead , May . He 's as tough as gutta percha . But , would it not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave us his money ? " " Do not say us , Helen . I expect nothing , and desire nothing . As for you , be satisfied ; you are handsomely provided for . " " I know it ; I know it . I have read the will ! " exulted Helen . " Read the will , Helen ! How ? When ? " " Oh , I did not mean that exactly , " said Helen , much confused ; " you really take me up so quick , that it is terrible . I should have said that Walter told me something of the old man 's intentions . " " May it be blessed to you , Helen , come when it will ; but while he lives , let his generous intentions in your favor purchase at least your respect , " said May , in a tone of bitter reproof , for at the moment she recollected Helen 's threat some weeks before to get into her uncle 's chamber , if possible , and she feared that she had accomplished her object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just in principle . " May , you wo n't say anything -- about -- about what I just blundered out concerning the --  " said Helen , confused and stammering . " No , Helen ; I have nothing to say . It was natural , though not delicate , for Mr. Jerrold to impart such information to you . No doubt he thought it would enhance your happiness , " said May , settling herself in her uncle 's chair . " That 's a good May . Oh , May , if you were not such a little fanatic how I should love you , " said Helen , stooping over to kiss May 's forehead ; but she put up her hand , and the kiss fell on the tips of her fingers . But her very indignation , although just , humbled her , for with a flash of thought , she was in Gethsemane , and saw the meek and Divine Jesus receive the kiss of Judas . " Why , then , " she thought , " should I shrink back from one who needs my pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a little longer , Helen . I feel quite uneasy about Uncle Stillinghast . Good night , " she said , holding out her hand to Helen . " What a curious little one you are , May , " said Helen , holding the tiny hand a moment in her own ; " but do come up soon , for really I am afraid to be up there alone . " And Helen went up to their chamber , and closed the door . She was alone , and had inadvertently placed her candle on May 's table before the old Spanish crucifix . A small circle of light was thrown around it , from the midst of which the sorrowful face , in its depicted agony of blood and tears , and the measure of a world 's woe stamped on its divine lineaments , looked on her . Terrified and silent , she stood gazing on it -- her hands clasped -- her lips apart , and trembling . The crown of thorns -- the transfixed hands and feet , from which the blood seemed flowing -- the wounded side -- the sorrowful eyes , appealed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience ; " it was all for thee !  - -  this ignominy -- this suffering -- this death -- oh , erring one ! It was all for thee Divine Jesus assumed the anguish and bitterness of the cross ! Oh , wanderer ! why add new thorns to that awful crown of agony ? Why insult the son of God , who suffers for you , by your derelictions and betrayal ? " Stricken and afraid , she would have fled from the spot , but she could not move ; her temples throbbed and her limbs trembled , when , lifting her eyes , she beheld a portrait of the mother of Sorrows , whose countenance , sublime in its blended tenderness and grief , seemed to look down with pity on her . She sunk weeping to the floor , and murmured , " Intercede for me , oh , Lady of Sorrows ! I have wounded thy Divine Son by my transgressions ; I fear to approach Him , who is my terrible Judge ; pity me , then , that I may not become utterly cast away ! " Then she wept softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen repentance , the errors of the past would be atoned for -- that a new life would dawn around her ; that in prodigal 's attire of repentance and tears , she would return humbly to her Father 's house . But the spirit of the world had wound its deadly fetters too closely around her ; the time of her return and purification , and welcome -- if it ever came , was veiled in the future ; but that passionate soul-felt appeal to the Refuge of Sinners was registered where it would return in benedictions when the soul weary of its wanderings , sought for forgiveness and peace -- if it ever did . And , after all , ere sleep visited her eyelids , she was plunged again in plans of petty ambition , vanity , and the pride of life ,  - -  so impotent is the human heart , unsupported by the grace of God . Twelve o'clock chimed from the old French clock over the mantel , and May , all unconscious of Helen 's struggle with conscience , still waited to hear any sound that might come from Mr. Stillinghast 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping her shawl around her to go up to bed , when she thought she heard a groan -- then footsteps , followed by a peculiar muffled sound . In a moment she was in the hall , where she heard it more distinctly , and springing up the staircase , rushed into her uncle 's room . By some rare forgetfulness , or bewilderment , he had left his door unfastened . The candle was still burning , and May saw him lying on the floor , where he had fallen in his endeavor to reach the door to call for assistance ; his face purple and swollen , and his breath gurgling up with a choking , spasmodic sound . " Great God , help me ! " cried May , throwing up her arms wildly . " He will die before I can obtain help ! " But she was not the one to stand lamenting when aught was to be done , so , collecting her scattered senses , she bethought herself of the watchman , who was just at that moment crying the hour at the corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the freezing mist and darkness , she found him , seized his hand , and told her story . " Go , for God 's sake ! for the nearest doctor ; do not delay an instant . " " Who are you , you wild witch , grabbing a fellow like a cat ! Who are you ? " cried the watchman , shaking her off . " I am the niece of old Mark Stillinghast . He is dying , I fear , " she cried , wringing her hands . " Zounds ! the old man dying ! Yes , I 'll go directly , " said the watchman , moving off . He had been on the beat twenty years , and felt an individual interest in all those whose property and lives he guarded . Then May , thankful for his promptness , remembered to have heard that ice applications to the head were good in cases like this , and rushing back into the yard , she groped her way to the rain-barrel , and stooping over , seized the jagged edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tearing it away from the sides , hastened back , and up to the chamber of death , with her prize in her bleeding hands . Stripping a case from a pillow , she threw in the ice -- pounded it with the tongs -- shook it together , and lifting up her uncle 's insensible head , laid the icy pillow under it , and gathered the ends over his forehead , as well as she could . Then she chafed his hands , exclaiming all the time , " Merciful Jesus , pity him ! Merciful Jesus , help me , and strengthen me ! " But his breathing became more and more difficult , and his limbs began to be agitated with horrible convulsions . A sudden thought suggested itself . She untied her silk apron , tore off the strings -- ripped up the sleeve of Mr. Stillinghast 's shirt , and wound the ribbon tightly around his arm above the elbow ; and while waiting for the vein to swell , she took a small penknife from her pocket , and opened the blade -- it was thin , keen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers years ago , and kept it about her to scrape the points of her ivory knitting-needles . In another moment , invoking the aid of Heaven , she had made an incision in the vein . A few black drops of blood trickled down -- then more ; then fast and faster flowed the dark stream over her dress , on the floor , for she could not move -- her strength was ebbing away . Presently the brain of the stricken man , relieved of the pressure on it , began to resume its functions ; the spasms and convulsions ceased , and a low moan escaped his lips . At that moment the watchman , accompanied by a physician , entered the room , and May remembered nothing more . CHAPTER XII . REPENTANCE . When May recovered , she looked around her with an alarmed and bewildered feeling . The darkened , tossed-up room ; the stranger watching beside her ; the pale , silent form on the bed , so motionless that the bed-clothes had settled around it like a winding-sheet , were all so much like the continuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up on her elbow . " You are better ? " inquired a kind voice . " Have I been ill ? " she asked . " Not ill , exactly , " replied the doctor ; " you fainted just as I came in with the watchman to your assistance . " Then she remembered it all . " How is my uncle now , sir ? " said May , sitting up , and with a modest blush gathering up the masses of dark hair which had fallen from her comb . " He is doing well now . He is indebted to your energy and presence of mind for his life , " said the doctor . " Oh , thank God ! thank God , that he is better ! Do you think , sir , that he will recover ? " " He may , but it is doubtful . I shall not be able to decide until he awakes . Meanwhile , lady , lie down , and rest . I will watch . " " I could not sleep , sir ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will rest my head on the sofa here , that I may be better able to attend to my duties to-day , " said May , in her earnest , matter-of-fact sort of way . And the doctor , a young man who was rising rapidly in his profession -- a son of the people , who , through difficulties and rugged obstacles , and calumny and opposition , had emerged purified , and conscious of power from it all , and attained an honorable position professionally and socially , looked at that fragile form , and paid homage to the right-thinking and right-acting spirit it contained . Her conduct had been heroic , noble , and evinced so much strength of character that even he , accustomed to phenomena , mental and physical , wondered . He knew not whence she derived her strength ; he had no idea of that divine charity which gives Titan power to the weak , and considers life itself of little worth when it does battle for the salvation of souls . It was a mystery , the effects of which he had witnessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology . Towards sunrise , Mr. Stillinghast turned uneasy on his pillow , and opened his eyes . He looked around him with a puzzled , angry look ; his bound-up arm -- his garments clotted with blood -- the confusion into which his room was thrown -- the strange man watching by his bedside -- May resting on the old sofa -- what meant it all ? He tried to call out , but could only whisper . " What 's all this ? Have I been robbed ? Who are you ? " " I hope you feel a great deal better , Mr. Stillinghast . You have been quite ill , sir , " said the doctor , soothingly . " I am Dr. Burrell ; allow me to feel your pulse . " " For what ? I never was sick in my life . I never had my pulse felt , " he said , doggedly . " How does your head feel , sir ? " " My head ! ah , my head feels shaky . Call her here . " May was beside him in a moment , holding his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's all this , child ? Why are you here ? " " You have been very ill , dear uncle . You know you were poorly last night . I felt uneasy about you , and sat up to listen if you should call for any thing , until I heard you fall , " said May , in a low , clear , and distinct voice . " Fall ? " " Then , sir , I ran up here , and found you on the floor , so ill -- so very ill , " said May , hesitating , always unwilling to speak of her own acts . " What then ? " " I did all that I could , sir , until the doctor came , " she said . " And that means every thing , Mr. Stillinghast . She saved your life . She used the best remedies ; she put ice about your head , and bled you . When I came you were out of danger ; but be calm , sir ; let me beseech you to be calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , little May ? " he asked , looking earnestly at her with his piercing gray eyes . " Yes , sir ; I had read that such remedies were necessary . " " Why did you do it , little one ? My life or death is of no interest to you . Tell me why you did it ? " he whispered . " Oh , dear uncle , forgive me ! " said May , while her tears dripped like rain-drops on her wan cheek ; " I knew that you had made no preparation for death . I would have died that you might live long enough to effect a reconciliation with Heaven . " " **30;1141;TOOLONG ! " he murmured ; then suddenly he put up his feeble hand , and drawing May 's face closer to him , kissed her cheek . " If it is not too late , pray for me ! " he whispered , in tones so low that she scarcely heard them . " Not too late . Oh no , dear uncle , it is not too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair from his sunken temples . " Mr. Stillinghast , my dear sir , I fear that you are exciting yourself . I would recommend quiet , composure ; indeed , sir , it is absolutely necessary in your case , " said the doctor , looking on uneasily . " It will make no difference , sir . I know full well whose finger has touched me . Do you know that I can not move my left side ? " said the old man in his firm , stern way . " I feared it , " said the doctor , turning away to conceal the expression of pain which this information caused him ; " but it may pass off , you may quite recover yet , sir . A cup of weak tea would be good for our patient , " he said to May . May glided out of the room , followed by the gaze of the stricken old man , to prepare it for him . She ran up to awaken Helen , and told her that their uncle was dangerously ill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I get a cup of tea for him . " " How very pale you are , May ! Is he in danger ? " exclaimed Helen , starting up , quite awakened by the news . But May was gone . When she went up again with the cup and saucer in her hand , Mr. Stillinghast greeted her with a look of welcome . " Do not leave me again , " he whispered , as he sipped the tea ; " it will not be long , little one , that I shall keep you . Take this away now , and send for Mr. Fielding . " " Perhaps you know Mr. Fielding , sir ? " said May , to Dr. Burrell . " He is my neighbor . Can I be of service ? " he replied . " My uncle wishes to see him as early as possible . He is his man of business , I think , " replied May , who felt anxious that Mr. Stillinghast should attend to his worldly concerns , and wind them up as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be directed to higher objects . " Here is a prescription , sir , " said the doctor , " which I would advise you to take immediately . " " Will it cure me ? " It may relieve you very much . " " Will it cure me , I say ? " said the old man , sharply . " I can not say ; I can only promise temporary relief from its use . " " I wo n't take it . I thank you for your patience , and shall be glad to see you again ; but I wo n't take your medicine . " " If you were a child , sir , I would compel you to take it ; but as it is , I can only recommend the continual application of cold bandages to your head . I will call in this evening , " said the doctor , kindly , as he left the room . " May ! " " I am here by you , sir . " " It is not too late to do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear uncle ! " said May , earnestly , " forget me ; forget the affairs of earth , and think of the judgment beyond the grave ! Oh , sir ! indeed -- indeed , I fear , that the time is too short to be wasted on perishing things . " " Listen to me ! " said the old man , gathering up his failing energies , and speaking in a low , distinct voice ; " I wish to save my soul , but fear it is too late . My life has been one long , dark , dismal blank . There is nothing which I can remember -- not one single thine , to cheer this dreary hour . I have gained the world , and lost -- heaven . Until yesterday , I derided and scorned all religions . It has been my lot in life to become entangled and betrayed by hypocrites of various professions . They disgusted and embittered me with all religion . I tried to think you a hypocrite , and cursed your patience and good works as so many snares for gain . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to that old negro 's hut ; I wrung the tale of your charities from your unwilling lips , and know and understand all . And now , in return for all my harshness , my neglect , my cruel unkindness , you save my life ; you tend me , nurse me , watch me , and for what ? For the love of God . " Do n't interrupt me , little one . You have proved the truth of the faith you profess by your works . It suits me . I need no doctrinal arguments , no theological and abstruse disquisitions , to convince me that it is right . I believe it , May , even at the eleventh hour , when I have but little to hope . I believe -- perhaps as devils do -- for , child , I tremble . " " Oh , dear uncle , the grace of contrition is never given to devils . It is Almighty God who has touched your heart . He pities , and would save you . ' I desire not the death of him that dieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . ' " " Does he say that ? " " Yes ; that , and ten thousand times more . Think of Him , dear uncle , ' who was wounded for our transgressions , who was bruised for our sins ; the chastisement of our peace was upon him , and by his bruises we are healed . ' " " What must I do besides ? " " Believe , and be baptized . " " Baptized ! I was raised in the belief of the Friends , and have never been baptized , " he said , musingly . " Better so , sir , for now you can receive properly the waters of regeneration , and experience , when you so much need them , all the graces that flow from baptism into the believing soul , " said May . " I know the doctrines of your faith , May . I have read -- I studied it in my days of vision and unreality as an admirable system of human philosophy ; but you , child , in your humility -- in your patience and long-suffering -- in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , uncle , not me -- not me ! I have done nothing but duty , " said May , covered with confusion . " It is the mysterious hand of Almighty God , leading you , guiding you to the truth . " " It can never -- never be now ! It is too late . I have wasted the hours -- I have buried the talents -- I have derided time -- now the night cometh when no man shall work , " he said , with an expression of anguish . " Shall I bring Father Fabian ? He can strengthen and cheer you with the promises of Christ ; he has the power and authority from a divine source to absolve and prepare you for your passage into eternity . Oh , sir , let me go . " " Do with me what you please , strange -- strong -- wise little one ! Only never leave me . Send your cousin for him . " Just then Helen made her appearance , elaborately and beautifully dressed , as usual , and was shocked at the change in her uncle 's appearance , which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt ? " " I believe I am ill . I wish you to take a note from May Brooke to her confessor . She must remain with me , " he said , in his old way . " I will go instantly , " she said , glad to escape from such a scene , and wondering what the strange old man could have to do with a priest . May scribbled a few lines on the blank leaf of a book , tore it out , directed it to Father Fabian , and gave it to Helen . " Try to sleep a little , sir , " said May , gently . " I have no time for sleep -- tell me of Jesus Christ ! " And May took down from the shelf an old , mouldy Testament , which had not been opened for years , and read , in clear , steady tones , and with sweet pathos , the Passion of our Lord from Gethsamane to Calvary . When she finished , and looked up , the lips of that pale visage were firmly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were falling apace -- the first he had shed for long , dreary years -- the first of contrition that had ever welled up from his soul . He did not fear death -- the mere act of dying , even the thought of annihilation , would not have stirred a ripple of fear in his heart , because , physically , he was bold , reckless , and defiant of personal danger -- but the eternal instincts of his soul , developed by the providence of God , at the eleventh hour , sought their true destiny ; they shrunk , with dread , from the scrutiny of Divine Purity , yet longed for immortal life , and immortal progress . Suddenly the veil had been torn from his eyes ; suddenly he felt all the gnawing , hungry needs of his soul ; suddenly his weakness , his wanderings , his infirmities , his tacit unbelief and indifference , were revealed , in all their frightful deformity ,  - -  and how ? By a still , calm voice -- the voice of a child , which had rung down the warning into his soul like thunder . " What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and lose his own soul ? " it had said ; and earth and earthly affairs had assumed the shape of nothingness ; the tough , hard work of years was scattered -- like a potent lever it lifted away the demoniac weight of darkness and pride from his soul , as it rung down into its frozen depths . And the strong angel of God , who had been contending with the powers of evil , to wrest it from eternal loss , bore up the glad news to heaven , that the hoary sinner repented at the eleventh hour ; and there was great joy among the angels of His presence , before Him . CHAPTER XIII . THE NEW WILL . Father Fabian came . Miracles such as this never amazed him . He knew too well that the Spirit of the Eternal God , which abides with His Church for ever , was as powerful then as it had been in ages past , and that He still condescended to add miracles to the testimony of revelation , to glorify the faith He planted . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad , " giving thanks to God for this new manifestation of His clement love . Long , and earnest , and touching , was the interview between the priest of God and the dying penitent . He saw the depths of an old and embittered heart broken up ; he heard its plaintive cry , as it floated out towards the dark ocean of death , of , " Save , Lord , or I perish ! " and its imploring prayer for the waters of regeneration , and the sacraments of the Church . All earth had failed him in this his hour of need ; and from the deep abyss of his misery he expected no deliverance but through them . But at last , Peace was whispered , and into his soul was breathed the holy sentence of absolution ; and on his hoary head was poured the baptismal stream ; his eyes and ears had been opened by divine power ; and , like Siloa 's wave , it washed him clean . What was the leprosy of those men of old , to the corroding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years diseased and defaced his spirit ? They were healed by a miracle of power ,  - -  he , by a miracle of grace . Mr. Stillinghast was much exhausted , but calm and humble ; he had suddenly become like a little child , so sincere and entire was his repentance . " I will come again in a few hours , and administer to you , my poor friend , the Sacrament of Extreme Unction ; and if I find that you are sinking , will bring the Holy Viaticum for your refreshment and consolation in the dark and trying hour . I would advise you now to settle all your worldly concerns , so that nothing may interfere between your soul and God . " " How is it with you now , dear uncle ? " said May , who came in as Father Fabian left the room . " Unworthy , child -- all and utterly unworthy , but hoping humbly , through the infinite merits of Jesus Christ , " he whispered . " Mr. Fielding and Doctor Burrell are here ! " said Helen , coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is , sir . " " Request him to come back . " Soon after the three gentlemen came in together . " Leave me a little while , " he said , unclasping his fingers from May 's hand . " I fear that you feel very feeble , Mr. Stillinghast , " said the doctor . " I feel it , sir , but I have a work to do , and the ' day is far spent . ' Could you ascertain , in any way , so that you could swear to it , that I am in my sane mind ? " he asked , eagerly . " The subject requires no investigation , sir . I have not the least doubt of your sanity . Your mind has been quite -- nay , uncommonly clear since your recovery , " replied the doctor . " Gentlemen , " he said , addressing the other , " I am perfectly and entirely in my senses ; I have not a single obscure or confused idea . All is clear and calm . Fielding , I made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it -- to make another . Open that desk , and you will find parchment , pens , and ink . Now , come sit near me -- so . Begin and write the usual preamble and formula . " " It is done , sir , " said Mr. Fielding , after writing rapidly some ten minutes . " I wish to devise to my niece , May Brooke , two hundred thousand dollars in bank and city stock , subject to her entire and free control , without condition ; and with the hope that she will accept and use it , as a memorial of my gratitude for the great and incalculable good she has done me . To Helen Stillinghast , I bequeath the sum of fifty thousand dollars , the harp I purchased for her , and the house , goods , and chattles I have devised to her elsewhere . " " It is all written out , sir , in due legal form , " said Mr. Fielding . " To my Irish porter , Michael Neal , who has served me faithfully these twenty years , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . To a certain wood-sawyer , introduced to me on the 25th by said Michael Neal , who will identify the man , the sum of one hundred dollars , annually , while he lives , as a small compensation for having conducted me , on that day , to a place where I learned something of the first importance to me . " Then followed a magnificent bequest for the establishment and support of a Catholic asylum for boys ; another for a standing fund for the support of young men preparing for the priesthood , who were destitute of means , and anxious to enter holy orders . The residue of his princely fortune , he wished applied to furnishing capital for a bank for the poor , where , by making small deposits in seasons of health and prosperity , they would be entitled to loans without interest , in ill-health , sickness , or hard times . To Walter Jerrold , in the event of his marrying Helen Stillinghast , his warehouse , then occupied by Stillinghast &; Co. , and whatever merchandise it contained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicality was omitted that might endanger the prompt execution of his wishes -- not a letter or dot left out . Mr. Fielding read it aloud . " Add a codicil , Fielding -- a codicil . I wish my legacies to the church to be placed in the hands , and under the control , and at the will of , the Archbishop of Baltimore . For the rest , I name you sole executor . Have you finished ? Let me sign it ; then ask those gentlemen , " he said , pointing to Father Fabian and Dr. Burrell , who had been engaged in a low-toned conversation at the window , to " witness it . " They came forward , saw him sign his name in full , clear characters , then appended their own signatures ; after which , Mr. Stillinghast fell back exhausted on his pillow , and , while an expression of rest settled on his pale , time-worn features , he exclaimed , " It is all right , now , Fielding . Now , my God , I am free ; my burden , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I am free ! " " Courage , my friend ; you have done a good work -- a work worthy of a dying Christian , and may the blessing of Almighty God rest on it and you , " said Father Fabian , who made over him the sign of the cross , while he blessed him in the name of the Holy Trinity . Mr. Fielding placed the will in a large white envelope , which he laid on the bed beside Mr. Stillinghast , and took leave , hoping that when he saw him in the morning he would be much better . The doctor prevailed on him to swallow a restorative which he had brought , after which , he grew more composed , and gave the will to May , and directed her to lay it on the shelf of a small , narrow closet , on the left side of the fireplace . As she did so , she saw another envelope like it , marked " Will ; " also a number of packages -- bonds , deeds , mortgages , and receipts , tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves . But she felt no interest there ; and quickly returning to her uncle 's pillow , was glad to see that he had fallen into a profound sleep . Helen , who had been hovering about the door , and around the room , in and out , for the last half hour , came in again , and asked May if " she should not relieve her by taking her post , while her uncle slept ? " " No , dear Helen , he might awake and miss me ; and he has requested me not to leave him until death releases his soul . Do you attend to the affairs of the house -- I will watch here . " " There 's something going on , " thought Helen . " She 's a deep one , with all her quiet piety ; but she shall never stand between me and my aims . I have read one will -- I shall not sleep until I read the other . " Then , turning to May , she spoke aloud . " It will suit me better to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a poor nurse ; " and glad to be released from a scene too uncongenial to her nature and feelings , she hastily withdrew . CHAPTER XIV . THE SECRET SIN . " This is shocking news , Walter ! " said Mrs. Jerrold to her son , when he imparted to her the news of Mr. Stillinghast 's illness . " Do you know -- has he -- did he send --  " " I do n't know , indeed , " said the young man , abstractly . " I mean , has he altered his will ? " said the lady , speaking out . " I do not know ; Helen tells me that a lawyer has been with him , and a priest . " " A priest ! " shrieked the lady . " Order the carriage instantly , Walter ; I must see Helen . " " I have not seen her since the morning , " said the young man , after having delivered the order , and returned to the sofa . " She looks harassed and ill , poor girl . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Walter , " said Mrs. Jerrold , fuming . " After all , this eccentric old person may change his mind , and it will be so awkward to break off the match , for you can not afford to marry a poor woman . " " I do not apprehend any thing of the kind , mother . Helen 's beauty and accomplishments are dower enough , " he replied , calmly . " Walter , I will never consent to this marriage if Helen is portionless , " exclaimed the lady . " My dear mother , you sometimes forget , do you not , that I have reached the mature age of thirty-one ? Really , where my happiness is concerned , I shall submit to no control , " he said , calmly . " Happiness ! " repeated the lady , scornfully . " The carriage is at the door , madam , " said a servant , at the door . " Very well . Tell Rachael to bring down my bonnet and wrappings . " Soon accoutred for her drive , Mrs. Jerrold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her carriage . He handed her in , and stepped in after her . " Why do you go , Walter ? " she asked , looking annoyed . " I wish to inquire after Mr. Stillinghast 's health , " he said , quietly . A few minutes ' drive brought them to Mr. Stillinghast 's door . Helen heard the carriage stop , and her toilette , as usual , being very becomingly and carefully made -- for Helen never forgot her self-homage -- she met them at the door . Her countenance had assumed a sad and mournful expression , and in answer to their inquiries , she spoke in an agitated and subdued tone . " It is horrible . I did not hear a word of it until to-day . I was dreadfully shocked , " said Mrs. Jerrold , kissing her cheek . " How is Mr. Stillinghast now , dear Helen ? " asked Walter Jerrold , folding her hand closer in his own . " They fear he is sinking , " said Helen , in the same tone of counterfeit feeling . " How melancholy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sofa , almost dying with curiosity . " Has he inquired after me , do you know Helen ? " " I have not heard . " " I thought , perhaps , he might wish to see me in relation to the firm , and its concerns ; though every thing has been conducted with such strict regularity , that I do not suppose it is necessary . " " Perhaps as May has been with him all the time , she can give you some information , " said Helen , with one of her cold , haughty glances towards May , who just then came in . " I will not detain you one moment , " said Mr. Jerrold , bowing to May . " I am anxious to know particularly how Mr. Stillinghast is , and if he has inquired for me ? " " But this moment , Mr. Jerrold , he awoke , and requested to see you . I thought you were here , and ran down to see . He is very low indeed , sir , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " It may not be important ; but if he is not too ill , I should be glad to see him a moment . " " I will come down for you immediately . Excuse me , Mrs. Jerrold , " said May , who hurrying out , was met by Father Fabian . He spoke kindly to Helen , bowed courteously to the strangers , and went up stairs . " Who is that , dear ? " asked Mrs. Jerrold , whose attention had been arrested by the dignified courtesy of Father Fabian 's manner . " A Catholic clergyman , " said Helen , blushing . " Your uncle is not a Catholic ? " " He was not , but he is now . " A look of ineffable scorn spread over Mrs. Jerrold 's handsome face , while a low , contemptuous laugh from her son , was the response . " Dear Helen , " said Mrs. Jerrold , taking the weak girl 's hand in her own , with a caress , " excuse me , for no doubt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wisely abandoned ; but this is so absurd . How came it about ? " " I can not imagine , " she replied , in a faltering voice ; for at that moment the thorn-crowned head of Jesus Christ -- his sorrowful face stained with drops of blood , until its divinely beautiful lineaments were almost covered -- was visioned in her soul with such distinctness , that she almost shrieked ; then it faded away , and she went on : " I have seen very little of my uncle since his illness . He keeps my cousin May by his side , and is uneasy if she leaves him an instant . " " And she is a Catholic ? " asked Mrs. Jerrold , anxiously . " Yes , a perfect devotee , " replied Helen , bitterly . " An infatuation ! He is weak ; his nerves and senses are shattered by this attack . He has been influenced by her and the priest . My dear Helen , I fear your interests will suffer . " " Do you really think so ? " said Helen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up for a moment . My uncle desires to see you particularly , " said May , appearing at the door . " That is a designing girl , depend on it , " whispered Mrs. Jerrold , as her son left the room ; " and now , Helen , I must warn you . Be on your guard , and do not feel hurt when I say , that if she should have succeeded in cozening your uncle to revoke his will in her favor , my poor son 's happiness will be wrecked for ever . He is not rich , you know , and is too proud to marry a woman whom he can not support in good style ; consequently , this marriage , which , under existing circumstances , gives us so much pleasure , would then have to be broken off . " " Mr. Fielding was with him , and I heard them talking about a will , but whether it was the old , or a new one , I could not determine , " said Helen , becoming very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming down . But remember what I tell you . Well , dear Walter ? " " I think Mr. Stillinghast is sinking , but he is perfectly himself , " said the young man , in a low tone , as he seated himself . " He is much changed , and speaks in broken sentences . " " He knew you ? " asked Mrs. Jerrold . " Perfectly . He told me that our recent engagement was all secured , and begged me to keep up the credit of the old house ; spoke of our marriage , dear Helen , and gave me some advice , which I could not understand , about faith and baptism , and truth , and all that kind of thing , peculiar to old men who are dying , " said the young man , with a light smile . " Then he has not made another will ? " asked Mrs. Jerrold . " No , I fancy not ; merely a codicil , if any thing . But be careful of yourself , Helen ; do n't sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May Brooke is an indefatigable nurse , " said the worldly man . " Farewell , sweet Helen , " whispered Mrs. Jerrold , embracing her . " We shall soon have you to ourselves . But be on the qui vive ; there may be something , you know , under all this . " " Another will ! " thought Helen , after they went away ; " if another exists , different from the first --  -- well -- I see no reason why a whim should wreck my happiness . " Then , tempted and scheming , she sat motionless for hours . Alas ! for the soul which of its own free will , unmoors itself from the Rock of Ages , to drift away on dark and uncertain seas ; who , lured away by the sun-gilt mirage , throws down the cross , scorns the thorny crown , and despises Calvary , to perish at last miserably in the arid desert ! Although Helen had never been a pious Catholic , she had always declared herself one , and resisted every open attack on her faith ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love had entered her soul , and poisoned it , and for a season they would triumph . " Uncle Stillinghast wants you , dear Helen , " said May , tapping her on the shoulder . " Me ! " she exclaimed , starting up like a guilty thing . " Yes , dear . He will receive the Holy Viaticum soon , and he wishes to speak with you before , " said May , winding her arm around Helen 's waist , and wishing , in the charity that filled her soul , that she could as easily lead her back , weeping and penitent , to the foot of the cross . " Come hither , child , " said the old man , turning his feeble eyes towards her . " I fear -- I **26;1173;TOOLONG you -- to forsake your faith . God -- forgive me -- for my ignorance and sin . But hear me . I am dying -- hear me testify to the saving and divine truths of that faith -- and repent you -- repent ere -- it is -- too late for ever . It is an awful thing -- girl -- to live away -- from -- the -- true fold of Jesus Christ ;  - -  but how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , feebly , while he placed Helen 's hand in that of the clergyman , " bring -- watch her -- guide her , until she is saved . " " My poor child ! you will not forsake your religion ; you dare not peril your salvation by severing , with sacrilegious hand , the ties which unite you to JESUS CHRIST , as a member of His glorious body ? " asked the priest , in a tone of blended pity and authority . " Oh , no , no ! " sobbed Helen , quite overcome by the scene . " I am very young , and love the world . I have never intended to forsake my religion entirely . I intend , at some early day , to go to confession . I have only procrastinated . " " Of course , my dear child , you will return to your duty , " said Father Fabian ; " you can not do otherwise , unless you wish to seal deliberately your eternal perdition . " " You will marry -- marry Jerrold , " gasped Mr. Stillinghast ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are -- you willing -- to assume the responsibility ? " " Oh , sir , this is horrible ! " exclaimed Helen , falling on her knees beside the bed . " But true , " added Father Fabian , at a sign from Mr. Stillinghast , who leaned back exhausted . " It is a perilous thing , under the most favorable circumstances , for a Catholic to wed with a Protestant . If the Catholic has not the patience of a saint , and the constancy of a martyr , scandal must come . Concessions must be made -- vital principles too often yielded , and at last the unbeliever triumphs -- not over the mere human will , and the weak nature of his victim , but over religion -- and exultingly thinks how frail are the defences of this faith , which is called divine . Then , confirmed in his errors by your betrayal , his whole life is a scoff at Eternal Truth ; while you , bringing forth children , who , instead of becoming heirs of Christ , become aliens from His fold , while your sin -- your treachery -- your apostasy will , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dashes itself , with its black abominations , at the feet of the Eternal Judge . But , my dear child , through the mercy of God , and your own example , you may win this wandering soul to embrace the truth : at any rate , you may , by your pious constancy , plant the seeds of a better life in his soul , which may bear the fruits of salvation . " " It was -- my act . I would undo it -- but -- it is too late -- too late . Helen -- forgive me . " " Dear uncle , do not say so.  - -  I have nothing to forgive , " she sobbed . " Time will come , I fear -- when -- you will not think so . Go , now -- I -- have provided -- for you -- see -- that you provide -- for the eternal future , " he said , with difficulty . Helen kissed the hand already shadowed by the approach of death , and left the room , weeping . " It is horrible ! " she exclaimed , almost shrieking , as she threw herself on the bed , after she reached her apartment . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved this harsh , bitter old man , nor do I intend to risk my happiness by promising impossibilities . I 'll go to confession , and all that , when I am ready , and not before . Walter detests Catholics ; and if he thought I was still one , he 'd never wed me . But it can not last long -- I shall soon be free ; and , once Jerrold 's wife , I can practise my religion if I choose . At any rate , I shall die a Catholic ! " It was midnight . All was silent in the death-chamber . The night-taper was placed behind a screen ; and the fire-light flickered with a tremulous motion on the richly-carved , antique furniture , black and polished by age , and creeping upwards , threw long , wavering shadows on the wall . Amidst this solemn twilight , a table spread with white , which supported a crucifix , wax lights , and flowers , stood near the sick man 's bed . A guest was expected ere long -- a divine and honored guest was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to strengthen and console that penitent spirit on is passage to eternity , when , like Elias , after his miraculous repast , strengthened and courageous , it would walk with humble , but sure steps towards its eternal Horeb ! May knelt by her uncle 's side , with his hand clasped in hers , praying , and whispering sweet words of cheer . A footstep sounded on the pavement ; it ascended the steps , and Father Fabian , accompanied by Helen and Doctor Burrell , who had been waiting in the parlor below , came in , bearing with him the Lord of Life . May lit the candles on the temporary altar , and retired with the rest for a few moments , while Father Fabian held a brief conversation with the penitent old man , touching the affairs of his conscience ; then he summoned them in ; and while they knelt , he arranged himself in surplice and stole , and in a solemn , impressive manner , began the sacramental rite . " ' Behold him -- behold the Lamb of God , who taketh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , holding up the sacred host . " ' He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , ' says the Redeemer , ' hath ever-lasting life , and I will raise him up on the last day . ' The day of life was almost spent , when you came to him ; night was coming on , but He , in the plenitude of His divine compassion , turned you not away , but gives you a princely reward -- even Himself . Like the Prodigal , destitute and naked , you return , and receiving you , He spreads a mystic feast , in which He gives you heavenly food ; and while the shadow of death falls around you , lo ! He comes to go with you towards those dismal portals , and admit you to a region of probation and everlasting hope . Humbly confiding , and strong in faith , receive Him , not as a representation or mere memorial of the Son of God , but Jesus Christ himself . ' Corpus Domini nostri Jesu ; ' " and , as Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eternal Life to the dying man . What could have changed that dark , repulsive face so entirely , that it looked an image of humility ? Was it death ? Was it memory ? Or was it the effect of new and divine influences ? It was surely nothing mortal . He lifted his eyes to Father Fabian 's face -- then turned them in search of May . She was by his side in a moment . " Unworthy -- unworthy , " he whispered ; then they saw his lips moving in silent and earnest prayer . Dr. Burrell had regarded the whole scene with interest and awe . The whole scene preached to his inmost soul . Doctrinal arguments and learned polemics , he could have tilted with , word for word ; but here were facts , and realities and influences , which disarmed and defied all that was skeptical in his nature . The dying man -- the priest of God -- that young and fragile girl , illustrated by their acts a faith which , though mysterious to him , could be nothing less than divine ; but Father Fabian , ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , through his mind , approached , and asked him in a low voice , " how long he supposed Mr. Stillinghast might linger ? " " He may live until noon to-morrow , " said the doctor . " He may , " said Father Fabian , " but I fear not , however , God 's holy will be done ! " During the night Mr. Stillinghast 's mind wandered . May , overcome by fatigue , had leaned her head on the bed-side , and fallen into a profound sleep . Helen , timid , and startling at every sound , sat near him , fearing to move , lest it should rouse him.  - -  Her guilty , selfish thoughts , terrified and haunted her like phantoms . " There are -- some papers , " murmured the old man , without turning his head , and thinking he spoke to May , " papers which I wish burnt . " " Shall I get them , sir ? " whispered Helen , while every bad , avaricious , and selfish instinct in her nature , started to sudden life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the second shelf -- of the closet -- where the wills are . They are records -- of sorrows -- and bitterness ; but be careful , child -- those two wills -- the last one , which concerns you -- is in -- a white -- envelope ; the old one -- in a brown wrapper . On the -- second shelf ; mind -- the wills . " " Yes , sir ! " whispered Helen , while her heart throbbed almost to bursting , and a wild gleam of triumph shot across her visage , giving it the fearful beauty of a demon . She would throw the new will amongst the condemned papers -- it would be consumed with them ; he would be silent and cold when it was missed , and could tell nothing ; but then , might not she be suspected ? No ! she would not burn it -- she would secrete it , and only destroy it in case she was disinherited . These thoughts rushed through her mind with a strange velocity , while she went towards the closet ; and , just as she laid her hand on a package of papers , Mr. Stillinghast , suddenly turning , discovered his mistake . " Come away -- come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how dare you go there ? Come away . " It was the work of an instant to snatch up the new will , thrust it into her bosom , and return , pale , trembling , and almost fainting , to his side . " I thought you were May ; call her here , Helen , then go away , " he said , gently . " Uncle Stillinghast wants you , May , " said Helen , stooping over , and touching her . " What can I do for you , uncle ? " she said , instantly roused . " I wish -- you to burn -- some **27;1201;TOOLONG . On the second shelf -- there -- in the small closet -- where the wills are . Is she gone ? " " Helen ? yes , sir ; shall I bring all the papers -- or are those you wish me to burn , numbered ? " asked May , taking the candle with her . " Yes , yes ; numbered -- 1 , 2 , 3 ,  -- 1796 -- 1799 -- 1800 . " " Here they are , sir . " " Lay them there -- under the **29;1230;TOOLONG blot out -- so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride -- of my ignorance -- of my avarice -- through , the bitter passion of Jesus Christ -- forgive me -- as I forgive -- all , " he murmured , as he watched the rapid destruction of these records of his life . " Take a spoonful of this , " said May , holding some brandy to his lips . He drank it , and cast a long , earnest , loving look on her , drew her face towards his , and kissed her forehead . " The blessing of Almighty God abide with you , little one ; hand me that , now , " he said , looking towards the crucifix , " lay it here -- where my eyes can rest on it -- so . " He never spoke again ; but , with the image of the CRUCIFIED in view , his failing eyes gradually and softly closed . May thought he slept . So he did , but he slept the sleep of death . Helen had fled up to her room , locked the door , and , with a white , pallid face , and trembling fingers , took the will from her bosom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; but May shall never have it , " she said , through her set teeth , as her eye ran rapidly over it . " They will think she burned it with those papers . I am saved -- I shall marry Jerrold ! " A mouse gnawing in her wainscot near her , caused her to start up and look around ; and there , looking down from the cross , where the sins of the world had hung Him , was the image of His divine and woeful face . In the flickering light , the drops of blood appeared to flow from those cruel wounds , and the thorn-crowned head seemed to droop towards her . With a shuddering cry , she fell heavily to the floor . But the paroxysm passed away -- she remembered her crime , and , fearful of detection -- for already had conscience begun to scourge her -- she flew to her trunk , and touching a spring in the side , a secret compartment slid back , revealing a narrow interstice between the body of the trunk and the exterior . In this she dropped the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to evil ? Shall any dare say it was religion ? She was a Catholic by birthright -- but an alien from the practices of her holy faith by choice , and through human pride and worldliness -- did its spirit lead her into crime ? Judge of its effects by May 's humble and earnest life . She was true and practical in her character , and acted out the precepts of her faith . Judge it , by the wonderful change it effected in the harsh and bitter nature of that hoary man , whom it excited to acts of perfect Christian virtue , and who , full of humble hope , had just breathed his last . Who would measure the patriotism and purity of Washington , by the treason of Arnold ? Dare not then , be guilty of the manifest injustice of judging the Church by the conduct of those , who , although bearing her sign on their foreheads , become traitors to her holy precepts , and scandalize her in their lives . CHAPTER XV . THE DISCOVERY . The old man was far down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , by the grace of God , he fled into the fold of Faith for safety ; and now , when all was over , the Church , like a loving mother , more tender of the repentant prodigal , who had fallen at her feet , and died , than of those who had never sullied , or torn their robes , and squandered their substance in the world 's wild wilderness , poured out the riches of its solemnities around the altar , where the Divine Sacrifice was offered , with touching prayers , for his eternal repose . Father Fabian officiated , and spoke eloquently of the nothingness of the world , the uncertainty of life , and the emptiness of riches . The cathedral was crowded by persons whom the news of Mr. Stillinghast 's conversion had brought together , and who , regarding it as an extraordinary event , were desirous of witnessing the funeral ceremonies , and at the same time testify their respect for his memory . The most influential and wealthy of the class to which he belonged were present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a commercial point of view , their general opinion was that their old companion in trade had made a good bargain . " He was stern and harsh , " they said , " but honest and upright ; and too shrewd altogether to make a bad speculation in the end , and doubtless he had sought only his best interests in the step he had taken . " But in all that crowd there was only one heart which felt an emotion of grief , or had a single tear to drop on his coffin-lid . After a long life of toil , and solitude , and unlovingness , only one . May felt this while she wept , and wished she had been more patient and persevering in her love while he lived ; but such regrets were useless now , except to kindle charity . She could do nothing which would be available to make up the deficiencies of the past , but incessantly beseech Jesus Christ , through which his bitter passion and death , and the Immaculate Mother , by the union she bore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROSS , to grant him a speedy release from suffering probation , to eternal refreshment , and light , and peace . It was late when the funeral cortege returned to the city , and Mr. Fielding , perceiving that May was much overcome , and looked ill , declined going in , or attending to business that evening . " I will be here at ten o'clock to-morrow morning . I know that my deceased client 's affairs are all in such order , that there will be no delay in carrying out his wishes . " " Just as you think best , Mr. Fielding , " replied May , wearily . " What say you , Miss Stillinghast ? " he said , addressing Helen . " To-morrow will be quite time enough , sir , " replied Helen , in a low tone . Time enough , indeed ! Well might she feel a sense of relief at its being deferred , when she knew that from the moment it was discovered that the will was missing , the temptations which had led her so deeply into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . As she went up with a heavy step to her room , an angel whisper suggested that there was time enough yet to undo the wrong she had committed . It startled and agitated her . " Can I bear these chains ? " was the question . Weak , but never hardened in wickedness , she trembled , and was afraid of the penalties of her offence ; and when she looked up , and saw by the flickering candlelight the image of the CRUCIFIED , and the sorrowful face of his Virgin Mother , both bending on her looks of tenderness and woe , which said , as plain as looks could say , " Child of my passion ! soul , ransomed by my death ! why wound me so deeply ? " With a low cry , she threw herself on her pillow . " I shall never know peace again , " her heart whispered ; " I already feel the anguish of guilt ; I begin to taste on earth the pangs of ever-lasting woe . This sin , with the human shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Sacraments of the Church . Where shall I turn for peace ? I can never bear this burden ; it will madden me . I feel even now so guilty that I dare not lift my eyes to Walter 's , for whose sake I do it . I feel an awe and dread steal over me when May comes near me as if she had Ithuriel 's spear with which to touch me . I will do it , " she said , with sudden resolution , and got up , and opened her trunk with the almost determined purpose of restoring the will to the place from which she had taken it . But oh , human frailty ! the light falling on an open case of rare jewels , and some costly articles of her bridal trousseau , met her eye ; then followed visions of splendor -- of such power as wealth gives -- of equipages and luxury , which swept away , like ocean-tides , the thoughts which her angel-guardian had written on her conscience . Hesitating no longer , a smile of triumph lit her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapery of pale illusions around it , she offered herself to a martyrdom of sin , to secure her worldly advancement . " I suppose , " said Mr. Fielding , the next morning to May , " that I shall find the will in that little closet , where your uncle kept his most important papers ? " " I presume so , sir . I placed it there at his request , in the place he designated , after you went away , the day it was written , " replied May . " That closet could tell strange things , " said the lawyer , " if it could speak ; but I believe I have come a half hour before the time appointed , as the others are not here . " " They are coming now . I see Mr. Jerrold and Father Fabian walking this way , and I think that is Dr. Burrell 's carriage down the street , " said May , looking out . " All right . May , suppose you had Aladdin 's lamp ? " said the lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing , sir , " said May , quietly . " Why , young lady ? " " I should be afraid of the monster it might evoke . Poor Aladdin had a miserable time of it from the beginning , in my opinion , " said May . " Riches have their cares , " said Mr. Fielding . " Cares without much peace , " replied May . Just then Mr. Jerrold , Dr. Burrell , and Father Fabian came in ; and after exchanging the compliments of the day with the ladies and Mr. Fielding , prepared to execute the business which had brought them together . Mr. Fielding , accompanied by Mr. Jerrold , went up to get the will . He had long held the most intimate business relations with Mr. Stillinghast , and was the only man living who had ever been in his confidence . He knew the contents of every parcel and package of writing in the old desk and bureau , and could just tell where he was at fault now . There was only one will to be found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be null and void . The group below who were conversing on some interesting topic , were soon amazed to hear Mr. Fielding 's voice in loud and excited tones at the head of the staircase . Clearing two or three steps at a time , he bounded into the room , followed by Mr. Jerrold , who was pale and silent . He was usually a grave and quiet person , and so governed by system , that the very hairs on his head might have been said to be arranged numerically . " Here 's a pretty thing come to pass ! " he exclaimed , throwing a bundle of papers on the table ; " a most beautiful kettle of fish . The last will and testament of the deceased is missing . Yes , sirs ! ca n't be found . May , who was in your uncle 's room the last night he lived ? I say then , because the closet in which the will was placed was locked then , and the key has been in my pocket ever since . Who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said May , astonished at the uproar . " Who else ? " " Helen was there for a little while . " " Who else ? " " The doctor came at eleven o'clock . " " The doctor did n't steal the will . Are you sure no one else came in afterwards ? " " Father Fabian administered the Holy Viaticum to my uncle . After that , no one except Helen and myself were there . " " Were you awake all the time ? ' " I think not , sir . I believe I slept about ten minutes . " " Why did n't you sleep ten years , May ? " exclaimed the irritated lawyer . " And you , Miss Stillinghast , please to state what occurred while your cousin slept . I suppose you kept awake , as you have heavy interests at stake ? " " Mr. Fielding , this lady is my affianced wife ; oblige me by assuming a more gentle tone , " said Walter Jerrold , taking his stand beside Helen . " If she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and let me tell you , not only sifted here , but in open court , whither I shall carry it , unless the will is forthcoming . What occurred , Miss Stillinghast , during the ten minutes that little fool slept ? " " Only this , sir , " said Helen , who felt supported by Mr. Jerrold 's protection ; " my uncle roused himself a little , and told me to take some packages of paper out of the closet , and put them under the grate . He said ' they were records of the past which he wished to perish with him . ' " " So -- so ! " said the lawyer , significantly . " But , " continued Helen , speaking in a clearer , and more assured tone , " I had just laid my hand on the knob to open the door , when he discovered that it was not May to whom he had been speaking , and in harsh tones he ordered me back , and commanded me to awaken May , and leave the room , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadfully that I could not remain . " " And you , May ? " " I got out the papers , sir , as my uncle directed , and burnt them , as he desired . Helen is right , " replied May . " And what did you burn ? " " Papers . Some in packages , and some in large envelopes , like that you hold in your hand , " replied May , calmly . " Why the deuce , then , did n't you put your head under the grate , and burn that too ? You have burnt the will , that 's clear : the will which would have made you the richest woman in Maryland . With those ' records of the past , ' which my old friend Stillinghast ought to have eaten up years ago , you have burnt up legacies to orphans , benefactions to widows , and many noble charities with it -- if it was burnt , " added Mr. Fielding . " Mr. Fielding , " said May , lifting her hands with an earnest gesture , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heedless act , injured the interests of any living being , I should be truly miserable . I can not comprehend the charges , or the cause of your unusual and ungentle excitement . " " You miserably innocent child ! You poor , unworldly infant ! I will endeavor to beat it into your comprehension , if you will listen . Your deceased uncle made two wills ; one a few months ago , leaving the bulk of his fortune to his niece , Miss Helen Stillinghast , and to his other niece , May Brooke , the splendid life annuity of one hundred and fifty dollars . But on Thursday last having felt , by the judgment and grace of God , that so unequal a division was unjust , and being convinced that the said May Brooke would squander his gains precisely as he wished at that moment he had been doing all his life , viz. , amongst the poor , destitute , and afflicted , he made another will , in which he devised the handsome sum of fifty thousand dollars , and some real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his well-beloved niece and heiress , two hundred thousand dollars , this house , lot , and furniture , and other properties . But this will is missing -- burnt up , it is supposed ; and the first one is good in law , and I will read it , although I protest against its being executed until a thorough investigation is made , and I am well assured that there has been no foul play in the case , " said the lawyer , impressively . " Mr. Fielding , " said Walter Jerrold , speaking out from the most honorable motives , " I feel as you do ; and before reading the will , let us make a more patient and thorough search . We may have over-looked it . Neither Helen , nor myself , could ever feel satisfied , or happy , in the possession of property which , in the sight of Heaven , belongs to another . " " Sir , your sentiments do you honor . I accept of your suggestions , " said Mr. Fielding , fixing a penetrating gaze on Walter Jerrold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , and help us to search high and low through the closet and bureau . " Father Fabian , who had come at the request of Mr. Fielding , had been a silent , but not unconcerned witness of this strange and unexpected scene , and looked for its issue with the deepest interest . Dr. Burrell exploded every now and then in opinions , which contained more feeling than legal reasoning , and consequently were of no importance . Helen 's presence restrained all conversation on the subject while the others were absent from the room , and Father Fabian , having no time to drift idly on a single moment of his life , took a seat in one of the deep embrasures of the windows , and read portions of his " office " from the well-worn Breviary , which he drew from his pocket . But the search for the lost will was in vain . Assisted zealously by Walter Jerrold and May , Mr. Fielding left no corner of the room unexplored . The bed and mattress -- the tester and curtains , were turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspected . The shelves of the little closet were removed , and the panel at the back and sides pried off , but in vain ; and Mr. Fielding sat down quite exhausted , and folding his hands , exclaimed , or rather growled , " I congratulate you , May . It has all turned out precisely as your humility hoped it would , no doubt . " " Sir , " said May , gently , " I am no worse off now than I was yesterday . I should have felt much encumbered by so large a fortune . I 'm afraid it would have made me dizzy and foolish ; indeed , sir , I feel quite unequal to the responsibility of such a stewardship . I feel deeply grateful to my poor uncle , and also to you , for your kind wishes in my regard , but , believe me , I am quite content for matters to stand just as they are , so far as I am concerned . " Then breaking down , May broke out into a regular womanly fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more gently , " when you took those papers out of that infer -- that closet there , did you see those two wills lying together ? " " I saw nothing , sir , except the papers I went to get . " " And which you burned ? " " Which I burned up to the last scrap . " " Very well . You burned up the will too . You have been purified by fire with a vengeance . Do you still believe in guardian angels ? " " Just as firmly as ever , sir , " she replied , fixing her clear eyes on him . " Where was yours , pray , while you was doing just what the devil would have you ? " " Guarding me from evils to come , I trust . Oh , sir , it is very perilous to one 's soul to be rich ! " she exclaimed , with one of her sunlit expressions . " Very well , again ! ' Gad , how Plato would have loved you ! But see here , you most uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you are . My heart is desolate . All that I loved have passed away ! Will you -- will you come and keep house for me , like you did for old Stillinghast ? Come -- come , tell me at once ; I am old and tottering , " said the lawyer , trying to twinkle away a tear from his large gray eyes . " Oh , dear me ! dear , kind Mr. Fielding ! " cried May , weeping on Mr. Fielding 's shoulder ; " I hope Heavenly Father will bless you for your kind intentions to a friendless orphan ; but , indeed , sir , I can not say -- I do n't think it would suit me to be dependent . " " Who wants you to be dependent ? " roared out Mr. Fielding ; " I 'll hire you , if that will suit you better , to keep house , mend my stockings , and make tea for me ; that will board you , and your splendid annuity will clothe you . " " I will tell you in a few days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I am so tossed and worried now I can think of nothing clearly , " sobbed May . " Let us go down , sir , and go on with the business which brought us here , " said Mr. Fielding , while he lifted May 's head gently up from his shoulder . " Whatever you decide on , May Brooke , remember that I am your protector , defender , and friend . " And so May was blamed for the loss of the will . Grieving more for the solid benefits which were lost to the poor and destitute , for the alms which would have sent up incense to heaven in behalf of the soul of the giver ,  - -  May thought not of herself , only so far as to vow her energies , her labors , her life , to the good of those who , through her heedlessness , had been injured . She was not clear that she did not burn the will ; she thought she had not done so , but she would not , for the world , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be supposed , however , that so shrewd a man as Mr. Fielding , and a man so experienced in all the devious and sinuous windings of the human heart as Father Fabian , were without their suspicions , but the one through policy , and the other through charity , forebore to express in words what they were not prepared to prove by legal facts . May kept her plans to herself , and in her matter-of-fact way set the house in order , and arranged , day after day , every article in its particular place ; and was scrupulously exact that not a scrap of old lumber , cracked china , broken spoons , or half-worn linen , should be missing on the day of the sale . Helen , quite unconcerned about such homely matters , dashed about in Mrs. Jerrold 's carriage from morning until night , making splendid purchases , and indulged in all those expensive tastes which her natural love for the beautiful , and her undisciplined will , made so necessary to her happiness . Happiness ! Could she in whose soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of restless fever , and unceasing torture , be happy ? Alas ! no ; she felt that hence forth she was to know not rest on earth -- beyond , she dared not look . One evening -- the eve of her bridal , she and May were together , once more , in the antique parlor . Helen , flushed , and splendidly beautiful ;  - -  May , calm , and pleasant , her cheeks and brow a little pale , but very lovely from the inner light reflected on them . " May , are you still determined not to witness my marriage ? " asked Helen , abruptly . " Yes , Helen . The same barrier to my being present exists , I presume ? " " If my being married by a Protestant minister , is the apology for your absence , it does , " replied Helen , with a decided air . " Do not say apology , Helen ; I do not pretend to offer one . It is your privilege to make your marriage , as far as you are concerned , sacramental ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By acting otherwise , you disobey the Church , and place yourself in a position of great danger ; and I do not choose to be implicated , by being present at the ceremonial . " " You are a most obstinate person ;  - -  but just as you please . What are your plans , if I may ask ? " said Helen , feeling ill at ease . " Very plain and honest ones , Helen , " said May , measuring out the tea . " I should not suspect you , May , of any other , " said Helen , with a sarcastic manner ; " but let us hear them , if you are not ashamed of them ! " " I am ashamed of nothing , Helen , but the guilt of sin . As to my plans , I do not know that you feel any genuine interest in them ; and , as we shall not meet often , I suppose , it is scarcely necessary to unfold them . " " I have a motive in asking you , May -- a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Helen . " I thank you , dear Helen , but I really do not require the least assistance . The sum my uncle left me , added to what I shall earn , will support me nicely , " she replied . " Earn ! how ? Shall you take in sewing ? " screamed Helen . " No . I have rented a nice room from my old friend Mrs. Tabb , who keeps the trimming store , and she has engaged to sell all the fancy knitting I can do . I am very well provided for , you perceive . " " I perceive nothing of the kind . It is positively ridiculous and disgraceful . What will the world say ? " exclaimed Helen . " The world , dear Helen ! What business has the world with me ? I owe it nothing but its just tribute of good citizenship . Oh , Helen ! the world can soothe no pang when sorrow comes ; it can bring us no peace when death touches our hearts with his inexorable hand . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and me . " " Gracious ! what a fanatic ! " said Helen , keeping down the wrestling and struggling of her heart ; and , with a careless air , throwing back the long , bright curls , from her faultless face . " But listen to reason , May . You have been unfairly dealt with . I can not reconcile the thing to either my pride or conscience . Walter feels as I do ; and I can tell you we are extremely anxious to have you become an inmate of our family -- to be in it , like myself , and feel free to act , and think , as you please . I can assure you , Walter has a prodigiously high opinion of you . " " Helen , " said May , fixing those clear luminous eyes on the shifting countenance of her cousin , " your offer is , no doubt , kindly meant -- but I can not accept it . I would not , Helen , if you offered me half your fortune , live in a house so unblessed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why such predictions ? " asked Helen , haughtily . " Can one who defies the spirit of God by disobedience -- and -- yes , I must say it -- apostasy , expect blessings ? And could I , who daily implore Heavenly Father to save me from temptation , thrust myself under its influence ? Oh , no ! no , Helen . Enjoy life after your fashion -- whirl through its giddy circles , if such is your choice -- but leave me in obscurity , to follow out the path which leads to something beyond the grave . But , dear Helen , let us part in peace -- my prayers shall follow you ; and I do beseech you , by the memory of the bitter passion and death of Jesus Christ , and the Dolors of His Immaculate Mother , to reflect , sometimes , on what should be the aims of an immortal soul ! " " You are a strange creature , May , " said Helen , with a quivering lip , and a momentary impulse to throw herself at May 's feet , and confess her guilt , which flitted away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you are sick , or sorrowful , or repentant , send for me . " " But you will come and see how very happy I am.  - -  Just once ? " " I can not promise , Helen . Events will determine me , " replied May , in a gentle tone . " I have a favor to ask , May , which you can not refuse ! " said Helen , with a degree of timidity unusual to her ; " will you grant it ? " " I hope so , Helen . What is it ? " " There is a picture in our room -- a valuable old painting of the Mater Dolorosa . I always fancied there was a look of my mother , particularly about the eyes , in the countenance . I should like to have it copied by some first-rate artist to hang up in my chamber . " " Certainly , dear Helen . I would offer you the picture as a keep-sake , only it was highly prized by my father ; and there are so many associations connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever you wish it , let me know , and I will go with it myself to the artist . " The next day they parted . Helen , arrayed in costly silks , laces , and jewelry , went forth a bride , and pronounced irrevocable vows , which made her the wife of a man , who , highly honorable in a worldly sense , was the professed enemy of the creed she professed . CHAPTER XVI . THE DEATH DREAM . While the splendid festivities which succeeded Helen 's marriage afforded a topic of conversation for the bon ton of three cities , May was quietly preparing to leave the old house , beneath whose roof she had learned so many lessons of self-denial , patience , and constancy ; while she found time , each day , to pay her accustomed visit to old Mabel , who was approaching nearer and nearer her eternal rest . In serving her , May felt richly rewarded by the edification she derived from her simple piety , and the perfect resignation and joyful submission she evinced to the Divine Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her expressions , and the beautiful humility of her language , when she spoke of the mercy of Almighty God , and lifted up her heart in joyful aspirations and effusions of love , to JESUS and MARY . The sacred and crucified , Humanity of ONE , and the suffering and anguish of the Humanity of the OTHER , seemed to condescend so entirely to her low estate , that the divinity of JESUS , and the measureless love of MARY , His Mother , were folded like a garment around her , and strengthened , and consoled , and brightened her path , as she approached the shadow through which she was to pass . And while May 's inmost heart united its pure emotions in harmony with the mysteries of faith and grace , the words of an old English poet rippled through her mind in sweet accord with them . " If bliss had lay in art or strength , None but the wise or strong had gained it ; Where now by faith , all arms are of a length , One size doth all conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great clerk , and reach the highest stature ; Thus dost Thou make proud knowledge bend and crouch , While grace fills up uneven nature . " 1 When May had proposed to Mrs. Tabb to live , or , rather , lodge with her , nothing of its kind could exceed the enthusiastic reception she met . She poured out a torrent of exclamations and superlatives , which set all the rules of grammar at defiance . Then she broke out in the vociferous indignation at " the old miser 's meanness , " and last , and more outrageous than all , were her reflections on " upstartish misses , who drop from the clouds when no one expects them , and get all and every thing that them ought to had , who had been waiting , and bearing with people 's meanness and ill-humor from their cradels up . " And if , at that moment , she had not tilted her snuff-box , which was filled with Scotch snuff , over , under May 's nose , whereupon both were seized with a paroxysm of sneezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have been silenced by a few charitable explanations . When May returned home , she found Mr. Jerrold waiting in the parlor . He offered his hand ; and there was such an air of sincerity in his manner , that it dispelled all May 's reserve . " I have brought Helen 's love , " he said , while he uncovered a magnificent bouquet , " and these roses and violets . They are the first of the season . " " These are very , very beautiful and fragrant , and I thank you most heartily for them . How is Helen ? " " She is looking well , but she falls occasionally into fits of despondency , which is either the result of much fatigue and excitement , or some cause which she does not wish to explain . I wish you would come and live with us . Helen needs a sister , " said the young man . " Dear Mr. Jerrold , " said old-fashioned May , " I have tried to find my way to Helen 's heart , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too differently . Helen will have none of my friendship on those terms on which I alone can give it . But you do not understand it all.  - -  You are a Protestant , and wish to see Helen one ; therefore , I should be a discord in your house , because , if there , my duty would not allow me to hold my peace . " " Helen is too young and beautiful to mope about religion , " he said , carelessly . " When she gets older , and is more tied down by domestic cares , it will be necessary and respectable for her to be religious ; and then , egad , if she wishes it , I 'd as lief she 'd be a Catholic as any thing else . " " Helen will be ill-prepared , I fear , for a life of pious example , if she devotes all of her energies now to the world . Grace , you know , sir , is not a human thing which can be bought with money , or worldly eloquence , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , on my honor , May , than yourself ; but , really , she must enjoy life a little longer ; then I will turn her over to you and her father confessor ;  - -  but I came for a purpose , to-day . " " A friendly one , I am sure ! " said May . " Yes . I saw Mr. Fielding this morning , and consulted him about the expediency of your remaining here , as you wont live with us . We wish the place kept up ; it is a curioso in its way -- an antique with all its appurtenances ; and I do not know any one more in keeping with it , than cousin May . " May laughed . " You think that , as we harmonize so exactly , we should be a mutual protection to each other ? " " Precisely . Will you remain ? " " No . It would be pleasant on some accounts , but would not be at all suitable on others . A residence here would very materially interrupt the objects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone be happy . " " Dodona 's Cave ! How oracular ! " said Mr. Jerrold , laughing outright . " Explain , dear Sopho , your argument ! " " Will you understand ? But how can you , a Protestant , understand the motive power of a Catholic heart ? " said May . " Proceed . I will give you oracle for oracle . I am a Protestant in principle , but not in fact , " was the light reply . " I have always felt that while I ate no idle bread I was of some use on earth . I have always been accustomed to an active life . Labor gives one an opportunity of learning many virtues ;  - -  patience amongst them , and not the least , humility . I should have nothing to do , here . The necessity for exertion would be gone ; and , really , I am too much afraid of myself , to trust to exigencies . No , no ! I must have an aim which will require the exercise of my most active energies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " broke in Mr. Jerrold . " Pride is at the bottom of the whole argument . May ! this moment you are as proud as the devil ! " " Oh , sir ! pray do not think that . I really feel extremely grateful for your kind intentions , " said May , looking distressed . " I have other reasons , which I can not very well explain , for choosing the way of life that I have . Only please to understand this , that I should be very miserable , if I were placed , now , in a situation which would leave me without responsibility . " " You are a paradox . You ought to be ten feet high , May , with such a will as yours . You wo n't live with us , because we are so wicked that you 'd have to preach to us about our sins ; and you wo n't live here , because you 're afraid you 'll get as bad as we are . Well , well ! be happy your own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Jerrold , laughing , as he got up to leave . " I feel your kindness deeply , Mr. Jerrold . I hope you are not hurt or offended ? " " Not in the least . I think you are bearing your wrongs like a saint ; and I wish I was only half as good , " replied Mr. Jerrold , shaking hands with her . " Tell Helen that I am thankful for the flowers , and will offer them this evening , with a prayer for her conversion , to OUR MOTHER , " said May . " I thought her mother was dead and buried ! " thought Mr. Jerrold , as he walked down the street . " What a curious little soul she is ! " After dinner , May went to inform Father Fabian that she had declined Mr. Fielding 's offer , and would remove to Mrs. Tabb 's in the course of a day or two . But she saw him in the garden walk in the rear of the house , walking to and fro , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she offered the rich bouquet Helen had sent her , on the shrine of Our Lady , the refuge ; after which , she said , with great devotion , a decade of the rosary , for her conversion . Father Fabian was standing in the door when she returned , and watched her , as she approached , with a grave , but quizzical , expression of countenance . " I am glad to see you , my child , in your long dresses yet , " he said , holding out his hand , kindly . " Sir , " said May , looking perplexed . " I did not feel sure but that you had adopted the new school so much in favor with your sex , judging from all that I have heard , " he replied , laughing . " What new school ? What have you heard , Father ? " she asked , anxiously . " The strong-minded women's-school ! " " I see that you have some jest at my expense , and I must be patient until it is explained , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; be patient . " " Will you not tell me , Father , what I have done ? " " May , do you believe that you burned the will the night your uncle lay dying ? " asked Father Fabian , abruptly . " I do not think I did . I may , however , have done so . " " Mr. Fielding intends to endeavor to set aside the will which was found . He had good legal reasons to expect that he can secure you an equal share of your uncle 's estate with your cousin . " " I hope he will do no such thing , sir . I am quite satisfied . " " But he and the witnesses to the other will are not , because there are very important public and religious interests involved in its loss . " " If that is the case , I can only object so far as I am individually concerned , " said May ; " but I hope most earnestly that Mr. Fielding will let the matter rest a short time longer -- a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not burn the will , and I feel a presentiment that it will come to light , " said May , earnestly . " And you will not give your consent , as one of the heirs , to go to law ? " " Not yet -- not yet , Father . Let us wait a little . If it is mislaid , it may be found ; if any one has wronged me by secreting it , they may repent . " " Was there ever such a wild goose on earth ? " said Father Fabian , laughing . " You know as much about the world now , May , as you did eighteen years ago , when you were just two months old . " " But , Father , you have always taught me to have faith in God , and told me in all difficulties to have recourse to him and the Blessed Virgin . If it is for his glory , and the good of his creatures , the lost will will be found , " she said , earnestly . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , " said Father Fabian , lifting his bounet-carre from his brow . " But , having turned a theological point against me , can you explain your most obstinate refusal to accept of Mr. Fielding 's and Mr. Jerrold 's kind offers of a home , where ease , luxury , and elegance would attend you ? You seem determined to take a stand against your interests in every way . What rational objection can you oppose to their offers ? " " Dear Father , are you displeased with your poor child ? " asked May , with humility . " To be frank , my dear child , I consider your conduct a little unusual , " said Father Fabian , looking down to conceal the smile that brightened his eyes . " How could you act so ? " " Simply and frankly because I wished to be free . " " Woman 's rights ! As I suspected , woman 's rights ! " exclaimed Father Fabian , lifting his hands with horror . " Soul 's rights , Father ! Soul 's rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could not live with Helen in peace without spiritual bondage . Her way of life would leave me no neutral ground to stand on . She has forsaken her religion ; every act of hers is therefore open rebellion against God , and I must have raised my voice in one incessant clamor had I lived with her . Had I gone to dear , kind Mr. Fielding , he might have made demands on time which I have devoted to religion , which my gratitude might have disposed me to yield to . But I am grateful to them all for their kind intentions , and I am sure , if their friendship is real , they will be happier to know that I am happy in my own way . " " Is this all , May ? " asked Father Fabian , who suspected her of entertaining other reasons still . " I had hoped to keep it secretly , but I have another reason . You know that I am blamed for the loss of that will , which made noble bequests to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretend to say that I am not , therefore , as a sort of reparation to those afflicted ones , who would have been relieved by my uncle 's bounty , of which I perhaps , by an act of carelessness have deprived them , I have made a vow to dedicate my life , my energies , and will , to the service of the poor in active and laborious works , " said May , with a grave and humble manner . " Your motives are good , my child ; only let us be careful not to seek our own gratification too much , either temporal or spiritual , in our works . I certainly acquit you of all modern chivalry . I will see Mr. Fielding about that affair this evening , and request him to postpone it . " " If you please , Father , " said May , over whose countenance a shadow had fallen . " What is the trouble now , little one ? " asked Father Fabian . " Have I been presumptuous , Father ? Have I been lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanking God that I am not like others ? Oh , Father , I think I should rather die than be self-righteous ! " " I think not , my child . Only we must not rely too much on our intentions , which may be , morally speaking , good , but spiritually bad , if they are not united with great humility . I should be false to your soul 's interests if I dealt not plainly with you . But go now to your old pensioner . I administered to her this morning the last rites of the Church , and think it more than possible that before another sunrise she will have passed away from this life of mourning and gloom . " " I thought yesterday evening , when I was there , that her sufferings were nearly at an end , " said May , wiping off a tear . " Her dispositions are perfect , " continued Father Fabian . " Oh , in the last hour , if the soul is right before God , how vain appears all human learning ! how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splendor and grandeur of riches ! Soon -- very soon , that ignorant and poverty-stricken old negro , who , like Lazarus , has been lying at the door of the rich , great world , humbly thankful for the crumbs she has received , will be endowed with knowledge and wisdom ; she will read and have solved mysteries which the greatest sages of antiquity , and the profoundest philosophers of modern times have shrunk from , overwhelmed with the vastness of their conception . She will have looked on the face of Him who suffered for her , and be , through his divine mercy , and the merits of his bitter passion , admitted into eternal rest . Oh faith , mistress of learning ! Oh humility , without which the learned shall not enter heaven ! Possess our hearts -- reign in our souls for ever . But go now ; tell her I will see her in the morning , unless she is beyond my reach . " It was a clear , soft evening . The sky , as the sun declined , was filled as with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ripples around the isles of cloud that hung over the deep . The flute-like whistle of the blue-bird , and the odor of violets , and young budding leaves , were in the air together -- music , light , and fragrance , like harmonies from the spirit-land , blending softly together . The earth was clothed in its new garment , for spring had risen from the grave , and its resurrection was glorious . Over the ways of the city , and in the suburban lanes ; in the glens and dells of the forest , and the distant slopes of the blue hills ; over the mounds of the silent dead , where the germs of infinite life are planted ,  - -  where , like pearls , lying beneath the earth-billows , they will sleep in their sealed shells until , from the eastern gates of heaven , springs the eternal dawn , which shall gather them in , clothed with new light , to be set amongst the crown-jewels of God ,  - -  the sweet clover , the tender grass , and wild flowers were springing together . In flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , as she walked along , and led her feelings sweetly up to that clime of which the fairest and purest of earth-born things are only the gray shadows ; and rejoicing in nature and high hope , she came in sight of Mabel 's cottage . She saw the child who lived with her , and called her grandmother , playing about the door , and beckoning to her , inquired " how she was ? " " I'se right well , missy . Granny 's asleep . " " How is she ? " again , asked May . " She 's heap better , missy ; she bin sleep dis ever so long . " " Very well . You can play out here a little longer ; but do n't go away , and I will go in and wait until Aunt Mabel wakes , " said May , giving her some ginger-bread she had bought for her . The child , glad of its freedom , remained watching the birds and clouds . May opened the door , and entered softly . She went towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , which tells that the inexorable decree is gone forth , and the " arrow fastened , " was fast settling on old Mabel 's features . Yet there was nothing uncouth or grotesque in that shrivelled and swarthy face , because FAITH , which leads death captive , had shed over them a supernatural calm , which ennobled them with a solemn sweetness . Her poor old hand , so long withered and helpless , dropped beside her ; the other , around which her rosary was wrapped , lay on her breast . May took off her bonnet and scarf , and knelt down to say the dolorous mysteries of the rosary . " Remember , oh most loving Mother , by these , thy own dolors , the soul of thy poor servant , who will soon be engaged in her last earthly conflict . Rescue , oh Mother of Sorrows , through thy intercession , and the bitter passion and death of thy Divine Son , from the foes who lie in wait for her soul , and conduct her under thy safeguard to eternal light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying slave ; caste , race , and fetters were falling together into the deep abyss of death . She would soon know the glorious freedom of one of the heirs of Christ . " Oh , lady ! oh , beautiful missis ! this is a mean place for your crowned head and shining robes to come into . And who are those beside you , glorious and fair ? " murmured the old woman , suddenly stretching out both arms towards the door , and looking earnestly beyond May at something unseen . " Queen of Heaven ! how is it that you come to me ? I am not worthy to lift my eyes to yours , yet you are here , " she continued , while an awe , unspeakable and sweet , fell on May , who did not move . " To deliver my soul , and conduct me to the feet of your Divine Son ? " she said , after a short pause , as if some one had answered her , and she repeated the words . " Oh grace ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope ! " she exclaimed . " If I could , I would be worthy of such love -- I would spread gold and precious things at your feet ; but I am only a poor old negro , covered with patches and shreds . But fill my heart with all the love it can hold , and take that -- it 's all I 've got to offer . " Again , as if listening , she paused , then , with a smile of rapture , cried out , " Love Jesus ! love Mary ! Oh , Jesus ! oh , Mary ! my soul is filled with Jesus and Mary ! " Then her eyes closed , her hands sunk down , and she seemed to sleep again . " Was it a vision ? Was it a dream ? " thought May ; " or had she been in the presence of MARY and the angels of heaven ? Had they surrounded her , as she watched and prayed by the side of the dying woman ? She could not tell , but she felt that the air had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked wildly and eagerly around her ; then her eyes settled on May 's countenance . " How do you feel , Aunt Mabel , now ? " she asked , in a low voice . " Honey , I 've had a dream ! Such a glorious dream ! I thought the door opened , and the Blessed Virgin , surrounded by bright spirits , came in , and stood around me ; and it seemed to me that I was so full of joy , that I lifted up my old shrivelled arm to welcome her . Oh , my dear missis ! I never see so much brightness and beauty together before , and never heard such joyful sounds . It seemed like music talking . And , honey , what is stranger than all , I saw you there , and I thought the Blessed Virgin took a white lily out of her bosom , and laid it on your head , and smiled . Oh , missy , was n't it comforting to have such a dream ? " " It was a glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood , with rapturous motion , bounded through her veins , and filled her face with a glowing hue . " You seemed to see it all . Your eyes were open , and your lame arm was really stretched out towards the door , as if to welcome some bright company . Oh may that white flower , which you saw laid on my head , go down , and take deep root in my heart . " " It will , honey . Let me kiss your hand , and lay mine on your head , little missy . You 've been my earthly helper , and your Heavenly Father will be yours . My blessing ai nt of no account , but I give it to you with all my feeble powers . May you be blessed in every thing in this world and the next . It 's growing mighty dark now , honey ; hold my hand , till it grows light again . " With a last effort , she lifted May 's hand to her lips , and kissed it ; then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the departing soul , and recommended the dying one to the tender care of the Immaculate Mother of Jesus . A ray from the setting sun , stealing through the trees without , flowed into the shaded room , and rested on her pillow in flickering radiance ; and ere it passed away , her spirit had sped from its tenement of clay to undergo the judgment which , after death , every soul must stand . It was a sweet falling asleep with her , so gently had death released her from the bonds of flesh . An hour passed by , and still May knelt , absorbed in prayer , and earnest intercession for the departed . It was growing dark , and rising up , she straightened and composed old Mabel 's limbs ; and covering her face , went out and called the child , and bid her go for one of the neighboring women to come in , and prepare the body for interment . She looked in the chest for the grave-clothes which the old woman had kept and guarded as her only treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the parcel , gave it to the woman , with strict injunctions to arrange every thing with the greatest decency , and watch by her through the night . Promising to be there early in the morning to pay and relieve her , she hurried to Father Fabian to leave word with him , and request him to make the necessary arrangements for the interment -- the expenses of which she wished to defray herself . It was quite dark when she got home , and feeling wearied and overcome , she retired early , filled with gratitude for the privilege she had enjoyed , of seeing one so good and humble as old Mabel die . Death had assumed to her a benign and holy aspect ; she almost felt , " There is no Death . What seems so is Transition . This life of mortal breath Is but the suburbs of that Life Elysian , Whose portals we call Death. " 2 The next day Father Fabian , in the presence of a few poor neighbors , performed the last touching rites of the Church over the inanimate body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be raised in honor " to eternal life . May walked beside the coffin as it was borne to the grave , nor left the spot until the last clod of earth was thrown on it ; then , when it was deserted by all else , as constant in death as she had been in life , she kneeled down beside it , and offered up fervent prayers for her eternal repose . 1 Herbert . 2 Longfellow . CHAPTER XVII . REMORSE . It was near day-dawn . A splendid carriage , drawn by a span of thorough-paced horses , whose black coats shone in the moonlight like jet , while they champed their silver bits , and blew the white froth with the breath of their proud nostrils out like spray over the rich trappings of their harness , rolled with a rapid , but almost noiseless motion , through one of the broad streets of a fashionable quarter of the city . The light which flickered down from the silver coach-lamps revealed magnificent hangings of brocade and velvet , looped back with twisted cords of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clad in livery which corresponded with the elegant style of the equipage . They turned in a broad , aristocratic-looking square , and drew up in front of a handsome and spacious mansion . The officious footman sprung to the pavement , swung back the carriage-door , and held out his gloved hand to assist a lady , who was within to get out . " No need , sirrah , " she said , haughtily , as she stepped lightly out , and ran up the broad marble steps of the mansion , where , heedless of her stainless and delicate gloves , she seized the bell-knob , and rung violently . During the few moments she waited for admission , her foot , clad in white satin , beat the threshold with a light , but restless motion . Her brocade-robe about which costly laces hung in gossamer clouds , rustled down in rich folds to the marble floor of the vestibule , while with every pulsation of her heart , and movement of her body , gems flashed out in the moonlight . Long , shining curls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks and bosom , half concealing the rare beauty of her face . It was Helen ! The door was at length opened , and attended by her drowsy maid , she hurried up to her chamber . It was a lofty , and beautifully proportioned room , filled with every thing the most luxurious fancy could desire , and arranged with fastidious taste and elegance . Flowers were heaped up in Eastern vases , near the open window , and deep-cushioned chairs , and softly pillowed lounges , covered with pale , saffron-colored silk , were arranged here and there throughout the gorgeous room . The low , and exquisitely carved French bedstead was half hidden by a flowing drapery of embroidered lace , which , depending from a small hoop of mother-of-pearl in the ceiling , hung like a tent over it . The toilette-table was elaborately furnished . Between its twisted rosewood pillars , which were inlaid with pearl , in graceful device , swung an immense oval mirror , set in a frame of the same materials . Near it stood a small marble table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumes , jewel-cases , and various costly articles for toilette uses . On each side of the mirror projected gas-burners in the form of clusters of lilies -- the flowers being of the purest porcelain , and the rest highly gilt and embossed . Helen threw herself down wearily in a large chair , while her maid turned up the light , which was burning dimly , to a brighter flame , which revealed more minutely the splendors of the room . Over the toilette-glass hung a picture -- there were no others on the frescoed walls ; it was set far back in a superb oval frame of ivory and gold , and as the brilliant glare of lights shot upwards , an exquisite painting of the Mater Dolorosa could be distinctly seen -- a strange companion , or presiding genius , or ornament for the shrine for pride and vanity . " You can go now , Elise , " said Helen languidly . " Shall I not undress madame 's hair , and put her jewels away ? " inquired the Frenchwoman with an air of amazement . " No -- leave me at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered the woman . " To tell me go ! I who was fille-de-chambre to une Grande Duchesse ! Mon dieu ! la chaleur est tres-incommode ! Ingrat -- parvenu ! Un -- deux -- trois ! Il est temps de se coucher . " Helen had just touched her repeater , and with its soft , silvery chime , it struck three . Elise hurried away from the door , where she had lingered , in hopes of being recalled , to comfort herself with a glass of eau-de-sucre , ere she returned to her pillow . Helen got up and locked her door , and began to walk to and fro . By and by the past , mingling with the present , made such a torrent of bitter memories seethe and sweep through her desolate soul , that she wrung her hands , and rushed backwards and forwards like one mad . In her wild mood , she saw the glitter of her jewels , as she swept by the large mirror of her toilette . She paused , gazed at herself a moment , then , with a frantic gesture , tore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter laugh dashed them from her . Her beautiful face , as white as the alabaster Psyche near her , was full of wild and demoniac expressions , which chased each other with the velocity of clouds over her countenance . Remorse , anguish , and despair settled like a brooding tempest on her forehead ; then wringing her hands , she again commenced her walk . " A lie , " she muttered , " a splendid , living lie . Widows and orphans wronged -- the poor defrauded -- the church wounded and robbed by thee , Helen ! A husband who trusts me -- who believes me -- honorable and true himself -- confiding in a nature utterly false -- and leaning on a heart rotten to the core ! Oh , Helen ! eternal loss will surely be thine -- so it is better to die ere madness comes , and divulges the dark secret . Walter is away ; he will be here at sunrise . Better for him to find thee , Helen , calm and cold in the beauty of which he is so proud , than live to know that thou art all a lie -- which he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very dogs ! " While these dark thoughts swept through the heart of the tempted and despairing one , she unlocked a secret drawer in her jewel-case , and took from it a small silver casket , which she opened . It contained a crystal flacon , filled with a liquid , transparent , and of a pale rose-color . " One drop of it , " she whispered , " one single drop , and without a pang , this unrest and anguish will be over . That which is beyond can not be worse ! " Just then a strong current of air rushed in through the open window , and blew the jet of gas , in a stream of brilliance , up towards the picture of the Mater Dolorosa . The sudden glare arrested the attention of the wretched , sin-stained one . She looked up , and her eyes , glaring with the frenzy of evil , met the ineffably tender and sorrowful face of MARY ; which , with its tears , and expression of submissive and sublime woe , its folded hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , while , with the distinctness of a whisper , these thoughts passed through her soul . " Wretched one , forbear ! Wound not again my Divine Son , whose body is already covered with stripes and bruises for thee . Open not my heart again , which is already pierced for thy salvation ! Hope ! It was for such as thee that my Son , Jesus , suffered on the cross ; for such as thee , that I immolated my soul , my nature , my maternal love , on that bloody altar with Him . " " Was it the wind ? No ! the sweetest winds of earth could not have drawn such language from the corrupt and frenzied chords of my spirit . No demon whispered it ! " exclaimed Helen , still gazing upwards . " Was it a heavenly warning for me , the most miserable outcast on the wide earth ? " The mad tempest was dispersed ; it rolled back its sullen clouds from her soul ; and , with a trembling cry for mercy , she staggered towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhausted . As the sun was rising , Walter Jerrold , who had travelled all night from New York , whither he had been on business of importance , opened his house-door with a private key , and entered without disturbing the servants . He ran up to Helen 's door , and finding it locked , opened his dressing-room , which adjoined hers , with the same key , and pushing back the silk draperies which hung between them , went in , and , to his alarm and amazement , saw her , still arrayed in her festal robes sleeping in the chair , into which she had fallen . Her face was as white as the drooping roses on her bosom , and her countenance wore an expression of pain . " Helen ! " he whispered , as he leaned over and kissed her cheek . " Helen , are you ill ? " " Will ! It was burnt . Will ! " she cried , starting up , and looking wildly around her . " Oh , Walter ! I am so glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . " " Helen , you are ill , I fear . What means this unwonted confusion ;  - -  have you been out , and just come in ? What is the meaning of it all -- and what is this ? " he said , while he stooped down to pick up the crystal flacon which had dropped out of its case on the floor . " Dear Walter , do n't open it , for the world ! It is a cosmetic . I am too white , sometimes , and touch my cheeks with it , " exclaimed Helen , starting up ; " do give it to me . " " No , Helen ; my wife must be real in all things . I do not approve of artificial coloring ; so , to save you from temptation , I shall put it out of your reach ! " replied her husband , throwing the flacon out into the street . A lean , hungry dog , prowling about in search of food , rushed to the spot -- hoping , no doubt , that it was a morsel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the spot , then , uttering a loud howl , he fell dead . " Helen ! explain this mystery ! " he exclaimed , grasping her hand , and drawing her to the window . " Are your cosmetics all poisons as deadly as that ? " " Walter ! this is horrible ! Poison ? Why , Walter , it might have killed me ! " she gasped , hiding her pallid face in his bosom . " Helen , answer me , by the love and trust I bear you , did you know that the contents of that flacon were poisonous ? Look up , dear Helen , and answer me , yes or no . " " No , Walter -- on my honor , no . You have saved me from a horrible death , " she replied , raising her head , and looking , with a strong effort into his eyes . Thus was Helen driven , with scourges , by her task-master , the great tempter of souls , into slough after slough , from which , there was but one escape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But repentance , to her vision , was like a shoreless ocean , or a fierce deity to whose exacting nature she must sacrifice all that she held dear on earth , or perish . But her husband 's love and esteem -- her ill-gotten riches -- her position -- her luxuries ! Could she live without them ? If she could repent without making restitution , she would . But she well knew that such repentance would be fruitless . And thus , while , to the world , she moved calmly in her proud beauty , and was envied by the miserable , for the apparent happiness and splendor of her lot , a fierce beast was tugging at her heart-strings , more savage than that which tore the vitals of the boy of Lacedaemon . It was remorse . " Helen ! " said Walter Jerrold , calmly , " have you any grief or mystery hidden from me , my wife ? I am like a helpless child , now in your hands ; you may deceive me , and triumph in your concealment -- but do not -- do not , Helen , for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . I love you well enough to lift the burden , if there be one , from it , to my strong shoulders ; and if -- if -- if -- you have ever erred , let me hear it from no lips but your own . " Helen would have cast herself at his feet and told him all , but she feared he would spurn her -- she longed to deserve the love of his manly and honest heart , but too weak , too much a coward , she shrunk from the agony and peril of a confession of her guilt . And Jerrold ! was he not mad to expect to find a true and loving spouse in one who had cast off her allegiance to God ? " You are mistaken , Walter . Really , you have made quite a scene ! I fear that you are romantic ! For , really except when my nervous moods come over me , I am not aware that there is any thing unusual in my conduct . I am excessively nervous and excitable . I was dancing all night . I went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most brilliant affair . It was after two o'clock when I came home . You may be sure I was tired . Then I concluded to give you a little surprise by waiting up for you ; and , as I looked very haggard , took out that precious cosmetic to tint my cheeks -- all , dear Walter , to welcome you ; but I was too much fagged , and went off into a sound , vulgar sleep ! " said Helen , going to her toilette-table to adjust her hair , while she laughed as if the whole thing had been an amusing adventure . " It will learn you to run off again , " she continued . " Well , well -- perhaps I am exacting ; but understand one thing , Helle , about me , " said Walter Jerrold , gravely , " I can bear with , and forgive errors -- but deception , never . " " Walter ! " said Helen , reproachfully , while tears suffused her fine eyes . " Forgive me , Helle , if my words grate on your feelings . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarities as early as possible . Shall I ring for Elise , for you are tangling and tearing your hair to pieces ? " " If you please . I will soon join you , if you will tell me where to find you , " she replied , with assumed composure . " At the breakfast table , I trust , " he said , pleasantly ; " I am thirsting for a cup of mocha , after my long journey . " " I suspect you will find it ready . I ordered them to have it ready early ;  - -  but see , Walter ! have you any special engagement this forenoon ? " " Nothing very particular after ten , Helen . Why ? " " Why , you know that Matinees are all the rage now . I hold my first one to-day.  - -  All the world have promised to come ! " " You do n't want me , then ? " he said , laughing . " Of course I do . It will look proper for you to be present at the first . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many queer stories about the Matinees . " " It is well to be prudent in these fashionable follies , Helle -- touch some of them with gloves on . I do not like this new style of thing , but if it 's the fashion , we must fall in . I 'll come , provided there is no scandal and high play , " he said , laughing . As the hour for the Matinee approached , Helen 's drawing-rooms presented a coup d'oeil of splendor and elegance . Daylight was carefully excluded ; and alabaster lamps threw a soft , moon-lit radiance , through flowers and garlands , over the scene . The costly mirrors , the magnificent furniture , of the time of Louis le Grande , the lofty , frescoed ceiling , the exquisite statuary , and rare paintings , were all in fine keeping with each other , and gave , what an artist would call , tone and harmony to the scene . Attired in white crape and pearls , Helen had never looked more lovely ; and of all who crowded with compliments around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group after group of the beau monde made their way to the head of the room , where she , with her high-bred worldly air , received them with a smile and pleasant passing words . " Your Matinee is the most brilliant of the season , Mrs. Jerrold , " said a fashionable old lady , with a dowager air -- such a one as we meet with constantly in society , who , tangled up in laces , false hair , and a modish style of dress , look like old faries at a christening , and who impress the young and inexperienced by their affected zest that the fleeting pleasures of life are immortal . " Your matinee is really splendid ! Such a fashionable company -- so much beauty -- really , it reminds me of old times . But , my dear creature , did you know there is the greatest sensation in town now about religion ? " " How ? " asked Helen , smiling . " The Romanists are holding something they call a mission at the cathedral , and really , I am told , that the performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for an hour . " " It is never considered outre to go to the cathedral , as the very elite of our society are Catholic , and attend there ; but entre nous , shall you go , Mrs. Jerrold ? " observed a lady near them . " Yes , " continued the dowager , with a spiteful air ; " and very few parvenues amongst them . Most of them sprung from something better than low trades-people . " " Granted . No doubt they enjoy their pedigree as much as I do the substantial fortune my grandfather acquired by trade , " said the lady , pleasantly . " But , Mrs. Jerrold , the music is fine , the preacher superbly eloquent , and every body goes now , instead of attending the opera ! " This grated on Helen 's ears . Classing the Church with the opera ! But what right had she , who trampled it under foot , to complain ? " Really , I have heard nothing of this mission before ! " she said , with an indifferent air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not tell exactly . Thousands go , and thousands come away because they ca n't be accommodated with seats . Altogether with the music , the eloquent preaching , and the crowd , it is quite a spectacle . " " Yes , " put in the dowager ; " and that is all . It is a spectacle ! " " Judge Craven 's wife and Major Boyd are amongst the converts ; and the Rev. Allan Baily , " said the lady , with a wink at Helen . " Oh , my God ! " exclaimed the dowager ; " Mr. Baily ! It must be a lie -- I declare it must ! " " Will you have my sal-volatile , madam ? " said the malicious lady , enjoying the scene , while she offered her vinaigrette . " I wo n't believe it . Who told you , Mrs. Grayson ? " " Himself , " replied Mrs. Grayson , calmly . " He 's crazy ! He 's been flighty these two years , with his long coats , and fast-days , and confession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuffing the sal-volatile , until she grew purple in the face . " As to the others , they are doting . I 'll go this moment , if you 'll excuse me , Mrs. Jerrold , and make my coachman drive me there ; and if he has done so , I 'll rouse him , as sure as I have a tongue in my head . I knew him when he was a boy , and I protest against it , " she said , screaming like an angry macaw , as she fluttered out . " The town 's crazy about Mr. Baily 's conversion . I am not surprised at Mrs. Fanshaw 's excitement . But let us make up a party , and go tonight , Mrs. Jerrold . The gentleman who conducts this thing , and pulls the wires , is a man of irresistible eloquence . He was one of us a few years ago . " " It would be dangerous to venture , I should think , " said Helen , with a dim smile ; " but if Mr. Jerrold has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mission ' you are speaking , Helen ? " interrupted her mother-in-law , rustling in silk and jewels , " Yes ; of course we must go . We shall be quite out of the fashion , if we do not . The most distingue persons in town are to be there this evening . " " I fear the opera and assembly will have but a slim attendance , " said Walter Jerrold in his pleasant , sarcastic way . " Oh , we shall get away in time for the assembly , which , by the by , is the last of the season , " replied Mrs. Jerrold . " Helen , you look charmingly this morning . I declare you are the happiest couple I know of in the world . " Cards , scandal , chocolate , and ices , filled up the routine of the Matinee ; then the guests rolled away in their carriages to dress for dinner , or leave cards at the doors of people , who they knew were out . It is the way of the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Helen that evening at tea . " Nonsense . I have better faith in you , Helen , than to think one evening will put you in peril . Come , do n't be a coward . I wish you to hear this eloquent , half-crazy enthusiast preach ; then we can drop into the opera , or assembly , whichever you wish . " " In my hat and white pegnoir -- how ridiculous , said Helen , with a faint smile . " No ; come back and dress , if you choose . It will look ill for us to stay away when the others expect us and to be frank with you , Helle , I want to convince the world that my wife is not a Romanist . " " Is any one so foolish as to suspect it now , Walter ? " she said , bitterly . " Of course they do . And they 'll be disappointed when they see that you neither bow down , nor cross yourself . " It was not meant , but every word her husband said told down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come , shall we go ? " " Yes , " replied the sin-enslaved Helen . When the gay company arrived at the cathedral door , although it was early , they could scarcely make their way through the dense crowds which thronged the isles ; but by patiently and gradually moving up towards the transept of the church , they were at last successful in finding seats , which commanded a view of the altars and pulpit . Lights in massive candelabra , and masses of flowers , of rare and rich dyes , covered the high altar . The tabernacle , which stood amidst this marble throne , was draped with cloth of gold , and surrounded by clusters of tube-roses and lilies . Above all , the objects which arrested every wandering eye , was the carved image of the MAN OF SORROWS -- the suffering son of God ! But it was not towards these that every Catholic soul was drawn . They were only signs , which designated the spot where the real presence of Jesus lay ; where , enshrined in the fairest of earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar of the Madonna and the " Good Shepherd " were gorgeously decorated with lights and flowers . Helen did not kneel . She did not cross herself . She merely sat down , and looked with a haughty , tired air , around her . She did not observe the priest as he came from the sanctuary , and ascended the pulpit , until she saw the attention of others directed towards him ; then she lifted her glasses , gazed a few moments at him , thought him a rather distinguished-looking person , and piqued by her husband 's observation , turned away to watch the movements of a party who were compelled to resort to walking over the backs of the pews to get to their seats . But while her eyes roved around in search of novel and amusing sights -- while she nodded to one acquaintance , and smiled at another -- what words are those which ring down into her soul ? Why pale her cheeks , and why tremble the gem-decked fingers of her fair hand ? Why do tears -- tears -- strange visitants to that haughty visage , roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross of Jesus , Mary , his mother ! " Again the clear sonorous voice of the speaker , filled with a tender cadence and solemn sweetness , enunciated the words . Why does Helen think of her picture at home -- of the pitying glance it cast on her the night she committed that crime , which had almost wrecked her soul ? Why does she think of her interposition that very morning which had saved her from self-murder ? It was from no voluntary will of her own ; but these visions came , subduing and touching the rind of her weary heart , until it heaved with the throes of a new birth . She listens now . She can not do otherwise , for the powerful voice of the preacher rings out clear , distinct , and impressive . His eloquence enchains every heart ; in burning words , he assails every soul . Unbelievers , heretics , infidels , and lukewarm Catholics , hang on every sentence ; nor disdain the tears which flow , while he tells of the dolors of Mary . Almost fainting , Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pent-up agony in her heart , her brain ached , and the throbbing of her pulses almost suffocated her ; and when the preacher ceased , she leaned back with a sigh of relief . But it was not over yet . The organ in deep-toned thunders , and notes of liquid music , wailed forth the dolorous harmony of Stabat Mater , while voices of surpassing sweetness sung the words . " I am ill , Walter -- take me home , " gasped Helen . " I am overcome by the heat and crowd . " " We must wait a little , Helen . The throng is so great that we can not move . Dry your face , and let me fan you . Every body is crying , I believe -- do n't let that trouble you . See , Helle , even I have dropped a tear in memory of those stupendous sorrows , " said Walter Jerrold , half playfully , and half in earnest . Then Helen leaned her face on her hands , while torrents of tears dripped over the diamonds and rubies that decked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in her neat little parlor , knitting and singing , when there came a curt , sharp rap on the door . " Come in , " she said , looking up ; and Mr. Fielding walked in , heated and flurried . " I am very glad to see you , sir . Give me your hat , and let me fetch you a drink of cool water . " " No , ma'am ; I am not in a sufficiently pleasant mood with you to accept your hospitalities . I came on legal business , " he said , pursing up his mouth , and looking around . " I am sorry that you are offended with me , sir . What shall I do to obtain your forgiveness ? " replied May , with a grave smile . " Do ? What shall you do ? " he said , mimicking her . " Do as you always do , and that is just what suits you , ma'am . " " No ; I 'll do better . I will beg your pardon , and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind a friend . And begging pardons do n't suit me , Mr. Fielding , for you must know I am very proud . " " No doubt of it . You look proud here -- living like a Parisian grisette in a garret , and delving from morning until night for your daily bread , " he said , testily . " Dear sir , I do not think I am like a grisette , and this is not a garret . Look around , and see if I am not very nice here . What can be purer and cleaner than this matting , which still smells of the sweet groves of Ceylon . See my chairs and sofa -- did you ever see such incomparable chintz ? the white ground covered with roses and blue-bells ! Here are my books , there my flowers , and this -- you know this , do you not ? " said May , leading him up to her little oratory . " No ; I only know that the commandments order us not to worship graven images , " he said , gruffly . " You only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you believe no such monstrous thing . Oh no ! no more than we worship the stars , which , in their sparkling beauty , lead our thoughts to God . In these sacred delineations we are reminded of our great examples , Jesus and Mary ; they tell us better than books can do -- better than our unfaithful hearts can , whenever our eyes rest on them , that for us the Divine Son and Immaculate Mother assumed the sin-offering of the world . These white hyacinths and violets are emblems of her purity and humility ; and carved crucifix , the image of incarnate patience and undying love . Oh , dear Mr. Fielding , I should be worse than a pagan , if I did not keep these memorials of Jesus and Mary ever before me ; if I did not let a shadow of my poor love for their infinite clemency and love express itself in veneration for those images which remind me continually of them . " " I did n't come here to talk polemics , " said Mr. Fielding , turning away abruptly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most grave sir , to open the business which has procured me the honor of this visit ? " said May , seating herself primly in a chair opposite to him , and folding her little hands together with an air of dignity . Mr. Fielding coughed , to hide a laugh . " Where is Dr. Burrell ? " he inquired . " Attending to his patients , I presume , " she replied , while her face flushed up . " So . When did your ladyship see him last ? " " I am not aware that it concerns you especially to know , " she said , confused . " Yes it does . I have a right to know every thing about you per fas et nefas . Any one who will burn up a will , which would have secured to her a half million in funds and real estate , or , in case she did not burn the will , wo n't consent to set one aside , which the testator declared on his death-bed was null and void ; who refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would have treated her in every respect as an honored guest ; who flew off like a fussy little wren , when her affluent cousin offered to provide for her ; and who , last of all , rejects one of nature 's noblemen -- the best match in the city -- the deuce knows for what ; I consider non compos mentis , and quite unable to take care of herself . " May 's countenance was a study while Mr. Fielding poured out this vial of wrath on her head . Smiles , and tears , and blushes flitted in bright tides over it , making it very radiant and beautiful ; but when he summed up the evidence , and the true cause of his ire burst on her , she laughed outright , with such a clear , merry peal , that Mr. Fielding was obliged to yield to its influence . " You are an incorrigible little wretch , May ! But tell me , soberly , why you rejected Dr. Burrell ? " " Simply , sir , because I have not the remotest idea of marrying ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find those sympathies , affinities , and qualities in Dr. Burrell which would secure my happiness . " " Whew ! whew ! " exclaimed Mr. Fielding , waving his hat around his head ; " Ne quid nimis ! " " Do n't abuse me , sir , in an unknown tongue , " said May , seriously . " Child , do you expect to find so much excellence in one character on earth , as you desire ? " said the old lawyer , putting his hat down . " I fear not , sir : but until I do , I shall remain single . " " Well , you deserve to . If any one ever deserved the fate of an old maid , you do . But I want you to understand one thing . I have not given up my point about that will . According to your express commands , I have made no movement in the affair , but nem . con . I shall present the case at the present term of the Orphan 's Court as a fraud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whatever it is you call them . It is very clear to me that the powers on high do not intend to trouble themselves about courts and questions of equity , and all that . " " You wo n't dare to do so yet , sir . I shall protest against it so far as I am concerned . I have faith in prayer , and shall wait , " exclaimed May . " It is because every thing is draped in materialism that we do not receive more aid from the heavenly powers . " The door opened suddenly , and Walter Jerrold came in , looking pale and haggard . He grasped May 's hand , and bowed to Mr. Fielding , who , muttering and angry , made his exit . " What is the matter , Mr. Jerrold ? " inquired May , kindly . " Helen seems ill , and I have brought the carriage for you , May . She asks continually for you , and fears you will not come . " " I will go with you instantly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on her hat and scarf . " What ails Helen ? " " That is more than I can tell you . She has feverish nights , and is silent and depressed . We made up a party last week to go to the cathedral , during the ' Mission , ' to hear a celebrated preacher . Helen went very unwillingly , and since then she has been moping and starting , and altogether in a strange mood , for one who ought to be happy , " replied Mr. Jerrold , with a gloomy air . By this time they had got down stairs , and May was seated in the splendid carriage , on her way to Upperton-square . " Poor Helen ! I hope it may be in my power to save her . What does her physician say ? " " That is the most singular part of the thing . She positively refuses to see one . Indeed , May , to be frank with you , I fear there is something dreadful preying on Helen 's mind . She sees no company ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother , she declined going : in fact , it 's all a mist , and I am puzzled to death to find out the end of it . " " Mr. Jerrold , " said straightforward May , " these are all the signs of a troubled conscience . Did you know that Helen was once a Catholic , and in virtually abandoning her religion , she is only suffering the pangs of a soul which can not be at rest in its apostasy ? " " Do you really believe this , May ? " he asked , eagerly . " I really do . Religion is a vital principle . It can not be torn from the soul without inflicting the most incurable wounds , " she replied , while her eyes filled up with tears ; " and these wounds give birth to an anguish , which is the prelude of eternal woe ! " " Why did she do it , May ? I did not require it . It is true I was better pleased to have her a Protestant , but I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know it would grieve me sincerely if I thought I had influenced her ? It would not a month ago , but now -- hang it all ! " said Mr. Jerrold , taking off his hat , and running his fingers through his hair . " And why now , and not then ? " inquired May , with interest . " Why , you see , May , I was so delighted with the eloquence of the preacher the night we went to the ' Mission , ' that I stepped in several times afterwards , and was considerably enlightened on some points ; in fact , a great deal of prejudice and ignorance were removed by the clear , close , cogent arguments I heard . It would be a terrible thing , May -- a devilish thing , to be guilty of soul-murder ! " " Terrible indeed . I can not believe now that you would on any account oppose Helen in the practice of her faith ? " " No , unless it makes her gloomy and moping . But here we are , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the post-office , and be back in a quarter of an hour , " said Mr. Jerrold , handing May out , and opening the hall-door for her . May ran through the gorgeous hall , and up the marble staircase , with its statues and vases ; but so intent was she on her errand of charity that she noticed nothing of the rich splendors around her . She encountered Elise at the head of the staircase . " Ou alles-vous , mademoiselle ? " she said , with an elegant courtesy . " I am Mrs. Jerrold 's cousin , and have come to see her . Show me her room , " said May , with an air of dignity . " Je vous demande pardon . Madame Jerrold est un peu indisposee . Entrez ! " said Elise , throwing open Helen 's door , without however , making the least noise . And there , amidst her almost oriental luxuries , she reclined ; her heaped-up silken cushions -- her ormolu tables -- her Eastern vases , filled with spices and rose-leaves , until the air was heavy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light flowed in softly and radiantly -- her jewels -- her costly attire ; amidst it all she reclined -- faded , conscience-stricken , and trembling . There was a wild , feverish light in her eyes , and her white lips quivered incessantly . " Helen -- dear Helen ! " said May , holding out her hands . " ' If you are sick , or sorrowful , or repentant , send for me . ' You said this to me some time ago , May . The promise is claimed , " she said , feebly . " And I am here , dear Helen . How can I aid you ? " " First go and close that door . I have a most inconveniently zealous French waiting-maid , who pretends not to understand English , that she may gather as much information about one 's private affairs as possible . " " I encountered her on the stairs , " said May , closing the door carefully . " Now , lay off your things , little woman . Sit here where I can see you , and tell me if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think I ought to be the happiest woman on earth ? " " No , dear Helen ; it is very rich and beautiful , but it does not dazzle me . And so far from thinking you ought to be the happiest woman on earth , I think you ought to be the most miserable , until contrition and repentance lead you back , humble and weeping , to the sacraments you have deserted , " said May , bravely . " Just the same ridiculous little thing ! " said Helen , with a faint smile . " But , May , suppose even that I felt those dispositions , do you know what it would cost me to practice them ? " " A few worldly pleasures , perhaps , which are so fleeting that they are not worth a thought -- a few vain triumphs , full of envy -- heart-burnings and aspirations , which , while they waste the energies of an immortal soul , rise no higher than your head , and fall like black , misshapen lava at your feet . " " Think you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could fling them from me as I do these leaves , " said Helen , tearing to pieces a rich japonica , which she snatched from a vase near her , and scattering the soft , pure petals around her . " No , May , these would be trifles . I should have to tear up my heart with a burning ploughshare -- put it under foot to be spurned and crushed ! The storm it would raise would rage so wildly that I should become like a piece of drift-wood , at the mercy of wind and waves . " " If your eternal interests are at stake , let the burning ploughshare go over it , Helen , for it is better to suffer here than where the fire of wrath is everlasting ; but , indeed , dear Helen , all this sounds exaggerated and impassioned to me ! These obstacles which you dread must be temptations to deter you from the holiest duties . If you anticipate any difficulties from Mr. Jerrold 's opposition , make your heart easy . He is quite miserable about you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you practising your Faith . " " Did he say that , May ? " " He did , indeed . I suggested that your happiness might be involved in these momentous questions , when he expressed not only his willingness , but his anxiety for you to do whatever your conscience demanded . " " Oh , May ! Oh , little woman ! simple -- good soul ! " cried Helen , bursting into tears . " I can not tell you all . You do not understand . There is a terrible mystery , which , like an incubus , is brooding day and night in my soul , and drives back all good angels who would enter . I am its slave , May . " " What is it , Helen ? " asked May , while the color faded from her cheeks , and she looked with mingled sorrow and dread on the miserable one . " Hush ! there is Walter 's footsteps ! " she exclaimed , starting . " Oh , May , I could not bear to lose my husband 's affection -- to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Helle ? Better , I hope , now that May is with you ? " said her husband , coming in . " And ready to pardon me for my insensibility to your happiness ? " " Oh , Walter ! " said Helen , covering her face with her hands . " I had hoped that these clouds would all be dispelled by the time I returned home . May and I were talking about you as we came along , and if she had not succeeded in making you believe that I wish you to be happy your own way , let this be a gage between us , " said Mr. Jerrold , unfolding a small parcel he held in his hand , and handing her a Catholic prayer-book . It was bound in ivory , with an exquisite miniature painting of " Ecce Homo " on one back and " Mater Dolorosa " on the other . The paintings were covered with crystals , and set with a rim of gold and pearls . The edges and clasps were of the same exquisite finish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen , I will buy a pew in the cathedral for you , and escort you thither whenever you wish to go . " " Dear Walter , why bring me so costly a gift ? " said Helen , looking at the sorrowful and sacred faces on the covers of the book , with a shudder . " Indeed , I am not worthy of such tender and restless affection . " " Look up , Helen -- look up , my love ! I am prouder of you this day than any king could be of his crown , but if religion is going to make you abject and tame , and mistrustful , I will have none of it , " said the worldly man , in an impatient tone . " Religion gives birth to nothing gloomy . Even in her penitential tears , there are rainbows , " cried May , " She is the mother of all that is lovely , cheerful , amiable , and perfect . Even our tribulations must be borne with joy , because the divine hope which sanctifies them leads the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right -- it sounds right . I know positively nothing about it , and wish I did . If I could only get Helen out once more , I should be the happiest fellow on earth , " said Mr. Jerrold , with a sad and puzzled expression on his fine face . " I suspected all along that perhaps some religious crank had got into Helle 's head , from the circumstances of her allowing no picture but that Mater Dolorosa to come into her room . It was a queer fancy in one so devoted to paintings as she is . I have been wishing ever since she got it to buy a pendant for it . I found a splendid ' Niobe in Tears '  - -  paid an exorbitant price for it -- brought it home , thinking Helen would be charmed , but she banished it to the library . Then I purchased a ' Hecate '  - -  a wonderfully beautiful thing , but that was also condemned , and sent into banishment . Was it not so Helen ? " " Dear Walter -- dear May ! " said Helen , lifting her white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . I must now , or never , yield to these impulses and warnings . Oh , Mother -- oh , Mother ! " she exclaimed , turning a look of agony towards the picture ; " aid me in this mortal struggle ! I can bear this no longer -- this mystery and burden -- this mantle of hypocrisy must be torn off , if it costs me your love , Walter , and my life ! I must be free . I thought I was strong ; I thought I could walk steadily along the way I have hewn out , but I have been haunted by a remorse which is inexorable , and that -- that sacred , sorrowful face over which my sins forced so many bitter torrents . It has never left me day or night . In my revels and worldliness -- in my dreams -- in my solitude , it has followed me . I believe if my heart were opened , it would be found graven there , " she gasped out . " Oh , dear Helen , respond at once to that tender love which has so patiently pursued you . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She has placed herself between you and divine justice , by adopting -- taking possession , as it were , of your heart ; and uniting her dolors with those of her Divine Son , has given you no rest , until you seek it at the foot of the cross ! " broke out May , with ardor . " Oh , Mother of Sorrows ! pity this , thy poor child , who flies wounded and weeping to thy bosom . " Helen wept convulsively . A dark cloud had gathered on her husband 's face . Her words had fallen like cold drops of lead into his heart . He knew not to what she alluded , and imagined strange and horrible things . " Helen , " he said , at last , " your words have a dark meaning ! your language is strange for a wife , who has been so loved and trusted , to use ! " " There is the sting , Walter . I have been loved and trusted without deserving it ; and what breaks down my proud nature most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows all my guilt , still bears with me , " she said , while every feature worked with the agony this trial was causing her . " You will set me mad , woman ! Let me hear what this guilt is , of which you so often accuse yourself . By Heavens ! all the wealth of India shall never cloak dishonor ! I will tear it away , and throw it -- with one who has dared to bring a stain on my name -- off , as I would a soiled garment . Do you understand me ? " he said , in a fury . Helen started up , the red blood rushing in crimson tides to her cheeks and bosom , dyeing her arms down to the very tips of her fingers , at the imputation . " It is not that , Walter , thank God ! " she said , in a firmer voice . " But there is no true repentance without restitution . In a few moments you shall know all my sin . " She went into her dressing-closet ; when she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which she laid on May 's knee . " Take it , May -- it is yours . I stole it from the closet the night Uncle Stillinghast was dying , while you slept . " " Helen , what is it ? " said May , almost overcome , while she took the package up , and looked at it . " It is the lost will , May , which it was supposed you had burnt . This is my guilt , Walter , " she said , turning to her husband ; " this is the barrier which has lifted itself , like a wall of lead , between my soul and heaven . Now spurn me , my husband -- despise me , May ; then , perhaps , loaded with disgrace , and forsaken and desolate , my Father in heaven may receive me once more . " " Base woman ! " exclaimed her husband , turning from her . " Sir , " said May , grasping his hand ; " Helen , whatever her faults may have been , is worthy of you now . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and annuities to the poor , over which I have no control , I want none of it . Only promise to deal kindly with her in this her hour of genuine humility and repentance . But , see -- she is falling . " " Unworthy , dishonorable Helen , how dare you wed me with this wicked act on your conscience ? " said the outraged man , looking coldly down on the pale and prostrate form at his feet . " I will leave her with you , May . " " Where are you going , sir ? " said May , kneeling down , and lifting Helen 's burning head to her breast . " To destruction ! " he replied , in a low , bitter tone . " Do not dare leave us , sir , " said May , in a commanding tone . " Help me to lift this penitent woman -- so deserving now of your tender support -- to the bed , and go for a physician and Father Fabian . Bring both immediately , for I believe a brain fever is coming on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had died ere my trust and love were so cruelly shaken ! " he exclaimed wildly , as he raised her lifeless form from the floor , and laid it on the bed . " Oh , Walter Jerrold ! are you mad ? To wish she had died without repentance -- without proving that her nature , by rising through grace above the guilt of sin , is worthy of your highest esteem and love ? Go , sir , unless you wish your servants to become acquainted with the whole affair , and to-morrow hear it recited at the corners of the streets by every newsboy in the city . I shall have to ring for assistance . " " Give me that will , " he said , moodily . " For what ? " " To place it in Mr. Fielding 's hands , and tell him the disgraceful story , lest he afterwards think I have been an accessory to Helen 's guilt , " he replied . " No , sir . It is entirely my affair , and I wish no interference . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and yours than you , in your savage mood , could be , " replied May , holding the will firmly to her bosom . When the physician came , he , after a careful examination , pronounced the case to be a violent attack of brain-fever . Helen was at times in a raving delirium ; then she would lie for hours without sense or motion . Sometimes she implored in moving terms her husband 's forgiveness ; then , when the violence of the paroxysm was passing away , she would whisper , " Lead me , Mother ! Lead me through this howling wilderness . Oh , save -- save me ! I am pursued . Hold me , my Mother -- my sorrowful Mother ! " May could only follow implicitly the doctor 's directions , and weep and pray . Father Fabian came -- heard the story of her repentance , and desire to return to God ; then returned to wrestle in earnest prayer at the altar that she -- the penitent one -- might be restored long enough to be purified and consoled by the Sacraments of the Church . For long weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , the shadow of his former self , never left her bedside . He had loved her well , with all his worldliness and pride . But now the crisis of the disease came on . Her life hung upon the most attenuated thread . The doctor gave them no hope of a favorable change . It was past midnight . May , with Father Fabian , who had staid , hoping that a short interval of reason would occur before her agony came on -- for they thought she was sinking -- knelt , praying and imploring the mercy of heaven for her helpless soul . Mr. Jerrold , unmanned , and filled with bitter anguish , had gone out into the balcony , which overhung the garden , where , bowed down , he wept like a child . A low moan escaped Helen 's white lips , a quivering motion convulsed her limbs . Her long golden hair was thrown back in dishevelled curls from her marble face . She gasped for breath . " Her agony is coming on ! " whispered Father Fabian . But suddenly there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she whispered , " Thanks , oh , my Mother ! " and her large eyes , from which the film passed away , closed in a sweet and refreshing slumber . " She will live , " said Father Fabian ; " but be silent -- shade the light , and let in more air . " May wanted to kneel , and sing the glories of MARY ; she would like to have declared to all the earth the power and tenderness of that Immaculate Heart , which pursues with importunity and tears those who fly from her Divine Son . Loving him , she can not bear that those for whom he suffered should be recreant to their high destiny ; but May could only commune with the unseen guardians of her soul , and through them declare her rapture , which ebbed and flowed in sweet numbers , like a life-tide through her soul . Father Fabian followed Mr. Jerrold out on the balcony , and laying his hand on his shoulder , said , " Let us give thanks to God ; your wife will live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest agitation , before the equilibrium of nature is restored , might destroy her . Come with me into another room , and follow the advice which I shall give you , which is to lie down and sleep . " Subdued and humble , the proud man was led like a child into another apartment , where , throwing himself on a lounge , exhausted with long and anxious watching , he fell into a profound sleep . When Helen awoke the next day , she looked around her with a bewildered air -- then gradually remembered all ; and though a feeling of deep tribulation came over her , she felt a peace within herself that she had never known before . She breathed a prayer to JESUS and MARY for strength and patience in her desolation , for she thought that she was forsaken by all earthly love -- but not friendship , because she saw May kneeling a little way off saying her rosary . " A drop of water , dear May , " she said . May started as the clear , liquid tones of that voice , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her wine-and-water , which the doctor had ordered . " How kind in you , May , to forgive me so entirely , " she said , gently . " Hush , dearest Helen ! Do not speak . We are so anxious for your recovery , that we do not wish to hear the sound of your voice , " said May , leaning over to kiss her forehead . " We , May ! Who ? " " We ! " said May , pointing to Jerrold , who at that moment had entered the room , stepping so softly , that he was almost beside her before she saw him . Neither of them spoke ; but after a long , earnest look into Helen 's eyes , which were now lifted with a clear and unclouded , but humble expression to his , he stooped over and kissed her , while he murmured comforting words of forgiveness , and regret for his harshness . " No more secrets , Walter , " she said , in a calm , low voice . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom of which I heard strange truths at the ' Mission . ' We will be united from henceforth in soul , body , and estate . " " Come away now , " said May , wiping away the fast falling tears ; " she must not be agitated . " " And you , most determined little woman , " said Mr. Jerrold , going away from the bedside , " have left me no rest . You have preached to me in actions of Faith , Hope , and Charity , ever since I first knew you . Doctrinal arguments I should have regarded as mere priestly sophisms if I had never known you -- our good genius . " " Oh , Mr. Jerrold , " said May , deeply wounded in her humility , " the grace of our powerful God needed no such poor instrument as I. His ways and designs are wonderful , and the operations of his divine mercy past all human comprehension . Give him the glory for evermore ! " CHAPTER XIX . CONCLUSION . Mr. Fielding was alone in his office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , pouring over Blackstone 's views on certain questions of equity , sat the lawyer at his desk , with a look of wisdom supernal . The door opened , but it did not disturb him . " Good morning , Mr. Fielding ! " said a small voice , somewhere below him . " I am engaged ! " he growled . " But I have come on legal business , " persisted the voice . " Who in the world are you -- a kobold -- or -- or -- May Brooke ! What on earth brought you here ? " he exclaimed , pushing back his glasses . " I have come about that will of my uncle 's , sir , " said May , demurely . " Come to your senses at last , " said the lawyer , chuckling with triumph . " I wish to take the most decided measures to set aside my uncle 's first will , having in my possession the most decided proof that I did not burn the last one , " she said , in her quiet way . " Proof , eh ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ? " " I should think so . But I can impart nothing more on the subject until you promise me , on your word of honor , to ask me no questions . I will promise you , on the other hand , to tell you all that is necessary on the subject , " said May , earnestly . " Heaven save us , when women begin with law ! My dear little foolish child , I am not the Law ; I am only its minister , and am bound , under oath , to perform its functions faithfully , " said Mr. Fielding , opening his eyes wide with astonishment at May 's strange proposition . " All of which I am perfectly aware ; but as your honor , or the honor of the law will not be in the least involved in this affair , I must persevere in my request . " " You 'll have your way there 's not the slightest doubt -- if you can get it . But ca n't you trust my discretion -- my judgment -- my -- my ahem ! friendship for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trust to nothing but a promise such as I require from you ; a promise which , if you knew all , you would voluntarily , from the best and most generous impulses of your heart , offer , " said May , standing up on a chair , that she might converse more at her ease , by bringing her face to a level with his . " I will promise this , and no more , " he replied , after thinking some minutes . " If , on producing your proof , I find it irrefragable , and can proceed in this matter without carrying it to court , or bringing in additional counsel -- that is , if I can manage it all myself , which I doubt , I will be silent . Men -- even lawyers , are not apt to die of ungratified curiosity . Will that answer you , ma'am ? " " I think so , " said May , after some deliberation . " Now produce your proof ? " " Here it is , sir . Here is my uncle 's will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proof sufficient , " said May , spreading out the lost will before him . But such was his surprise , and so great his eagerness to take it to the window to examine it , that he upset his desk , and losing his balance , plunged head foremost after it , and lay amidst the ruins covered with books , ink , and papers . " Indeed , sir , I hope you are not hurt , and beg of you to excuse me , " said May , trying to raise him up , while she laughed until tears ran down her cheeks . " There , sir , sit in the arm-chair , and let me wipe the ink from your face . " " Let the ink be , May . Only tell me how this will has been so unexpectedly recovered , for it is , I am willing to swear on the Holy Evangely , the identical one I drew up the day your uncle died , " he said , quite unruffled by the accident , and examining the document with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked May , gravely . " Perfectly , " he replied . " Then I can only tell you that it is a case of conscience which I am not at liberty to reveal ; indeed , I would rather tear that will into fragments than reveal its history . Heaven has interposed in answer to prayer in this matter ; an immortal soul has been led back to God . Justice is satisfied . The widow , the orphan , the destitute will be comforted --  " " And you will be as rich as Croesus ! " said Mr. Fielding , with a delighted look . " Oh , sir ! Oh , Mr. Fielding , what shall I do ? " exclaimed May , bursting into a fit of crying . " What is the matter ? What in the world are you crying about ? " " I do n't want to be rich , sir ; indeed , I never thought of myself . Oh , dear ! I shall be so trammelled , so tempted with all this . I do n't want it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want , boy ? " said Mr. Fielding angrily to a boy , who was standing at the door , laughing immoderately , though in a suppressed manner . " I have a note from Father Fabian , sir , " said the urchin , who gave him the note , and rushed out of the office , while his laughter , unsuppressed , made the street echo with its mirthful sound . Mr. Fielding tore open the note , and read :  --  " DEAR SIR : I find that it will be impossible for me to see you , as I wished to do , to-day . Ere this you have been informed , no doubt , by May Brooke of the recovery of the lost will . I can only say , with the permission of the penitent , who , through the fear of the Judgment of Almighty God , and a sincere desire for salvation , restored it ; that it is the same which you drew up the day Mr. Stillinghast was taken ill ; which declaration has been made to me under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , feel quite safe in making such business arrangements in connection with it as your discretion may suggest . " Very sincerely yours , " STEPHEN FABIAN . " " Of course , " said the lawyer , looking hurt , " it must be a most delicate case where such secrecy is observed . But one can not control his suspicions . " Just then Mr. Jerrold came in . He looked so little like a man that was going to lose the bulk of a princely fortune , that Mr. Fielding was amazed -- so amazed , that he could not imagine the cause of Mr. Jerrold 's laughter , who , although highly diverted at the grave lawyer 's blackened visage , endeavored in the most polite manner to suppress it . " He does n't know the will is found , " thought Mr. Fielding . " I have called , Mr. Fielding , to say that I am ready to give an account of the stewardship of Mr. Stillinghast 's property , which I have managed for the last nine months . My wife and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is genuine , and are too happy to see every thing restored to its equilibrium , to wish an hour 's delay in resigning all right and title to every thing except what is legally and honestly ours . " " Give me your hand , Mr. Jerrold . I honor your sentiments , and the prompt and honorable manner with which you meet this emergency , " said honest Mr. Fielding . " Take May home , and comfort her between you all , for the poor child is breaking her heart because she is rich . " And so it was settled . After receiving with true humility the Sacraments of the Church , Helen , so altered and changed in all her views of life and eternity , accompanied her husband to Europe . They spent the winter in Rome , where , among other converts , who made their abjuration of error and first communion at the " Gesu , " was an American gentleman named Jerrold . We may easily imagine who this Jerrold was . As to May , with the advice of Father Fabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wealth , she became gradually reconciled to the idea of being rich , because it afforded her an unfailing source of happiness in the reflection that she could now , in an extended view , become the benefactor of her kind . And from that day to this she has been the busiest -- the most untiring -- the most loving friend of the poor and afflicted . Decorating the sanctuary -- visiting the widow and orphan -- relieving distresses , not only by alms , but by words of cheer -- raising up the fallen , and soothing the broken-hearted , was the business of her life ; a business sweetened by such ample consolations , that she sometimes dreaded lest she should seek more her own comfort than the kingdom of heaven . And then she often paused , and wondered and feared , because no wild torrents swept across her way , and no ruggedness wounded her feet in life 's pathway . But she need not . The love of God -- a perfect charity , smoothed and brightened all . Where others would have made gloom , she made sunshine ; where others found the waters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the divine will . And better than all , her practical works of charity were continually adding members to the Church of Christ . But we must bid her adieu . She is growing old , but her step is light , and her cheeks still tinted with the hue of health ; and , perchance , in some future sketch of life , we may meet her again in her ceaseless round of charity . Helen was one of her consolations . A truly Christian wife and mother ; though timid and humble in her spiritual life , her unobtrusive piety , amidst temptation and worldly associations , made her an example and edification to all who knew her . Mr. Fielding , always devoted to May , and admiring the indomitable and cheerful energy of her character , was at last persuaded that , as there is but one God , so there was but ONE FAITH , and ONE BAPTISM , the fruits of which he sought with great humility and steadfastness . We regret to add , that the benevolent and warm-hearted Mrs. Tabb was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be saved , that she easily fell in with the New Light of the day -- Spiritualism ; and got her head so filled with " circles , " and " progression " and " manifestations , " that not recognizing the demoniac origin of it all , she became hopelessly insane . Mrs. Jerrold , enraged at the loss of Mr. Stillinghast 's fortune , and the conversion of her son and Helen , retired to the " Cedars , " where between " whist " and opium she drags out a lengthened and miserable existence -- refusing all spiritual aid , and denouncing May in no measured terms , as the cause and prime mover of all her reverses . We should like to have told all this in our own way , but our limits , already transgressed , warn us to silence , while the night-lamp , burning low in its socket , and the watch ticking faintly , like the last pulses of the dying , tell us , in emphatic language , that the " good-night " hour has come . THE END .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
