He possessed for this purpose one great qualification which had beea wanting to his father ,  - -  he was really and thoroughly a Spaniard . Born and bred in Flanders , Charles V. was at first , and long remained , a Fleming . When he ascended the throne of Spain , great and general was the irritation against his Flemish habits and predilections . At a later period , passing his life in constant intercourse with all the States of Europe , Charles V. became less Flemish , but not more Spanish . lie spoke German , French , Italian , Flemish just as well and as readily as the Spanish tongue ; and notwithstanding his retreat to the mountains of Estremadura , Flanders ever remained the home and country of his heart . Philip II . never had , either by birth or by affection , any other country than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life ; he never left it but upon the most pressing occasions ; he returned to it as soon as he could do so without extreme political peril ; and he constantly evaded , during the last thirty-nine years of his reign , the reasons and the entreaties which summoned him to other parts of his dominions. lie knew neither the German nor the Flemish languages ; indifferently the Italian and the French . The Spanish was almost his only tongue , as Spain was his favorite abode . lie found pleasure and confidence among Spaniards only . Between their faith and his faith-between their manners and his manners-between their tastes and his tastes  --  the harmony became every day more complete . Spaniards alone were summoned to his councils at Madrid , even to conduct the affair* of his other possessions ; and when , in 1559 , at the States-General of the Low Countries assembled at Ghent , the Flemings asked him to send away the Spanish troops and Cardinal Granvelle , because they were foreigners , he reje4ed their prayer with the ungracious reply : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain and for its Sovereign , what elements were these of strength and of success ! What pJedges of a powerful and glorious future ! The condition of the Spanish monarchy in the middle of the sixteenth century will appear still more advantageous if it be compared to that of the two monarchies with 579 which its relations were most frequent and most important-that of France and that of England . Francis I. had been succeeded on the throne of France by a feeble prince ,  --  . rash , vain , equally ready to plunge into great undertakings and to recoil before obstacles or reverses . Charles V. , before his abdication , had taken care to insure to his son , by the truce of Vaucelles , concluded for five years , an interval of repose not less needed by France than by Spain ; but very few months had elapsed-perhaps , indeed , the negotiation of the truce was hardly terminatedwhen henry II . allied himself to the Pope and the Sultan to make war on the most Catholic King ; and by his orders the truce was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Flanders by Admiral de Coligny . On every point the fortune of war turned against France ; in spite of the skill of Guise , the veteran experience of Montmorency , the heroism of Coligny , the baitles of St. Quentin and Gravelines were lost ; St. Quentin was taken by the Spaniards ; Italy was evacuated by the French ; and , after two years of a ruinous contest , in which the recovery of Calais was the only stroke of enterprise and of success , henry II . hastened to conclude the inglorious peace of Catean Cambresis , and to promise in marriage to the Infant Don Carlos , of tragical celebrity , that daughter of France who was some months afterwards to wed , in lieu of the Infant , Philip himself , a widower by the death of Queen Mary of England . The affairs of France were not more ably or more prosperously conducted at home than abroad . The Reformation was rapidly spreading there - not enough to secure its triumph , but enough to prolong the contest and to survive its defeat . Persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor-faith spoke louder than patriotism-Catholics and Prote*ants invoked alike foreign aid . The Catholics dispatched frequent messages to Philip II. , the bearers of their apprehen* sions and their entreaties . The Spanish ambassador in Paris , Perrenot de Chantonnay , the brother of Cardinal Granvelk* , denounced to his master the weakness of Catherine de Medicis towards the Protestants . " You may reckon , " wrote he , " that whatever is done at Geneva , as well in the pulpit as in the administration of the sacra // qwq // eluded at the Hague , under the name of a twelve years ' truce , to save the last pang of royal pride , a treaty which was in fact a recognition of the independence of Holland and a peace . The other provinces of Flanders had indeed remained faithful to the Romish Church , but they were not the less alienated from the Spanish monarchy ; Philip , not being able to govern them as he wished , desisted from governing them altogether , and handed over the sovereignty of the country to his eldest daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince who had been a cardinal , but who shook off the ties of the Church to become a sovereign . In 1599 the Infanta and her husband reigned in Brussels , under the joint title of " the Archdukes . " Thus the country of Charles V. ,  --  those magnificent provinces for which Philip II . had labored incessantly for forty years ,  --  where he had wrought so many acts of iniquity and of horror ,  --  where he had inflicted such incalculable sufferings and roused such indowiitable hatreds ,  --  were , at the close of his long career , either lost altogether to the crown of Spain , or transferred to the German branch of his house , with the single reservation that they were to revert to the royal line in the event of a failure of issue from their new rulers . Abroad , and especially in his relations with France , the designs and the efforts of Philip II . had proved equally vain . He had ardently fomented in France the two curses of religious persecution and of civil war . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factious plots to such an excess , that the Pope himself , and that Pope Sixtus V. , repudiated his policy , and said to Louis of Gonzaga , I ) uc de Nevers : " In what school have you learnt that it is well to form parties against the will of their lawful sovereign ? I am much afraid that things may be brought to such a pass , that the King of France , Catholic as he is , may be compelled to call for the aid of heretics to rescue him from the tyranny of the Catholics . " Whilst Henry III . was still alive , Philip , in his eagerness to exclude Ilenry IV . from the throne , had concluded a formal treaty with the Guises , by which they mutually bound themselves that " none should ever reign in France either himself a heretic , or who being king should concede public impunity to heretics . " After the assassination of Henry LII. , Philip , burning with the two-fold ardor of secular ambition and religious zeal , had recommended the party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella , and he ordered the Duke of Parma to enter France with his army to support the Ligue at all hazards-even at the risk of losing the Low Countries . The Duke of Parma by two able campaigns did succeed in checking the progress of Henry IV. , and still held the crown of France on the cast of a die . At the States General , assembled at Paris in 1593 , Philip II . felt the full extent of his power ; the faction of the " Seize** had formally offered the throne to himself or to some one of his descendants . Yet but a few months after this explosion of Spanish fanaticism , Henry IV . entered Paris the bearer of victory and peace . Two years later , Mayenne and the Ligue made their submission . In the following year Philip himself entered into negotiation with Henry of Bourbon ; and on the 2d of May , 1598 , the ambassadors of Spain signed the peace of Vervins , two weeks after henry IV . had promulgated liberty of conscience to the Protestants by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but greatly in advance of the prevailing spirit of those times , and which was the signal stamp and seal of the defeat of Philip II. , the confusion of his maxims , and the ruin of his pretensions . In his relations with England , the King had undergone reverses , not more bitter , perhaps , but even more direct and more terrible . His plots with Mary Stuart , sometimes designed to marry her to the Infant Don CurIos , sometimes to deliver her from captivity , and to place her on the throne of England , " whether Queen Elizabeth died a natural death or by any other kind of chance , " had ended in a more tragical and disastrous failure than his French intrigues with the house of Guise . He had seen the most powerful are mament which had ever sailed from the ports of Spain  --  the Invincible Armada itselfscattered and destroyed in a few days before the blasts of the tempest and the valor of English seamen . English cruisers had on several occasions ravaged the coast of ' Spain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cadiz , Philip being unable to repel these attacks or to avenge these insults . Nay , it was with repugnance that // Elizabeth consented , on the solicitation of Henry IV. , to join in the peace of Vervins ,  --  a peace far more necessary to Philip than to herself , and far more eagerly desired by Spain than by England . Scarcely was this peace signed when the King died , mutilated in his possessions , defeated in his political and religious ambition , humbled in his pride , leaving the Spanish monarchy enfeebled and depressed . Its neighbors , who had been his obsequious all.ies or his timid antagonists , were now its conquerors ; and the contested acquisition of the crown of Portugal was the sole compensation which remained for so many losses and reverses . To this had Philip II. , in a reign of forty-two years , brought the monarchy of Charles V. Was , then , this decline an accident in the destinies of Spain , the fault of an individual , the result of the mistaken but transient policy of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our survey ; and as we have already passed from the accession to the death of Phil-ip , let us descend from the death of Philip to the present time . The great witnesses of history are events examined by the light of ages . What has the monarchy of Charles V. become since the commencement of that decay already so perceptible under the sceptre of his son ? Beyond the confines of Europe , in America , there is no more Spain ; all her conquests have shaken off her yoke , all her establishments have escaped from her authority . One splendid possession alone remains to her ,  --  the Island of Cuba , the queen of the Antilles ; but that possession is already precarious , day by day more coveted and more assailed by the United States , neighbors as powerful as they are ambitious , as daring as they are powerful , and which pursue the track of conquest like those mighty rivers that extend their course and overflow their boundaries by the incalculable volume of their waters . The Spanish colonies , now severed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States have become to England ,  --   --  a wide and wealthy market ,  - -  a swarm of active and industrious settlers who have left the hive , but who , in spite of their rivalry , are still united to their parent State by habit , by interest , and by conformity of tsstes , in close , manifold , and productive intercourse . The colonies of Spain have sought to become free States . But Spain has given them none of the principles , the traditions , and the examples of liberty . They have conquered their independence only to fall into a state of annrchy ,  --  a state of anarchy not less unfruitful than their former servitude . The most subversive notions , the most uncontrolled passions , are propagated and indulged without restraint and without success in the immense dismembered territories of what was once the Spanish empire . Catholics in name , these nations are infested by the excess of licentiousness and infidelity ; they are the chief consumers of the cynical productions of the profligate incredulity of the last century , the refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend and maintain her faith as ill as she taught them to establish and to exercise their own freedom . In the North of Africa , whither she had first driven and afterwards pursued the Moo ? s , Spain has long since retired before the descendants of that conquered people ; the conquests of Charles V. and Cardinal Ximenes have been abandoned ; nothing remains to her on that coast but one or two miserable receptacles for outlaws and convicts . Upon the native soil of Spain , in that magnificent peninsula which is bounded by the Pyrenees , the Mediterranean , and the Atlantic Ocean , the prosperity and grandeur of the monarchy have shared the same fate . Two royal races , once the proudest rivals in glory and in power , the house of Austria and the house of Bourbon , have occupied that throne ; both of them have left the Spanish nation in weakness and in apathy ; the descendants of Louis XIV . degenerated at , Madrid as rapidly as the descendants of Charles V. Under *their administration Spain has witnessed the decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fleets , of her finances , of her literature as well as of her policy , of the mind as well as of the State . The well-meant but incoherent and incomplete reforms attempted by Charles III . disguised for a moment the ruin they failed to arrest . The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have been to Spain two centuries of servile government , of disorganization , of waning life . Has , then , this state of intellectual and 682 // political torpor in the government and in the ' nation preserved either one or the other from revolutions ? Has stagnation secured durability ? Does the soil , which has ceased to bear its increase , forget the shocks of the earthquake ? Has the trance of Spain been a period of repose ? The world knows it is not so . No sooner has an opportunity occurred , no sooner has some great blast from without swept over Spain , than the daring spirit of the age manifests itself as abruptly as if it had never ceased to haunt the nation ; there , as elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous desires with extravagant designs ; not less presumptuous , not less ambitious , not less licentious than in those communities where it has long extended its authority and established its empire . No sooner had Spain been roused from her torpor by the call of national honor and of war , than she flung herself into the track of revolutions ; her ancient manners , her ancient attachment to the Throne and to the Church are not yet altogether lost ; and they have more than once rescued her from the brink of the precipice ; they must still play a considerable part in herdestinies ; but they have to failed either to satisfy or to restr*in her ; they have failed to prevent the irruption of the revolutionary spirit ; they will fail to overcome it ; and if Spain emerges from the perils that surround her , she will certainly not return to that authority , alike oppressive and ineffectual , which Philip II . and his successors had imposed upon the nation . Whilst Spain has fallen into this state of apathy , which has not saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those neighboring States which were in the sixteenth century her subjects or her rivals ? What has been the growth , and what have been the results of that growth , in the destinies of the Low Countries , of France , and of England ? Imagine Philip II . returning to Brussels to contemplate the aspect of Belgium-the Belgium of our own times . Instead of those subject provinces , eternally divided and mutually jealous in their com*non dependence , he would find a kingdom of no very ancient date , but already consolidated by trials of no ordinary gravity , and a Protestant sovereign who has not thought it necessary to 583 * abjure the creed in which he was born , but who brings up his children in the faith of Rome , surrounded by the confidence , the respect , and the loyal attachment of a Catholic people ; he would find the most entire religious liberty and toleration , proved by the continual and unrestrained expression of different forms of belief and of the fervor of different opinions , with their respective . claims and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flanders still in full vigor and still dear to the population ; a vast deal of political freedom , exercised with judgment and moderation in spite of the awkard institutions of the country ; an immense amount of industry and wealth diffused through all classes of society , and promoting the development of the intelligence as well as the prosperity of the nation . From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century what changes have been wrought ! what obstacles surmounted ! what improvements perfected ! Philip would look on such a state of things with extreme surpvise ; scarcely would he resign himself to believe what he must see before him . If he passed from Brussels to the hague he would again encounter a fresh source of astonishment and disappointment . He would see in that spot his oldest and most tenacious enemy  --  the house of Nassau , tranquilly established on a throne , surrounded and supported by all the liberties , whether ancient or modern , of that country . The Protestant Low Countries have triumphantly survived , in the course of the last three centuries , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican form of government , they conquered , with infinite toil and sacrifices , the freedom of their faith and the independence of their government ; abroad , they successfully resisted the greatest sovereigns of Europe ,  --  the house of Austria and the house of Bourbon ,  --  Philip II . and Louis XIV. ; at home , they have outlived the miserable dissensions of the Commonwealth , the furious rivalry of those parties to both of which they owed their salvation ,  --  that of a republican aristocracy , and that of a family of popular and patriotic princes . These labors being achieved , these . perils being surmounted , when the events of another age opened before them , and the revolutions of the great European community pressed upon Holland , that an- // cient Republic assumed the form of a constitutional monarchy ; neither stubborn to retain , nor prompt to discard , its former condition , but able to provide for the new exigencies of its situation by employing the different elements of its past history . For a people which has played a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult or more meritorious than a transformation thus modestly accomplished , with no defeat and no sacrifice of dignity to any party , under the influence of an enlightened sense of national interest and by a great act of public reason . France , indeed , has suffered in these three centuries transformations far different , far deeper , far more poignant , than those of Holland . That country has desired or accepted rules of government the most various ; monarchy and republicanism , absol.utism and constitutional government , the despotism of a man and the despotism of an assembly , a supremacy in Europe sometimes earned by war , sometimes exercised in peace , the empire of the sword and the empire of opinion . But in none of these conditions has France found rest ; none of them has sufficed to content or to arrest her ; she has tried and traversed them all as experiments , soon to be cast aside with disgust ; and she has exhibited to Europe the spectacle of a nation alternately ardent and indifferent , fit and unfit for political life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conquest , incapable of any lasting possession . Yet upon a closer and more attentive examination of these vicissitudes and inconstancies of France , and of the revolutions of her government , it is not impossible to discover one desire , one hope , one national object still the same : though at times her course has been interrupted and that object thrown aside , it has never been completely forsaken , for it lived in the heart of the nation , even when no outward signs of activity disclosed its presence . In the sixteenth century , amidst the crimes and calamities of religious and civil war , the Chancellor de l'IIbpital , the President de Thou , the great judges of the land , the bourgeoisie of that age , were already bent on laying the foundations of a legal monarchy , and on securing the principal rights of personal freedom . In the seventeenth century the same design , enlarged to the limitation of the power of the Crown and to the introduction of a more popular element in the government , gave rise to the coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fronde-that strange mixture of selfishness and of sincerity , of frivolity and of bloodshed . Long after this design had miscarried , when Mazarin and Louis XIV . had secured the ascendancy of pure monarchy , a pious and illustrious prelate , a proud and honorable courtier , a virtuous heir to the Crown ,  --  Fenelon , St. Simon , and the Duc de Bourgogne-entertained a vision of reforming that monarchy for the honor of the aristocracy and the benefit of the nation . Reforms of a far bolder and broader nature became the fixed object and the passionate desire of the eighteenth century . The Revolution of 1789 was the result ; in other words , the old society of France was recast in the mould of democracy ; and this work , which was commenced under the name of constitutional monarchy , continued through all the crimes of the Republic , and was crowned by the glories of the Empire . After a quarter of a century of chaos and creation , of anarchy and despotism , of triumphs and of reverses ,  --  when France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repose which she herself desired , she found that repose under the shelter of constitutional monarchy , and she lived for thirty-four years in the enjoyment of its blessings , believing that she had at last obtained that free government which she had projected in 1789 . Plunged once more into anarchy , she eagerly accepted , to escape from fresh calamities , the alternative of a temperate despotism , sustained by an imperial dynasty and sanctioned by the suifrages of the people . But who shall venture to affirm that this is the termination of her political aberrations , or that she will not one day revert to the hopes and the experimcnt of free government , which she has already so often grasped , relinquished , and resumed with the same vivacity ? In a new preface which M. Guizot has recently added to the sixth edition of his " History of Civilization in France , " he describes in forcible and accurate language these characteristics of the history of hi* country : " France has undergone in the last fourteen centuries the most extraordinary altern // ations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she has never long renounced either order or liberty , the two conditions of the honor and the well-being of nations . That fact sheds a gleam of light over the gloom of our history . That fact tells us , that with all the errors and the crimes of these times , we are not such unexampled innovators or such idle dreamers as we are accused of being . The end we are pursuing is , in fact , the same which our forefathers pursued ; they too labored in their day to emancipate and to raise , both morally and materially , the different classes of our society ; they too aspired to insure , by free institutions and by the effectual participation of the nation in its government , the good conduct of public affairs , the rights and the liberties of individuals . And if they on many occasions tailed in this generous design , still have some strong and manly minds , patrician or plebeian , magistrates or common citizens , stood erect amidst the general prostration , maintainin* sound principles and lofty hopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no temple had yet been successfully raised about it . The confidence of these persevering champions of the good unfortunate cause has not been deceived ; that cause has not only survived its misfortunes , but in its own good time it breaks forth with greater energy and power . Time enlarges what it does not destroy . " Whatever may be the obscurity of the future in the political government of France , that nation has no cause to view it with excessive apprehension ; her past history may supply her with some consolations for the difficulties she encounters , and even for the failures , more or less protracted , she has to endure . There is more than one road which may lead nations to prosperity , civilization , and freedom . The road which France has taken is not the shortest or the surest ; but along that road she has seldom ceased to advance . Devustated as she had been in the sixteenth century by religious animosities and persecutions , she nevertheless resumed in the seventeenth century , under the hand of Henry IV . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every kind of activity , of progress , and of glory . Exhausted by the reverses , and instructed by the rapid decline of absolute monarchy , she cast herself with eager impetuosity , in the eighteenth century , upon the track of opposition , of reform , and of freedom there , too ' , in spite of her extravagant pretension and preposterous errors , she shone with no common intellectual lus tre , she extended over the world her opinions , her manners , and her influence , and she helped to prepare new destinies for the people of the earth  --  a nation full of vital strength , rushing onwards , rushing in the wrong direction , then suddenly perceiving her error , and changing her course ; or at other times motionless and apparently exhausted by her unprofitable search , but never resigned to impotence , finding in fresh efforts and fresh triumphs a compensation for her former failures-great , intelligent , and powerful , in spite of all her faults , and.destined to float after a hundred shipwrecks . The pol.itical life of England has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more fortunate , and more skilfully conducted than that of France . England has achieved the task which France has vainly attempted  --  the establishment of a free government . That task has cost us two revolutions , but these revolutions ( including even that of 1648 , in spite of its excesses ) werejn truth the development , not the interruption , of the faith , the spirit , and the institutions of this country . Both in 1640 and 1688 , the movement of the nation was essentially Protestant and Parliamentarian . Parliament had been for centuries , and Protestantism had already been for a hundred years , the heart of England . When the people of England changed their government , they did not break with the past ; and , far from abjuring their religion and their laws , they defended , established , and extended them more and more . The spirit of tradition has ever borne as large a part in our feelings and our actions as the spirit of innovation : and we owe to the combination and the equipoise of these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady progress of legal liberty , of moral and religious stability , and of bold and persevering activity , which has now established , for nearly two hundred years , the strength , the prosperity , the glory of England , amidst the convulsions and the efforts of the rest of Europe . We have exhausted our terms of comparison . We have drawn side by side at different neras of their greatness the contrasted destinies of the three great nations of Western Europe . Why then is Spain , which was so powerful precisely ' three hundred years ago , when in 1556 Ch*irles V. resigned his empire to Philip II. , so feeble at the present // time ? flow comes it to pass that France and England , following such different courses , and with such unequal success , have nevertheless both incessantly advanced and increased ? The problem is worthy of our examination , for events which embrace so large a portion of the world and of time , are the revelation of eternal laws and the sentence of Divine justice . The sixteenth century was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Middle Ages and the starting point of modern histoxy . The principles of th&amp;ught and action adopted at that period by the States of Europe have decided their fate . Neither intellect , nor energy , nor virtue , nor glory , were wanting to those Middle Ages , which were long so unjustly appreciated , and which have been in our own time not less unjustly vaunted or decried . The Middle Ages were a period of faith and of conviction , of robust activity and original inyention , fruitful in great things , in great men , and in courageous efforts for the freedom and progress of mankind : they fought out stoutly , and in spite of many obstacles , some of the great problems of humanity : in letters and the arts they sometimes touched the beautiful , often the sublime ; and , although they oppressed and humbled , they did not scorn , mankind . But , after several centuries of violent though monotonous fermentation , the great day of trial came upon the Middle Ages-that trial to which all the ages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be perpetual or fruitless ; organization must one day begin . The longer the society of the Middle Ages endured , the more deeply did the want of justice and of improvement , of order and of freedom , penetrate the strata of which that society was composed . The defects and abuses which lurk in all human affairs from their origin , or affect them by the injuries of time , broke forth at last at every stage of the social structure , in the Church as well as in the State . The society of the Middle Ages was urged to the work of organization and reform . The calls of interest and the claims of opinion , which had become more imperious or more exacting , summoned that society , whether feudal or municipal , lay or clerical , to assume a constitution , more regular and more stable , fitted to extend to all its members means of pro- congress and pledges of protection . In that effort the society of the Middle Ages perished , for it was incapable of regular organization and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether wanting . In the political sphere , kings and their councillors , the States General of France , the Cortes of Spain , the Parliaments of England , the Municipal Confederations of Italy , Flanders , and Germany-in the ecclesiastical sphere , popes and councils , bishops and friars , labored more than once , from the eleventh to the fifteenth century , for the redress of grievances , for the reformation of abuses , for the establishment of a regular government and an equitable authority over the civil and religious interests of Europe . Their efforts were vain . The tyrannical anarchy of the Middle Ages was untameable by man ; no creation could naturally arise from that social chaos . Nor is this result attributable solely to the rulers of the people in those ages , whether laymen or ecelesiastics , whether kings , popes , or nobles , or to their selfishness and their vices alone . This inaptitude and this absence of political organization were general in the Middle Ages , not less amongst the governed than amongst the governing order ; they were as manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Whatever be the cause , whoever be the actors , a certain amount of intelligence , of wisdom , of foresight , of judicious and persevering moderation , is an indispensable condition of success . That condition is as necessary to nations as to sovereigns  --  to the band of insurgents , as to their oppressor ; and in all the vicissitudes of public life sacrifices must be made and conditions accepted in the name of the public interest rightly understood . But in the Middle Ages neither the people , nor the sovereigns , nor the burgesses , nor the nobles , nor the laity , nor the clergy , were wise enough , or enlightened enough , or temperate enough , or patient enough to form a just estimate of this public interest rightly understood , extending over a wide range of territory and of time , to submit to its requirements , or to adapt their conduct to insure its triumph . Their epoch was one of impetuous instinct , of abrupt resolution , of precipitate action , of brutal force . The men of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a dark and narrow horizon-ill-acquainted , even the wis 586 // est of them , with the facts and obstacles they had to meet , failed in their political designs at least as much from ignorance as from crime their contracted views , their false notions , their misconceptions , and the mental twilight in which they lived , proved not less fatal to the attempted organization and reform of the Middle Ages , than the hostility of selfish interests or the tumult of malignant passions . The great event , commonly called the Revival of Letters , which happened in the fifteenth century , added fresh impediments to the organization and reform of the society of the Middle Ages . The resurrection of republican and pagan antiquity shook and troubled the Christian world . That array of great actions and great men , so different from those of the existing generation-that galaxy of the recovered works of poets , philosophers , historians , and orators , so superior , at least in the perfection of external form , to the works of their own time  --  the novelty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spells of no common power , intoxicated the upper classes of that ardent and unrefined society , who eagerly accepted this fresh excitement of intellectual gratification as a compensation for the burdens and the evils they had- to bear . This trial was inevitable . The nations and races of the world which have filled the age with their lives and works can not remain unknown or unnoticed by those which come after them . Providence itself watching over the growth of mankind , forbids so great a waste of genius and of power . It is the mission and the glory of different peoples and of d*ifferent acras to pass onwards the chain of their history and their being , and reciprocally to act on those they can not know . To deplore the Revival of Letters , which gave us back the Greece and the Rome of antiquity , because the European society of the Middle Ages was struck and shattered by this revolution , would be an act of retrospective and retro-active barbarism . This was one of the phases through which the society of Christendom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of Paganism fifteen hundred years before , Christianity was not now to quail before its spectre . Taking an extended view of history and of times the Reviva of Letters neither corrupted nor impaired Christian civilization , but , on the con-687 trary , gave it a broader and mightier impulsion to new and abundant increase . Yet at the moment when this event took place , it aggravated the disorder and the difficulties of Europe ; it cast doubts and perplexities upon the faith and the usages of Christendom ; and it inspired many of the most eminent men of that age with the discouraging and enervating feeling of contempt for the country and the time in which they lived . The human mind became more curious and more sceptical , whilst the manners of society were relaxed and enervated . The progress of this intellectual activity and appetite rendered that reformation , which the Middle Ages had vainly attempted to effect , at once more necessary and more difficult of execution . The world , however , stops not , though it cease to be guided ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy its desires . Just as the remains of Pagan antiquity were again disclosed in all their splendor , just as the spirit of the Middle Ages had failed to reconstitute the modern society of Christian nations , the sixteenth century opened by two mighty events , - events correlative though distinct ,  --  the Reformation of the Church and the foundation of the great Monarchies of Europe . Of the three great States whose policy and whose destiny it is here our object to characterize and to compare , Spain was the best prepared and the most resolved to accept one of these events and to reject the other . Monarchy had triumphed in Spain more completely and more gloriously than in any other part of Europe . By marriage or by eonqvest Ferdinand and Isabella had reduced the Peninsula to a single kingdom . Without immoderate violence , without revolting oppression , in the name and in the interest of public order , of justice , and of the common good , the authority of the Crown was already almost as much concentrated as the political condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve and to shine , without resistance , in the army and the court . Indeed , the nobles did not always take their seats in the Cortes , to which the Crown summoned in preference the delegates of the towns  --  a loyal and docile class provided they were suffered to retain their corporate privileges , and were not called upon for too much money . The burgesses of Spain in the fifteenth century // showed so little seal for a share in the government of the State , that considerable towns-such as Burgos and Toledo-solicited the King to pay their deputies ; and many others , which enjoyed the right of representation in the Cortes , made over that right to the representatives of some neighboring city whom they charged to attend and vote on their behalf . The deputies of Salamanca are said to have represented five hundred towns and fourteen hundred villages . The whole province of Galicia sent no other representatives than those of the little town of Zamora ; and when in 1506 several cities claimed the privilege of representation , led on that occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had constantly exercised the franchise opposed their demand , maintaining that by the ancient usage of the realm the right of representation was confined to eighteen cities of the kingdom . In opposition to popular claims thus limited and humble , Ferdinand and Isabella had found it an easy task to assert the plenitude and the independence of their royal authority . The Spanish monarchy of the fifteenth century had moreover an advantage which has often been absent when it was most required : the two sovereigns were able and respected ; one of them beloved by her subjects to a singular degree , and both of them faithfully and gloriously served by their principal ministers . Ferdinand of Arragon , though wanting in greatness of mind and splendor of ' genius , without rectitude in his foreign relations , without fidelity in his domestic life , was nevertheless a serious , laborious , sensible , moderate , frugal , and just prince , whose ambition did not exceed his strength , and who was little wont to abuse success . Isabella of Castille is of all the queens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the fairest reputation of virtue and the highest mark of ability ; her great and conscientious character rose to enterprise and boldness in the hour of need , whilst she followed the modest course of a woman 's life in the ordinary circumstances of her existence : she was at once dignified and affectionate ; faithful to her friends and to her duties ; and in her somewhat difficult relations with the King , her husband , she combined the submission of a wife with the independence of a queen . She it was who comprehcnced and constantly supported-sometimes with great difficult*y - Christopher Columbus , Gonsalvo of Cordova , and Cardinal Ximenes , three of the noblest and most honest subjects who ever served a Crown-three heroes under the tonsure , under the buckler , and in the solitudes of the Atlantic-all three alike unchangeable in their loyalty , although ill-treated after the death of Isabella by the master to whom they had given , one the New World , another the supremacy of Italy , the third the outworks of Islam on the African coast . Such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feudal system-such was the array which surrounded that throne . But if Spain at the opening of the sixteenth century was prepared ahd zealous for the establishment of a great monarchy , she was utterly opposed to a religious reformation . The contest with the infidel had been for eight centuries the thought , the passion , the task , the glory of the Spanish nation . And in that nation the infidel was not this or that sect of Christians , this or that tribe of Spaniards , but the Arab , the Moor , aliens in race as well as in creed , enemies as well as miscreants , the conquered conquerors of a former age . All these religious and patriotic feelings , all these incentives to hatred and to war , rose at the name of unbelievers , and still glowed in Spanish hearts when the unbelievers became Protestants and heretics . It was against the Moors and the Jews , against the followers of Mahomet and the murderers of Christ , that Ferdinand and Isabella kindled the fires of persecution , and established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country and their Church . A task somewhat dissimilar , but equally glorious , seemed to await them when Columbus had opened the gates of the New World . The Catholic kings were called upon to bring within the pale of Christianity and of their empire , those idolatrous nations whose very names and numbers were still unknown . To Queen Isabella especially this enterprise became a passion . Yet , ere long , her pious ambition was crossed by fresh perplexities ; the fierce cupidity to which the Indians fell a prey , the atrocities committed to plunder and to convert them , excited scruples in her mind , which she expressed but a few days be-588 // fore her death , and in the terms of her will , with pathetic solicitude . Ferdinand , indeed , less scrupulous than the Queen , but not less wary , had treated the Moors with care and forbearance long after their defeat . Several of his ordinances prove that as late a 1499 the treaties which had secured to them the free exercise of their religion and their laws within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few scruples of conscience and a few precautions of policy do not long resist the authority of a principle and the impulse of a passion proclaimed and upheld by all the institutions and powers of the State . When the crown of Ferdinand and Isabella passed to their grandson , the unity of the Catholic faith imposed by political force , without distinction of persons or of means , was already the law and the will of Spain , both of the nation and of its rulers . When Charles V. inherited from his grandfather this creed and this law , with the title of the Catholic kings , he found himself constrained to adopt equal , or rather far greater , measures of forbearance . The Moors of Spain were enemies long since exhausted and vanquished ,  --  the Protestants of Germany were adversaries in the pride of youth and the ardor of prdgress . By the extent and variety of his possessions and his policy , Charles F. was successively and even simultaneously engaged in Italy against France and the Pope , in Germany against the Lutherans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks , and everywhere in a series of variable and inconsistent contests which never allowed him to concentrate on one point , or on a single object , his movements and his forces . Though a Catholic and a despot , he was more politic than fanatical ; and his judicious and clearsighted comprehension sometimes taught him to yield to necessity , and even to pause in the execution of his fondest designs . In struggling against the Reformation he affected to act on political grounds , and not to resist religious freedom absolutely and in itself . He had Protestant allies against the Protestant League ; and Cardinal Farnese quitted the Imperial camp with indignation because the service of the conventicle was performed beside the sacrifice of the mass . The history of Charles V. in Germany is but a long series of half measures , of temporiza 589 tion , of concessions , of wavering , of compromises ; and , after all , it was upon the basis of two great acts accepted by that prince  --  the Treaty of Passau in 1552 , and the recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , that *s to say , religious liberty among the States , was first established in Germany . But in his hereditary dominions-in the Low Countries , in Italy , and , above all , in Spain-Charles V. avenged himself for this extorted hypocrisy , and rigorously applied the principle of unity and constraint in matters of faith . He urged that principle still more absolutely from his cell in the monastery of Yuste . When released from the fatigues and the responsibility of power , he could only give , in the name of his conscience and his conviction , the advice of a free but not dispassionate spectator . Having learnt in May , 1558 , that the doctrines of the Reformation had penetrated into Andalusia and Castille , he instantly wrote to his daughter , the Infanta Dofia Juana , regent of the kingdom in the absence of Philip II . " Believe mae , my daughter , that this affair causes me no small care , and brings me more grief than I can express , to see that these kingdoms were ' perfectly tranquil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King and my own , but that now I am come hither to enter into my rest and to serve our Lord , so monstrous and insolent an abomination should break forth in my presence and your own , when I well know what toils and grief I have endured on this account in Germany , to the not small risk of my salvation . Assuredly , if I were not certain that you and the members of the Council who are about you will extirpate this evil to the root , 1 know not if I could resolve to remain here and not go forth myself to remedy the evil . " * Four months afterwards , and a few days before his death , whilst adding a codicil to his will , he addressed to the King , his son , these last words : " I command him as a father , and upon the obedience due to me , carefully . to pursue and chastise the heretics with all the severity and vigor which theircrime deserves , without allowing any guilty person to escape , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any man : and in order that these my intentions may have their full * " Recuell de Lettres inddites tirdes des Archives de Simancas , " par M.

Brussels : 1864. // and entire effect , I recommend him everywhere to protect the holy office of the Inquisition ; thus will he deserve that our Lord will insure the prosperity of his reign , will guide him in all his doings , and protect him against his enemies for my greater consolation . " * Philip obeyed the hehest of his father to a degree which Charles V. himself would doubtless never have attained . The chastisement and extirpation of heresy ,  --  the maintenance , the restoration or the extension , by fire and by the sword , of the unity of the faith ,  --  was the object of his constant and devouring anxiety ,  --  the rule and standard of his policy abroad as well as at home , in his family as well as in his dominions . There lay his entire history . We care not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two scenes may be recorded which disclose , with a malignant brightness , what the mind of such a man3 and the government of such a King , became under the sway of the fixed and fatal idea that possessed him . On the 29th of August , 1559 , Philip returned from Flanders to Spain ; it was the first time he had set foot in that kingdom since his father had resigned the sceptre to his grasp . He was in that flush of fortune and of satisfaction which Providence not unfrequently bestows on new-made kings . The war he had been compelled to wage in Italy against the Pope himself , sorely in his own despite , but from which the fiery Italian patriotism of Paul IV . had not allowed him to escape , had just been happily and moderately brought to a close . Against the King of France , his two generals , Emmanuel Phillibert of Savoy and the Count Egmont , had just gained the brilliant victories of St. Quentin and Gravelines . He had employed this success to conclude the peace of Cateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Princess Elizabeth de Valois , a charming girl of fifteen , who was to arrive a few months later in the Spanish territories . To celebrate meanwhile these auspicious events Philip resolved to hold a high festival with his people and his court . On the 8th of October , barely six weeks after the King 's arrival , an amphitheatre was raised upon the public square , before the Church of St. Francis at Valladolid . At six o clock in the morning the bells of all * Sandoval , " Vida del Emperador Carlos V. en Yuste , " vol . II . p. 829. the churches pealed forth . A solemn procession issued from the prisons of the Inquisition . Thirty prisoners came first ; by the side of each of them two familiars of the Holy Office ; and to fourteen of the number two attendant friars . Of these prisoners some were simply clad in black ; others were muffled in a sack of yellow frieze , their heads covered with a conical cap , and upon this strange garb figures of devils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the magistrates of the city , the civil judges , the clergy , the hidalgos on their steeds ; and these were followed by the members of the Sacred Office itself , preceded by the arms of the Inquisition blazoned on a standard of crimson damask . Behind this procession rushed a mighty multitude of people , assembled from far and near to see the king on his throne and the heretics at the stake . It is stated by an eye-witness that not less than 200,000 persons were gathered together that day at Valladolid . The Inquisitors took their seats . Upon a platform raised hard by , the king sate , accompanied by his sister , the Infanta Dolia Juana , his son Don Carlos , his nephew Alexander Farnese , afterwards Prince of Parma , and followed by the foreign ambassadors and the nobles of his court . Fronting this royal gallery rose a gigantic scaffold , to be seen from every part of that vast square . The assembly being complete , the Bishop of Zamora preached a sermon , called the Sermon of the Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferdinand Valdes , Archbishop of Seville , approached the king , who rose from his throne , and drew his sword . " Your majesty swears , " said the prelate , " by the cross of that sword now resting in your royal hands , to give to the Holy Office of the Inquisition all necessary aid against heretics , and apostates , and all those who may favor the same , and to cause whomsoever shall act or speak against the Faith to be sought out and brought to justice . " " I swear , " replied Philip , making the sign of the Cross , which was instantly repeated by the whole assembly . The thirty prisoners were brought forth . Their sentence was read . Sixteen of them were reconciled ,  --  that is , condemned either to a perpetual or a temporary imprisonment , with the confiscation of all their property . These knelt down and abjured their errors . The 590 // fourteen others , being condemned to death , were immediately consigned to the stake . Those from whom the horror of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a speedier death by strangulation before their bodies were cast into the flames . Of the whole number two only sternly refused every form of recantation ,  --  a Dominican monk , one Domingo Roxas , son of the Marquis of Posa , and a Florentine gentleman , Don Carlos di Seso , who had long been a favorite of Charles V. As they mounted the pile of faggots , the Dominican sought to address the people : the King indignantly ordered him to be gagged , and the gag closed his mouth till his last moment , being burnt with the victim . The Florentine Seso , as he passed before the royal balcony on his way to the stake , exclaimed , " Can your majesty attend in person to see your innocent subjects burnt before your eyes ? " - " If it were my own son , replied Philip , " I would bring the wood to burn him an he were such a wretch as thou art . " Having begun at six o'clock in the morning , the ceremony was not terminated until two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immolation of Protestants . Such were , in the most brilliant days of that reign , the festivities of Philip II. , and such were the graces with which he mingled in the pastime . As he acted , felt , and spoke on that 8th of October , 1559 , so he acted , felt , and spoke during his whole life . War on heretics or the pursuit of heretics was his work ; the autos-de-fe ' were his triumphs . " Better not reign at all , " said he , " than to reign over heretics . I would sacrifice a hundred thousand lives , if I had them , rather than submit to a single change in matters of religion . " When Count Egmont came to Madrid in 1564 , to present the remonstrances of the nobility of Flanders against his rigor , Philip convoked an assembly of theologians , and laid before them the state of the Low Countries , which were grievously agitated and loud in their demands for freedom of conscience . Upon the supposition that the King was seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these doctors at first reported that , " in consideration of the critical condition of the Flemish provinces and the imminent danger that a refusal might drive the population to open revolt against the Crown , and to the entire abandonment of the Church , the King might reasonably grant them that liberty of worship which they desired . " " I did not call you here , " said the King , " to know whether I could , but whether I ought , to grant this to the Flemings . " The answer of the doctors then became absolutely negative , and Philip , falling on his knees before a crucifix placed in the chamber , exclaimed : " Sovereign Master of all things , keep me fast in the resolution I now am in , - never to become , never to be called , the lord of those who reject thee as their Lord . " All that could be obtained from him was the formation in the Low Countries of a commission of three bishops and three jurists charged to examine , together with the Council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . In July , 1565 , this commission sent its report to Madrid : it recommended the continuance of all the measures of severity , proposing only that in case of the recantation of convicted heretics , the punishment of death might be commuted by the judges into banishment . Philip approved the report with the exception of this power of mitigation , which he absolutely refused to vest in the judges ; and three months afterwards , on the 17th and 20th of October , he announced to his sister , the Regent Margaret of Parma , his final resolution not to grant to the Low Countries , either in government or in religion , any of the changes they solicited , but especially no convocation of the States in the Provinces , and no limitation of the powers of the Inquisition . When these letters were read in the Council at Brussels , and their publication resolved on , " The time is come , said the Prince of Orange , as he left the room , " when we shall see the beginning of a rare tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , by the resistance of the aristocracy , at once directing and restraining the excitement of the people . The " Gueux " of 1566 had for their acknowledged chiefs , or for their scarcely disguised patrons , such men *s Prince William of Orange , his brothers the Counts Louis and Adolphus of Nassau , the Counts of Egmont , of Horn , of Brederode , the first nobles of the land , most of them still Catholics , but leagued // together to regain their ancient political liberties as well as some toleration for those of the reformed faith , and thus proudly accepting this name of " Gueux , " which the Spanish councillors had flung at them ; n scorn , and themselves causing medals to be struck to perpetuate it . At this explosion , begun by such leaders and resounding through the land , Philip paused for a moment with anxiety ; he wrote to the Prince of Orange , who wished to retire from the Council , " You are much mistaken if you think that I have not full confidence in you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteem , I should not be so idle as to lend him an ear , I who have so often tried your loyalty and your services . " Soon afterwards , on the 31st of July , 1566 , he . addressed somewhat milder instructions to his sister , the Regent : " Through the natural inclination I have ever had to treat my vassals and subjects by the means of clemency and love rather than by fear and severity , I have given my assent to all it was possible for me to admit . " He had , in fact , assented to the abolition of the holy Office in the Low Countries , and agreed that the bishops alone should exercise the powers of Inquisitors . But at the very time he dispatched these concessions to Brussels , he sent for a notary to his palace at Madrid , and in presence of the Duke of Alva and two doctors of laws , he declared , " That not having made these concessions freely or spontaneously , he held himself not to be bound by them ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1566 , he ordered his ambassador at Rome , Don Luis of Requesens , to tell the Pope Pius V. , " That in the matter of the abolition of the Holy Office he felt it would have been right to consult his holiness , but that time was wanting , from the importunity of the people of Flanders for a speedy decision ; and , perhaps , " added he , " it is better it should be thus , since the abolition of the Holy Office can be of no effect unless it be ratified by the Pope who established it ; but on all this matter it will be well to be secret . " Philip was not aware that , in spite of all his precautions and his power , his secrets were almost always known to his most formidable opponent . The cause of the Reformation and of freedom in the Low Countries , fortunately possessed as its chief not only an illus PHILIP II . AND 1118 TIMES . trious nobleman , but a courtier and a man of the world , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the relations and intrigues of society ,  --  not less skilful to unravel the mazes of a palace than to direct the debates of coui*cil or the strife of civil war . Whilst he labored to set bounds to an iniquitous despotism , and to restrain or even to repress an irritawd people , Williazii of Orange foresaw the failure of this twofold resistance , and , steadily looking to the future , he kept in his pay at Madrid numerous agents to inform him of all that was in preparation , who transmitted to him the most secret mcidents of the King 's closet , and even copies of his correspondence with the Regent at Brussels . " Meaning to deceive all the world , " said he of Philip , " to make the more sure of it he begins by deceiving his sister . " These apparent concessions of the King did not therefore impose on William . Information received from Paris , where he had also his emissaries , apprised him that Philip was meditating sinister designs against the rebels in the Low Countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himself . Such was the first note of preparation of the mission of the Duke of Alva . William perceived that the time was come to take a decisive step , and yet to place himself in safety until the day of action had arrived . He formally refused the oath of implicit obedience which Philip required of the Knights of the Golden Fleece , and started for Germany , on the 30th of April , 1567 , after having vainly endeavored to induce his two friends , Egmont and horn , to take the same resolution . lie had already left the Low Countries four months , when the Duke of Alva arrived there-that true confidant ( if Philip II . ever had a confidant ) and worthy instrument of the policy of his master . On the details of his administration it is unnecessary for us to dwell , they are recorded everywhere ; his was the policy of the block and the gibbet , instead of the auto-de-fi* , hut in the name of the same principle , the unity of the faith and the unity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistance of his council of blood , by dint of proscriptions , of condemnations , of executions , of confiscations , of exactions , of depopulation , the Duke of Alva thoroughly satisfied the King ; and when on 2nd of March , 1568 , the Emperor Maxi // milian TI. wrote to the King of Spain in the name of the Electors of the Germanic Empire , and in his own name , to solicit both from his prudence and his clemency a milder administration in the Low Countries , Philip replied : " That which is done in these provinces has for its object their advantage and their tranquillity as well as the maintenance and extension of the Catholic faith . If I had not thought fit to proceed with so much justice , matters would have been promptly brought to an end there . I should not act otherwise , though I were to risk the sovereignty of these dominions , and though the world itself were to crush me . " Nevertheless , at the end of six years , Philip could not but perceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crown were restored in the Low Countries , and that even his victories aggravated instead f terminating the war . The state of Europe afforded a motive to his policy and an excuse to his pride for a change , or at least an apparent change , in his conduct and his agents at Brussels . The affairs of England and of France demanded more of his attention and his efforts . In England , in spite of all the reserve of Queen Elizabeth , her policy became , both abroad and at home , decidedly Protestant ; and the Reformed party in the Low Countries , as well as in France , found in her an effectual , though not an open , ally . In France , the religious contest , carried on with increasing ferocity , opened to Philip II . another field of action and fresh chances of power . He frantically applauded the Massacre of St. Bartholomew , contracted a close alliance with the Guises and the Ligue , and treated with them for the succession to that fair crown of France which seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own head . He took part , moreover , in all the plots of Mary Stuart against Elizabeth , and was preparing measures more effectual than plots . The struggle of the Catholic Church against the Reformation was now transported , as he thought , to the soil of France and England : his warfare against his own subjects in the Low Countries still fluctuated in its results , and subsided into secondary importance . The Duke of Alva was recalled , and from his recall down to the end of Philip 's reign , six different governorsDon Luis of Requesens , Don John of Austria , the Duke of Parma , the Count of Mansfeldt , DOLXVII . LIVING AGE . VOL . XVI . 38 the Archduke Ernest , and the Count of Fuentes-successively endeavored , in various degrees hut with indifferent success , to govern the Low Countries on a more moderate system . Negotiations , promised concessions , attempts to tamper with the Reformed leaders and with the Prince of Orange himself , were continually interposed in the course of this slackened but unceasing contest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshaken in his principle and unchangeable in his object . Never did he consent , or allow i.t to he supposed that he would consent , to allow the free exercise of the Reformed Faith in his dominions . In matters of civil government and rights , he might make concessions and promises ; in matters of religion , none . And even these political concessions were mere pretexts and evasions , which he meant to hold very light whenever he could renew the struggle , and restore by force the unity of his authority and the unity of the faith . Assurances to this effect were frequently transmitted to the Court of Rome ; and the superior penetration of the Prince of Orange was not necessary to pierce the conscientious duplicity of the King . We say the conscientious duplicity-words which appear most incompatible with one another are best fitted to describe his character , for that character was yet more strange , gloomy , and unnatural than the principles of his government ; the morality of the man was not less false and perverted than the policy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what he conceived to be the interest of that faith , whilst he discharged this duty he seemed to forget the existence of any other . In his public and in his private life , cruelty , deceit , assassinations , forgeries , adulteries , the most ungrateful selfishness , the most perfidious vindictiveness , and every sort of vicious and atrocious actions abounded ; yet all these things were done in frightful serenity of mind , under the conviction that his religion permitted and pardoned everything , provided every thing were sacrificed to his religion . One sacrifice he made to this idol , less criminal perhaps than many others , for serious if not sufficient motives were not wanting to justify it ; but this action was stamped with so much harshness , and has ever remained enshroudcd in so much ob* 693 // scurity , that not only the indignation but the calumnies of posterity have fi*stened on it . The more closely we have examined the history of the Infant Don Carlos , the more we are satisfied that neither on the one side nor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the gloomy anxiety of the father with reference to the opinions and conduct of his son on religious subjects furnished the true explanation of their tragical differences . The romantic story of the pretended passion of Don Carlos foe his step-mother , Elizabeth of France , and the supposed jealousy of Philip , is contradicted by the testimony of history , by moral probability , and we may almost say by physical possibility . The state of mental disease into which the Infant had been thrown by a severe fall , which is proved by many positive acts of extravagance and frenzy , would suffice to explain the King 's determination to remove him from the succession , and even to detain him in confine.nent ; but this fact does not account for the mystery thrown over these measures , and still less for the semi-religious and semipolitical procedure directed against the Prince . If the mental derangement of the son had been medically established , that would have been the best justification of the father ; nor is it easy to comprehend why Philip should have refused to avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some other cause . " The Prince , " as the Minister of Tuscany wrote to his master , " is suspected to be no great Catholic . " He had expressed a lively interest in the wrongs and the resistance of the Low Countries . When the Duke of Alva went to assume the government of those provinces , Don Carlos conducted himself with extreme violence , opposed the Duke 's departure , and declared he would go himself to Brussels . Somewhat later he had planned to fly either to the Low Countries or to Germany , and the day of his arrest was that he had appointed for the execution of this scheme . He had more than once expressed himself in terms of bitterness and hostility against the Inquisition . " Matters have now reached such a point ( said Philip , in writing to his aunt , the queen of Portugal ) , that to fulfil my duty to God and my kingdom as becomes a Christian prince , I have been obliged to subject my son to strict confinement . I have resolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the welfare of my dominions to all human considerations . I will only add , that this resolution has not been forced upon me by any delinquency of my son , or by any want of respect on his part to my person : I do not treat him in this wise by way of punishment , a thing which must have , whatever were the cause of it , a time and limit . Nor is this an expedient to correct the excesses of his life . What I have done rests on other reasons : the remedy I am applying is neither an expedient nor a temporary resource . I have had recourse to it , as I have just told you , to fulfil my duty to God and my people . " ( Prescott , vol. ii . p. 493 . ) To the Pope these motives were also , perhaps more fully , communicated ; for Zuniga , Philip 's ambassador at the Court of Rome , reported to his master ,  --  " his Holiness loudly applauds the course taken by your Majesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is necessary you should live many years , and leave a successor who will walk in your Majesty 's footsteps. * , After a period of six months spent in alternate paroxysms of frenzy and depression , on the 24th of July , 1568 , Don Carlos lay stretched on his pallet , expiring , exhausted , perhaps already insensible . With noiseless steps Philip entered the chamber of his son , and , half-concealed behind the Prince of Eholi and the Grand Prior , Don Antonio of Toledo , he looked upon him , stretched out his hands towards him , and making the sign of the Cross , gave him his farewell blessing . " After which , " to use the words of the historian Cabrera , " the King returned to his closet , more afflicted and less anxious . " By the death of his son , Philip conceived his policy to be secure . But around the dominions of the King of Spain , in spite of all his vigilance , other systems of policy were already formed and flourishing , far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have practised had he ascended the throne ,  --  far more formidable , whether as his rivals or as his foes . In England , Elizabeth found herself , on her accession , in presence of two Reformations ; the one royal , the other popular . Both of them were rescued by her succession to the throne from great evils and great dangers ; but whilst the former held the 694 // work of reform to be complete , and sought to arrest it , the latter held it to be incomplete , and aspired with passionate fervor to promote its ulterior consequences . Catholicism was defeated , but its defeat was recent and its powers were still to be feared ; the Church of England had gained the victory , but those beyond the pale of the Church still demanded further liberty . That religious liberty which they dernanded lacked the support of civil liberty , and relied on its assistance . With the assent of Parliament , Henry VIII . had tyrannically accomplished the royal Reformation ; by the action of Parliament the popular Reformation hoped to triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tudors , the Parliament of England had never disappeared . It had been servile , it had been wavering , but it had never ceased to take an active part in the government of the State . The lists were still open to all comers and to all the chances of victory . Contrasted with the fate of popular assemblies in other parts of Europe , this circumstance was exceptional , but not inexplicable . Protestant England is the country in which the institutions of the Middle ages-of those times which were most essentially Catholic-are still best perpetuated and preserved . The political franchises of the nation , which had been won in the thirteenth century , led to the triumph of the Reformation in the sixteenth . The people of reformed England instinctively understood that their freedom and their faith were one ; and in their struggles as well as in their hearts , they constantly identified their new form of religion with their ancient liberties . In this complex and agitated position , the Queen displayed consummate clearness of insight and firmness of purpose . Though perhaps Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her country and her Government a staunch and sincere Protestant . Though despotic by character , by descent , and by design , she never carried to the last extremity her pretensions or her actions . Though she affected to resent the remonstrances of her Parliament and of her people , she never overlooked grievances or rights which it would have been unsafe for the sovereign to ignore . She repressed with harshness , and oftentimes oppressed , that great party of religious and political reform 595 which had arisen in her own time , and which was destined in the following century to found the constitutional monarchy of England under her less able successors ; but she contrived to conciliate while she resisted it , and it grew beneath the shadow of her sagacious disapprobation . Neither religious freedom nor political freedom existed under Queen Elizabeth ; but from her reign and her policy , we date in England the triumph of the Protestant cause , to which we owe all the rest . No doubt the Protestant cause is obnoxious to the reproach of intolerance and persecution ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it not unfrequently violated that principle . But the germ of toleration was there , and that germ , however disputed and disavowed , could not fail one day to put forth its power . For men who claimed the liberty of exercising their own faith against the constituted authorities , to impose on others the tyranny of constraint in matters of belief , was a revolting inconsistency ; and amongst the Protestant sects this species of recrimination was soon mutually urged . But above these sects were some of the champions of the new-born Protestant cause , especially amongst the men of the highest eminence in the ai*ts of government and of war , raised by their vigorous intellect or by their judicious experience beyond the vulgar passions of their time , who speedily perceived that in these religious questions freedom is the best security of public peace as well as the right of conscience ; and this principle they labored to infuse into the public opinion and the laws of their country . William of Orange had the honor , in the sixteenth century , to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great moral truth , to which at the end of the seventeenth century the most illustrious of his descendants was destined to secure an imperishable triumph . These early champions of religious freedom failed in their efforts ; but no efforts are lost on behalf of a good cause which is still defended and still pursued ; and they were followed by a goodly array of successors , in the name of philosophy , in the name of Christianity , men in authority , and men in private life , all actors or spectators in these religious contests . Another of the greatest and most essential effects of the Reformation was considerably to reduce and even to // supersede the priestly office in the relation of the worshipper to the Deity ; this relation tended therefore to become more personal and direct , a circumstance that leads to the strong development of original energy and activity in the religious life of the soul , and therefore imparts to it the use and the desire of freedom . Throughout the continual wars and fierce persecutions of the sixteenth and seventeeenth centuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty may be discerned and traced from step to step in all the Protestant States , in Holland , in Germany , and in England , for it is the natural consequence of the convictions , the sentiments , and the institutions which Protestantisra had established in the world . Amongst the Catholic States , France was , in the sixteenth century , the first which had the merit of discovering , and to some extent of adopting , this principle . The condition of that country , both in its religious and its political parties , was even more complicated and more perplexing than that of England . Catholicism had indeed recovered its ascendancy , but i1 was not in a condition to crush or to silence its Protestant antagonists ; the Reformed party were still stronger in France than the Catholics in England ; the struggle between the two Churches was far more protracted , more dubious , and marked on both sides by more sanguinary violence . In politics the Crown was the master , but it was unsupported and unrestrained by any of those great institutions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of authority certain and effectual . The monarchy of France in the sixteenth century , though nearly absolute in principle , was powerless in reality , and incapable of discharging its public duties , or of watching over its own interests . It could neither protect its subjects from one another , nor protect itself against the ambition of the great or the passions of the people . The nation was sincerely monarchical , both in the nobility and the commons , yet they gave way to all the pretensions and the license most fatal to monarchy . In the heart of a royalist kingdom this sovereign royalty saw the State a prey to anarchy and civil war , through which it was drifting helplessly along with some faint efforts to check its course . PHILIP II . AND HIS TIMES . Two classes of statesmen , very different from each other , but who saw distinctly the deplorable state of the country and of the Government , sought in earnest for means to stop these calamities . The former consisted of men versed in warfare and in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little for truth or morality , but attached to the greatness and independence of their country , desirous to restore some degree of order and security for themselves and for the nation ; skilful , moreover , to prognosticate the different chances of the future and careful to provide against them . The latter was composed of men of a higher stamp , most of them in judicial offices , some high , some humble in position , devoted to their country and their king , hating the intrigues of the Court and the influence of the foreigner , desiring just laws under a competent authority , and who had attained , by their virtues , their enlightened piety , by science , by letters , and by experience , to conceptions of justice and of government far superior to those of their age . The Chancellor de l'H6pital and Du Plessis Mornay may thus be ranked beside the Marshal de Damvelle and the Duc de Brissac . These dissimilar elements which were brought into proximity by their own good sense and by the public danger , contributed to form what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not undeserving of its name , for in spite of the futility of their efforts in the course of the struggle , they undoubtedly exercised a decisive influence on its termination ; and it was from this party that the policy of the French monarchy received , from that very period , the peculiar character and the impulse which afterwards gave it the stamp of originality and success . Tried by any standard of morality , it is impossible to judge Catherine de Medicis with too much severity-she was at once corrupting and corrupt , cold and frivolous in the very act of crime , treacherous with an everchanging treachery , and capable of any enterprise or any risk from the love of agitation and the lust of dominion . But with all these vices , Catherine had two merits-she attached herself heartily to the monarchy and to France ; she defended , to the best of her power , the independence of the crown and of the nation against the Guises and the King of Spain , by refusing // to abandon her trust either to the extreme violence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayward , but not by nature violent or fanatical . In spite of her distrust and antipathy to the Protestants , she had no deliberate purpose or permanent resolution against them . From 1562 to 1584 Charles IX . and henry III. , acting under the advice of their mother , endeavored by no less than nine edicts or treaties to terminate the contest : and these attempts at pacification were not all of them perfidious deceptions . Catherine was not indisposed to make concessions to religious freedom , not from a sense of justice or as a right , but as a political necessity preferable to the excesses of civil war or of tyranny . She took L'H6pital for her minister , and supported him for a considerable time against the fanatical party . Cardinal Richelieu was not the first ruler of France who hit upon the expedient of an alliance with the Protestants of Germany or the North to sustain or to raise the crown of France against the House of Austria : Francis I. had commenced that policy against Charles Y. ; Catherine de Medicis repeated it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices and passions ; her creed had not smothered her reason ; and in spite of all her false and cruel actions , she never lost sight of the safety and greatness of the royal perogative and of the kingdom . Nor was hers an insignificant part in the policy which eventually delivered France from internal factions and from foreign influence . But the triumph of this policy was the work and the glory of Henry IV . We think that Europe and even France , where the memory of this prince is still so popular , have not yet done him full justice . The Protestants never forgave him for having become a Catholic , nor the Catholics for having been a Protestant . He accomplished the two greatest , the two hardest , the two most useful things which were desirable and practicable in his time . At home , after the fiercest struggles of civil discord , he restored peace , not by a harsh and despotic power , but by temperate government-he procured a victory to one party without oppressing the other-nay , even to the defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Abroad he pursued a policy altogether national and independent , looking to nothing but the safety and greatness of his country , and liberating his foreign policy from every.consideration and every influence which might be at variance with the paramount interests of France . He made peace with Spain in spite of the ill will of his ally the Queen of England . He persisted in his alliance with England and the other Protestant States , notwithstanding his conversion to the Catholic faith , well knowing that these Powers were the natural antagonists of the governments whose hostility or whose rivalry was formidable to Prance and to himself . His mind was alike free from prejudice and from rancor , lively but wellbalanced , proof against despondency and against illusions ; to different interests and to different motives of action he assigned with precision their relative importance , and he never allowed his foreign relations to enchain his domestic policy , or his domestic policy to thwart his foreign relations . His ambition was tempered with patience ; his sympathies were warm , yet he was not accessible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , yet cautious to stand in no man 's power ; skilful to enforce his will and his authority before they were called in question ; and not less per severing in his designs than fertile and flexible in his means of success . Never did a King , whose lot was cast in times of excessive violence , employ more gentle remedies to end a vast deal of evil , to begin a vast deal of good , or to restore a monarchy to its balance by a more just adaptation of ancient traditions to the more liberal demands of his own age . The sixteenth century was at an end . From the inaptitude of the Middle Ages to organize and to reform the state of Christendom , by the revival of classical antiquity , by the reformation of Luther and Calvin , all the great questions which can agitate the human mind and human society-questions of religious liberty , of intellect*ial liberty , and of political liberty-had been raised and debated in the course of that mighty epoch . At the commencement of the seventeenth century three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full activity in the three great states of Western Europe . In Spain , a system exclusively and absolutely Catholic . In England , a system essentially Protestant .. 697 // kn France , m*system more mixed and undecided-Catholic , yet in the spirit of the laity rather than of the clergy , royalist without being practically despotic . These three systems naturally assigned a different answer and a different fate to the questions of the age . In Spain all freedom was alike extinguished , whether religious , intellectual , or political ; the Inquisition and the Crown shared the despotic government of the realm , whilst literature and national poetry , which had flourished with so much lustre in the preceding age , fell into decrepitude and decay like the community to which they belonged . In England the symptoms were already manifest of an ardent national effort to establish freedom in all its triple forms : the sects of Protestantism were eager and numerous ; the contest was begun between the Puritans and the Church of England , between Parliament and the prerogative . In France the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edict of Nantes was in force ; some of the principles of political liberty were maintained by a few minds of the highest order , but their application was precarious and incomplete ; the States General of the realm were again convoked , but their functions were lost , and they separated to meet no more ; but the intellectual liberty of the French nation had already acquired its full activity and power , in philosophy , in science , and in literature ; the constellation which was to illuminate that age already gleamed on the horizon : Descartes , Gassendi , Fermat , Corneille , Pascal , Bossuet were born , and were ere long to sound the deepest problems of human nature , to touch the noblest emotions of the heart , to exercise and to satisfy the loftiest faculties of the mind . From that epoch to the present , two centuries have already passed  --  a third has run more than half its course : the three systems of policy which prevailed in the sixteenth century in the three great States of Western Europe have undergone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth to their natural effects . The light of experience rests upon this page of history : he who runs may read the conspicuous and majestic result . In England , freedom of faith , freedom of thought , and freedom of government , perfected and assisted by each other , have tri umphed in their common efforts : the relation of the soul of man to its Maker , the expression of the human intellect to its fellow men , are alike free ; whilst free institutions secure the personal xights of every man and the public rights of all . Under the protection of these institutions and these liberties , the prosperity and power of the nation have marvellously augmented , and still increase from day to day . Christian principles , joined to a reverence for the past and a respect for the law , have carried us unscathed through our severest trials ; for , by the happy constition of this country , the essential condition of the morality , strength , and happiness of human society , namely the union of permanence and of progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured , as far at least as the incurable frailty of all human works will permit it . In France , both in the seventeenth and in the eighteenth century , political freedom was wanting . Religious freedom , which had been accepted and secured by the enlightened liberality of Henry IV. , perished under the bigoted and arrogant despotism of Louis XLV . But in spite of all legal impediments , the intellectual freedom of the French nation has ever asserted an empire of its own ; that independence and public spirit which were absent from the institutions of the country took refuge in social life , where the animated expression of opinion , the pleasures and pursuits of the mind , have kept their place in the favor of the nation , and sometimes even in the favor of the absolute sovereign . They were relished by Louis XIV. ; they were tolerated by Louis XV . The faculties of the human mind remained free and active , though without any direct or precise application to administration of the country ; but their influence , which was recognized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit than in its form ,  --  sufficed to keep up the circulation and vital movement of the moral and social powers of the nation . France was ill-governed , but not , in the strict sense of the term , oppressed , and she had lost neither her lustre , her prosperity , nor her greatness . The day came at last when this intellectual freedom of the country , controlled by an authority too mild and too weak to resist it , imperiously demanded freedom of conscience and freedom of government in the name of the rights of man . and of the people . 598 // From that day to the present , France has been tossed by storm after storm across the pathless seas , and it is still a problem whether she will ever reach that haven for which she started , and which she has twice appeared to have attained . But , thanks to that intellectual freedom which she has ever retained , and thanks to the temperate policy of her kings , she has encountered these trials in the full possession of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has wrested from those frightful convulsions results of no common value . She has reformed the internal condition of society ; she has emancipated the industry of the country from internal restrictions ; the administration of public affairs , and what maybe termed the mechanism of society , has attained a high degree of perfection ; freedom of conscience , though illdefined and imperfectly secured by the law , is nevertheless established . In spite of her mistakes and her reverses , France has a right to believe that she has not yet seen the close of her achievements any more than of her trials ; and that the efforts and the progress she has made in the last three centuries will never be complete until she has secured , by public liberty , the pledge of her triumphs and realization of her hopes . The destinies of Spain are more melancholy and more obscure . That noble people remained for three hundred years doomed to stagnation by its spiritual and temporal tyrants , and it submitted to its fate until the insults and the arms of a foreign invader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Spanish nation in that contest by the alliance of England gave birth to no lasting principle of political regeneration . The burden of centuries of apathy , sterility , and decay is less easily shaken off than the burden of foreign oppression . The Spaniards may pursue their task , but has Europe sufficient reason to place confidence in the result ? In thus endeavoring to trace the principles and the results of the distinct systems of policy which have , for the last three hundred years , disputed the empire of modern society , we have confined these observations to three States of Western Europe . But this survey might be carried further : the same political systems might be compared in the States of Novtbern and in those of Southern Europe , or in the British and utch ccdonies and the 599 colonies of Spain , both in America and in Asia . Everywhere the results are the same ; everywhere the same answer must be given to the same interrogatories . Wherever Catholic absolutism has reigned , it has stopped and congealed the life of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifling freedom , it has established an authority without real coherence and force ,  --  an authority which has never prevented the occurrence of great days of trial , and which , those trials having begun , fails to curb their excesses , and proves to be almost equally incapable of reform and of stability . Wherever , on the contrary , Protestantism has prevailed , as in England , Holland , or in the North of Europe ; or even the more moderate and enlightened form of Catholicism , as in France , Belgium , and a part of Germany , where the Church of Rome has not been either the instrument or the mistress of the civil power ,  --  moral activity , social energy , public prosperity , have spread and increased , under different shapes and with various success , but always with fruits beneficial and glorious to mankind . These nations may have committed great faults , or great crimes ; they may have endured great sufferings ; their progress has been more or less rapid , more or less complete ; but they have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their course and the vicissitudes of their destiny , they have remained or have become capable of the highest culture . These abundant results , though sometimes in appearance contradictory , are in reality the harmonious product which fulfils the task of humanity and satisfies the want of society ; and thus they have continued to advance towards that boundless future which is the sublime goal of Christian civilization and the mark of its divine origin . The two works which stand prefixed to this article have for their subject the earlier scenes and the most prominent actors in the great European drama which we have here sought to follow in its plot and its significance-the Spanish monarchy in its gloomy splendor , and the Commonwealth of the United Provinces in its bloody origin-Philip II . and William of Orange-Catholicism and Protestantism-contending with equal fury and under their most indomitable champions . Starting from different poix*ts , end arriving // at different periods , in this memorable history , Mr. Prescott and Mr. Motley relate the same tale . Both of them being Protestants , the one has chosen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King and his Catholic court ; the other the Prince and the people of the Reformed faith . The work of Mr. Prescott is to comprise the whole reign of Philip II. ; but the two first volumes , which alone are now before us , contain no more than the first twelve years of that period ,  --  from 1556 to 1568 . Mr. Motley has taken the life of William of Orange as the standard of his book . lie opens it with the accession of Philip , and closes it in 1584 , when William fell by the pistol of an assassin paid by the King ; and Philip exclaimed on the arrival of the intelligence , " had that blow been struck two years ago , the Catholic Church and I should have gained by it . " Philip had cause to temper his exultation with regret ; for , though William of Nassau was no more , the Commonwealth of the United Provinces was founded . These publications have been seasonably undertaken ; for the evidence necessary to a full and entire comprehension of the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own times . Not indeed that earlier chroniclers were wanting to record them . Charles V. and Philip II . had both taken especial care to provide this class of writers , and even to furnish them with information . Three Spanish historians and one Neapolitan , contemporaries of the period , Sepulveda , Herrera , Cabrera , and Campana , have left voluminous narratives of their reigns . Sepulveda and Herrera were the regular historiographers of Charles V. and Philip II . respectively , and the former seems to have enjoyed from his master a degree of independence equal to his opportunities of observation . On one occasion lie wished to read to the Emperor some fragments of his work . " No , " said Charles , " I will neither hear nor read what you have written about me . Others will read it when I am gone ; but if you require information on any *point whatever , I shall always be ready to give it you . " Even in his retirement at Yuste , the Emperor occasionally received Sepulveda , who was also living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthplace , and writing his book as his master was closing his life , at a distance from the world , but not detached from it . There is no reason to suppose that Philip II . granted the same familiarity or the same freedom to his historiographer Ilerrera . These official historians , however , and especially Sepulveda , are not only important as contemporary and well-informed witnesses , but they have a good deal of that unconscious impartiality which proceeds from an accurate knowledge of the persons and events they describe . In the history of Philip II . by Cabrera , which has no official character , and only the first part of which has been published , some traits of the character and secret policy of the King are to be found , so true and forcible , that the author himself appears scarcely to have felt their whole significance . In addition to these contemporary writers , several subsequent authors , such as Gregorio Leti in the seventeenth century , and Watson in the eighteenth , wrote the history of Philip II. , but without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fresh materials have been discovered in great abundance : in Spain , in Holland , in Belgium , in France , the public archives have been searched ; diplomatic correspondence , private memoirs , the mest authentic and secret documents have been dragged to light and abandoned to the curiosity of the learned and the idle . Three great collections more especially-the archives of the house of Nassau , published at Leyden by M. Groen van Prinsterer ; the correspondences of Charles V. , Philip II. , and William the Silent , which M. Gachard has published either textually or by extracts from the archives of Simancas and of Brussels ; and the papers of Cardinal Granvelle inserted in the great collection of unpublished historical documents relating to the history of France , which was begun in 1833 by M. Guizot , then Minister of Public Instruction , have in the last twenty-five years poured a flood of light on the history of this period ; and we may now be almost as well acquainted with the transactions of the sixteenth century as if the living men of that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , which were already known to the public , Mr. Prescott and Mr. Motley have added some new and hitherto unknown results of their Own researches . Their books are not mere compilations from other books ; they have prose-600 // cuted these discoveries in public libraries , in archives , in private collections of MSS. ; each of them gives a careful account in his preface of his own sources of infor.mation , of the courteous assistance he has received , of the results which he hopes to have attained ; and their works fully confirm , by their close and conscientious study of the subject , that confidence which the mere statement of their labors at once inspires . As we proceeded in the history of Philip LI . by Mr. Prescott , this confidence steadily increased . He has given us not only a complete and accurate narrative , but a narrative which is remarkably impartial ; and this impartiality is not only the strict impartiality which consists in speaking the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , but the generous impartiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings it does not share , assigns a fair place to diversity of situation , to disinterested motives , to traditional prejudices , to irresistible circumstances ; and treats the memory *f historic personages , whose principles and actions it execrates , with the equity and forbearance of an upright and humane judge passing sentence on their lives . Philip II . and the Duke of Alva , even Margaret of Parma and Cardinal Granvelle , sometimes put Mr. Prescott 's virtue to a severe trial ; but his virtue is never at fault . It does great honor to Protestant civilization that it has furnished historians thus prepared to render full and free justice to its bitterest enemies . This impartiality , just without effort , is the result of a sincere homage to truth , of an earnest sentiment of Christian charity , and of the security of a cause already won . Nor is this honorable moral distinction peculiar to Mr. Prescott ; it may be traced in several of the Protestant historical researches which have recently been directed to the Catholic Powers of the sixteenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prinsterer to his . Archives of the house of Nassau . " From a Dutchman and a zealous Protestant , busied in the records of the sufferings and the heroic struggles of his forefathers , this scrupulous and unswerving fairness is even more meritorious . Considered as a literary work , independently of this high moral appreciation of persons and of events , Mr. Prescott 's " History of Philip II . " has other merits which , rare as they are , are not always remarked . The structure of this book is ingenious and well arranged . Mr. Prescott has not bound himself to follow in strict succession the chronological order of events ; he has classed them according to their characters , and divided them into groups , which follow their respective and distinct course , without however losing the thread which connects them , or ceasing to form a whole . Thus the accession of Philip , and his first wars in France and Italy-his return to Spain , arid his administration of the kingdom  --  the condition , the revolt , and the struggle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parma , and the Duke of Alvathe trials and the death of Egmont , Horn , and Montigny  --  the story of Don Carlos and Elizabeth of France-form a series of complete pictures , at once distinct and well connected together , and the general history of the King 's reign may thus be grasped in its grander masses instead of unrolling the incoherent links of a broken chain . This style of writing places the moral succession of causes above the material succession of events , and supersedes , by a loftier chronology , the chronology of the almanac . The master of all historians , Tacitus , has left us in his Annals and in his Histories examples of either method ; and although he has in both his works shed the splendor of his genius with equal lustre over the details he relates , their diversity and their unequal beauty as works of art are extremely striking . Amongst the group of events which fill the two first volumes of Mr. Prescott 's book , there is one , interesting enough in itself , but so disproportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general harmony and effect-we mean the four chapters he has devoted to the Knights of Malta , and to the siege of Malta by the Turks in 1565 . This brilliant incident filled too small a space in the history of Philip II. , and Philip II . himself filled too small a space in the history of the siege , for Mr. Prescott to have assigned to it so large a portion of his book . He has evidently been led away by the charm of his subject , and by the pleasure of painting in detail that glorious passage in the long stru*glc of Christians against the Infidel , the character of the 601 // gallant veteran , Jean Parisot de la Yalette , who was then Grand Master of the Order , and the impetuous valor of his Knights . To this merit of a well-arranged history Mr. Prescott adds that of an easy , unaffected , though somewhat frigid , power of narration . He belongs to the historical school of Robertson , judicious rather than profound in its general views , and more remarkable for simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us are never wanting in truth , but they are sometimes wanting in life . History only becomes dramatic on two conditions ; it must have either the passion of the politician or the imagination of the poet . Mr. Prescott has neither one nor the other ; he is a calm and enlightened philosopher , an accomplished man of letters ; he is well read in the history of Philip II. , and he relates it with fidelity ; but he has studied it after the lapse of three centuries in all the serenity of his own reflections and the tranquillity of a New England study ,  --  faititfully , therefore , as these events and these personages are described by him , he leaves them where he finds them , in their tombs . Mr. Motley has more vehemence : not that of a politician engaged in the struggles of party and the responsibilities of office , but that of a Republican , a Protestant , an honest man , who hates , as if he saw them before his eyes , the outrages and persecutions inflicted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far country , and lashes with all his heart the authors of these crimes . His admiration for the champions of the liberal and Protestant cause is not less keen . As much as he execrates Philip and the Duke of Alva , he loves William of Orange ; he describes him , he praises him , he defends him as if he were personally interested in his fate and in his fame . William is to Mr. Motley wh2t his illustrious descendant is to Mr. Macaulay - not merely a hero , but a hero of his own . Too well informed to overlook the imputations which rest upon the memory of that great Prince , and too conscientious to conceal them , Mr. Motley scrutinizes every detail , and argues the cause of his client with unbounded confidence . Thus , his account of the marriage of William , in 1561 , with the Princess Anne of Saxony , a daughter of the great Elector Maurice , and of the religious equivocations of the Prince in the negotiation of this alliance , is a model of obstinate and skilful pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great . man . Thus excited by alternations of extreme aversion and strong predilection ,  --  which , however , reasonable in themselves , have obtained absolute possession of Mr. Motley 's mind ,  --  this writer does not handle his subject with the perfect fairness and comprehensive grasp of Mr. Prescott ; nor does he , like his eminent contemporary , descend into the ranks or search the hearts of his enemies , to understand and to describe their conduct with strict impartiality . His strong and ardent convictions on the subject of his work have also affected its style and literary character ; his narrative sometimes lacks proportion and forbearance ; he dwells to excess upon events and scenes of a nature to kindle in the mind of the reader the excitement he himself feels , and he studiously withholds from the opposite side the same amount of space and of coloring . His style is always copious , occasionally familiar , sometimes stilted and declamatory , as if he thought he cmld never say too much to convey the energy of his own impressions . The consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive and fatiguing , persuasive and irritating . An accumulation of facts and details , all originating in the same feeling and directed to the same object , mingles our sympathy with some degree or distrust ; and although the cause he defends is beyond all question gained , we are not impressed with the judgment of such an advoc*te . With these merits and with these imperfections , the " History of Philip II . " and the " history of the Rise of the Dutch Republic " are undoubtedly two important works , the result of profound researches , sincere convictions , sound principles , and manly sentiments ; and even those who are most familiar with the history of the period will find in them a fresh and vivid addition to their previous knowledge . They do honor to American literature , and they would do honor to the literature of any country in the world .
