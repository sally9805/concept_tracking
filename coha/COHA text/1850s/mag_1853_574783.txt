txt ALISON 'S HISTORIES . The History of Europe , from the commencement of the French Revolution , in 1789 , to the Battle of Waterloo . By Sir ARCHIBALD ALIsoN , Bart. : S vols. , 1843 . The History of Europe , from the fall of Napoleon , in 1815 , to the accession of Louis Napoleon , in 1852 . By Sir ARCHIBALD ALIsoN , Bart. : Vol. 1 , 1852 . DR . JOHNSON , in one of his ursine growls , is reported to have expressed a very contemptuous opinion of the writers of History ; for , if they narrate what is false , said he , they are not historians , but liars ; and if they narrate what is true , they have no field for the display of ability , because , as truth is necessarily one , it must be told by every body alike . But this dilemma of the Leviathan is a superficial one , or rather no dilemma at all for the reason that the historian does not deal with absolute truth , with naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual and disconnected facts , but with phenomena that may be variously interpreted , with living complicated and warring movements , that spring from violent passions in the actors concerned with them , and that excite similar passions in the beholders of them ; and with institutions and usages which represent vast and irreconcilable differences of political and social faith . His art , therefore , like that of any other artist , consists in the selection of his topics , and in his method of treatment . lie must have his principles and his processes , his color and form , his foreground and background , his light and shade , and his variety as well as unity of composition . Thus there will be an ample scope afforded him for the display of any ability that he may possess , for the nicest judgment , the most profound and active imagination and consummate skill ; and , so far from finding him either a liar on one side , or the utterer of bald truisms on the other , we shall see that his function is allied in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the dignity of its objects , to the loftiest forms of intellectual expression . But the historian , besides his descriptions of the scenes and characters of the drama of life in which , like the artist , he strives to produce the best general effects-effects infinitely more true than the most microscopic minuteness of detail would be without this artistic management-is required to refer these scenes and characters to great general principles , and to evolve comprehensive and permanent laws of development , out of the kaleidoscope of ever-shifting and variable appearances . He is , therefore , the philosopher as well as the artist and needs the penetration and insight of the clearest reason , in addition to the finest qualities of the rhetorician and the poet . We have thought it well to premise thus much in order to show that it is with no low or narrow conceptions of the province of history , and of the endowments of tho historian , that we approach a survey of the labors of Mr. Alison . He holds a prominent place among the historians of his day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Empire ; has put forth voluminous books , very widely accepted as authorities ; traverses periods of time which are among the most important in the annals of our race ; utters positive judgments on important men and important things ; in short , aspires to the highest character in the department of literature to which he is devoted , and is , therefore , entitled , both by his position and pretensions , to be judged according to the most elevated standards of criticism . In an inferior walk of art , with a more humble aim , or a less ambitious style of exe ' *'ition , we might dismiss him in a few *iassing strictures , to find his level as he could among the multitude of authors . The period which Mr. Alison has chosen for the subject of his researches , extends from the time of the first French Revolution to the accession of Napoleon the Third , if we must call that desperate adventurer by a dynastic name . It covers a space of about sixty years  --  a little more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pregnant years that the world has known-full of grand events and crowded with great characters - and , in many respects , an era decisive of the destinies of mankind for a long time to come . Indeed , we do not suppose that // any six decades that have fallen upon man , scarcely excepting the most glorious age of Greece , the epoch of the advent of Christianity , or that of the Reformation in the sixteenth century , have been more prolific of great men , more agitated by great thoughts , more splendid in great discoveries , or more marked by signal and tremendous changes in the condition of society , than the sixty years embraced in the design of Mr. Alison 's volumes . Let us then take a rapid glance at some of the principal occurrences and leading characteristics of this era , before we pass to a consideration of the method in which he has treated it , or to such observations as the nature of the subject may suggest . The period we refer to begins with the first French Revolution , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than the beginning of the present age ; or , more strictly still , the transition between the two , the Phenix birth , and fire consummation , as a German would say ,  - -  in which an old economy passed away in flames , and a new one sprang from its ashes . But whatever it was , in this respect , it was confessedly one of the most stupendous events in the history of our race . Huge , astounding , uproarious , it was made memorable to all men , and to the end of time , alike in the causes which lod to it , in the unparalleled scenes that attended its progress , and in the far-reaching consequences of which it sowed the seeds . No event in the annals of mankind has been more frequently and more voluminously written about , and yet there is none more fresh or full of an absorbing interest . Covering in its duration only a few rapid years , confined for the most part to a single city and its adjacent provinces , costing , amid all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle-it still stands apart , from all other occurrences , in certain wild and portentous proportions ,  --  as the grandest and fearfullest product of any age . Thit its mere external phenomena would be insufficient to account for the peculiar and lasting impression which it has made and still makes on the human mind , were it not for those great and novel ideas out of which it arose . Timid and unrefiecting minds are accustomed to consider the French Revolution as a mere wanton explosion and whirlwind of frantic passions , and to stigmatize the chief actors in it as reckless fiends ; a holiday of malignant merriment to which all the devils of the earth had rushed as the witches rushed to the mad midnight revels of the Blochsberg ; but other minds which strive to pierce deeper into things , which believe that no effect exists without a cause , and a justifying cause , which can not suppose that God ever abandons a whole people to sheer imbecility and madness , or that he has no deeper design in allowing the errors and crimes of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or death's-head and cross-bones , for the use of conservative moralists ,  --  find in the excesses and riots of this wonderful event a vital truth and significance , however terrible . They discern a law of Providence amid its sad dislocations and irregularities , a rhythmic order in its wild Bacehic dances , a spark of genuine fire through its meteor lights , a noble and great thought pervading even its most monstrous throes . Now it is this thought , and not alone the carnage , which has been greatly exaggerated , nor the ferocity which is more or less incident to all civil wars , nor the sudden overthrow of government , of which we before have had many examples , that fastens our attention to the external events as it was never before fastened as if we were bound by some magic spell . We stand in the presence of any one who proposes to recite its story , like the wedding guest , pierced by the glittering eye of the Ancient Mariner , and " can not choose but hear . " For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of the divinc rights of men , as opposed to the pretensions of governments , institutions , and society itself ; taken possession of the hearts of a whole people , to be proclaimed as a vital and inextinguishable fact . Revolutions there had been before , but none so deep , thorough , and radical as this-. - none which penetrated so directly into the very core of the relations of the individual to the State . The contests in England , during the reign of James the First , and the earlier years of that of his successor , were parliarhentary contests , carried on mainly by learned lawyers , and ending only in a change of dynasty . The Revolution of 1688 , conducted by the appointed organs of the corporations , the landed aristocracy , the town magistrates and borough proprietors , scarcely touched the frame of the government , and did not ask , as it had no need , of thepopular interference . Again , the American Revolution was at first but a strife between revolted colonies and an imperious mother country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked to that final and broad assertion of the supremacy of the people which it afterwards uttered . It was , even in the end , a conflict of state with state . But the French Revolution . prepared from afar by the whole course of European thought and experionce , ani // mated and encouraged too , doubtless , by the success of the American experiment , was a solemn and unqualified proclaination of the rights of man as man ; the protest of the individual against every form of domination , whether it pretended to be human or divine . It was a matter of course , therefore , that a position so extreme , provoking every conservative resentment , and arousing every aspiring passion , should issue in actions equally extreme . The mean and petty squabbles of cabinets , the windy debates of political factions , were no longer in place , because the questions which had come to be debated , involving the very foundations of government , the basis of Society , were the deepest and most searching inquiries that the mind could entertain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal logic of the schools , but with the fiery vehemence of the forum , where the people , roused to an intense sense of the oppression , the injustice , and the licentiousness by which they had been governed for ages , had rushed , not to listen and deliberate , but to act . Twenty four millions of them , courageously casting off the trammels of centuries dislodging temporal and spiritual tyranny from its strongholds , elevating the multitudes from servile and superstitious submission , and assuming the control of their own destiny , presented a spectacle , which , in the midst of its bloodshed , terror , and atrocity , was so original and magnificent , that we admire it , while we tremble before it . Ah ! we may condemn and denounce those millions as we please ; but it can not be denied that they struck a blow with which humanity still vibrates , while the echoes of their wild screams will go down as jubilant harmonies to the end of time . Thus , the opening incident of the age we are considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the national convulsions and movements by which it was followed . The waves of the tumult had scarcely subsided , when a majestic figure appears , emerging from the ooze and slime of the deluge , like Milton 's postdiluvian lion " pawing to get free His hinder par then springe as broke from bonds , And rampant shakes his brinded mane . " The year 1799  --  the last of the last century - saw Napoleon Bonaparte First Consul of France . A subaltern in the armies of the republic , he had rapidly risen in rank ; he had given a coup de grace to the factious debris of the revolution , had finished a campaign in Italy , which recalled the most brilliant exploits of Ciesar , had baffled the sagacity of veteran intriguers at home , and now saw himself the chief man , as he was consciously the greatest man , of his nation . Europe , in league against the encroachments of the aspiring democrats , threatened France with annihilation ; but , throwing himself into the conflict , with a power of combination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have seemed miraculous , he set the whole at defiance . Then followed those shocks of war , in which the thrones of the world trembled like the trees of the forest when a tempest is passing . A multitude of armed men , more numerous than the hosts of Persia , more impetuous than the fierce tribes of the Asiatic steppes , but endowed with all the skill and energy of the ancient Romans , and led by a master mind , with a genius for war surpassing Alexander 's , and not inferior to that of the great Julius , were precipitated on the field of battle , and in twelve short years , by a series of unexampled victories , scattered every enemy , and laid mankind under tribute . At the same time , the imperial intellect which had overcome the combined forces of Russia , Prussia , Austria , Italy , and Spain , and distributed sceptres among his brothers , as a housewife distributes portions of bread to her dependents , had organized order at home , had remodelled the constitution and reconstructed society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and the science of his people , with a comprehensiveness of view and decision of purpose , which raised him to the highest rank among legislators , as he was already the acknowledged first among warriors . His unexampled successes , however , were followed by unprecedented disasters , While he bent the energies of his mighty brain to the prosecution of those progressive ideas which had been the impulse of the Revolution , and which were still effective after the Revolution was closed he was carried forward without a break in the triumphs of hisprodigious career ; but when personal aggrandizement usurped the place of his original inspiration , when the " armed soldier of democracy " dwindled into the usurper and the tyrant , more eager to found a family than to perpetuate the liberties of the people , the divine hand which had seemed to lead him was withdrawn , he floundered into insanities of ambition , and fell , with a more stupendous *clat , even , than he had risen . The invasion of Russia , conceived in the mad dream of universal dominion when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bands which the frantic Persian led across the Libyan deserts , were wasted , like the hosts of Sennacherib , by no repelling foe , but , by " the breath of the Lord ; " the // fearful retreat , when the ground for thousands of miles was covered with the victims of fire , frost , and famine ; the decisive overthrow at Waterloo , and the lonely imprisomnent of St. Helena , were the successive acts in a drama of gigantic grandeur of movement and equally gigantic pathos of catastrophe . Much has been said of the character and career of Napoleon ; and much remains to be said ; but whatever may be the final verdict of the world it will be conceded that the immense adventures of which he was the moving cause , unsettled and deranged permanently tIme despotic system of Europe , and prepared the way for the ultimate emancipation of the people . The conspiracies at Carlsbad , Vienna , Verona , and Laybach , which took the name of the holy Alliance , and which appeared to fasten the chains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were , in fact , a short-sighted policy , and by their unwise " distribution of souls and soils , " as a late writer names it laid the train of that series of incessant civil explosions which has agitated the last thirty years , falsely called years of peace . The disorders of Spain , the revolution of Poland , the insurrections of Piedmont and Naples , the revolt of Belgium , the dethronement of Charles X. , and the universal uprising of 1848 , from Paris to Comorn , were as much the fruits of the absurd arrangement of 1815 , as they were of democratic aspiration . It has provoked an uneasiness and discontent among the masses in which the orators of progress find their readiest material , and surest ground of appeal . But while these grander movements were going forward , two new and disturbing influences were silently spreading in Europe , until they came to be felt as among the most powerful that were likely to affect the destiny of mankind . We refer to the growing importance of Russia and the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the overflowings of their rapacity , what Charlemagne , Louis , and Napoleon , wasted the treasures and blood of empires in the vain endeavor to acquire  --  the dominion of Europe , and , through Europe , of the worldthe descendmnts of the Dukes of Muscovy have prosecuted with a steady tread and the most certain aim ; while , on the other hand , the young Republic of the West , master already of the new continent , is not indifferent to the struggles of the old , and may yet fling itself with all its unkempt strength and its invincible prowess , into the arms of the people , with whom alone it has a common sympathy . The appearance of these two nations , conse May quently , on the theatre of politics , is a fact to be noted in the history of the age . Coeval also with these larger perturbations and changes in the , political world , the most remarkable developments in other spheres have taken place , any one of which might have distinguished the Nineteenth Century , but the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among these , we can only refer to the great legislative and law reforms which have taken place in England ; the sudden diffusion and almost universal spread of every form of literature ; the prodigious acquisitions made in the fields of natural science ; the rapid improvements in mechanical skill and the practical arts ; the expansion of benevolent enterprise ; the rise of socialism as an active theory ; the extension of commerce , the discoveries of gold in Australia and California , and the vast movements of populations , compared by Alison to the original dispersion of mankind , and surpassing the changes that followed the oceanic enterprises of the Fifteenth century . In literature , for instance how many and what brilliant names pass before us , when we recall the history of the last fifty years ! It seems as if we were sweeping the heavens with a telescope , when the night was glorious with stars . G*ithe , Scott , Wordsworth , Shelley , Byron , Coleridge , Schiller , Tieck , Sismondi , Jean Paul , Lamartine , Hugo , Carlyle , Thackeray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among many illustrious names . Or . in science again , what a thought it is that , with the exception of Astronomy and the Fixed Sciences , nearly all that is entitled to the name of Science has been the product of the Era before us ; that Chemistry and Geology and Comparative and Fossil Anatomy , and Palmeontology , and Magnetism and Electricity , may be said to have been created under our eyes , while all that was before known has been enlarged and certified by the wider and more accurate observations of Humboldt , Cuvier , Arago , Audubon , Faraday , Dumas , and Henry ! Or , still more , what grand facts are connected in our minds with the words , steam , electricity , caloric , which to our great-grandsires were either utterly unknown , or which , had they been told them , would have seemed nothing less than miracles ! Railroads , steamships , electric telegraphs , daguerreotypes , the cotton trade , have been the contemporaries of the youngest of us , endowing us with new power , bringing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and yet , so far from absorbing us in material pursuits , and dazzling us with material splendors , have given a new impulse to every form of intellectual activity and Alison ' . * Histories . // every kind of benevolent solicitude . How wise and liberal now , compared with what it was sixty years since , the guardianship exercised , both by states and individuals , over the unfortunate classes of our race , those deprived by nature or circumstance of the common blessings of life  --  the idiotic , the blind , the mute , and the depraved ? How much more comprehensive our sympathies , and gentle and benignant our ministrations , and judicious and truthful our treatment ? But above all , what searching inquiries we send into the causes of social malady , and how resolute we are getting towards every effective application of the remedy , though it costs us many time-honored institutions , and perhaps the very form and body of our existing social state ? These , then , are the characteristics of the period of which Mr. Alison has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see even in the hasty sketch we have given of it of tremendous activity and expansiveness , marked by great events on every side , not only in politics and war , but in literature , science , social improvement , and in practical as well as moral enterprise ; and it now remains for us to look in what manner he has treated the rich materials placed in his hand . ilegel , one of the profoundest and acutest , as well as most brilliant of the Germans , has divided history-by which he means history as an art , and not the course of events-into the primitive , the systematic , and the philosophical ; and we shall borroxv his method without limitin , , ourselves to his meaning , however , in our estimate of Mr. Alison . By primitive history ilegel meant , we suppose-for it is long since we read his work  --  a simple narrative or chronicle of events , as they might be described by an actual witness of them and of which we have specimens in ilerodotus , Thucydides , C msar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , in Carlyle . Systematic history aspires to a slightly higher character , and records the life of a nation or of nations , accordin* , to some general scheme of thought in the author 's mind , not founded , however , upon any profound view of the logical order of events so much as upon external relations of time and place , or the rhetorical requirements of the subject , and is exemplified in history , as it is commonly written in Gibbon Hume , Robertson , Macaulay , and Prescott . But philosophical history takes a more connected and deeper , as well as wider view ; looks upon human actions and their developments as illustrations of a foregone design , or as the manifestations of some universal tendency , bringing out in one place one aspect of itself ; and in another place . another aspect , because the whole is the work of the Divine Providence , or Supreme Reason realizing its grand purposes towards humanity . In this style Guizot , Thierry , Louis Blanc , and , to some extent , our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of historians still , the scientific order , which would blend perfect accuracy of narrative with a deduction of absolute scientific principles , the time has not come , for the reason that the science of history is not yet known , and can not be known except as the crown and summit of every other science . Now , Mr. Alison , who modulates variously through all the different styles , has attained a brilliant success in none , and only a mediocre success in either ; and , in any large view of the historical function , must be content to take a very humble place . As a narrator of events he has the two very important merits-of patient and laborious industry , and of considerable animation and vigor of description . He shrinks from no effort of research in collecting his crude materials , and he puts them together with a ponderous diligence . His works , therefore as repositories of certain selected facts , save the inquirer a deal of pains that he would otherwise be at , in reading newspapers , debates , bulletins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , especially the movements of battle , in strong and vivid colors . But , in the ordinary current of his narrative , he betrays constantly the want of the most simple and obvious qualities that are necessary to either a skilful or an interesting story-teller . His vocabulary , in the first place , is remarkably deficient ; he can not handle words which are the most elementary tools of his art , with any masterly facility or power ; for he perpetually repeats the same turns of expression . His diction , in the second place , is equally poverty-stricken ; his sentences are often heavy , confused , straggling , and ill-joined ; he commits blunders in grammar that a child would be punished for at school ; and , being utterly destitute alike of fancy or imagination , his metaphors are the stereotyped phrases of literary commerce or the commonplaces of the street . We all remember the " Alexander and Clytus " illustration of Coleridge 's school friends , who lugged it in on all occasions ; and we are reminded of it in lmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usque ad nausearn , of his pet similes and comparisons . But what is worse of his figures is , that they do not run on all-fours , but are both halt and blind , and , like the monsters in Horace 's Art of Poetry , have // joined a horse 's neck to a human head , or spread the plumage of birds over the limbs of beasts . As proofs of these defects we refer to expressions such as these : " the vast and varied inhabitants " of the French empire , as if Frenchmen were vaster than any other people ; " an acquisition which speedily recoiled upon the heads of those who acquired them ; " " Murat , who made 1800 of their wearied columns prisoners , " which would have been more prisoners than the whole Austrian army contained of men ; a narrative " tinged with undue bias ; " and a historical work " closing with a ray of glory ; " " it could hardly have been anticipated that it would have been attended by effects , " &amp;c. , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this : " In 1789 GOthe. profound and imaginative , was reflecting on the destiny of man on earth , like a cloud which turns up its silver lining to the moon ; " or this astronomical glorification of the age of George III. , " Bright as were the stars of its morning-light , more brilliant still was the constellation which shone forth at its meridian splendor or cast a glow over the twilight of its evening shades , " which is neither poetry nor science . Again , he says , speaking of modern enterprise and emigration , which he capriciously calls the second dispersion of mankind : " No such powerful causes . producing the dispersion of the species , have come into operation since mankind were originally separated on the Assyrian plains ; and it took place " - what took place ? - " from an attempt springing from the pride and ambition of man as vain as the building of the tower of Babel . " The first three sentences of the Preface to his New Series read thus : " During a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly perceived , on a first and superficial glance , as when they are marked by the decisive events of war ; but they are not on that account the less obvious when their respective limits have been once ascertained . The triumphs of parties in the Senate-house or Forum are not , in general , followed by the same immediate and decisive results as those of armies in the field ; * * * but they are equally real and decisive . " The triple duty imposed upon decisive , in these three sentences , is a characteristic that we may pick out of almost any page of Mr. Alison 's writings . It is because these secondary defects are so habitual with him , marring his most studied and elaborate passages , that we speak of them at length ; but they should not be allowed to detain us from the consideration of those more grievous faults which mark his works as a sys tematic historian , or one who wr , tes according to an avowed scheme . Mr. Alison 's arrangement comprehends the history of Europe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closed in 1815 ; and the second part , of which the first volume only is issued , is intended to carry on the narrative to our own day . Now , what will be the surprise of the reader to learn that , in the proposed systematic view of Europe , there is scarcely more than a reference to those great movements of thought , to those grand discoveries in science , to those magnificent moral enterprises , of which we have spoken in the outset of this article , as so characteristic of the period ? The whole ten volumes of his first series are exclusively occupied with the French revolution and the wars that grew out of it , while " the literature , the manners , the arts , and th' social changes , " which he admits are far more permanently interesting and important than the doings of statesmen in general , are quite omitted ! A critic has well objected to Niebuhr , in his ilistoryof Rome , that he should have exhausted his effort* in clearing up and rendering intelligible the merely civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or nothing besides of the people themselves , of their ideas and feelings , their religious morality and domestic relations , of their women as well as their men , of their children and their education , and of their slaves and the treatment of slaves . " The central idea of the Roman religion and polity , " he says . " the family , scarcely shows itself in his voluminous works , except in connection with the classification of the citizens ; nor are we made to perceive in what the beliefs and modes of conduct of the Romans . respecting things in general , agreed , and in what disagreed , with those of the rest of the ancient world . Yet the mysteries of the Romans and their fortunes must be there . " But with how much more pertinency and force may we apply similar objections to the oversights of Alison , who speaks of wars , and battles , and intrig*ie* as if Europe , for the last half century , had done nothing but fight . Were all the Europeans ministers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other characters are permitted to figure on the scene 1 Were there no other movements but those of armies , no words uttered but those of protocols , no letters written but the cipher of secret agents , or the dispatches of commissaries ? Had not those thirty millions of Frenchmen , and those other millions of Germans , Spaniards . Italians , Russians , English , &amp;c. , who make up the noun of multitude Europe , like Shylock , " eyes , organs , senses , aft*tion* // passions , " or had they only hands to handle swords , and bodies that were targets for cannon ? If we were left to Mr. Alison 's accounts alone , for our sources of information we should be compelled to give a most abhorrent answer to these questions , and to suppose that Christendom , for a quarter of a century , had been surrendered to Milton 's apostate angels , who " only in destruction took delight . " His pages remind us of the Salon des Batailles , at Versailles , where every picture is some grand state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the carcasses of the slain , with noisy trumpeters in the foreground , and vast masses of lurid smoke blotting out the green earth and the skies . We are not unaware , as we trust we have shown , of the surpassing greatness of the external events of which his history is composed , nor do we complain of the minute and laborious zeal with which he has gathered every particular concerning them ransackin , archives and measuring fields of slaughter ; but we do complain that he has allowed the tumult and dust of these vast contests to stop his ears and blind his eyes to every object but themselves . Mr. Alison acknowledges this serious deficiency in the preface to his second series , and attempts to supply it by a promise to present " subjects of study more generally interesting than the weightier matters of social and political change , " giving a chapter of the literary history of England in the body of the work , by way of specimen ; but the reparation comes too late ; for we can not see with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ouaht to have commenced in 1789 or how he can be so weak as to suppose that desultory sketches of certain prominent writers and discoveries , is a history of Arts , Manners , Literature and Society . These have as much a connected life , interdependent relations , and an order of development , as the " weightier matters of social and political change , " and , in any consistent historical survey , ought to be treated with the same abounding completeness and accuracy . A few scraps of commonplace criticism , such as one reads in the book notices of Ladies ' Magazines , or in the essays of young collegians , scraps loosely strung together by mere contemporaneousness or sequence of time , and as if their subjects had no relation , either to the spirit of the age , or to the condition and movements of society , can not be called history , even in the lowest sense of the term ; much less can they be called systematic history . Yet it is precisely such scraps that he has set before us in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arts and Manners in Great Britain after the Peace , " a chapter designed to shadow forth his intentions as to the future treatment of the Literature , Art , &amp;c. , of the rest of Europe . Preluding with a brief reference to the rapid growth of steam navigation and of cotton manufactures , and to the impulse given to intellectual activity by great wars , he sketches the literary or artistic characters of Scott , Byron , Rogers , Southey , Wordsworth , Coleridge , Paley , Malthus , Hersehell , and others , down to Miss O'Nell , and helen Faucett . We say , sketches , though a meagre term like that even can hardly be applied to the wretched skeletons he parades as life . Not to remark upon the singular anachronism that many of his personages , such as Paley , Sir Thomas Lawrence Scott , Crabbe , Dugald Stewart , Davy , Kemble , Hersehell , &amp;c. , attained their chief celebrity before , instead of " after the Peace " ; nor upon the still more singular oversight , of omitting utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faraday from that of philosophers , and Godwin from the novelists , and De Quincey and Leigh Hunt from the critics , and Sheridan Knowles from the dramatists ; we must say that his characterizations of the men he names are the most puerile , vague , and unsatisfactory that we ever read in a book of any pretension . As to any distinct , positive , or discriminating description of the distinguishing peculiarities of these worthies , there is none ; " charming , " " delightful , " " fine , " " brilliant , " " graphic , " " interesting , " are the epithets that exhaust his thesaurus , and which are applied equally to all , with a slight change of posture , in each different sentence . Take Tennyson , whose merits and defects as a poet are alike salient , and seizable , for an example of Mr. Alison 's method of estimating liter ry character . " Tennyson , " he says , " has opened a new vein in English poetry , and shown that real genius , even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chord , and , departing from the hackneyed ways of imitation , charm the world by the conceptions of original thought . His imagination wide and discursive as the dreams of fancy , wanders at will , not over the real so much as the ideal world . The grottoes of the sea , the caves of the mermaid , the realms of heaven , are alternately the scenes of his song . His versification , wild as the song of the elfin king , is broken and irregular , but often inexpressibly charming . Sometimes , however , this tendency leads him into conceit ; in the endeavor to be original , he becomes fantastic ; there is a freshness and originality , however , about his conceptions , // which contrast strangely , with the practical and interested views , which influenced the age in which he lived , and contributed not a little to their deserved success . They were felt to be the more charming , because they were so much at variance with the prevailing ideas around him and reopened those fountains of romance , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often closed by the cares , the anxieties , and the rivalry of the world . " Now this mass of verbiage , this feebleness , nonsense , and mixed metaphor , might have been written , if any one but Mr. Alison could have written it , about any poet that has flourished since Pope , and would have given a reader ignorant of him , just as clear an idea of his qualities as all . Tennyson 's subtle insight , intellectual intensity , deep mystical imagination , refined spiritual fancy , elaborate sculptural art , and pervading melody , or any other traits that separate bim from the rest of his tribe , are terra incognita to the " great historian , " who seems , also , quite as innocent of any real knowledge of all the other two or three score personages whom he attempts to delineate . We meet once more , too , in this literary patchwork , with Mr. Alison 's fondness for repetition , and read , not without amusement of Scott 's " widespread reputation , " Byron 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread interest of Moore 's lines , " Campbell 's " widespread fame , " Dickens 's " widespread reputation , " - phrases that recur on every second page-on the very pages , indeed , in which we are informed truly enough , that " repetition and monotony are the bane of literature and imagination .

" Fine qualities these for a judga ! Nor are we less amused in hearing that Wilson , the truculent editor of Blackwood , " wields his aerial flights through the heavens , without alighting , or carin* for the concerns of the lower world , " i. e .

" We might fill a volume with such crude and preposterous judgments , if we had space to waste in copying them ,  --  judgments formed without principles , and expressed in the loose language of the newspapers . Of criticism as an art-an art which treats the great products of literature and science , as the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , and related to the age in which they were produced , by the profoundest ties and influences-Mr . Alison appears to have no more conception than a common house-painter has of the chemistry of the colors he uses . When he has given us the title of a writer 's principal works , adduced a few facts of hi* external life , told us that he was charming , widely celebrated , and enduringly known , and that he was a man of some moral convictions , he fancies that he has written a history of that writer . But of his individuality , as distinguished from other writers , from what standpoint or under what circumstances , he looked on life and nature and interpreted their lessons , or of his relations to great contemporaneous developments in the same sphere , as well as in // other spheres , we are taught literally nothing . Sir Walter Scott , as a novelist , for instance , was an altogether peculiar and significant phenomenon , makingits appearance in the midst of English literature , to revive the images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world was agitated , and rushing on to an unknown future . What then did he express , what were his uses , what his value to the age ? Can a thoughtful mind consider him , without asking questions such as these ? Has he any real interest to us , as a fact of history , except in his relations to the general course of literature and to the general life of society ? Yet Mr. Alison is satisfied with a few personal details , and a very vague talk about his " brilliancy of fancy , " his " poetic conceptions , " his " great and varied powers , " and that poetic temperament which " threw over the pictures of memory , the radiance of the imagination ; " adding , as a proof ; both of his morality and immortality , in true Alisonian style , that " nothing ever permanently floated down the stream of time but what was buoyant from its elevating tendency ! " Coleridge was no less than Scott a notable man , not in himself merely , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of his generation , and the new era which he may be said to have created in the speculative tendencies of the English mind . More than any man of his age , therefore , he deserves at the hands of the historian , a rigid analysis of his splendid powers , and a careful estimate of his bearing upon contemporary thought . At the least , he should have been described as something more than a considerable poet , and an excellent translator , " with a strongly metaphysical turn of mind , " less " abstract and philosophical , " though " more pictorial and dramatic " than Wordsworth , and not destined to " lasting celebrity , " because his " ideas and images are too abstract . " Our readers may , perhaps , object that it is too much to expect of Alison any philosophical view , either of men or things ; and we should admit the force of the objection if he were not constantly thrusting his reflections , which are meant to be philosophical , into the course of his narrative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his attempted portraitures of character , he deals sweeping judgments " round the land , " uttering them with the most positive confidence , and claiming for them at times the authority of Heaven . We are bound , consequently , to look a little into his right to assume this lofty judicial attitude , voL. and to ask ourselves on what principles he proceeds in his elaborate philosophical reflections . It is difficult , we confess , to ascertain distinctly what his philosophical views are ; but as near as we can gather them from the maxims and theories he is fond of sporting , they amount to this : that man is universally corrupt , destitute alike of the goodness which should prompt him into the right path , and of the intellect always to discern ft ; and as an inevitable result , running perpetually into lamentable errors , from which he is alone saved by an inscrutable Providence . Thus , when a French Revolution comes , in a sudden access of frenzy , to spread its wickedness over the continent a sober and constitutional England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus when a wicked Mr. Peel contracts the currency or establishes free trade , to the infinite damage of the landed aristocracy , Providence opens the way to California , to supply the precious metals and give an impulse to emigration : thus , on every occasion when the iniquity and short-sightednass of mirtals get them into hopeless straits , Providence step*i in with its methods of relief ! Now , we have as much faith in Providence as Mr. Alison , but we differ from him in believing that it works , through human agcincy and according to a fixed and intelligible order , which is no further inscrutable than we are ignorant , and which shows no favor either " to the just or unjust , " but proceeds in every respect rationally because it is itself the Supreme Reason . There was a class of talewrights and dramatists in German literature which somebody called the Need-and-HelpSchool , because it was their habit to allow their characters to fall into all manner of dangers and difficulties , in order at the critical moment to come to their aid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all off at once . They very well illustrate the kind of Providence to which Mr. Alison seems to commit the universe ,  --  a Providence which creates a certain number of ninnies and villains , places them in the midst of the scenery in which they are to move , sets them at work until they are all at loggerheads and begin to throttle the life out of each other , and then at last , interposes to make a display of its own adroitness and compassion . We say this seems to he his theory of the course of providential guidance , inasmuch as he is not always consistent in his expositions , accounting for the French Revolution , in one place , for example by alleging that it was a part of " the universal frenzy which at times seizes mankind from causes inscrutable to hu // man wisdom ; " and yet , in another place , assigning a dozen natural causes , in the oppressions of the previous reigns , for all its sanguinary violence ; or again , insisting on the radical depravity of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while at the same time he tries to make out that there is , after all , a steady progress and general improvement of the race . But , it is evident that both these views can not be true ; for if there is progress , there must be a law of progress , and consequently , no incessant proclivity to evil ; or if there is that uniform proclivity to evil , then there can be no general progress , only a capricious , occasional , and useless fluctuation between good and evil . We must do Mr. Alison the justice , however , to confess that for the most part he adopts the obscurant theory , or that view of human affairs which , when it can not confirm its own prejudices by the actual facts of the case , refers the whole to inscrutable wisdom . As a matter of course , then , he distrusts all popular movements , even to the extent of doubting whether popular education does any good ; regards representative government every where as a failure , detesting the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success ; imagines England to be on the verge of bankruptcy and dissolution , because freetrade has been carried there and the popular element of the constitution is coming into the ascendant ; is filled with consternation by every proposal of change , and vaticinates like another Jeremiah over the entire future . In short , we do not know a philosopher on the face of the earth , who , ifhis own philosophic essays on man and nature are correct , ought to feel more uncomfortable than he , in the present advancing condition and brightening prospects of mankind . We shall not , therefore , quarrel with him for his inveterate , silly , and miserable toryism ; nor take him to task , as we might , for those reiterated misrepresentations in which he chooses to indulge in respect to the character and progress of Democracy , particularly as it has developed itself in this country ( for he appears quite incorrigible in both respects , being either insensible to the force of facts , or meanly unwilling to admit them ) , but , on the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties of his position . A man who writes the history of the nineteenth century , under a serious conviction that its experiences are a solemn warning against liberalism , is one of the saddest spectacles that can be presented to our eyes . The labor of Sisyphus was nothing to his : the fruitless experiments of the Danaides were nothing . in short , nothing but that swimming pig , by which Southey in the Devil 's Walk , illustrates England 's commercial prosperity , can be his parallel . Every stroke that he makes only cuts his own throat ,  --  every fact that he records upsets his theory . Or* rather , he isobliged to read the riddle of things backwards . We ought not consequently to have been surprised , as we were a little way back , that Mr. Alison should give such sterile and incomplete accounts of the great movements in literature science and practical art , which have distinguished the years of which he writes . If he had done so , with any completeness , he would have been compelled to abandon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human affairs quite damaging to his pet notions of the extreme naughtiness and littleness of God 's last creation Man . lIe was prudent , if not wise , in time ! Gervinus , one of the most accomplished and profound of German historians , lately sentenced to prison at Baden for the publication of his opinions , taking up the doctrine of Aristotle , that the law of human development was from the participation of the few to that of the many in government demonstrates and confirms it by the subsequent experience of two thousand years . It is not a fancy , he says , nor an opinion , nor a declamatory phrase , nor a hypothetical judgment , but the absolute , scientific order , as certain as the courses of the stars , or the process of growth in the individual being . But what Gervinus proves , mainly in the political sphere , made still more manifest by the entire course and consequence of the development of literature and science , is particularly striking in the wonderful achievements of the last half century . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocratic maxims and practices , in the ameliorations it has wrought in the spirit of the laws , in the growing political power , moral elevation , and intellectual enlightenment of the masses of the people , in the almost universal diffusion of letters , as well as in their humanitarian tone , in the greater cheapness of all the appliances of everyday life , whereby the luxuries of the past age have become the daily comforts of this in the prodigious movements imparted to trade , by the discovery of new outlets for population , new fields for labor , new rewards for enterprise ; in short , in the indescribably numerous and inexhaustible sources of enjoyment and wealth bestowed upon all communities by the revelations of science and their practical applications , we find the condition of mankind advanced beyond even the dreams of // the most sanguine enthusiasts of former generations , and we see in them , also a pledge of the more rapid and surprising conquests of the future . But Mr. Alison finds in them , and sees in them , no such things ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished notions of law and order , and sees in their future promises only another " dispersion of mankind , " like that on the plains of Shinar , produced , too , by the same unholy pride and ambition which raised the vain tower at Babel ! Now it is becau*se he does not find and see these things , or , in other words because he does not comprehend the spirit of the age he undertakes to describe , but stands in a relation of antagonism to it , that we pronounce him quite incapable of his task . We do not wish any actual specimens of his unskilfulness to convince us of his unfitness . He may string facts together with never so much industry , describe isolated scenes with the animation of a Napier , analyze individual character with the eye of a Scott ; but so long as the characters and events he portrays are no more than so mnny shadows dancing upon the wall ,  --  as they must be to the mind which has no clear and consistent clue to their movements , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not become their historian . A Sandwich islander , suddenly placed before the footlights at Niblo 's , when Sontag or Alboni is electrifying the intelligent spectators with splendid visions of beauty and enjoyment , might as well hope to write a competent criticism of the performance for the next day 's Tribune , as a historian of Mr. Alison 's sympathies to depict the Nineteenth Century . Granting that he sees the incidents and events with as comprehensive and minute an eye as any other man , he can yet see only the outside of them , like the Otaheitan at the play ; he does not see the motives of the performer , nor the scope of the drama . The principle which explains all  --  the struggle for human freedom-that contest of man for the mastery of nature , of society , of himself ; which is the open secret of all history , he winks out of sight , and puts in its place some marrowless , and conservative , highchurch dogma . Nor is it less true of history in general , than it is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guiding principle of freedom , it is a vast and innavigable ocean , clouded with mists , and darkness . The historian , who puts his little bark forth into it , moves forward without compass or chart . Innumerable counter-currents of tradition baffle him on all sides ; huge sand-banks of authority arrest his course ; the coral reefs of prejudice and the wrecks of stranded systems scrape his keel the storms and winds of fierce war harry the atmosphere , so that he is driven he knows not whither , and makes the shore when he arrives at all , by the merest chance . But had he carried with him the chart and compass , supplied by even a dim perceptio# of that great law of freedom , which is the principle of all the evolutions of history , he might have defied the tempests and mastered the stormy seas , beholding beyond the chaos of the elements a beautiful sunshine and the green world of peace . But , without protracting this discussion which the amiable editors of Putnam warn us already encroaches upon the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close by saying that this , then is our estimate of the great English historian : that he is an e*ceedingly patient collector of facts , and sometimes an ani* mated , but generally a drowsy and bungling narrator of them ; that his style is too often slipshod , awkward and ungrammatical ; that his statements maybe relied upon for the most part , except where the United States and democratic institutions are concerned when his vehement prejudices bewray him into the grossest misrepresentations ; but that his alarming deficiency in any general views , especially in broad and consistent principles of historical philosophy , which would enable him to detect the real inward life of society , renders him quite incompetent to a worthy discharge of the functions of an historian , especially of the period which he has undertaken to describe .
