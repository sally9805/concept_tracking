JOHN C. CALHOUN . THE sad , though not wholly unexpected announcement of the death of JOHN C. CALHOUN , which reached us early last month , calls upon us for a tribute of respect to the many virtues and genius of the illustrious deceased . Such a tribute can not be more honorably , or more appropriately paid , than by presenting a brief sketch of the career of Mr. Calhoun , accompanied with such reflections upon his public services and character as the occasion is calculated to suggest . For nearly forty years Mr. Calhoun has been engaged in the service of the Federal Government . His fame is national . Jt belongs not to South Carolina alone , but to the entire Union . We might , indeed , call him " the illustrious Southerner , " as he styled Washington in his last speech in the Senate ; but we can also speak of him , and so will history speak of hun hereafter , as the illustrious American . The whole Union has a right to be proud of that distinguished name which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Southern sympathies , was not sectional in the narrow and partial acceptance of that term . True , he loved the South-he was devoted to her interests-he stood forth ever as the champion of her institutions , when he believed them unjustly assailed . The very prominence of his position , and the greatness of his talents , made him more than ever " the illustrious Southerner . " He was regarded as the chosen champion of Southern rights-at once the Ulysses and the Ajax  --  the head to conceive wise councils , and the strong hand to fight the battle . This endeared him to a large portion of the Southern people , particularly the people of his native State , which never failed to sustain him in every emergency . But his affection for the South and his native State , was not conceived in that exclusive spirit of sectionalism , whose narrow vision is bounded by a geographical line . His was a nobler and more expansive patriotism . It was co-extensive with the Union , entirely and thoroughly American . The whole American people-the woodsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fertile savanna of the South-even the pioneer from the wilderness territory of the far West ; all lave the right to regard him , with his illustrious contemporaries of an age that is passed away-with Madison and Monroe-with John Quincy Adams and Gallatin , not to speak of one or two of his distinguished colleagues who still survive-as an American Statesman , and one of those whose great names properly belong to the history of the whole Republic . Mr. Calhoun expired on the 31st of March last , at the city of Washington , in the sixty - seventh year of his age . Like the venerable Adams , he died in the service of his country-almost like him , too , struck down in his seat in the National Legislature . He delivered his last great speech , through the lips of his colleague , upon the floor of the Senate , but a short time before his death . It is a great and masterly speech , bearing upon it the marks of careful and most elaborate preparation , and evincing not the slightest decay of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried , wrapped up in flannels , to the House of Lords , a dying man , to make that last noble appeal , in the midst of VOL. xxvI. - NO . CXLIII. 2 // which he was struck down , and borne away to the chambers of death . Mirabeau was five times in the tribune on the last day of his stormy public career , although the fire of disease was consuming his vitals , and never had his genius shone more resplendent . As he finally descended the tribune , be whispered to the friend on whom he leaned , " take me away from this , " and was carried to his bed of death , and his ephemeral restingplace in the Pantheon . Like these great men , the mind of Mr. Calhoun in his last public effort , shone brightly out amid physical weakness and decay , and his intellectual faculties continued with unabated vigor to the end . But how unlike the stately and Ciceronian periods of the English orator , or the impassioned and ostentatious eloquence of the French tribune , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last great speech of the American Statet3man ! Chatham tottered into the House of Lords in all the consciousness of his dignity , fully sensible of the proud eminence of his position . Mirabeau went to the French As .. sembly with more than his usual egotism of character , to confound his enemies , to dazzle the spectators , and to come down from the tribune , as he declared , either dead or victorious . Calhoun took his seat in the Senate weak and emaciated with disease , without display or ostentationwithout a single effort to catch the breath of popular applause , and apparently unconscious that the eyes of the people of thirty sovereign States were upon him , and solely to discharge what he felt to be a solemn duty .. The contrast is striking and characteristic . A full history of the life of Mr. Calhoun , will be the task of some future biographer . Our present limits forbid the attempt . The materials for such a history are rich , varied , and copious . They lie plentifully strewn through our public archives during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1811 , and has remained in the public ser .. vice almost without cessation from that day to the present . The period of his public life embraces the history of two foreign wars , two separate acquisitions of territory , each of which in itself is an empire ; important treaties and negociations of every description , the charter of a national bank and its final overthrow , the compromise tariff act , and the Missouri compromise . A minute history of his services , with a collection of his best speeches upon these momentous questions , would be a political history of the government . It would require volumes , where we have only pages at our command , and we shall , therefore , not enter here upon the task . It is enough to say , that upon every issue he occupied a prominent and an influential position . In the arena of debate , whether in the Senate or House of Representatives , he found no champion of intellectual strength greater than his own ; and though he sometimes encountered an opponent more fully clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a flying adversary would find upon him a vulnerable spot , yet the point of his spear , driven with unerring skill , rarely failed in return to reach the fleetest archer of them all , or to pierce the strongest armor of proof . Upon the floor of the Senate , that splendid arena of intellectual combat , where his last years were spent , his greatest triumphs were achieved . It was here that he was best known , and most illustrious . Him , among the first , the curious eye of the stranger was wont to seek on entering the Senate chamber , " Micat , inter omnes , Julium sidus " - * * * * // 403 illustrious and distinguished among his compeers , and such compeers , too , as his great rivals , WEBSTER and CLAY , whose names will remain for posterity associated with his upon the page of our parliamentary history . Mr. Calhoun 's father was a native of Ireland . His mother was a Virginian lady , by the name of Caidwell . He was born on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , South Carolina . Until his eighteenth year , we are told , he had been able to avail himself of but few of the advantages of education . A small stock of books , some of them historical , were all the materials afforded him for study . In his nineteenth year he first applied himself to study , with a view to professional life , and such was his quickness and vigor of mind , that in two years he prepared himself to enter the junior class of Yale College , where he graduated two years after with distinguished honors . In 1807 he was admitted to practice at the bar in South Carolina , and for several years he continued the practice of his profession , in which he was fast rising to eminence at the time of his entrance into public life . The detail of Mr. Calhoun 's professional career we have not seen stated in any biographical notice . Doubtless , it contains many passages of interest , and many exhibitions of mental power , which foreshadowed his future greatness . His mind , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined subtleties , as well as to grasp the broadest principles of legal science-comprehensive , yet acute - able at once to generalize , and yet to trace the nicest distinctionsmeasuring with a glance , and by intuition , the full merits of the question at issue , and yet never suffering the minutest point of an argument to escape him . Had Mr. Calhoun continued in the practice of his profession , he must have risen to distinction at the bar . Forensic talent and eloquence , it is true , are not always the best adapted to deliberative bodies , nor does eminence in one sphere argue success in the other . Erskine , one of the most brilliant lawyers of his age , failed in parliament ; and it is quite certain that Sheridan would have made an indifferent figure at the bar . But the mental constitution of Mr. Calhoun was such , we think , as to fit him equally for eminence in the Forum or in the Senate . He did not , however , long pursue his professional calling . His great ability soon attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more distinguished career . After a service of two sessions in his State Legislature , Mr. Calhoun was elected in 1811 , by a large majority , a representative in the 12th Congress . Though comparatively a stranger , yet his name had preceded him , and he found himself not wholly unknown in a body composed of such men as Clay , Randolph , Porter , Lowndes , Cheves , Quincy , Breckenridge , and Grundy  --  a body of representatives that has not been excelled , if equalled , since the foundation of the government . Mr. Clay himselfand certainly no one is more competent to pass such a judgment than he-lately declared in the Senate , that since his entrance into the service of the government , there has not been assembled such a galaxy of eminent and able men as were those Congresses which declared the ivar , and which immediately followed the peace . The same high authority , speaking of Mr. Calhoun , then not yet thirty years of age , says , that he stood among that galaxy " a star bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war resolutions , no one was in advance of him in advocating the cause of his country , and in denouncing the injustice which // 404 John C. Calhoutr. compelled that country to arms. * The first speech of Mr. Calhoun , in reply to a formidable antagonist , John Randolph , and in support of the administration of Mr. Madison , fully developed his extraordinary powers We shall not now speak of that admirable speech . It has been preserved , and has , doubtless , been extensively read by the admirers of Mr. Calhoun . It is more ornate , has more vivacity , more of impassioned declamation , we think , than any of his later and maturer efforts ; yet it is distinguished by the same characteristics of style  --  the same curt , nervous , compact sentences-the same severe propriety of diction  --  the same logical method. , and intense energy of language , which mark all the best spccimens of his oratory . Soon after his entrance into Congress , he was made Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and with Messrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously sustained the war to its close , and none rendered more efficient service than he . The creation of an immense national debt , a disordered commerce , and disordered finances , were the immediate results of the war of 1812 . The charter of the old United States Bank had expired , and an unsuccessful attempt had been made , in 1811 , to revive it . To relieve the pressing necessities of the country , and to provide what , in the judgment of the financiers of that period , should be , if not a sovereign panacea , at least a temporary relief to the embarrassments of the currency , a national bank was again proposed . Mr. Calhoun , then Chairman of the Committee on Currency , to whom the President 's recommendation on the subject had been referred , presented , on the Sthof January , 1816 , an able and elaborate report , recommending the creation of such an institution , and detailing its operation . The bill subsequently reported was sustained also by Mr. Clay , and became a law . Fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this great financial questionthe one advocating it with a zeal quickened and re-invigorated by years , the other opposing it with all the earnestness of a deep and thorough conviction . It is no part of our design to attempt a defence , or even an explanation , of any apparent inconsistency of action in the public career of this distinguished statesman . His political life speaks for itself , and its record is his best interpreter and his best defender . Not only upon this financial question , but also upon the protective policy , is the allegation of change and inconsistency charged agaiast him . It is certainly true that , on the 12th of March , 1816 , Mr. Lowndes , of South CarQlina , from the Committee of Ways and Means , made a report relative to the policy of increasing the revenue by heavy duties ; and that Mr. Calhoun , in opposition to Mr. Webster , sustained the bill , which was subsequently reported . The interests embraced in the question and its political aspect , were doubtless different then from now ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have not Mr. Calhoun 's speech at hand , and do not now recollect whether the constitutional question was discussed at all , or , indeed , whether his speech extended so far as to advocate the imposition of duties for protection beyond the revenue limit . If so , we regard his views , as we are free to say we do his course upon the bank question , as an error-an error , however , not without strong and cogent reasons for its commission . Mr. Madison himself , under his constitu // 405 tional o ' *th of office , recommended to Congress the establishment of a bank , " as the best , and perhaps the only adequate resource to relieve the country and the government from the prcsent embarrassment ; " and however much , with the light of past experience shining on our path , we may regard this opinion as unsound , and the recommendation as unwise , yet it would be presumptuous to say that the measure , endorsed by such a statesman as James Madison , was then manifestly unconstitutional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun by any reference to Mr. Madison 's opinions upon this subject , His purity of character and lofty patriotism need no vindication at our hands . If he erred , it was simply an error of judgment ; if he subsequently adopted different views , it was under a change of circumstances which called for it , or upon a thorough conviction of his error-not from sinister motives , far less from fickleness of purpose or caprice . In December , 1817 , Mr. Calhoun was appointed by President Monroe , Secretary of War ; and during the whole period of Mr. Monroe 's administration , he conducted the business of that department with unparalleled energy and vigor . At the close of this administration , he was elected Vice-President , by a vote of 182 out of 261 votes in the electoral college . The election of President , it is well known , went into the House of Representatives , and Mr. Adams was chosen . The honors of the VicePresidency were again conferred upon him , in the election which elevated Andrew Jackson to the Presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over without comment , not for the reason that it is not full of rich historical , as well as biographical incidents , but because , honorable and distinguished though it was by the noblest public service , it is not , in our judgments , so well calculated to illustrate his character as a statesman , for the reason that it afforded no opportunity for the exercise of those splendid parliamentary talents upon which his renown chiefly rests . We look upon this part of his career as to him the least fortunate . The honors of these distinguished positions can add but little additional lustre to his fame , and he passed there many of the most valuable years of his life  --  a period sufficiently long of itself to have enabled a genius like his , in a more appropriate sphere , to earn an immortality of renown . He was fitted by nature for the legislative , rather than the administrative branch of a free government ; he was adapted to the Senate , rather than the Cabinet . We turn , therefore , without regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors and inactivity of the Vice-Presidency , and placed his foot once more upon his " native heath , " as a Senat South Carolina . or in Congress , from It is not our design to revive the personal controversies and political animosities of that period ; and if we allude to them at all , it is solely with a view to illustrate the character and opinions of the departed statesman who is the subject of this sketch . It is well known that during the administration of General Jackson , a personal disagreement occurred between the President and Mr. Calhoun , the nature and merits of which it is not necessary now to discuss . The breach was widened by the famous nullification controversy , which sprang up during Mr. Calhoun 's VicePresidency , and which led him eventually to resign his place as President of the Senate , for the purpose of becoming a member of that body . The passage of the tariff act of 1828-that " bill of abominations , " as // its opponents styled it-led to the nullification resolutions of South Carolina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of all who entertain any reminiscence of that period . In November , 1832 , the Legislature of South Carolina ratified an ordinance , declaring the tariff act utterly unconstitutional and void , on the ground of its being a protective , and not a revenue act . The state claimed the right in virtue of its own sovereignty , to pronounce upon the unconstitutionality of a law of the general government , or , in other words , to determine upon for itself , and , if necessary , resist any infraction of the constitutional compact existing between the states . South Carolina threatened to oppose by force the execution of the revenue laws . It is unnecessary to add the fact so well known , that Mr. Calhoun fully coincided in these extreme views . Hitherto he had given them countenance only by the silent influence of his character , and in private conversation . He was about to become their open advocate in a more conspicuous position . The State of South Carolina was at this period represented in the Senate by an able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man of splendid talents and genius , a ready and skilful debater , and every way fitted by study and acquirements , as well as by the force of his natural abilities , to occupy the very first rank as a parliamentary leader . He had encountered Mr. Webster in debate , and the friends of each had claimed the victory . The contest had been no idle flourish of rhetoric-no strife of pigmies-no tilting of knights with blunted weapons in the lists of the tournament  --  but a war of the giants ; a stern encounter of determined and nearly equal opponents , with sharp steel and pointed spears . It is no disparagement even to the splendid abilities of Mr. Hayne to say , that he was scarcely a match in debate for the massive intellect and brawny strength of Webster . In the preliminary skirmishes , the rapid advarrce , the attack and the skillful retreat , he sometimes gained the advantage ; hut in the stern hand-to-hand encounter , when the cooler nature of the Massachusetts senator was fully aroused , and nothing but superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then that the senator from South Carolina was made to feel the stunning weight of the blows which fell from the potent arm of his antagonist . The ardor of Mr. Hayne 's temper sometimes beguiled him into an imprudent expression , and laid him open to a scathing retort from his adversary . In the memorable debate in the Senate , in 1830 , he hurled the sarcastic taunt at his opponent : " Has the gentleman discovered , in former controversies with the gentleman from Missouri , that he is overmatched by that senator ?  --  and does he hope for an easy victory over a more feeble adversary ? , while the excited and angry tone of the speaker robbed the expression of its irony , and left only its bitterness behind . The reply of Webster was overwhelming . In its power of sarcasm and its scathing , yet perfectly dignified invective , it has rarely been surpassed - superior , in our judgment , to the celebrated reply of Pitt to Walpole , and equal to the best of Brougham 's former efforts in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to cease . Hayne was elected chief magistrate of his native state , in the crisis of its affairs with the general government , and a greater than Llayne was selected to fill his place in the Senate of the United States . In December , 1832 , soon after the passage of the famous South Carolina ordinance , Mr. Calhoun // resigned the Vice Presidency , and was elected a senator in Congress . In no event of his life did he ever exhibit more decisively his moral courage and independence of character . His state was upon the eve of rebellion . His own views , as to the right of her resistance , were well known . He stood in a position of hostility to the administration , and many of the friends with whom he had formerly acted . It was even conjectured by some , that he would be arrested on his journey to Washington . But he did not falter for an instant . Like the remarkable man , then at the head of the government , he had that determined will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of principle , through fear of the danger of asserting it . Between these two men , we may think there may be traced certain striking points of resemblance , as well as of contrast . Both are ardent , determined , resolute , strong-willed . Calhoun had the concentrated energy of thought ; Jackson , the concentrated energy of action . The one acted as promptly as the other spoke , and both with the same fearless independence , and the same lofty sternness of purpose . It was thought that a difficulty would rest with Mr. Calhoun in taking the Constitutional oath ; but that question he had himself settled , and decisively settled in his own mind . He had resolved not to violate an*q provision of the Constitution . Had he conceived state resistance to a law which he believed manifestly unconstitutional , to be an infraction of the Constitution , John C. Calhoun was the last man in the Union , who would have taken upon his lips that solemn oath , no matter .1 what private or public interests were to be subserved by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his part , as he calmly , yet seriously repeated the oath to support the Constitution of the United States . Not a senator on that floor designed more religiously to observe it than he . A history of the debates which followed Mr. Calhoun 's entrance into the Senate , would lead us far beyond our limits . The chief antagonist whom he found to encounter , was Daniel Webster . The first question of debate between them was , in one sense , an abstract question  --  a theory , merely ; but it was a theory , on the stability of which , the whole framework of Mr. Calhoun 's argument rested . It involved the profoundest *question , perhaps , which can occupy the attention of the American statesman  --  the question as to the nature of our government , and the true character of the instrument which we call the Constitution . The views of Mr. Webster were strongly federal ; those of Mr. Calhoun went to the furthest verge of the States-rights doctrines of Mr. Jefferson , and even so far beyond , as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the Union of these States a mere temporary league , to be dissolved at the pleasure of any member . In order to explain the Constitutional construction of Mr. Calhoun , which led him to infer the resistance of the right in a state , to nullify the a9tion of the general government , as opposed to the fundamental doctrines laid down in that magnificent proclamation of General Jackson , believed to have been penned by Edward Livingstsn-*nIiat other pen could have produced it ?  --  and distinguished not less for its e*ance of style , and beauty of diction , than for its cogent and conclusive argument , we yet deem it but fair to state , briefly , the point at issue between him and Mr. Webster , as we find it developed in the dejates . The Senator from Massachusetts maintained that the Constitution was not merely a compact between the States , but a fundamental law-the // supreme sovereign law of the land  --  and that its ratification rendered it binding , not merely as a league or confederation between the States , as independent sovereignties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . forming , to the extent of its delegated power , a nation one and indivisible . The contrary of this proposition was maintained by Mr. Calhoun , . in a speech of transcendent ability , which brought into full play all his acuteness as a dialectitian , and his close and subtle logic . He contended that the adoption of the Constitution wrought no such change in the political condition of the States as Mr. Webster had assumed , and that they retained , precisely , the same elements of sovereignty , save in respect to the exercise of certain powers which they had voluntarily yielded , as under the old confederation . That the Constitution was strictly a compact between sovereign bodies , not a union of the people of the States , and that in virtue of its sovereignty , a state can declare the nature and extent of her obligation under this constitution or compact , the same as in the analogous case of a league , or a treaty of alliance existing between two independent nations . Upon the strength of this position it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Mr. Webster*s view was the true one , the forcible position of South Carolina in the execution of the revenue laws was rebellion . If Mr. Calhoun 's construction was correct , then the ordinance of South Carolina was not an infraction of the Constitution , and that state , or any state was at liberty to annul an act of the general government , or to withdraw from the Union . The discussion of this momentous question was conducted with equal ability on both sides . It will not disparage the acknowledged talent of Mr. Webster , in the opinion of his warmest admirer to say , that he found his equal in debateperhaps under circumstances somewhat modified , he would have found his superior-in the logical acumen and argumentative power of his great rival . The speeches delivered in this memorable discussion , make an instructive chapter in our political history . They form a text-book upon the nature of our Constitution and government , which may be profitably studied , even by statesmen , and will rank among the best speeches of American oratory . A part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Force bill . We regard this , on the whole , as one of the best specimens of his eloquence , combining , as it does , all striking characteristics of his style and mu anner-intense earnestness-close and compact logic-subtle disquisition-dignified invective  --  a tone and spirit not haughty , but proud and firm as that of a man conscious of the purity of his own motives , and the injustice of his assa*1ants . The portion of his speech wherein he repels the charge of disappointed ambition , is admirably fine* It is Miss Martinean , we believe , who calls Mr. Calhoun " the cast iron man , who looks as though he had never been born . " Speaking of his oratorical powers , which she does in terms of judicious admiration , she qualifies her remarks by alluding to the changed manner , the hoarse voice , and the angry emphasis with which he repelled those personal charges brought against hun , of aspiring to the Presidency . On such occasions , doubtless , Mr. Calhoun spoke with an intense feeling , which his manner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud and sensitive spirit ; a feeling of impatience and indignation , at the groundless charge ; the feeling of the caged lion , goaded by tormentors who are beyond his reach , and the language in which he hurled back the charge-impetuous as the mountain torrent , and burning as a flamemust // have been pointed sharper and driven deeper home , by the flashing eye and emphatic voice and gesture of the speaker . The finest passages of this masterly speech occur when he comes to the vindication of the gallant state , whose honor and rights , almost alone in his own person , he is defending . We can not refrain from selecting the following sentences , as a specimen of his intense energy of thought and manner  --  the only complete extract from his speeches , that our present limited space will allow : " It has been said by the senator from Tennessee , to be a measure of peace ! Yes , such peace as the wolf gives to the lamb  --  the kite to the dove ! Such peace as Russia gives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by extinguishing the political existence of the state , by awing her into an abaadonment of the exercise of every power which constitutes her a sovereign community . It is to South Carolina a question of self preservation ; and I proclaim it , that should this bill pass , and an attempt be made to enforce it , it will be RESISTED at every hazard-even that of death itself . Death is not the greatest calamity ; there are others still more terrible to the free and brave , and among them may be placed the loss of liberty and honor . There are thousands of her brave sons , who , if need be , are prepared to lay down their lives in defence of the state , and the great principles of Constitutional liberty for which she is contending God forbid that this should become necessary ! It never can be unless this government is resolved to bring the question to extremity , when her gallant sons will stand piepared to do the last duty  --  to die nobly . " Mr. Clay 's compromise bill , providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun concurred , became a law in March , 1833 , and with its passage , the nullification controversy ended . From the passage of the Compromise Bill to the resignation of his seat in the Senate , in March , 1843 , Mr. Calhoun 's course was signalized by an undeviating adherence to the principles upon which he conceived the Constitution to be based . A close analysis of his recorded votes during this period will show that no man more steadily opposed every measure tending to the consolidation of the government , or which was calculated to invest it with any constructive or doubtful powers . Mr. Calhoun , it is said , was a theorist ; hut his theories were not visionary or speculative ; they were based upon facts , and had to do with practical realities . His theory of government , the result of profound study and meditation , was based upon a few simple propositions of natural right , state sovereignty and constitutional law . It was adhered to in every act of his political life , and he never gave a vote upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effect , and measuring it by the standard of his theoretic principle . Upon the questions of the tariff , the currency , banking , the independent treasury , he stood in the front rank , among those who have zealously guarded the Constit u*on from perversion , who have resisted the encroachments of the Fede *I government upon the rights of the states , and have opposed those financial schemes whose inevitable tendency was to the centralization , as well as the demoralization , of the government . his views upon the currency and the revenue laws , as well as various other grave questions of policy , were wholly with the Democratic party ; they were comprehensive and statesmanlike . It is doubtful if any American statesman has made himself more intimately acquainted with finance and the operation of the revenue laws . Nothing was too complicated for his acute understanding to unravel-nothing too minute to elude his investigation . He spoke with a varied and accurate know . // ledge upon every detail . In his assaults upon that gigantic moneyed institution which threatened the further consolidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in his able and luminous expositions of the doctrines of free trade , he was in advance of the foremost of his contemporaries . His speeches upon these topics were invaluable lessons to the political economist ; he discussed them at once as a philosopher , a statesman and a financier . The broadest principles of political ethics , and the minutest question of finance , theory and statistics , abstract propositions and practical results ,  --  all are found combined to illustrate and enforce his argument , with a logical precision and a clearness of perception rarely equalled . In February , 1844 , Mr. Calhoun , then in private life , was called by President Tyler to fill the office of Secretary of State , in order to conduct the negotiations then pending for the annexation of Texas . His commanding ability and infinence succeeded in carrying through that favorite measure of Democratic policy which has so widely extended the bounds of our Union . At the same time , he conducted the Oregon negotiations with singular ability , and in such a manner as led eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On retiring from the state department , Mr. Calhoun again took his seat in the Senate , where he continued to the end of his life . His course here is too recent and too widely known to require comment , and we have neither the inclination nor the space to attempt it . If he separated from his friends upon the question of the Mexican war , and advocated defensive measures , in opposition to the policy of the administration , he did it in that same manly , open and independent spirit which marked all his actions ; if he spoke freely and warmly upon the slavery question , and if he entertained and advocated extreme opinions , it was , we are assured from his whole life and character , with an honest and candid conviction of the right . That last remarkable speech of his-taken in all its feati*res , the most remarkable , as it is the most elaborate , and one of the ablest compositions he has left behind him-is a complete exposition of his views upon the slavery question ; and no impartial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious reasonings , and its impressive vindication of the South , without being satisfied that its author speaks ( no matter whether erroneously or not ) from the depths of a sincere conviction , and with no sinister or selfish motive . It commences with Mr. Calhoun 's well-known and dignified address : " I have , senators , believed from the first that the agitation on the subject of slavery would , if not prevented by some timely and effective measure , end in disunion ; " and it closes with the solemn declaration : " I have now , senators , done my duty , in expressing my opinions fully , freely and candidly on this solemn occasion . In doing so , I have been governed by the motives which have gover4d me in all the stages of the agitation of the slavery question since its commencement ; and exerted myself to arrest it , with the intention of saving the Union , if it could be done ; and , if it can not , to save the section where it has pleased Providence to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Constitution on its side . Having faithfully done my duty to the best of my ability , both to the Union and my section , throughout the whole of this agitation , I shall have the consolation , let what will come , that I am free from all responsibility . " And thus the life of this great man closed . He appeared , we believe , bat once more in debate . It was on the 13th of March , as he died on // the 31st of the same month . The subject was the slavery question , and Mr. Calhoun joined in the discussion . It was the last gleam of expiring energy exhibited on the theatre where his noblest laurels were won-the last effort of a great spirit struggling with the infirmities of a weak and shattered frame . It was characterized by his colleague , after his decease , in beautiful and touching language , as the exhibition of " the wounded eagle , with his eyes turned to the heavens in which he had soared , but into which his wings could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun was a pattern of simplicity , frankness , and manly independence . Every public act of his life was straightforward and direct . No public man among us had less of the demagogue about him . He never sacrificed a principle to an expediency . He was above the petty combinations and intrigues by which small men ambitiously strive to thrust themselves into great places . He looked with scorn upon the chicanery of politics . He moved straightforward to his purpose , freely disclosing beforehand what that purpose was , and the means by which he hoped to attain it . He adopted his opinions with perfect freedom , without reference to the opinions of others , or one thought of their consequence to himself personally ; and when once adopted , he fearlessly avowed them . His perfect independence is exhibited in many acts of his public life . More than once he separated from his friends upon an important political question , and stood almost alone . When as President of the Senate , he was urged to give a casting vote , contrary to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition with scorn , and declared that no earthly consideration could induce him to do so . He gave his casting vote to recall Mr. Van Buren from England ; and when Mr. Van Buren recommended the Sub-Treasury , he was the first to come forward and sustain his administration . Acting solely from a high sense of duty , he opposed almost alone of his party , the Ten Regiment Bill , and advocated defensive measures in the war with Mexico . In the expression of his opinions even upon abstract and philosophical questions , he was equally independent . He received no dogma upon trust , though it came to him sanctioned by the authority of a great name . He pointed out what he conceived to be the errors of Jefferson , as freely as he spoke of those of any political opponent . He stood in his place in the Senate , and criticised the preamble to the DecI ration of Independence with the same frankness and candor he was accustomed to use in discussing an executive message , or a question of finance . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pronounced error , however deeply it lay entrenched , or however widely extended , whenever he conceived it his duty to do so . The prominent characteristics of Mr. Calhoun 's mind were clearness , compactness , and strength . His speeches have been so often analyzed and spoken of , as to render it superfluous to di*uss their merits here . They are clear , sententious , logical , and demonstrative . Their style is remarkable . It is severe , sometimes almost hard , and nearly destitute of ornament or superfluity of any kind . He used the fewest possible words to express his meaning , but they were singularly well chosen and pure . lie scattered his thoughts in profusion , but he was an economist of language . He addressed himself to the reason ; he spoke to convince , not to captivate or please . There is no effort of imagination , no prettiness of speech , no tricks of rhetoric , no fantastic play of words , no brilliant epigrams , or striking antitheses in his speeches . The thoughts of Mr. // Calhoun came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gorgeous drapery of speech , in which an ingenious rhetorician may manage to conceal a meagre stock of ideas . The eloquence of his discourse lay in the thought , and not in the form of its expression . Its power consisted in the earnestness of its expres3ion , and in its facility of conveying to the mind of his hearer the idea precisely as it was formed in his own - clothed in words as simple and pure as the English tongue affords . Mr. Calhoun could have demonstrated a mathematical theorem in the same language he employs in discussing a constitutional question . He lays down his premises-he applies his axioms-he draws his conclusions . His reasoning is whoJly demonstrative . There is no link of the argument gone-no superfluous expression  --  and no word misapplied . Each new step in his process is the natural and logical sequence of the propositions already established ; and should we discover at the close that we can not yield our free assent to the conclusion at which he has arrived , we find ourselves amazed at being unable to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the argument the first fallacy was committed . Mr. Calhoun was not an orator in the popular sense of the term . His range of ideas was rarely found extending into the realms of fancy . his mind was creative , but not imaginative . Such thoughts as he had to express were not fitted for that copious fullness of language , and those studied graces of action , which captivate or dazzle a popular assembly . There is scarcely to he found in all his speeches one of those fine Ciceronian periods which adorn the harangues of Clay ; or those gorgeous and periodique sentences in which Webster sometimes enforces a strong thought , or closes an argument . Strike out from his sentences every superfluous word , every syllable not necessary to a distinct enunciation of the proposition-leave but the thought untouched and unclouded , and the whole still stands in its full beauty and vigor . Nor is this style without the highest merit . In that very clearness and conciseness of expression there is a greater force , if not so much art of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are often employed to conceal rather than to convey ideas . In his speeches Mr. Calhoun is very sparing of quotations  --  the help of speakers who are better satisfied with the language of others in expressing their ideas than their own . His Southern address contains the quotation , " Timeo Danaos et donaferentcs , *** the only one , as it is said , and perhaps with truth , he ever used . His reasoning is frequently interrogatory . Sometimes he compresses a variety of propositions into a series of brief and pregnant questions . When he introduces a figure of speech , it is by way of argument , not for ornament ; it is always to elucidate a thought , never to set off a phrase , or point a period . His similes are clear and practical illustrations . His metaphors , or tropes , when such are used , which is rare , are parts of his reasoning . They seem to belong to , and form links in the chain of his argument , always simple , striking , and suggestive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure of speech . The idea in his own mind , the proposition he combats , or the charge he is repelling , becomes a corporeal thing . He speaks of it as though it were a visible and tangible reality . In his celebrated reply to the attack of Mr. Clay , he exclaims- " The imputation // 413 sinks to the earth with the groundless charge on which it rests-. -I stamp it down in the dust ; " and immediately changing the figure , adds , " I pick up the dart which fell harmless at my feet . I hurl it back . What the Senator charges on me unjustly , he has actually done . " In his great speech on Oregon , alluding to the magnetic telegraph , he says --  " Our globe itself will become endowed with sensitiveness , so that whatever touches it on one point , will be instantly felt on the other . " In his remarks upon the resolutions introduced by him into the Senate , adverse to the conquest and annexation of Mexico , it is only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by anything in the shape of a metaphor or illustration . It is found in a graphic and striking figure of speech , thrown in almost parenthetically in the midst of his argument " Mexico is to us a dead body , and this is the only way that we can cut the cord which binds us to the corpse . " Again , upon the rrhree Million Bill , he clothes the same idea in another form . The figure is varied , but no less significant and bold : - " Mexico is to us the forbidden fruit . The penalty of eating it would be to subject our institutions to political death . " The power of analysis was possessed by Mr. Calhoun in a remarkable degree . No doctrine was too abstruse-no principle too complex , to resist that searching analytic process which every important question was certain to undergo in his hands . The prism does not more accurately separate a ray of light into its primary colors , than did the clear mind of this remarkable man resolve a general proposition into its elementary principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dross , than did the fire of his intellect refine away error , and leave behind only the pure ore of truth . The same rapid perception which enabled him to lay hold of the elementary truths of a general principle , and to present them with such singular precision and clearness , enabled him also with equal facility to rise from particular facts to the broadest generalization . His mind was inductive , as well as analytic . Indeed , his rapid and bold generalizations , and his fondness for theoretic principles and abstract truths , have led to the impression that his intellect was metaphysical and speculative , rather than practical or profound . Such an impression is entirely erroneous . A more thoroughly practical statesman , we believe , has not been among us since the days of Jefferson , nor a more profound intellect . The evidence of his practical wisdom lives in the great measures he originated and sustained . I ' he evidence of his profound thought  --  a thought , the offspring of something more than mere talent  --  the offspring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the record of the words he has left behind him . He was undoubtedly one of the profoundest thinkers of the age . He had during a long life studied intimately and thoroughly the science of government , the principles of political economy and political ethicsthe origin , nature , and powers of our own Constitution . He was a statesman in the largest sense of the term  --  a philosophical , as well as a practical statesman . It is said that he has left behind him for publication , a work containing his speculations and views upon the scienceof government , and the nature of our own Constitution . Such a work from such a man will be an incalculable legacy to the American people . We do not remember to have met anywhere a finer or more graphic description of the character of Mr. Calhoun , within the same compass of words , than that of Mr. Webster , pronounced upon the floor of the Sen // ate , on the occasion of his death . Such a eulogy , from the lips of a distinguished political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alike honorable to the character of the living statesman . Mr. Webster never uses language without a meaning ; no man more carefully weighs every sentence , and calculates the precise significance of every word he utters . His remarks are , therefore , deeply interesting , as they convey the exact impression which the character of Mr. Calhoun has left upon the mind of one who can not be suspected of bias , and who had intimately known him during a long public career : " Sir , the eloquence of Mr. Calhoun , or the manner of his exhibition of his sentiments in public bodies , was l ) art of his intellectual character . It grew out of the qualities of his mind . It was plain , strong terse , condensed , concise ; sometimes impassioned , still always severe . Rejecting ornament , not often seeking far for illustration , his power consisted in the plainness of his propositions , in the closeness of his logic , and in the earnestness and energy of his manner . These are the qualities , as I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years to speak often , and yet always command attention . His demeanor , as a senator , is known to us all-is appreciated , venerated by us all . No man was more respectful to others ; no man carried himself with greater decorum , no man with superior dignity . I think there is not one of us but felt when he last addressed us from his seat in the Senate-his form still erect , with a voice by no means indicating such a degree of physical weakness as did in fact possess him-with clear tones , and an impressive , and , I may say , an imposing manner-who did not feel that he might imagine that we saw before us a senator of Rome , when Rome survived " Such , indeed , was John C. Calhoun . In the republican simplicity and greatness of his character , he may well be compared to a Roman senator in the best days of Rome . His mental characteristics , from their very simplicity , appear striking , perhaps from the contrast , when compared with some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intellectual conflict . He was the massive Doric pillar amid a cluster of luxuriant Corinthian columns , standing out " nobly plain and unadorned , " the emblem of simplicity combined with majestic strength , and the representative of a primeval age . Surely the arrow of the destroyer was this time aimed at a shining mark ! We would add a word , did the time permit , upon the political influence of Mr. Calhoun in the direction of our Federal Legislation . It was great , particularly during the last seventeen years of his life . If it is not correctly estimated in our day , posterity will not fail to appreciate it . During that period , he has performed the most signal and valuable service , in sustaining the policy of the Democratic party . Not to Inention that remarkable achievement which he so successfully accomplished in incorporating the Republic of Texas with the Union , we need only allude to his determined and successful resistance to the encroachments of the moneyed power ; the ability and devotion with which he sustained , and finally carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , his noble and untiring efforts in support of the principles of free trade . For these and other signal services , the name of JOHN C. CALHOUN will be held in grateful remembrance . Posterity will do him justice , especially when that time shall have arrived , which we predict is approaching , when his course upon these measures will be universally regarded as in accordance with a sound political economy , and the result of an enlightened statesmanship.
