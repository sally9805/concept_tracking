ART . III . - 1 . Speeches of Mr. JOHN BRIGHT , M. P. , at Birmingham and Manchester , on the Representation of the People . 2 . A Letter to Mr. Bright on his Plan for turning the English Monarchy into a Democracy . By llExi*Y PRUMMOND. 3 . Speech of MR . DISRAELI , Chancellor of the Exchequer , in Explanation of the Reform Bill laid before Parliament by the Government of Lord Derby . IT is the inevitable tendency of a ' government like that of England , to be more or less absolutely controlled by some one of its elements . At the era of the French Revolution , and for a hundred years previously , as well as during the subsequent struggle with Napoleon , the aristocracy were the ruling power . But since that period the democratic element has been rising into the chief place , and the control of affairs is surely passing into the hands of the Commons . The Refc*rm Act of 1832 was a severe blow to the ascendency of oligarchical power , and though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable bill , the House of Commons has been less distinguished for ability than before , it may be confidently affirmed that this has been owing , in large measure , to the fact that the last quarter of a century has not been adapted to develop such political abilities as were stimulated and brought into action by the great events of the previous period . Besides , in judging of the merits and consequences of the Reform Bill , we must consider the ameliorating measures that have since been adopted . Tested by that standard , it must be conceded that the extension of suffrage , and the redistribution of Parliamentary seats by the legislation of 1832 , have been productive of immense good . The question now is , Shall the basis of that legislation be still further enlarged ? Shall the democratic element in the British Constitution be still further increased in power and influence ? One class of British society are in favor of a new reform bill , because they believe that political justice and national well-being alike demand is . Another class are invincibly opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , in such a // concession , the transfer of power from the aristocracy to the Commons , and along with it the ultimate overthrow of the distinctive principles of the Constitution . A third class , composed of rival parties , yield to it , not because they desire it , but because party exigences demand it . They will concede , however , as little as possible , - as much only as will enable them to gain or retain the control of public affairs . We may regard Mr. Bright as a representative of the first class , Mr. Drummond of the second , and Mr. Disraeli of the third . Mr. Bright is a powerful speaker , - not an orator , indeed , in the sense in Which Chatham and Mirabeau were orators , but a man who hits hard blows and makes a strong impression . Without much learning , and without systematic culture , he has strong natural abilities , extensive and intimate familiarity with the political history of his country since he came upon the stage , indomitable courage , and sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees things as they are , and is not likely to be misled by illusions . His estimate of the British Constitution differs radically from Mr. Burke 's . He does not behold in King , Lords , and Commons " the triple cord which no man can break ; the solemn , sworn , constitutional frank-pledge of this nation ; the firm guaranties of each other 's being and each other 's rights ; the joint and several securities , each in its place and order , for every kind and every quality , of property and of dignity . " On the contrary , he has no reverence for the Constitution of England as it now exists . " I have no object , " he said in his speech at Birmingham , " in making these observations , but to show to the people that they have been deluded by the idea that they have a glorious - that is , an excellent - Constitution . The Constitution of this country , said to be of a King or Crown , Lords , and Commons , is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take it to be a part of my duty to expose . John Foster , speaking of the English Constitution , spoke of it as that canted and extolled humbug . They tell us we owe everything to this Constitution . Now , I deny it altogether . " Sentiments of this kind startle such men as Mr. Drnmmond ; they sound like the tocsin of revolution . But Mr. Drummond , // whimsical , mystical , prejudiced , and ab*surd as his pamphlet proves him , though he is described as outspoken and scholarly , is not of force to arrest the movements of this energetic and practical age . He may amuse or annoy an opponent ; he may gratify his own spleen , and pander to the spleen of others , by valgar abuse of this country ; yet it is not such adversaries that the friends of reform have to dread , but rather those who in reality entertain his opinions , who dislike reform quite as much as he does , and still , with their eyes fixed steadily on office , attempt to delude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Derby laid before Parliament at the opening of the last session . Mr. Disraeli , with ready speech , versatile talents , suppleness , and aptitude for affairs , may explain and defend with great show of reason the various provisions of this bill ; but it is apparent upon the most cursory examination , that its leading , governing design and principle was , to preserve the ascendency of the aristocratic element in the House of Commons . Indeed , Mr. Disraeli vindicates , and with a great deal of ingenuity , this feature of his plan . He utterly rejects the notion that representation should be proportioned either to wealth , to population , or to both combined . His theory of representation regards only what he is pleased to term the interests of a country , by which he means classes and opinions .. " Men , " he says , " are sent to this House to represent the opinions of a place , and not its power . " Hence it is , that his bill made no provision for a redistribution of seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few glaring anomalies , the existing borough system . It did , indeed , extend the privilege of election to a considerable degree , but with such cautious discrimination as to exclude the great body of the working classes . But , even with the utmost extension of the elective franchise , so long as the House of Commons is constituted as at present , the result is the same . " There are , " said Mr. Bright in his speech at Birmingham , - " there are in the House of Commons at present 330 members ( more than half ) whose whole number of constituents do not amount to more than 180,000 , and there are at the same time in Parliament 24 members , whose constituents are upwards of 200,000 in number ; 9* // and , while the constituents of the 330 members are assessed to the property tax at ? 15,000,000 , the constituents of the 24 members are assessed to the same tax at more than ? 24,000,000 . " Now Mr. Disraeli would not only maintain this unjust and unequal distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unequal . By extending the suffrage he increases the disproportion between the constituency of the twenty-four members and the Constituency of the three hundred and thirty members , Without any change whatever in the relative number of the representatives . And upon what ground does he defend a scheme like this ? Upon the fanciful notion that the chief element of representation should be the interests , or , in other words , the classes and opinions of a country , rather than its wealth and population . Admit this , however , to be the correct theory : does it follow that no sort of equality should be observed in fixing the ratio of representation between these various classes or interests ? Must the opinions of a score of voters in a midland borough counterbalance the opinions of fifteen or twenty thousand voters in Liverpool or Manchester ? Must the political influence of one class , and that the smallest , outweigh the political influence of all other classes ? Must a constituency of 180,000 send 330 members to Parliament as the representatives of their opinions , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To plain republicans such a scheme of representation appears unjust , - so unjust as to be scandalous . That it can not be much longer maintained is obvious . The Derby government has owed its existence thus far to the liberal members ; and if that government should be overthrown , and Lord Palmerston again resume office , their support would doubtless be equally necessary to him . Holding this important position , and resolutely insisting upon a reform of the House of Commons , it is impossible that they should not carry their point . They may not , indeed , obtain in the first instance all that they desire ; but they will gain vastly more than is proffered by the bill of Mr. Disraeli . Lord Palmerston will concede more than Lord Derby ; he will be compelled , by the exigences of his position as a party leader , to // come forward with a more satisfactory proposition , - a proposition which , though it may not fully meet the views or wishes of the sincere friends of reform , will be an advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would arrive . Moreover , when it happens , as happen it will , that the great body of the nation is included in the list of electors , and representation is proportioned to population , or to population and property combined , then England becomes , not in theory only , but in practice , a republic , though a republic under a monarchical form . The crown even now is but a pageant , the ornamental plumage of the noble bird , not the feathers that support him in his flight . With a full and impartial representation of the people in the House of Commons , with an hereditary executive and an hereditary Senate or House of Lords , England would possess , according to the ideas of Polybius , a perfect polity . There would be that apt contexture of the three forms of government in the general frame which , as he thinks , produces the co-operation , mutual counteraction , and reciprocal control of the parts necessary to constitute a perfect political system . Let the hereditary principle be rejected ( as it is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representative principle be substituted for it , England becomes a republic on the plan of our American constitutions . And what is there in this prospect , beyond the loss of power and privilege , that should excite such lively alarm in those whose cause finds a champion in Mr. Drummond ? What , in fact , are the characteristic influences and effects of democratic institutions ? It may be well , at a time like this , when the organs of one class of opinions and interests in England , from the apprehension of being Americanized , assail our republicaii system with studied disparagement and insidious censure , to consider this question , - to refresh and confirm our faith in that government which was contrived by the patriots of the Revolution , and which they fondly believed would preserve the liberties and establish the independence of their country . What , then , are the characteristic influences and effects of democratic insti-tutions ? // We answer , that they give to society a vital impulse and energy which no other description of government has been able to impart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they inspire , raises and develops even the humblest individual . His faculties impose the only limit to his ambition , the only bound to his aims and endeavors . Hence the immense force , the restless exertion , of democratic communities . The ancient republics , - what brilliancy , what activity , in arts , in arms , in philosophy , letters , and industry , characterized all their career ! Their achievements in war and in peace have been the admiration of every succeeding age . The prodigious prosperity of the Italian republics , their renown in all the arts that ennoble and embellish life , and in all the modes of industry that add to its comfort and enjoyment , sprang directly from their freedom . While popular institutions thus quicken individual energies , and elevate society in all its constituent classes , they claim at the same time this peculiar praise , that they more fully identify the citizen with the state than any other form of government , and by this means foster an intense and lofty patriotism . Every man feels himself a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him as his own . In monarchies , the habit of loyalty is , without doubt , a powerful tie , - a motive which in the hour of peril or trial goes far and does much . But , in all wars except those which are strictly national , and arouse a whole population to the defence of their altars and their fires , it may be confidently affirmed that the citizen of a republic comes forth with more alacrity at the call of his country than the subject of a monarchy . He has more of personal interest in all that concerns the government under which he lives ; he is an indirect but influential agent in the administration of its affairs , watches with eager interest its course , and whenever difficulty or danger impends , with something more than a sense of duty or spirit of loyalty , acts boldly and greatly in its service . It is this personal interest and participation in the government of his country that animate and exalt the patriotism of a freeman . In addition to all those ties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birth , the home of his ancestors , and the repository of // their ashes , he has a sense of property in , of identification with , all the acts of the state . At the same time , it may be affirmed that popular governments are less prone to war than monarchies . It is said , indeed , that the tastes and qualifications of the many , in all countries and under all systems of polity , lean towards the warlike virtues , and that in free states those tastes and qualifications can demand scope and employment , and hence wars are precipitated . The ancient republics are cited as an illustrative example . So far , it is alleged , were personal independence and personal ambition fostered by their institutions , that war and conquest , the storm and hurricane of life , could alone satisfy them . Undoubtedly , the ancient republics were warlike , and discovered a passion for the excitement and gloi*y of arms ; but this was the fault , the characteristic mark of their age , not of their systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace numerous and increasing , combined with the powerful classes who in every country are directly interested in its preservation , wars must inevitably become less frequent whenever and wherever these classes exercise a check , a control on government . In democratic states , through public opinion , through the press , and the ballot , they possess this check , this decisive means of enforcing respect for their pacific sentiments . In monarchies , on the contrary , with standing armies , with the military spirit habitually cherished , with the ambition , whims , caprices , and family connections of the monarch , as added motives to war , what wonder is it that the earth so frequently shakes beneath the tread of hostile forces , and drinks up the blood of the bravest and the best ? Popular governments are not only less liable to external war than monarchies , but they are less exposed to internal convulsion . There may , indeed , be local and temporary turbulence , there may be passionate excitement bursting out into acts of violence ; but all this , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of waters beneath remains undisturbed . That which shakes the foundations of society , that which precipitates revolutions , has been extinguished in its very germ . Equality of rights and privileges - the boon // so eagerly coveted by mankind - is consecrated and insured . By incorporating this principle into the very texture of society , popular governments remove the prevalent cause of civil and revolutionary strife . No class endowed with hereditary political power or superior immunities stands as a barrier to essential progress . Hence desirable changes are accomplished peacefully through the medium of constitutional forms . In monarchies , on the contrary. , when the laws and customs are no longer adapted to existing circumstances , when they inflict even misery and injustice , it is difficult to procure their abrogation without the convulsive struggles of revolution . Those who have been long habituated to a system , who derive all its benefits and feel none of its mischiefs , naturally cling to it . Besides , they dread the consequences of disturbing the existing order of things . Change is denounced and frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard to restrain it , - lest it may slowly , but surely , sap the foundations upon which exclusive privilege reposes . All the influence of authority , of confirmed prejudices , of interested fears , is aroused and arrayed against reform . Hence , without other means of redress to the suffering classes , revolution , which is among the direst evils that can befall a state , and in the height of its fury tends to involve the whole fabric in one mighty ruin , is called in to achieve that which , under a different system , concurring interests or a provident foresight would naturally have anticipated . It was , as all the world knows , the threat and apprehension of revolution that wrung from the reluctant hands of the English aristocracy the reform legislation of 1832 . In a popular government , neither the sympathies nor the interests of the law-makers are bound up with a caste or order , whose power and perpetuity , whose weight and influence in the present and future , are primary objects of concern ; but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weal or woe must partake their fortune . Hence the greatest good of the greatest number is the distinguishing principle of popular legislation . There may be mistakes , there may be rash resolves , in moments of excitement or delusion ; but the steady and uniform tendency will be to promote the interests // and well-being of the greatest possible number . Such being for the most part the evident result , the law comes to have a fixed and firm hold upon the respect and reverence of a free people . In doing homage to law , they do homage to themselves , the creators and preservers of law . And a state without this reverence for law reposes on a foundation which may indeed last long , but is in danger every moment of subversion . It may impress the spectator with an idea of durable existence , but while he gazes , the structure may fall to the ground . Whenever , from any cause , the influence upon the imagination and the moral feeling of men which is exerted by long-established institutions , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are lost or impaired , there is no other foundation upon which the despotic legislator can build , except fear , which , Protean in form , may suddenly assume the aspect of ferocity , and avenge its humiliation in the overthrow of all law and all authority . Popular institutions not only inspire a respect for law , but they beget self-respect . Hence , we see in republican states nothing of that servile thraldom of mind which is so apparent in other conditions of society . Manners , indeed , which , as has been finely observed , throw a pleasing illusory charm over human nature , may not be carried to so high a standard of refinement as among the superior classes in monarchies . But manners , however pleasing , however necessary " to cover the defects of our naked , shivering nature , " may be acquired at too great a sacrifice . It is better to protect and exalt the many , than to bless and adorn the few . It is better to strengthen and enlarge the foundations of the social edifice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is better to cultivate the sentiment of brotherhood , to pour over the surface of society the balsam of charity and kindness , to engage men in common labors , common aims , and common sympathies , than to isolate and separate them by gradations of rank . By so doing , there may , indeed , be less lustre , bu't there will be more harmony , - a less showy , but a more happy country . A popular government presupposes not only the removal of all restraints upon the dissemination of knowledge , but the // adoption of all practicable measures to diffuse it as widely as possible . All authority having its rise and fountain in the people , it can hardly be conceived that they would employ it to put a padlock on their minds , and shut up the sources of information . Besides , participation in the daily affairs of their government opens and enlightens their minds . Such a people must necessarily discover a clearness of understanding , a practical sagacity , a facility in affairs , unequalled. by any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold this high place in the scale of intelligence , history abundantly proves that they also contribute their full quota to the roll of the world 's choice and master spirits . What lustre was diffused around their country by the famous orators , philosophers , statesmen , and soldiers of republican Greece I Recall , too , the history of the modern Italian republics . What talents in every variety were summoned forth to grace and serve the state ! In architecture , in sculpture , in painting , in poetry , history , and politics , republican Italy produced the great masters whose art and genius enlightened the darkness of that night which then enveloped the world . But not to confine our view to former times , let us turn our eyes to our own coutitry . Let us see if , as is alleged by our impartial and friendly English critics , the character of our institutions has dwarfed talents , and sunk them to what has been termed the populous host of mediocrity . Scarcely eighty years have gone by since our independence was achieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident to a new country , and were compelled in the first instance to employ all our energies in recovering from the impoverishment of a long war , yet in letters , in all forms of civil and military ability , we have kept fully abreast of contemporary states which have existed for a thousand years . But , says the leading journal of England , your statesmanship has declined , and declined in consequence of the universal participation of the people in the affairs of your government ; in other words , in consequence of universal suffrage . Precisely the same thing is said of the representation of England in the House of Commons , and the fact is attributed to the // Reform Bill . We have already adverted to the circumstance , that the political events of the last quarter of a century have not been of a character to stimulate and bring into activity striking political abilities . Those who have shone most conspicuously in public life during that time , in either country , received their training and impulse in the previous period . That race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before or just after the second war with England , had to grapple with great questions and imperilled interests , and the excitement and conflict of high debate gave tone and elevation to their minds . If our present representation in Congress has fallen below their measure , it is not attributable to universal suifrage ; but , in good part , to the fact that the pabulum of our political life is of a less invigorating nature . We know it is said , and Lord John Russell adopts the notion in his recent Life of Fox , that the natural jealousy of a democracy has led the American people to elevate their inferior men to the Presidency , in preference to their statesmen of reputation and ability . This as*ertion is altogether unwarrantable . That it has happened , in one or more instances , that candidates inferior to their competitors in point of talents have been raised to the highest office in our government , may be admitted . But why impute this fact to mean prejudices and unworthy motives ? Will Lord John Russell pretend that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief of their state a man whose principles were wholly discordant with their own , merely because he possessed more shining talents than his competitor ? Has not his experience taught him that a man may possess great metaphysical , logical , or oratorical abilities , and yet in the administration of public affairs be wanting in wisdom ? The opinions of great masses of men on practical questions , affecting their interests , are very apt to be right . The individual , however eminent for talents , may be biased by social habitudes , or local and temporary influences , and thus be deflected from the true policy . If the collective wisdom , therefore , of a people sees what the individual fails to see , if they withhold their suffrages from an eminent personage because of the principles he advocates and represents , let it not be said that they are either // incapable of discerning his merit , or indisposed , from a spirit of jealousy , to do honor to it . But after all , what member of the house of Hanover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in contempt of popular election , could be compared in point of abilities with the least illustrious name in the roll of our Presidents ? It is objected to popular institutions , that they foster a love of gain , and tend to make physical prosperity the goal of their citizens . Mr. Drummond , with facile calumny , declares that " they ( the Americans ) are utterly without private or public honor , and the only people on earth who ever avowed that gain was their sole object in every relationship of life . " In what form and through what organs this extraordinary avowal has been made , Mr. Drummond has not thought proper to inform us . If he means to imply that our actions speak that language , we may be pardoned for applying the same test to his own countrymen . Are the English less moderate in their desire and exertions for gain than ourselves ? Are they not emphatically the shop-keeping nation ? If it be true , as is affirmed by one of the most charming of their poets , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes an Englishman to boast of any superiority on that score . Mr. IDrummond is a scholar , and is , doubtless , familiar with the history of the aristocratic governments of Rome , Carthage , and Venice . As an Englishman and a member of Parliament , the annals of his own country have naturally attracted much of his attention ; and he must know that there has never been exhibited by any class of mankind such rapacity , such eagerness to obtain riches , as by the governing class in aristocratic states . The corruption , the venality , and the " jobs " that have distinguished and tainted the English government in times past , are matters of familiar history . That the citizens of republics are remarkable for the ardor with which they pursue gain , we do not mean to deny . But they seek it in the paths of business , in adventures by sea and land , not from the influence of a mistress or the favor of a minister . " The Athenians , " says Thucydides , " con // tinue ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire , esteeming that only a time of festival in which they are prosecuting their projects , and holding rest as a greater evil than the most laborious business. ** This boundless activity , this inextinguishable love of exertion , is indeed a characteristic distinction of democratic states . It is this which explores the mine , unlocks the secret treasures of the earth , whitens the seas with the canvas of unnumbered ships , diversifies industry , and stimulates intellect . Nevertheless , the passion of acquisition among such a people is not more eager than in a different condition of society ; but it is more apparent , because the sources for its gratification are more numerous . More avenues are opened , the masses are not shackled by the habit of dependence , are conscious of their powers , and accustomed to rely on them . Their freedom gives them boldness , confidence , and a spirit of enterprise . Yet , if eager in acquiring , they are equally liberal in expending wealth . Nowhere is money more freely given for patriotic and beneficent purposes ; nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republican soil . Indeed , when we contemplate the benefits that flow from this description of polity as from a natural fountain , when we see the immense energies that are developed , and the immense advances that society makes under its auspices , what manly , generous mind would not wish it endued with an inherent strength , and fitted to survive for the good of mankind to the latest ages of the world ? But forms of government , like every other contrivance of human wisdom , are mutable , and subject to decay . Time , which defaces the inscription and crumbles the marble , leaves untouched nothing beneath the sun . What is to be the future fortune of our own political system it is vain to conjecture . This much is certain , - to preserve our institutions , we must preserve and foster an habitual respect for them . Fleets and armies can not maintain them . The foundations on which they repose are not of material structure . They are based on ideas , and will continue to bless , develop , and accelerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles and sentiments of their founders shall // animate their posterity . When these no longer hold sway , the form may indeed survive , but the animating soul of the republic will have departed . It has not escaped observation , that familiarity with European society has already led many of our social and literary dilettanti to regard European institutions with no unfavorable eye . The gayety and glitter of foreign courts and capitals have dazzled their imaginations , and they have come to undervalue the freedom which has given their country its position among the nations . They might remind us of some rigid Protestant , whose antipathy to IRome would do no discredit to a Presbyterian of the school of Knox ; yet who , when he comes to tread " the long-drawn aisle " of a venerable cathedral , covered with " the awful hoar of innumerable ages , " to listen to the pealing anthem , and to witness the imposing ceremonies of an earlier worship , abandons his life-long convictions to the illusion of the passing hour . But the great body of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their country , are devoted to its institutions with a warm and earnest attachment . They contemplate the past with pride , they anticipate the future with hope . The strictures that reach them from the Old World , whether clothed in the considerate phrase of a Russell or the envenomed language of a Drummond , do not abate their confidence or disturb their equanimity . They know that a successful republic is a pungent and ever-recurring criticism upon monarchy and aristocracy ; that it awakens mankind to reflection , and engenders a love of liberty ; that it is , in fine , at once an argument and an example , whose persuasive force summons the nations to demand institutions that shall recognize and guarantee their rights . They are not surprised , therefore , that those whose repose is thus disturbed , and whose power and privileges are endangered , should seek to disparage a government whose silent operation is productive of such results . But they are neither so blind nor so prejudiced as not to know that perfection is unattainable in human affairs , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the sense and sagacity , however , to perceive that , // while there are faults in the details and the practical working of their institutions , they possess excellences peculiar to themselves . It is not occasional irregularity , violence , or m*dadministration , whether state or municipal , resulting in whole or in part from the ordinary machinery , as it were , of their system , that can disaffect them with the general principles on which the system itself is founded . The essence of republicanism does not consist in the ballot and universal suffrage , as many persons seem to suppose . Doubtless , it is in the theory , as it should be in the practice of a republic founded on just principles , that those from whom it is derived , for whose benefit it was established , and whose contributions support it , should , by their suffrages , have the control of it . But every political society necessarily possesses the right of self-protection ; and if any portion of its members , from vice or ignorance , from mental or moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration of its affairs , they should be disfranchised . It would be well if our legislators would give a little more heed to this obvious truth . In towns and cities where population is largely concentrated , and where a considerable portion of that population were the former subjects of England , and bred under a system which makes no provision for the instruction of youth , and keeps the great body of the people ignorant of political duties , it is highly impolitic to confer indiscriminately the privilege of election . The compatriots of Mr. Drummond should continue in statu pupillari until they become familiar with political rights , and imbibe a proper sense of political duties . Hereafter , when the British system shall have been reformed , they will receive that preliminary training at home which will qualify them for more immediate admission to the privileges of citizenship upon their arrival in this country . With a proper restriction of the right of suffrage , a proper check upon the unwise multiplication of elective offices , and a more discreet and attentive exercise of the privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a politic administration of affairs , we shall guard against that municipal misgovernment , wastefulness , and corruption , which have tended to bring reproach on our whole system . 10* // But whatever the defects which a friendly or an unfriendly criticism may point out either in the foundation or superstructure of our institutions , in the organic law , or the details of legislation , the general result of the system is obvious . The generation of our countrymen now passing off the stage of aclion are nearly as old as the government under which they live ; yet what prodigies have they witnessed ! They have seen our boundaries enlarged , our resources developed , our weakness converted into strength , and our power acknowledged and respected by the most distant nations . Our territory , which even at the outset was deemed by European statesmen too vast and extended , is now washed by the waters of two oceans ; capacious harbors indent its shores ; immense rivers bear the products of thriving industry to the seas ; populous towns and cities are scattered over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty insured . With a vast confederation of States , comprising every variety of climate , soil , and production , with innumerable cities , the natural centr*s of commerce , manufactures , and arts , with immense lines of railway stretching across the continent from ocean to ocean , and with such an administration of the government as will give us contentment at home and respect abroad , we shall present to the world an instance of beneficent power unparalleled in the annals of mankind .
