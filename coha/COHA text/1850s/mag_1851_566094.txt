txt ART . III. - LORD 'S EPOCH OF CREATION . The Epoch of Creation . The &amp;riptural Doctrine Contrasted with the Geological Theory . By ELEAZAR LORD . With an Introduction by RICHARD MT . DICKINSON , D.D . New York : Charles Scribimer , 145 Nassau Street . 1851 . Tuis work , though recently published , be longs , geologically speaking , to an earlier period . The author maintains , that " the heavens and earth and all their host , including man , was created at one epoch , " and in the space of six days of twenty-four hours each . About time certainty of this fact , he allows himself to have no doubt , nor is he willing that a one else should have any . But still , for our own part , we are obliged to hesitate a littl*e before going back to the era of Granville Penn and the Dean of York . Time true relation between Revelation and Physical Science is often misunderstood , though it would seem to be a very plain one . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . He has created the human mind and endowed it with that desire of knowledge which impels it to the study of Nature and the Bible . And in that intellectual constitution which enables man to form // premises , to draw conclusions , and to trust in the nnbiased convictions of his understanding , he has laid a foundation for the acquisition of knowledge through such study . That man should study the works of nature , acquire a knowledge of her laws and put confidence in his conclusious is as certainly the will of God as it is that he should study the Bible , find out its truths and believe them . We have an equal authority , therefore , for the study of each , and we are equally competent to acquire knowledge from each . It is certain that man can discover , and has discovered by his own powers in the legitimate exercise of them , as God designed they should be exercised , truths which hive to his mind - as that mind is constituted-as much evidence in their favor as the evidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution about its axis , and the laws of gravity , we know as certainly as we do that the Bible is the word of God ; and w* know both according to the legitimate exercise of the powers of the mind , employed in accordance with the laws of evidence upon subjects adapted to its nature . We have before us , therefore , two great fields of investigation , the Bible and Nature , both of which we are authorized to study , and both of which will yield us their truths . Thus far we have looked at them as distinct . Let us now look at them as related to each other . The ground of this relation is , that Revelation brings Nature within its department as a portion of its subjectmatter . It utters the great truth concerning it , that God is its author , and speaks of it in other ways . And here arises the question , upon the correct answer to which depends , on the one hand , the true interpretation of those parts of Scripture which relate to Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating Nature herself within her own domain . That question is , whether revelation speaks . of nature popularly as adapted to the comprehension of those to whom it was first made , or scientifically as adapted to the cultivated intellect of all time ? The statement of the question answers it . The revelation of the wonders of modern science , to say nothing of what may hereafter be discovered , would have contained to those who first received it , far more astonishing miracles than any which God saw fit to perform to authenticate revelation itself . To have spoken in scientific language of the globe and its diurnal and annual revolutions , of the solar system with its complexity of movements , of the myriads of bodies dispersed in space and of their all but infinite distances ; to have spoken scientifically of the composition of the elements , fire , earth , air , water , and of the decomposition of light ; to have spoken scientilically of the whole animal creation with its mountains of infusoria ; to have spoken scientifically of // the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows of heaven and the waters above the firmament ; in a word , to have spoken of the ordinary appearances and operations of nature in the language of science and with scientific truth , would have been , we must believe , an unsurmountable barrier against the establishment of revelation itself . The Bible has not spoken in this way . It describes the outward shows of things as they appear to the common  --  the uninstructed , the unscientific eye . And it deserves to be considered , that so far as regards ordinary objects in nature , such as common plants , trees , animals , the situation and character of places , as Jerusalem , Nineveh , Petra , the obvious topographical features of a country , as of Palestine , Egypt , and the regions beyond the Euphrates ; as regards everything , in short which is open to ordinary observation , the Bible describes them with complete accuracy . Every new examination of the geography of the regions about which it is conversant , every new discovery as to the manners and employments of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new reading of long forgotten languages , only shows with what graphic accuracy the Bible has represented the objects which came within the sphere of common observation . The descriptions are life-like and carry their own evidence with them that they were made by those who saw with their own eyes what they describe . On the contrary , almost every great discovery in physicsevery advance which science has made , has filled the Bible more and more , if it is to be regarded as a book of science , with scientific blunders . But the Bible is not so to be regarded . For , besides the fact that it is not a book of science , besides the reason of that fact already alleged , that such a revelation would have defeated the very end for which the Bible was revealed , that end itself would be decisive of the question , if anything more were needed . The Bible has for its subject-matter , God , the Soul , Eternity . It reveals the moral purposes of God ; it teaches the relations of the soul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discloses in some measure the grand events which are yet to take place in the moral universe . This is professedly its end . It does not profess to teach physical science nor any other science ; it does not teach them . With this statement in our minds regarding these two great fields of truth which God has opened to the study of man , and into which He calls him to enter and labor , it seems not difficult to arrive at some important practical conclusions . And , in the first place , it would appear to result as a consequence , that both Revelation and Science should be studied with reference to the kind of truth which they teach , and , where they treat of the // same subject-matter , according to the point of view from which they look at it . The interpreter of the Bible must explain its language , not as scientific but as popular language , and language too addressed to people not enlightened by the diffusion of scientific knowledge but in a comparatively rude state . The man of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not according to some pre-judgment derived from another field of knowledge . The mistake early made and long persevered in ,  --  that the Bible is intended to teach science and is to be regarded as an encyclopedia of knowledge , and that therefore science is to be studied in its pages ,  --  though a natural one , has been most disastrous to the professed defenders of the Bible and hostile to the progress of science . If any one doubt this , let him read the explanations which the professed defenders of the Bible have given of the phenomena of nature , in opposition to the conclusions of science , from the time of the ancient fathers down through all the physico-theological writers-we were going to say , to the author of the treatise under review . But we can detect progress notwithstanding the intolerant dogmatism with which the author asserts that the earth and heavens , with all their host , were created at the same epoch with man . We hear no longer of the fossils being made just as we find them ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eschewing any particular theory , the author rests in the naked proposition , that almighty power will account for anything . If any one would see the effect of the error in question upon scientific men themselves , let him read the theories which prevailed from the early part of the sixteenth century down to the beginning even of the nineteenth , all of which were modified by con siderations extraneous to science . There is another practical result from the relative position which we have assigned to IRevelation and Science , which must not be overlooked . It is this , that there is no occasion for haste and over-anxiety about harmonizing the truths which are discovered in Nature with those which are taught in the Bible . The investigation and establishment of individual truths is the first step ; the harmonizing of individual truths into one system is , in the order of nature , the second step , and it may not be taken till long after the first . Doubtless , all the truths in the universe fit together and form one perfect whole , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts even of a very small portion . It may be necessary to wait till some other truth shall be discovered , and until that is done the harmony of what is now known with the whole will not appear . It is possible , too , that the reconciliation may be , ap von . ix . 33 // parently in its very nature , beyond our reach , and yet we may not give up either of the truths which seem in hostility . This will be peculiarly the case when the same things are looked at from different points of view . We doubt not the time will come when the antiquity of the earth will be as generally acquiesced in as a fact to be held along with a full belief in the Bible as is now the revolution of the earth upon its axis , although we may not say with certainty what will be the final view taken of the account of creation in Genesis . Holding this opinion upon the harmonization of truths in different departments of knowledge , we have thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own respective sciences as they are in themselves . The infidel is , of course , eager to trumpet forth every new discovery as irreconcilable with the revelation which he rejects . The man of science , who believes in the Bible , in his eagerness to relieve himself from the appearance of hostility to it , has been too ready to take up with any interpretation which may suggest itself . We have thought , for instance , that Agassiz , in propounding his hypothesis of different centers of creation , would have done better if he had not attempted to bring the Scriptures into harmony with his view . Let him first demonstrate the reality of what he asserts , and when the whole scientific world shall have acquiesced in it as true , if they shall do so , it will be time enough to re-investigate what the Bible says on the same subject . Others of ingenious minds have pressed the coincidences between revelation and science too far . We can not but think the distinguished astronomer of Cincinnati found much more of modern scientific astronomy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book had any knowledge of . On the contrary , it has seemed to us that the interpreters of the Bible have striven too much merely to make out a case . Some have spoken of the results of geological investigations as great triumphs of the Bible-as being , instead of difficulties , confirmations of the sacred record-which is certainly an over-statement . Others , in a patronizing way , say to the man of science , " You may believe this and that with safety-we can make out this interpretation for you-so far you may go and even farther ; " as if the question were , how much may you concede ? how much may be forced from the text ? and not what did the writer mean ? Others , again , have argued with special pleading , as if to put down science , at any rate , by overwhelming its devotees with the charge of infidelity . It seems to us that the interpreter of revelation , and the interpreter of nature , should each follow his own distinctive line of investigation ; should each carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should each ever remnember // that he is studying but different volumes of the same author . Above all , is it important that investigations and discussions by both should be carried forward , not with arrogance and shouts of defiance and triumph , but with modesty ; not with a purpose to carry a point , but with both a philosophic and Christian determination to ascertain the truth-what can we know from Science as to Nature ? How much did the sacred writers have revealed to them on the same subject ? With these preliminary observations , which seemed to be necessary in order to present our own views clearly before the reader , we proceed to examine the contrary views as they are exhibited in the work before us . The staple propositions of the author are two , which are repeated again and again , and presented in various shapes throughout the discussion . The first of these asserts the impossibility that the Scripture narrative of creation should have any other meaning than that the universe was created in six natural days . The second maintains the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the belief in the antiquity of the earth . The geologist will at once see that there is nothing new in these propositions . They are the very ones which for three hundred years retarded the progress of science , and involved the defenders of the Bible in all sorts of extravagant " theories of creation ! " Mr. Lord , however , has , with commendable caution , abstained , as we have before said , from any definite theory ; he relies on the bare possibility of supernatural intervention . But we will allow our readers to judge for themselves . And our first quotation shall be his opening paragraph : " The geological theory assigns to the physical world a far higher antiquity than it allows to the human race . Many who believe in the inspiration of the Scriptures adopt this theory , to avoid the difficulties which geological science is supposed to present to the doctrine which ascribes the creation of man and that of the earth to one and the same epoch ; and they endeavor so to construe the language of Scripture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unavoidable conclusions of science . If they regard the Scriptures with the reverence due to them , they must yield to the required interpretations , under the impression that the credit of revelation itself demands them , that they affect no essential doctrine , that the alleged conclusions of science can in no other way be met , and that this course m y conciliate and win the confidence and faith of scientific men , who otherwise would be in danger of rejecting the Bible altogether . " - pp. 33-34 . Here , now , we have a class of divines and Christian scholars , . probably a large majority of those who are qualified to discuss the subject in hand , put upon trial as to whether they regard the Scriptures with the reverence which is due to them . The test is their interpretation of the narrative of the creation . And . // they would be condemned at once , if strict justice were done them . There is , however , some ground for a charitable judgment . They may have departed from the true meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible would have led them , with good motives . They may have merely yielded to what they supposed the necessities of the case , in order to sustain the credit of the Bible and conciliate men of science . And , besides , they may have thought their interpretation would affect no essential doctrine . But if they have not some such excuse as this , they must be pronounced guilty of irreverence , that is , provided Mr. Eleazar Lord is infallible . And we see no indications that he at least has any doubt upon this point . It seems not to have entered his mind that any other interpretation is-we will not say possible  --  but honest . Everywhere the representation is given that the interpretation which allows room for a greater age to the universe than about six thousand years , is a forced one , adopted to remove difficulties . If Mr. Lord chooses to argue that such interpretations must be erroneous , we do not object ; but what right has he to charge or insinuate that they who propound them have not sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most naturally feel indignant at such a charge ; but , really , when we see such men as Dr. Chalmers , Dr. J. Pye Smith , Dr. Buckland , Moses Stuart , and hosts of others , men honored in the church , just escaping the guilt of irreverence , on the ground that they meant well , we may be permitted to smile . But it may be asked whether such interpretations do not remove difficulties , and whether they were not intended for that purpose . We beg leave to make a distinction . The results to which the geologists came , as to the antiquity of the earth , conflicted with the prevalent interpretation of the Scripture account of the creation . This gave occasion to the re-investigation of that account , to determine whether the prevalent interpretation was the true one ; and if it were not , whether the true one would harmonize with the conclusions of science . The geological facts were also taken into account in the interpretation , and properly , for an interpretation of the account of any given phenomenon may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . But there is a distinction between furnishing the occasion of a new interpretation and presenting facts , before unknown , pertinent to the case , and forcing that interpretation from the words , contrary to their true import . We have an exactly parallel case . The discovery of the revolution of the earth upon Its axis gave occasion to a re-investigation of those passages which were universally interpreted to mean that the earth is immovable . It // furnished a new fact which was to be regarded in that investigation . The result was , that the prevalent interpretation was found to be erroneous , and the true one discovered , which removed all difficulties . Was there anything objectionable in this ? Was not the latter interpretation made with as sincere desire to learn the true meaning of Scripture as the former ? But while the author has in'iputed to those divines and scholars who have interpreted Genesis differently from himself , the restraint of a foregone conclusion , he ascribes to the geologist a mode of reasoning altogether foreign to his science . W e quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity of the earth- " so far settled , and entitled to such confidence , as to make it necessary to the believer in revelation to construe the Mosaic record in accordance with them . In other words , he deems it more likely that the apparent is not the true meaning of that record , than that any other besides natural , ordinary , physical causes have been employed to produce the sedimentary formations , or other phenomena with which his inquiries are concerned . If there is a defect anywhere , he supposes it must be in the written account of the creation , and not in his ascription of changes to the slow operation of natural causes . He supposes it to be more likely that a written account , in a dead and very ancient language , should appear to mean what it does not mean , that it should be figurative or mystical , that it should be misconstrued through ignorance , or by reason of its brevity or other peculiarities , than that he should be mistaken in his inferences from the geological phenomena of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very adroit . It would shine in a special plea . But it can easily be rebutted . The geologist as a geologisthas nothing to do with any such balance of probabilities . It is his sole office to investigate " the successive changes that have taken place in the orgame and inorganic kingdoms of nature ; and to inquire into the causes of these changes , and the influence which they have exerted in modifying the surface and external structure of our planet . " We take our definition from the writings of Sir Charles Lyell , who in his " Principles of Geology , " first gave its proper promiiience to " the theory of the uniform nature and energy " of geological causes , and thus placed geology as a science on the basis of the inductive philosophy . In the investigation of the changes which the earth has nudergone , nothing is found but what is accounted for by the operation of natural causes , acting through , indefinite periods of time . The geologist has no question to ask-none is in fact suggested to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the supposition that the Bible limits the epoch of the creation of the material universe to the creation of man , the thought of supernatural agency would never have arisen . The investigation of facts and the search after the natural causes of these facts are the sole objects of geology . It is not one of it3 objects even // to inquire into the antiquity of the earth , though this is a necessary result , to be sure , of its investigations . Indeed we may go farther ; if it could be demonstrated that the changes which the geologist observes , were produced by supernatural causes , we see not how it would change the principles upon which he must proceed . The same facts would remain ; the same appearances of the operation of natutal causes , and the same adequateness of these causes to produce the results , would remain , and , furthermore , it would be out of his power to discriminate the supernatural from the natural causes , since the effects of the two are the same , and the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of supernatural agency arises without the domain of geology . It is a question of the interpretation of Scripture . We of course must not be understood as saying that no geologist has written upon this question , but in so doing , the geologist appears not as a geologist , but as an interpreter of the Bible . We admit also that the lines of distinction between geology and interpretation have not been always drawn with sufficient care . But , looking at it as a question of interpretation , has this writer stated truly the mode in which the investigation of Scripture has been carried on by those whose interpretation he opposes ? Have they thus struck the balance between the credit due to the Mosaic narrative and to the conclusions of science ? Or have they honestly and truly sought to learn the meaning of Scripture ? Look at the men , and judge . We perhaps ought to guard against an inference which might be drawn from what we have just said , that geology discards supernatural intervention , whereas it expressly recognizes successive creations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an intervention suggested and proved by facts occurring within its own domain . The author having thus explained the principles upon which the interpreter of the Bible and the geologist respectively proceed , next states what he regards as the question at issue . " The question at issue is , whether the Mosaic account of the creation is an account of the original creation out of nothing of the material worlds and all that in them is ; or whether the narrative of the six days ' is an account only of the remodeling of the earth-. - one of those worlds-out of the materials of the same earth created at an earlier period , supposed to be indicated by the phrase in the beginning . ' " - p. 40 . We object to this statement of the issue , that it brings into the question a fact about which there is no question , namely , that the narrative contains an account of original creation . At least , this is the interpretation which the author himself puts upon this ob // scure sentence . For , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself of the creation of the heavens and the earth . " But we claim , that fact is not involved in the question as to the proper meaning of the Mosaic narrative . Every interpretation yields the sense , that God gave beginning to the heavens and the earth . That is one of those points in the narrative about which all are agreed . Those who interpret the account of the six days ' work , as relating to the remodeling of the earth , have been very careful to bring out prominently that the first verse reveals the fact of the original creation . With what propriety , then , are they represented as merely 8Thpj9O&amp;*flg that it is indicated by the phrase " in the beginning " ? And even that small concession is virtually withdrawn by the subsequent assertion that the fact of the creation of the heavens and the earth is involved in the question . We object also to the statement that it does not present all the alternatives . One other interpretation has been proposed , and is maintained perhaps even by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are six periods of indefinite length . Besides the statement ought not to have excluded the possibility of other interpretations still . Before entering upon the discussion of the question of interpretation he has stated , the author goes out of his way to triumph ever a suI ) posed deficiency in the science of geology . - he says , can not even prove that there was any original creation . " It furnishes no conclusive evidence , nor , at best , anything more than a faint and doubtful probability that the earth has not existed and been occupied with plants and animals from eternity . " In another place , he speaks of it as a physical theory , which " leaves the fact of any beginning or creation of the world in extreme doubt and uncertainty . " This failure seems to give him a good deal of pleasure , for he repeats it again and again . We would not interfere wantonly witli this sort of complacential triumph , but we think it due to truth to say , that geology does not profess to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It studies the structure of the earth as an existing phenomenon . If writers on natural theology have used the results of geological investigations to prove the creation of matter and have failed , the failure should not be imputed to the science of geology . It is a stale trick to burden science with the office of doing what it does not profess to do , and then upbraid it for not fulfilling that office . If Mr. Lord has fallen into this trick , we are willing to believe it has been done unconsciously . The discussion of the epoch of creation according to the Scriptures is prosecuted in the second and third chapters . The // Nov. author holds that the Scriptures teach that the universe was created at the same time with man . His first argument is drawn from the interpretation of the first verse of Genesis , which connects the beginning of creation with the work of the six days narrated in the subsequent verses . He contends that the Hebrew phrase translated " in the beginning , " always denotes " the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and phrases in particular sentences is pre-eminently the work of judgment and good sense . The best scholar will be a poor interpreter , unless he possesses a well-judging mind . For the ultimate decision innst be left to that sort of tact or whatever else it may be called , which in matters of daily life so generally hits right . It can not be made out like a point of mathematics , though it may be argued about forever . There is always room for those who are disposed to controversy , to carry it on as long as they please . The ever varying shades of meaning which words have in different connections , and the multitude of possibilities which must exist in almost every case , furnish an inexhunstible supply of materials for argumentation . Besides the varied impressions which a particular passage may make upon the mind , and the many little circumstances which conspire to form the judgment , can not be well expressed in words ; and if it is attempted , the imperfection of the account will only give occasion to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially the phrase in the beginning , " opens a wide field of discussion . By means of parallel texts , it may be prolonged without end . But fortunately it is a passage which involves no doctrine of religion about which men differ , and we can get at the nubiased decisions of scholars and divines upon it . It is well known what that decision has been . Men of sound , practical judginent , men of comprehensive learning , men of profound thought , men of every name and p*rsuasion , eminent in the church of Christ , have united in judgment upon this question . There is a very general acquiescence in separating the creation of the heavens and the earth announced in the first verse from the transactions of the " six days . " Under these circumstances , a new and strong case must be made out in order to overthrow this decision . But we discover nothing new in what Mr. Lord has advanced , unless an uncommon degree of positiveness be a novelty . But if there is nothing new in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiary arguments in favor of his main position as to the epoch of creation , which we believe are new ; at least we do not remember // 1851. lord 's Epoch of creation . to have met with them . These , therefore , we must briefly examine . The first which presents itself may be thus stated . The author lays down as a foundation , the following proposition , that " the creation of the heavens and the earth is made in revelation the basis of God 's rights and prerogatives over His creatnres as their providential and moral governor . " lie then argues that this creation must have been contemporaneous with the creation of man , in order to render that claim effectual . But we will quote his own language . " Had the sacred writers only stated in general terms that God created the celestial bodies and the earth , without associating with that statement a detail of all the visible objects of creation , so as to exclude the idea of any other creator of any of those objects ; and including in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idolatry , imposture , and error , their testimony , however correct as far as it went , would not have met the exigencies of the case . " Had the first verse of Genesis asserted the creation at an indefinitely remote , uncertain , and unknown epoch , wholly unassociated with man as a creature , and with his relations and duties as a moral agent , no such sign as the sanctification of the seventh day , to re-express and perpetuate the fact that Jehovah was the Creator , could have been instituted ; nor would the bare assertion that he was the Creator , without such a significant and oft-recurring sign , founded in the details of the works of creation , and interwoven with the moral relations and obligations of man , have served to guard him against the wiles of the antagonist system . " - p. 69 . Hero itis plainly asserted-not on the authority of revelation , but of Mr. Lord only-that the creation of the material universe at the same time with the creation of man was an absolute necessity , if God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral kingdom  --  the two would be so wholly unassociated ! Astronomers tell us that there are bodies in the universe so remote in space that light commencing its journey at the epoch of man 's creation , would not as yet have reached him . Could not Mr. Lord get up an argument to prove they are not so far off , because such a distance would so dissociate them with man as to impair the force of God 's government over him ? We have heard a good deal in our day of putting limits to the power of the Almighty , but we think this is the boldest case we have ever met with . The second argument which we notice is founded on a similar primiciple , and is derived from the office of the Logos as creator . The author first lays down the following proposition which we give in his own language : " As the anointed , the Christ , he was with God , before exercising his creative energy in the work of creation ; and in that character lie created all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nov . " Having created the earth , instead of leaving it through millions of ages without occupants having any relation to his moral government , he created man , and invested him with a subordinate dominion over the inferior creatures , to rule them for himself , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things . ' " In this view of his person and office , and the connection of his work of creating and upholding all things with hi* moral and providential government , and all his works as Prophet , Priest , and King , it would be more than irreverent to represent him as having created the earth myriads of ages before he created man , whose nature , in order to the execution of the most important and glorious part of his whole undertaking , was to be and remain forever united to his person . " No deductions of geology , unsupported by and irreconcilable with the teachings of revelation concerning him , can justify us in disconnecting the first act in the execution of his delegated undertaking , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its relations , was essential . " - pp. 80-81 . We are here again told-not on the authority of revelation , but the presumptions pre-judgment of Mr. Lord-that to have created the earth at an earlier epoch than the creation of man would have been so far unworthy of Christ that the suggestion of the thought is irreverent . But is it for man to dictate , when Christ should have created the earth ? Can man fathom by ( 2 priori reasoning all the motives which should have governed the creator of the universe ? Besides , what more idle than questions of earlier and later when we speak of eternal duration ? But Mr. Lord 's notion of eternity seems to be somewhat peculiar , for he declares that the geologists represent natural causes as acting so s ? ow*y , as " to render the inference that the vast masses of sedimentary matter were ever produced by them , not only improbable and incredible , but impossible " - impossible , we suppose , for want of time in past eternity ! The third and last argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection . Mr. Lord is quite dissatisfied with the primeval earth of the geologists , lie declares it an inconceivably imperfect one ; in fact , no earth at all . But we must quote the passage : our author is quite witty at the expense of the geologists . " Again : the alleged primeval earth of the geologists is supposed by them to have been , if not a mere chaos , wholly without order , light , and life , yet , at best , to have been an extremely , nay , inconceivably , imperfect earth-an earth in such a state and condition as with no propriety to be called an earth , it being at first , and no one knows for how many myriads of ages , unfit for the abode of the meanest insects and reptiles , and so unfit for the abode of man , its intended prince and master , as to require a course of alterations and improvements to be carried on incessantly through immeasurable rounds of duration , before he could exist , if created or developed and brought upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by geological causes as to admit of the creation of some of the lowest organisms , the Creator interposed and brought them into existence ; and when , according to the laws of their nature , which ( contrary to the perfective law of the embryo earth ) was a law of decay and degradation , they died // iSSi . Lord 's Epoch of Creation . out , ' and took their permanent stations as organic fossils in the lowest fossilliferous stratum , the Creator interposed again , and brought forward a class of creeping things , as much more perfect than the class which had died out , as the progress of geological improvement would permit . By the repetition of this mechanical tide-waiting process , as often as the successive creations , when their places of abode became too perfect for their natures , declined and rua out , the earth at last came to be stocked with animals wholly unsuited to be contemporary with man . The development had gone too far ,  --  a retrograde movement was necessary . It was not only necessary to exterminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latest creation , but to throw the earth itself back into a chaotic state , in order , by the operation of the six days ' spoken of by Moses , to give it just that degree of perfection which would make it suitable to the nature of man , and to stock the seas , the land , and the atmosphere , with races proper to be contemporary with him . " Wonderful scheme of operations , no doubt , considered as a geological contrivance , and of it , considered as the scheme of the Moral Governor of the Universe , who sees the end from the beginning , and acts only for reasons worthy of his infinite perfections l " - pp. 85-87 . But as the author kindles with the subject , he loses his wit and grows indignant . " This beggarly , earth-born scheme , " he says , " is scarcely to be treated of without impatience and indignation . It dishonors every attribute of the eternal self-existent Creator ; and would dishonor any human mechanician , who was competent to his nndertakin* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of all The phenomena which the geologists adduce . He only accounts for their existence differently . It would seem , then , that the very same phenomena , which , produced by natural causes , ( of which ultimately uf course God is the author , ) prove imperfection of plan , prove perfection of plan , when produced by supernatural causes . A distinction pretty much without a difference . Besides , are we to give up what we see , as it were , with our own eyes , as to the manner in which God has created the earth , in order to accommodate some * pr%ori speculations as to the perfectibility of creation ? But this argument needs no refutation ; one feels in handling it , that he has disinterred some petrified fossil of middle-age metaphysics . We have thus hastily noticed the several considerations by which Mr. Lord proves from Scripture that the epoch of the creation of the material universe was the same with that of the creation of man . We have been so often reminded , in doing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the folios of that divine , and published in his recent work entitled " Religion of Geology , " that we present it to our readers . Turretin lays down the following proposition , that " the sun and moon move in the heavens and revolve around the earth , while the earth remains at rest "  --  and proves it . " First . The sun is said in Scripture to move in the heavens , and to rise // Nov. and set . ( Ps. 19 , v. 5 . ) The sun is as a lridegroom coming out of his chamher , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race . ( Ps. 104 , v. 19 . ) The sun Jcnoweth his going down . ( Eccies. 1 , v. 5 . ) The sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down . Secondly . The sun , by a miracle , stood still in the time of Joshua ( Joshua , ch. 10 , v. 12 , 13 , 14 ) , and by a miracle it went back in the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Thirdly . The earth is said to be fixed iminovalidy . ( Ps. 93 , v. 1 . ) The world also is estallished that it can not he moved . ( Ps. 104 , v. 5 . ) Who laid the found tion of the earth , that it should not he removed forever . ( Ps. 119 , v. 90 , 91 . ) Thou hast established the earth , and it ahideth . Theycontinue this day according to thine ordinances . Fourthly , Neither could birds , which often fly off through an hour 's circuit , be able to return to their nests ; for in the mean time the earth would move four hundred and fifty of our miles . Fifthly . Whatever flies or is suspended in the air , ought , by this theory , to move from west to east ; but this is proved not to be true from birds , arrows shot forth , atoms made manifest in the sun , and down fioatino* in the atmosphere . " To the suggestion that Scripture , in natural things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers , " First , the Spirit of God best understands natural things . Secondly , in giving instruction in religion , he meant these things should be used , not abused . Thirdly , he is not the author of any error . Fourthly , he is not be corrected on this pretence by our blind reason . " Te the suggestion , that birds , the air , and all things are moved with the earth , he gives two answers . " First . This is a mere fiction , since air is a fluid body . Secondly . If it were so , by what force would birds be able to go from east to west ? " Compendium Theologice Didacto-Eleuctic* , Amsterdam , 1695 . Turretin was doubtless as thoroughly convinced of the infallibility of his interpretation as is Mr. Lord of his ; and there is another coincidence which we should hardly have anticipated . The physical arguments of Turretin bear a most marvelous likeness to certain speculations which are to be met with in the subsequent part of Mr. Lord 's book . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord should have referred to one of the veryp assages quoted by Turretin , that from Joshua . Turretin says , " the sun stood still ; " Mr. Lord says , Jehovah " suspended the revolution of the earth . " We fear Mr. Lord would have received at the hands of Turretin a little of that castigation which he so liberally bestows upon the geologists , for not following the obvious , apparent meaning . By the way , does Mr. Lord suppose that Joshua actually thought that it was the earth and not the sun which stood still ? // But Mr. Lord is not satisfied , as we have just intimated , without having a tilt with the geologists on their own ground . He attempts to discuss the geological questions as a man of science , and if he were really acquainted with the science , would be no unworthy antagonist . Mr. Lord , in this part of his work , undertakes to sho ' * that the geological theory of the antiquity of the earth is entitled to no credit even as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geologists in their stronghold . We admire his bravery . There he stands alone against a host-Humboldt , Buckland , Murchison , Sedgwick , Lycil , Miller , De La Beche , Silliman , Hitchcock , Agassiz , and every other man of science  --  and not alone in one country but in every country where there is science at all  --  and not only every man of science in this department but every man of science in every cognate department  --  and not only every man of science but every man of education who has studied the subject . We confine this argument , of course , to the point under consideration-the operation of natural causes in producing the phenomena of the earth disclosed by geological investigations , and the consequent indefinite antiquity of the earth . In the explanation of particular facts by specific natural causes there is great diversity of hypothesis , as there must be in every progressive science . But our author shall speak for himself . The quotation contains the substance of his entire argument ,  --  and a more remarkable paragraph has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here those who believe in the inspiration of the Scriptures might be content to rest , assured that no interpretation of the facts of geology or inferences from them , in conflict with the statements of revelation , can be entitled to any consideration . But many good men , teachers of revealed religion , and others , are prepossessed with the impression that the geological theory , respecting the antiquity of the earth , is entitled to regard as a deduction or demonstration of science , and as such is in conflict with the language of Scripture . This , however , is a mistake . That which constitutes or belongs to geology as a science , has properly nothing whatever , directly or indirectly , to do with the question at issue . It has to do only with physical phenomena , their natural laws , and their physical relations and connections . To determine the Epoch of Creation is as truly out of its province as it is to create a world. , It can not demonstrate , nor even render it probable , that the earth ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part of the science , but is a discreditable appendage to it . The theory is merely an inference , a supposition , a conjecture , derived from the construction which the geologist puts upon the facts of the science , the phenomena which he observes , and the mode in which he conceives them to have been produced by the ordinary and exclusive operation of natural causes . Should he modify his inference by admitting that a supernatural cause may have been interposed to produce those facts , he would be forced to conclude that geology could determine nothing upon the subject . It is impossible for // him to prove , or to exhibit any facts or phenomena from which it can be inferred , that supernatural interpositions have not taken place , or that there have not been adequate reasons and occasions for them . And it is only by vaulting over the boundaries of geological science , into the province of revelation , moral government , and final causes , and assuming that no supernatural interpositions have occurred , that he makes his inference , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural causes to produce the phenomena which he observes . " - pp. 94-96 . There are one or two things in this passage which we must notice before coming to the argument . He again makes " the epoch of creation " one of the objects of geological investigation . But there is not a geologist in the world who has ever attempted to iix the time when the earth was created . Indeed , he might as well attempt to create a world as to determine that . But to say that the earth has eGeisted for an indeterminate length of time is not the same as to say it legan to exist at a determinate point of time . The geologist may be found quietly at work in very remote periods , but never at the fountain-head of time . It may be added , also , that the question of antiquity is an incidental one and not the main one in geology . But Mr. Lord says " the theory of a remote antiquity is merely an inference . " An inference ! Mr. Lord seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole argument for the intervention of supernatural causes is an inference ! Where in Scripture is the account of such sup ernatural causes as would produce the appearances brought to light from the depths of the earth ? Is it in the account of creation ? God said , " let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that bath life "  --  but is there anything here that leads us to think he created strata of fishes thousands of feet thick ? Is it the deluge ? what is there in the account of that to lead us to the conjecture of such supernatural causes as would produce what geology has revealed ? Nothing . The truth is , there is no direct account in the Bible of the operation of such supernatural agency as must be assumed , if the eiioch of the material creation is identical with that of man . We defy denial upon this point . * then , does Mr. Lord get his knowledge of such supernatural intervention ? Why , by inference . The heavens and the earth were created at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been &amp;upernatural agency . But we proceed to examine his positions . His first position is that geologists have entirely mistaken the proper object of the science , which is simply to observe facts . It has nothing to do with causes . Its sole office is to observe facts , " simple , comprehensive , fixed facts . " These " can be described on paper simply as facts , without any conjectures as to how they were caused , or // any inferences as to the time occupied in their causation . " We hardly know how to treat this modern Novum Organon with gravity . The old one did indeed abjure the attempt to manufacture facts by * pr*or ' * reasoning and metaphysical speculation , but it did not discard the study of the causes of the facts which have been ascertained by observation . And it did well in not discarding it , if we may judge either from the nature of the human mind or the results of the system . The impulse to trace effects to causes is one of the very strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe is also very strong , particularly in childhood , and there are some full-grown minds that take pleasure in collecting stores of mere facts ; but we have supposed that the habit of connecting facts in the relation of cause and effect was the characteristic of the philosophical and well-trained mind . The progress of science , too , which has been made not less by the investigation of causes than the observation of facts , would seem to show that cause and effect should not be separated in science . But we cyprehend this new system of Mr. Lord 's , which authorizes the student to record the impression made on his senses , but not the irresistible convictions of his understanding as to the cause of that which makes the impression , will reach much farther than the author intended . A child puts his hand in the fire and is burnt . Is it unscientific for him not to put his hand in the fire again , hecause , if he does , it will burn him ? Newton saw an apple fall to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause acting through and in the universal law of gravitation ? The universe is an effect ; may we not &amp;fer an intelligent and almighty cause ? Now , in geology the existence of causes forces itself upon the mind just as much as in these cases , and if the human mind could be compelled to disregard and disown causes there , it would disregard and disown them everywhere . But we fear our readers will accuse us of misrepresentation , unless we give the words of the author . The quotation will be long , but then it is a curious one . " Suppose now the geologist to go forth to examine the structure and materials of the globe . He observes two classes of rocks , stratified and unstratified . They are clearly distinguishable . One has a crystallized form and texture , the other such a form and texture as would result from the deposit of mud , sand , and gravel in water . These he calls sedimentary . He finds of these , a regular succession of beds or layers , which in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These layers differ from each other in thickness and in their mineral composition ; that is , in the kind of earthy materials which they were composed of* He finds them generally tilted up from the horizontal position in which they were deposited , to a greater or less degree of inclination , and sometimes to a vertical position , so as greatly to facilitate his examination of them . He gives distinctive names to these successive layers , indicative of their mineral // characters , as gneiss , lime-stone , red sandstone , slate , coal , clay , &amp;c. &amp;c . He observes that the lowest of these sedimentary formations everywhere rests on crystalline rock or granite . Again he observes that a large portion of these sedimentary rocks , to the depth of six or seven miles , contains the skeletons and relics of various plants and animals , terrestrial and marine . " Now these and the like undisputed and unquestionable facts constitute what he calls , or ought to call , geology . The observation , study , and knowledge of them constitute the science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geologists , one and all , have occupied themselves mainly in attempting toaccount for the facts disclosed by their researches upon some theory of the mode in which they were caused , the physical agencies by which they were effected , the time occupied , &amp;c. &amp;c. ; and they most unscientifically and unwarrantably denominate the facts , and their theories and inferences conjointly , the science of Geology . " - pp. 146-.148 . Suppose now the geologists had done just what Mr. Lord wishes-what difference would it have made ? There is not a reader of ordinary intelligence that would not have accounted for the facts for himself . ft is impossible , under such circumstances , to crush by authority the natural and necessary convictions of the understanding . Can any human being see the pebbles of the drift and not believe they were rounded by the action of water ? Yes , there is one man , Mr. Lord . We had forgotten at the moment that this is one of the points he makes against the geologists . The pebbles , he thinks , are so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , without an extreme vertical pressure , and a motive power far exceeding that of current water , would ever wear off their angles and give them their rounded form . " How does the reader suppose they were rounded ? By miracle , of course . But to return from this digression , can any man-except Mr. Lord-see the tracks in the sandstone of Connecticut river and not believe they were made by birds stepping upon the materials of the stone when in a soft state ? Not all the authority in the world can present such inferences being drawn . If science were to discard them , the common mind would take them up . Mr. Lord 's second and grand position is , that the facts observed by the geologist might have been produced by supernatural causes . This is the sheet-anchor of his cause . It is in fact his sole reliance . Almost every page of the volume bears witness to what he thinks of it . But who ever denied the possibility of such an agency ? Surely no geologist who is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have been wrought by miracles . Anything which does not involve an impossibility may be done by almighty power . The difficulty with Mr. Lord 's position is , that it is worth little , after he has established it . We will , however , examine it , and will first // look at the peculiar phraseology which he adopts . He says the theory of the antiquity of the earth is " merely an inference , a supposition , a conjecture . " But if the changes in the structure of the earth were produced by natural causes , it is absolutely certain-whether you call it inference or supposition or conjecture-that the earth must have a greater antiquity than the race of men . This can not be his meaning , though it is the apparent and most natzcral interpretation of the words . The doctrine of the geologists that the facts which they observe have been produced by natural causes , is the inference , supposition , conjecture , of which he speaks . I-fe calls it in another place " the assumption " of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this . The geologist finds results , effects-facts-in the process of production on the surface of the earth by natural causes which are the same in kind as he finds within the crust of the earth . In searching the causes of these latter effects or facts , he necessarily accounts for them by causes which he sees now at work producing the same results . But not only is there this positive demand for a natural explanation of the facts , there is nothing in the facts which excites the suspicion of any other causes , or gives reason to suppose any other ever existed . It is extremely difficult to express by language the full impression which the reality makes upon the mind , but if the reader will conceive of a person beholding some plain covered with broken weapons of war and strewed with dead bodies , pierced with bullets or mangled with cannon ball or hacked with swords , and still believing that those appearances were produced not by battle but by supernatural agency , he will have some idea of the state of mind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances which he observes were the products of miraculous power . For , without an exception , all geologists are agreed in this principle , which is indeed the very foundation of the science . Mr. Lord may call this explanation of the facts of geology by natural causes , an **43;934;TOOLONG , or whatever else lie pleases , it is an explanation forced upon the mind by the necessary laws of human belief . Now how much is a hare possi bility that Almighty power might have interposed , to weigh against such convictions ? Mr. Lord does indeed say that it is * impossible for geology to prove or to exhibit any facts or phenomena from which it can be inferred that superna-. tural interpositions have not taken place " - neither can any one show that the deltas now forming at the outlet of rivers , and the mud and rocks depositing at the bottom of lakes , may not be going on through supernatural agency . It may be possible that rivers flow to the ocean , trees and plants spring up from the VOL. ix . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are produced by supernatural intervention ; we could not perhaps demonstrate the contrary , certainly we could not , if Mr. Lord 's principles are correct . For , it is to be remembered that this is not a case where the fact it8e*f shows it * , nust have been prqduced by miracle , it is not a case where hypothetically some case may be supposed , as in the Nebular hypothesis , but it is a case where if there have been any supernatural causes , they have so closely simulated natural causes that the one can not be discriminated from the other . And it does appear to us that if the human mind gives up its convictions under these circumstances , all the laws of evidence are reversed , and we can have no confidence in any reasoning of this kind . And yet throughout the volume , Mr. Lord has spoken of the inferences and conjectures of the geologists and found fault with them for overlooking the agency of supernatural causes . But , perhaps , Mr. Lord will say he does not rely upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has given reasons for its exercise . What are they ? Certain metaphysical speculations as to the necessary connection of the epoch of the creation of the material universe with the creation of man  --  but they are worthless in such a case as this : Certain moral ends which the Deity had in view  --  but they are as readily secured on the one scheme as on the other : And , besides these , we know of none , excepting his interpretation of the first verse of Genesis , and in this interpretation lie stands alone , unsupported by the great majority of Christian divines and scholars . But , perhaps , Mr. Lord will further say , he has shown that there is evidence of the intervention of supernatural agency in the facts themselves . lie has tried to do so , and his argument about " rounded pebbles " is a specimen of his success in this line . We shall not discuss this part of the subject . The truth is , Mr. Lord is not scientifically acquainted with geology , and his observations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expose them in a way which we do not wish to do . There are a great many other things in this volume fully as remarkable as any we have taken up . But we pass them by , as we have examined the main principles of the book . We intended to make some remarks upon the Introduction written by Rev. Richard W. Dickinson , D . D. , but on re-reading it we perceive we should be obliged to go over the ground we have already traversed . Besides , the writer exhibits no precise scientific acquaintance with geology , less even than the gentleman whose treatise* he indorses and eulogizes ; although he turns a very good period , as he descants upon the conflicting theories of the geologists , almost every teacher having a different one-upon // the assumptions of the " deini-savants " of the age ! upon their rejection of , and contempt for " all that is miraculous in the works as well as in the IFord of the Creator " /-upon their failure to demonstrate " the Epoch of Creation ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scripture , by which is meant their lack of faith in the infallibility of his interpretation of the first verse of Genesis , for he seems to be in a happy and complacential state of ignorance as to the views of other divines and scholars . We have never had so vivid a conception of the trials which beset the early cultivators of science as in reading this volume . We seem to see the weight of overbearing authority and dogma-* tic intolerance pressing them down with an increased force . We are more ready to wonder that they ever advanced opinions in physics contrary to the received teachings of Scripture than that , startled by their own temerity and awed by the decisions of the church , they should have shrunk back and disavowed their convictions . That time , we are thankful , has passed . The man of science can now pursue his investigations in peace , unharmed by the feeble shouts which are now and then raised against him . The present volume a few years since might have done harm . It is now too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm the prejudices of the
