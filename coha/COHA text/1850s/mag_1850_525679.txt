WhAT CONSTITUTES REAL FREEDOM OF TRADE ? Such is the question to which we mean to ask the attention of our readers , believing it one of the highest importance , and knowing that there exist in relation to it impressions that are most erroneous , and that may , as we think , be removed by a careful examination of the phenomena by which real freedom of trade is characterised . THROUGhOUT the world , and at all ages , men have been disputing about words to which they attach no distinct ideas ; and such is still the case . The writers of Eu - rope , opposed to Democracy , quote , in illustration of its evils , the example of Athens , whose citizens lived in the streets and in the courts , occupied in the government of the people of a thousand subject towns and cities , or in theatres erected and maintained by aid of taxes imposed on those subjects , who , when in Athens , were denied participation in the amusements , for the support of which they were taxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there can be no subjects ; whereas in a government by a people , masters are numerous , and the condition of the subject approaches near to that of a slave . Athens had numerous subjects , and therefore could be no democracy , though it is ever referred to as such . M. de Toe queville wrote of democracy in America , while proving in every page of his work his entire inability to furnish such an explanation of the phenomena of society which constitute democracy as would enable us to rect ) gnize it when we might chance to meet it . The owner of a thousand slaves calls himself a democrat , and stigmatizes the employer of a hundred workmen as an aristocrat . We are daily called upon to support certain measures because they are democratic , yet , when examined , they not unfrequently prove to be precisely such as would be advocated by men who desired to diminish the power of self-government , and destroy democracy . At one time , certain measures are advocated as democratic in their tendency ; and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the people who vote not unfrequently lend their aid to measures the direct effect of which is to transfer power from themselves to others who should be their servants - but thus become their masters . So is it with many other terms in constant use . Civilization is in the mouth of every one , and yet where shall we find such a definition of its phenomena as will enable us accurately to distinguish it from barbarism ? Jill . Gwizot undertook the task and failed , the consequence of which is , that the reader of his History of Civilization rises from its perusal with no distinct ideas on the subject of the work . Unable to describe the thing of which he wrote , he invites attention to a period of Roman history described as one of rapidly advancing civilization , whereas a little further knowledge would have enabled him to see that it was one , all the phenomena of which were evidences of rapidly advancing barbarism . We are daily told that certain occurrences , indicating deterioration of physical or moral condition , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in possession of any generally recognized test of civilization , we should find those occurrences to be the result of measures tending in the opposite direction . France claims to be at the head of civilization . yet France is ever at war , either abroad on at home , and war and barbarism are synonymous . Another of these terms is Slavery . Of all our readers , there is scarcely one that does not suppose himself capable of furnishing a definition of the word , and yet how few in number of the definitions thus sup- // plied would stand ! The English journalist looks with horror upon the idea of selling a negro slave , yet he prints without remark a paragraph like the following , in relation to the people of the sister kingdom , of whom he is accustomed to write as being free : " Out of three hundred creatures who were seen and spoken to by the proprietor of this journal , during a recent visit to the Kilrush Workhouse , forty-six have silice died of starvation . On the morning of the 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road-side near Knockeven . It is further stated that at the last accounts from the Kilrush Union , six hundred patients were under medical treatment from diseases arising principally from the want of sufficient food . An inquest was held on the morning of the 5th ult. , at Ballinalacken , on the body of Michael Fitzgerald , and the verdict of the jury was ,  --  " Death for the want of food . " The same day an inquest was held on the body of a young lad named James Grady , and the verdict was " Death from disease of the lunge , accelerated by destitution . " The papers abound with similar accounts . The details of some of the cases are truly touching and heart-rending . "  - -  - Limerick Examiner . The man who is given over to the tender mercies of the parish overseer is far less free than he who is sold to a master who needs his services , and is willing to feed , and clothe , and lodge him well in return therefor . The Irishman , expelled from his wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of being bought by any one who would treat him as are treated the slaves of Georgia . The abolitionist rejects the cotton of the well-fed , well-clothed , and well-lodged laborer of Tennessee , preferring that of the free Hindoo , who perishes of pestilence , consequent upon a famine , itself the result of tyranny and oppression so universal and complete that the poor ryot , or little occupant of the soil , is enabled , and with truth , to declare that " his skin alone is left him . " The British government , at enormous cost , maintains fleets on the coast of Africa for the purpose of stopping the negro slave trade , and employs other fleets on the coast of China for the purpose of compelling the people of that country to grant a market for opium produced in India by the free people , whose condition is worse than that of slaves . It emancipates the black man in the West , and enslaves the brown one in the East ; and the advocate of the one messure is equally the advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are no clear and distinct ideas attached to any of these terms , and equally so , that , until we can agree upon some definition , expressing clearly the idea that is meant to be conveyed by them we shall continue to occupy ourselves in disputing about words instead of things . In other sciences , this difficulty does not exist . The word gravitation , whenever and however used , conveys always the same idea . So is it with all the terms of physical science , and hence it is that men who are engaged in the study of the phenomena of the physical world find so little difficulty in understanding each other , while it is rare to find two men engaged in the discussion of any question touching the condition of man that do not greatly differ as to the signification of the terms they use . Of all those in use among men , there is , perhaps , not one that is now more frequently used than that of free tradenor one in relation to which there exists so much difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that the immediate adoption of a certain system which passes by that name would be productive of unmixed good ; while , by another , it is regarded as a sort of Pandora 's box abounding in evil , and yet both parties would be found agreeing that they themselves preferred , in the performance of their exchanges with each other , the most perfect freedom of trade . What is it that constitutes free trade ? As in the case of democracy , civilization , and slavery , every one of our readers will find himself prepared with a definition , yet it will , as we think , be difficult to find among them all a single clear and definite idea-such an one as will embrace and explain accurately the phenomena which constitute real freedom of trade . Like the other terms to which we have referred , it seems very simple , yet few would be found to be agreed in determining precisely what it meant . The Englishman boasts that his country is the land of free trade , yet the farmer can not apply his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hops into beer , nor can his wife apply her own labor for the conversion of her tallow into candles , while the brewer is required to brew , // and the tallow-chandler to make his candles , according to law . The owner of disengaged capital can not determine for himself the mode of its employment . If he would purchase land , he finds himself surrounded by men who can neither sell the property nor give it to their children , and if he study the works of the most eminent advocates of free trade , he finds that the community is benefitted by restraints upon trade in law , the source of all production. * If he would bank , he is met by the monopoly of the Bank of England ; and if he study the speeches of another eminent advocate of free trade , t he will find that it is to the interest of the community that the monopoly should be maintained . The owner of a machine can not send it to distant countries without a license . The inventor of an improvement can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little owners of a saving fund must make their investments in consols which yield but three per cent . Throughout England , there is no real freedom of trade . The system tends to build up great landholders , great farmers , great manufacturers , great newspapers , great lawyers , great conveynneers , great railroad speculators , and great men of many other classes , while preventing the existence of a free market for either labor or capital ; the consequence of which is , that these great men are surrounded by an infinite number of small men , whose utmost exertions are insufficient to enable them to obtain adequate supplies of food and clothes , because of the vast number of persons who stand between the producer and the consumer , and who must be supported , even if both producer and consumer be forced to seek refuge in the workhouse - and yet England now claims to be emphatically the land of free trade , because , quite recently , she has abolished some restrictions on the smallest and least important portion of her trade , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up to us , and we are told that any departure from the system there known by the name of " free trade " would have " an unfavorable effect on public opinion in England , " and English writers lecture us on the advantages of perfect freedom of trade , without perceiving that here it is that trade is freest , and that it is for them to pattern after us , instead of urging that we should pattern after them . The owner of land here disposes of it as he pleases . The farmer may make his own candles , brew his own beer , burn his own bricks . The author communicates his ideas to the world without being subjected to the payment of a tax , and the mechanic exports his machine without a license . Everywhere there exists a freedom of trade in land , labor , and the products of land and labor , elsewhere unknown , and yet because , in some certain matters , we do not follow the example of England , we are reproached as being slaves to anci-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great principles of English political economy . Anxious to meet the good opinion of our trans-Atlantic relatives , we occasionally make a step in their direction , the result of which has thus far been , and that invariably , to close the mills , furnaces , and workshops of the Union ; the places at which men , women and children were accustomed to trade off labor in exchange for the necessaries , convenience , and comforts of life . The spinner was thus denied the power to trade her labor for cloth , for the reason that trade has become free . The mechanic was deprived of the power to trade his labor for food for his children , because trade had becomefree . The miner , desirous to trade his labor for coal , was compelled to remain idle , or to raise food , because trade had become free . The furnace-man , unable to exchange his exertions for food and cloths , found that it was freedom of trade that had produced the inability to trade  --  and thus a general paralysis of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England we see precisely the same results with each and every step in the direction known as free trade . Every packet brings advice of diminished power to exchange labor for commodities , the consequence of which is , diminished home consumption , diminished prices of commodities , for the diminution is the price of labor , and increased necessity for exporting to foreign countries the men who had lost the power to trade off their labor for commodities , and the commodities no longer needed to be given in exchange for 9 * See MeCulloch on the Succession to Property vacant by death . t Sir Robert Peel . voL. vi . NO . II . NEw SERIES . // labor . Each successive arrival informs us of the increasing number of persons compelled to live in alms-houses , and compelled to make their exchanges through the medium of poor-law guardians , because of inability to make their accustomed exchanges of labor for food  --  and month after month , we have to remark the increasing anxiety for expelling from England the men , women and children who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to trade off their exertions in exchange for food and clothing  --  and yet England claims to be the land of free trade . If we turn to Ireland , also the land of free trade , we see an almost total inability to trade off labor in exchange for either food or clothing . Canada has free trade , yet she is unable to trade off labor for food , and Canadians are forced to get employment within the Union . Next , we see the farmer of Canada seeking to send his food to be exchanged in the markets of the Union for that labor which could not be employed at home . The system that is called free trade appears there , as here , to produce general inability to maintain trade . It is scarcely possible to study these facts without being convinced that , in the meaning that is attached to " free trade , " there existssome error that needs detection . Real and perfect freedom of trade would have unmixed good , as is proved to be the case among the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free trade , " appears , on the contrary , examine it where we way , to be productive of unmixed evil , diminishing the power to trade wherever the system obtains ; the diminution is seen to be always greatest where it most obtains . In 1841-2 the power to trade labor for food in this country was almost at an end , and the Union presented the same state of things that now exists in Canada . In 1846 , the power to trade was immense . In 1850 , it has greatly declined , and it declines dai ly . Seeing these things , it would seem to be time to examine in what it really is that freedom of trade  --  the unmixed good-consists , that we may know it when we meet it , and perhaps also be enabled to determine in what direction it may be sought . To do this satisfactorily to ourselves and our readers , we must begin at the beginning of trade , in the family , which long precedes the nation . Doing so , we find the husband trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials of clothing , for those of his wife , employed in the preparation of food for the table , and the conversion of raw materials into clothing , and here it is we find the greatest of all trades . Of all the labor employed on the farms and in the farm-houses of the Union , we should , if ever we have an accurate statement , find that the proportion ( f its products exchanged beyond their own limits , scarcely exceeded one-third , and was certainly far less than one-half , the remainder being given to the raising of food and raw materials for their own consumption , and the conversion of that food and those materials into the forms fitting for their own uses . At the next step we find ourselves in the little community , of which the owner of this farm constitutes a portion ; and here we find the farmer exchanging his wheat with one neighbor for a day 's labor-.  - -  . the use of his wagon and his horse for other days of labor - his potatoes with a third for the shoeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoeing of himself and his children , or the making of his coat . On one day he or his farnily have labor to spare , and they pass it off to a neighbor to be repaid by him in labor on another day . One requires aid in the spring , the other in the autumn ; one gives a day 's labor in hauling lumber , in exchange for that of another employed in mining coal or iron ore . Another trades the labor that has been employed in the purchase of a plough for that of his neighbor which had been applied to the purchase of a cradle . Exchanges being thus made on the spot , from hour to hour and from day to day , with little or no intervention of persons whose business is trade , the amount of exchanges is large , and combined with those of the family , equals probably fourfifths of the total product of the labor of the community , leaving not more than onefifth to be traded off with distant men ; and this proportion is often greatly diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the land for the products of the land . This little community forms part of a larger one , stykd a nation , the members of which are distant hundreds , or thousands of miles from each other , and here we find difficulties tending greatly to limit the power to trade . The man in latitude 40* may // have labor to sell for which he can find no purchaser , while he who lives in latitude 50 is at the moment grieving to see his crop perish on the ground for want of aid in harvest . The first may have potatoes rotting , and his wagon and horses idle , while the second may need potatoes , and have his lumber on his hands for want of means of transportation , yet distance forbids exchange beween them . Again , this nation forms part of a world , the inhabitants of which are distant tens of thousands of miles from each other , and totally unable to effect exchanges of labor , or even of commodities , except of certain kinds that will bear transportation to distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its amount with every circumstance tending to increase the necessity for going to a distance , and to increase in amount with every one tending to diminish the distance within which it must be maintained . As it now stands with the great farming interest of the Union , the proportions are probably as follows : Exchanges in the family , 55 per cent . in the neighborhood , 25 in the nation , 15 " with other nations , 5 " Total , 100 It will now be obvious that any law , domestic or foreign , tending to interfere with the exchanges of the family or the neighborhood , would be of more serious importance than one that should , to the same extent , affect those with the rest of the nation , and that one which should affect the trade of one part of the nation with another , would be more injurious than one which should tend to limit the trade with distant nations . Japan refuses to have intercourse with either Europe or America , yet this total interdiction of trade with a great empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the imposition of a duty of one farthing a bushel upon the vegetable food raised on their farms to be consumed in their families . The great trade is the home trade , and the greater the tendency to the performance of trade at home the more rapid will be the increase of prosperity , and the greater the power to effect exchanges abroad . The reason of this is to be found in the fact that the power of protection increases with the power of combined exertion , and all combination is an exchange of labor for labor , the exchange being affected at home . The more exchanges are effected at home the smaller is the number of the men hands , wages , ships , or sailors , employed in making exchanges , and the greater the number employad in the work of production with increase in the quantity of commodities produced , and the power to trade grows with the power to produce , while the power to produce diminishes with every increase in the necessity for trade . Again , when the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitates the trading off of a vast amount of labor that would otherwise be wasted , and an infinite number of things that would otherwise have no value whatever , but which , combined with the labor that is saved , are quite sufficient to make one community rich by comparison with another in which such savings can not be effected . Virginia wastes more labor and more commodities that would have value in New England than would pay five times over for all the cloth and iron she consumes . Again , the quantity of capital required for effecting exchanges tends to diminish as exchanges come nearer home . The ship which goes to China performs no more exchanges in a year than the canal-boat which trades from city to cityperforms in a month ; and the little and inexpensive railroad car passing from village to village may perform twice as many exchanges as the fine packet ship which has cost ninety or a hundred thousand dollars . With the extension of the home trade , labor and capital become , therefore , more productive of commodities required for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laborer and the profits of the capitalist tend to increase , and trade tends still further to increase . On the other hand , with the diminution of the power to effect exchanges at home , labor and capital become less productive of commodities ; the wages of the laborer and the profits of the capitalist tend to decrease , and trade tends still further to diminish . All this is fully exemplified on a comparison of the years 1835-36 with 1841-42 , while the contrary upward tendency is exemplified by the years 184*-6 and 7 , as compared with 1841-2 . Singularly enough , however , the fashios*a // ble doctrine of our day is , that the prosperity of a nation is to be measured by the amount of its trade with people who are distant , as manifested by custom-house returns , and not by the quantity of exchanges among persons who live near each other , and who trade without the intervention of ships , and little need of steam-boats or waggons . If the trade of a neighborhood be closed by the failure of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power to trade off the labor of himself or his children , or the farmer deprived of the power to trade off his food , consolation is found in the increased quantity of exports , itself , perliaps , t/*e direct consequenceofa diminished ability to consume at home . lf canal-boats cease to be built , the nation is deemed to be enriched by the substitution of ocean steamers requiring one hundred times the capital for the performance of the same quantity of exchange . If the failure of mills and furnaces cause men to be thrown out of employment , the remedy is to be found , not in the revisal of the measures that have produced these effects , but in the exportation of the men themselves to distant climes , thus producing a necessity for the permanent use of ships instead of canal-boats , with diminished power to maintain trade , and every increase of this necesssty is regarded as an evidence of growing wealth and power . The whole tendency of modern commercial policy is to the substitution of the distant market for the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may there grow the wool that might be grown at home more cheaply , and we export to California , by hundreds of thousands , men who employ themselves in hunting gold , leaving behind them untouched the real gold mines- those of coal and iron - in which their labor would be thrice more productive . The reports of the late Secretary of the Treasury abound in suggestions as to the value of the distant trade . Steam ships were , he thought , needed to enable us to obtain the control of the commerce of C*iina and Japan . " With our front on both oceans and the gulf , " it was thought , " we might secure this commerce , and with it , in time , command the trade of the world . " England , not to be outdone in this race for " the commerce of the world , " adds steadily to her fleet of ocean steamers , and the government contributes its aid for their maintenance , by the payment of enormous sums withdrawn from the people at home , and diminishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign one . The latest accounts inform us of new arrangements about to be made with a view to competition with this country for the passage traffic to and within the tropics , while the greatest of all trades now left to British ships is represented to be the transport of British men , women , and children , who are so heavily taxed at home for the maintenance of this very system that they are compelled to seek an asylum abroad . In all this there is nothing like freedom of trade , or freedom of man , and the only real difference between the freeman and the slave is , that the former trades for himself , his labor and his products , and in the latter another does it for him . The late Secretary regards himself as a disciple of Adam Smith ; so does Lord John Russell . *Te , too , are his disciples , but in the Wealth of Nations we can find no warrant for the system advocated by either . The system of Dr. Smith tended to the production of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been attended with improvement in the condition of the people , and increase in the power to trade , thus affording proof conclusive of the soundness of the doctrine whereas every step in the direction now known as free trade is attended with deterioration of condition , and increased necessity for trade , with diminished power to trade . Those who profess to be his followers and suppose that they are carrying out his principles , find results directly the reverse of their anticipations ; and the reason for this may readily be found in the fact that the English school of political economists long since repudiated the whole of the system of Dr. Smith , retaining of it little more than the mere words " free * That this is the case we purpose now to show our readers by a few extracts , that will enable them to understand what really was his system , and to compare it with the counterfeit that has been substituted in its place . The basis of all trade is to be found in production , and , therefore , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , as the first pursuit of man , // manufacture and commerce being useful to the extent that they aided production , and no further . " No equal quantity of productive labor or capital employed in manufacture " says he , " can even occasion so great a reproduction as if it were employed in agriculture . In these , nature does nothing , man , does all , and the reproduction must always be proportioned to the strength of the agents that occasion it . The capital employed in agriculture , therefore , not only puts into motion a greater quantity of ' productive labor than any equal capital employed in manufacture ; but , in proportion , too , to the quantity of productive labor which it employs , it adds a much greater value to the annual value of the land and labor of the country , to the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants . Of all the ways which a capital can be employed , it is by far the most advantageous to society . " This is the starting point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which starts the modern English politic economical school , which professes to follow in his footsteps , as we shall have occasion to show , together with the causes of the change . For the present , it is suflicient to say that Mr. M'Culloch deems this passage , which really constitutes the base upon which rests the whole structure of Dr. Smith 's work is regarded by Mr. M'Culloch as " the most objectionable passage " in it , and he expresses great surprise that " so acute and sagacious a reasoner should have maintained a doctrine so manifestly erroneous . " To accomplish the object we have in view , that of exhibiting the system of Dr. Smith , and comparing it with that which has now to so great an extent usurped its place , we shall be compelled to give our readers many extracts from his work ; which is the more necessary that although his name is often used there are very few even of those who profess to be his disciples who even possess his work , and even of these but few who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority of production to trade , and the entire dependence of the latter upon the formeris so well shown in the following passage that we desire to call to it the careful attention of our readers " The great commerce of every civilized society is that carried on between the inhabi* tants of the town and those of the country It consists in the exchange of rude for manufactured produce , either immediately , or by theintervention of money , or of some sort of paper which represents money . The country supplies the town with the means of subsistence and the materials of manufacture . The town repays this supply , by sending hack a part of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country , The town , in which there neither is nor can be any reproduction of substances , may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and subsistence from the country . We must not , however , upon this account , imagine that the gain of the town is the loss of the conntry . The gains of both are mutual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in all other cases , advantageous to all the different persons employed in the various occupations into which it is subdivided . The inhabitants of the country purchase of the town a greater quantity of manufactured goods with the produce of a much smaller quantity of their own labor , than they must have employed had they attempted to prepare them themselves . The town affords a market for the surplus produce of the country , or what is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators ; and it is there that the inhabitants of the country exchange it for something else which is in demand among them . The greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants of the town , the more extensive is the market which it affords to those of the country ; and the more extensive that market , it is always the more advantageous to a great number . The corn which grows within a mile of the town , sells there for the same price with that which conies from twenty miles distance . But the price of the latter must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and bringing it to market , but afford , too , the ordinary profits of agriculture to the farmer . The proprietors and cultivators of the country , therefore , which lies in the neighborhood of the town , over and above the ordinary profits of agriculture , gain in the price of what they sell , the whole value of the carriage of the like produce that is brought from more distant parts ; and they save , besides , the whole value of this carriage in the price of what they buy . Compare the cultivation of the lands in the neighhorhood of any considerable town , with that of those which lie at some distance from it , and you will easily satisfy yourself how much the country is benefited by the commerce of the town . Among all the absurd speculations that have been propagated concerning the balance of trade , it has never been pretended that either the country loses by its commerce with the town , or the town by that with the country which maintains it . // Wkat Constitutes Real Freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal profits , naturally preferred to foreign commerce , for the same reason that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures . As the capital of the landlord or farmer is more secure than that of the manufacturer , so the capital of the manufacturer , being at all times more within his view and command , is more secure than the foreign merchant . In every period , indeed , of every society , the surplus part both of the rude and manufactured produce , or that for which there is no demand at home , must be sent abroad , in order to be exchanged for something for which there is some demand at home . But whether the capital which carries this surplus produce abroad he a foreign or domestic one , is of little unportance . " It is thus , in his estimation , of small importance whether the capital engaged in the work of transportation be foreign or domestic , the operation most essential to the comfort and improvement of man being first the production and next the conversion , of the products of men occupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number or their capital be insufficient for the conversion of all the rude produce of the earth , there is then " considerable advantage " to be derived from the export of the surplus by the aid of foreign capital , thus leaving " the whole stock of the society " to be employed at home " to more useful purpose . " These views are certainly widely different from those of modern economists who see in tables of imports and exports the only criterion of the condition of society . Coinmerce-distant commerce-is now **King** and , yet , according to Dr. Smith , " According to the natural course of things , therefore , the greater part of the capital of every growing society is , first , directed to agriculture , afterwards to manufactures , and , last of all , to foreign commerce . " The natural tendency of the loom to go to the plough is thus exhibited . " An inland country , naturally fertile and easily cultivated , produces a great surplus of provisions beyond what is necessary for maintaining the cultivators ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of river navigation , it may frequently be difficult to send this surplus abroad . Abundance , therefore , renders provisions cheap , and encour ages a great number of workmen to settle in the neighborhood , who find that their industry can there procure them more of the necessaries and conveniences of life than in other places . They work up the materials of manufacture which the land produces , and exchange their finished work , or , what is the same thing , the price of it , for more materials and provisions . They give a new value to the surplus part of the rude produce , by saving the expense of carrying it to the water-side , or to some distant market ; and they furnish the cultivators with something in exchange for it , that is either useful or agreeable to them , upon easier terms than they could have obtained it before . The cultivators get a better price for their surplus produce , and can purchase cheaper other conveniences which they have occasion for . They are thus both encouraged and enabled to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land ; and as the fertility of the land has given birth to the manufacture , so the progress of the manufacture re-acts upon the land , and increases still further its fertility . The manufacturers first supply the neighborhood , and afterwards , as their work improves and refines , more distant markets . For though neither the rude produce , nor even the coarse manufacture , could , without the greatest difficulty , support the expense of a considerable land carriage , the refined and improved manufacture easily may . In a small bulk it frequently contains the price of a great quantity of the raw produce . A piece of fine cloth , for example which weighs only eighty pounds , contains in it the price , not only of eighty pounds of wool , but sometimes of several thousand weight of corn , the maintanance of the different working people , and of their immediate employers . The corn which could with difficulty have been carried abroad in its own shape , is in this manner virtually exported in that of the complete manufacture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . In this manner have grown up naturally , and , as it were , of their own accord , the manufactures of Leeds , Halifax , Sheffield , Birmingham and Wolverhampton . Such manufactures are the offspring of agriculture . " These views are in perfect accordance with the facts . The laborer rejoices when the market of his labor is brought to his door by the erection of a mill or a furnace , or the construction of a road . The farmer rejoices in the opening of a market for labor at his door giving him a market for his food . His land rejoices in the home consumption of the products it yielded , for its owner is thereby enabled to return to it the refuse of its product in the form // of manure . The planter rejoices in the erection of a mill in his neighborhood , giving him a market for his cotton and his food . The parent rejoices when a market for his labor enables his sons and his daughters to supply themselves with food and clothing . Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its products , for trade is then increasing daily and rapidly , and every one mourns the diminution of the home market , for it is one the deficiency of which can not be supplied . Labor and commodities are wasted , and the power of consumption diminishes in the diminution of the power of production , trade becomes languid , labor and land diminish in value , and labor and capital becomes daily poorer . With each step in this course man becomes more and more free as land becomes more valuable and labor becomes more productive , and the number of small properties tends to increase , when not prevented by restrictions resulting from the law of primogeniture . The effect of this upon both the man and the law is thus exhibited : " A small proprietor , however , who knows every part of his little territory , views it with all the affection which property , especially small property , naturally inspires , and who upon that account takes pleasure not only in cultivating , hut in adorning it , is generally of all improvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successful . " August , These views were opposed to those then universally prevalent . " England 's treasure in foreign trade " had become " A fundamental maxim in the political economy , not of England only , but of all other commercial countries . The inland or home trade , the most important of all , the trades in which an equal capital affords the greatest revenue , and creates the greatest employment to the people of the country , was considered as subsidary only to foreign trade . It neither brought money into the country , it was said , nor carried any out of it . The country , therefore , could never become richer or poorer by means of it , except as far as its prosj ) erity or decay might indirectly influence the state of foreign trade . " It was against this error chiefly that Dr. Smith raises his warning voice . He showed that it had led , and was leading , to measures tending to disturb the natural course of things in all the countries connected with England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to maintain trade . " Whatever tends , ** says he , " to diminish in any country the number of artifleers and manufacturers , tends to diminish the home market , themost important of all markets , for the rude produce of the land , and thereby still further to discourage agriculture , " and consequently to diminish the power of producing things with which to trade . The tendency of the then existing English policy was , as he showed , to produce in various countries this effect . The legislature had been , he said , " prevailed upon " to prevent the establishment of manufactures in the colonies " sometimes by high duties , and sometimes by absolute prohibitions . " In Grenada , while a colony of France , every plantati en had its own refinery of sugar , but on its cession to England they were all abandoned and thus was the number of artizans diminished , to " the discouragement of agriculture . " Her course of proceeding , relative to these colonies , is thus described : Regarding manufactures and commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of their great influence on the progress of production , he shows himself almost disposed to apologize for some of the interferences with perfect freedom of trade , by preventing the import of cattle from Ireland , and from other similar measures , because tending to show " the good intention of the legislature to favor agriculture. , * " That however , to which he attributes the greatest influence in this respect is that " the yeomanry of qwq upon their purchasing of her merchants and manufacturers all goods of this kind which they have occasion for . She prohibits the exportation from one province to another by water , and even the carriage by land upon horseback , or in a cart , of hats , of wools , and woolen goods , of the produce of America ; a regulation which effectually prevents the establishment of any manufacture of such commodities for distant sale , and confines the industry of her colonists in this way to such coarse and household manufactures as a private family commonly makes for its own use , or for that of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views , in regard to such measures , are thus given : " To prohibit a great people , however , from making all they can of every part of their own produce , or from employing their stock and industry in a way that they judge most advantageous to themselves , is a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind . " Further to carry out this view of compelling the people of the colonies to abstain from manufacturing for themselves , bounties were paid on the importation into England of various articles of raw produce , while the export of various raw materials , of artizans , and of machinery was prohibited , the whole object of the system being to " raise up a people of customers , a project , " he adds , " fit only for a nation of shopkeepers . " Indeed he thought it even " unfit for a nation of shopkeepers , " altho ' " extremely fit for a nation whose government was influenced by shopkeepers . " For the former reason he was opposed to all such arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obtaining the control of the market of Portugal for the sale of her manufactures , Great Britain agreed to give to the rulers of that country great advantage over those Gf France . The impolicy of the system , as regarded the interests of Britain herself , was shown to be as great as the injustice to her colonists , because tending to drive British capital from the profitable home trade to the comparatively unprofitable foreign one . " The most advantageous employment of any capital to the country to which it belongs , is that which maintains there the greatest quantity of productive labor , and increases the most the annual produce of the land and labor of that country . But the quantity of productive labor which any capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption can maintain , is exactly in proportion , it has been shown in the second book , to the frequency of its returns . A capital of a thousand pounds for example , employed in a foreign trade of consumption , of which the returns are made regularly once in the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it belongs , a quantity of productive labor , equal to what a thousand pounds can maintain there for a year . If the returns are made twice or thrice in the year , it can keep in constant employment a quantity of productive labor , equal to what two or three thousand pounds can maintain there for a year . A foreign trade of consumption carried on with a neighboring , is , upon that account , in general , more advantageous than one carried on with a distant country ; and , for the same reason , a direct foreign trade of consumption , as it has likewise been shown in the second book , is in general more advantageous than a round-about one . " These views , as will be seen , are in direct accordance with those we have submitted , that the value of every trade diminishes with every increase of distance , by which the time and labor required for the performance of exchanges are increased . Dr. Smith saw that the tendency of the whole British system was in this direction-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and manufactures a large amount of capital that could be more profitably employed in the work of producing commodities with which to trade , thus producing an unnatural and improper distribution of the population , and a dependence upon the movements of the rest of the world , that was entirely inconsistent with the happiness and prosperity of the people , or the security of property . His views on these subjects are so clear , and tend to explain so fully the phenomena now passing before our eyes in Great Britain , that we give them in full , persuaded that our readers will thank us for so doing : " The monopoly of the colony trade , too , has forced some part of the capital of Great Britain from all foreign trade of consumption to a carrying trade ; and , consequently from supporting more or less the industry of Great Britain , to be employed altogether in supporting partly that of the colonies , and partly that of some other countries . " The goods , for example , which are annually purchased with the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-exported from Great Britain , are not all consumed in Great Britain . Part of them , linen from Germany and Holland , for example , is returned to the colonies for their par ticular consumption . But that part of the capital of Great Britain which buys the tobacco with which this linen is afterwards bought , is necessarily withdrawn from supporting the industry of Great Britain , to be employed altogether in supporting , partly that of the colonies , and partly that of the particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the produce of their own industry . " Against all the errors of the system , Smith , however , raised his warning voice in vain . " England 's * was to be found " in Foreign Trade , " and every measure adopted by the government had in view the extension of that trade . With each new improvement of machinery there was a new law prohibiting its export . The laws against the export of artizans were enforced , and a further law prohibited the emigration of colliers . England was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people had been warned that her system was not only unnatural , but in the highest degree unjust , and even more impolitic than unjust , because while tending to expel capital and labor from the great and profitable home market , it tended greatly to the " discouragement of agriculture** in the colonies and nations subjected to the system , and to prevent the natural increase of the smaller and less profitable distant market upon which she was becoming more and more dependent . By degrees the tendency of the system became obvious . Bounties on the import of wood , and wool , and flax , and other raw materials , tended to " the discouragement of agriculture " at home , and bounties on the export of manufactures tended to drive into the work of converting and exchanging the products of other lands the labor and capital that would otherwise have been applied to the work of production at home . The necessary consequence of this was , that the difficulty of obtaining these raw materials , instead of diminishing with the progress of population , tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance of a quarter of a century from the date of the publication of " the lVeaith of Nations " that the foundation of the new school was laid by Mr. Malthus , who taught that all distress existing in the world was the inevitable consequence of a great law of nations which provided that food should increase only in arithmetical progression , while population might increase in geometrical progression . Next comes Mr. Ricardo , who furnished the law of the occupation of the earth , showing , and conclusively , as he supposed , that the work of cultivation was always commenced on the rich soils , yielding a large return to labor , and that as population increased , men were compelled to resort to other ones , each in succession less fertile than its predecessor , the consequence of which was that labor became daily less productive , the power to obtain food diminished , and the power to demand rent increased , the poor becoming daily poorer and weaker as the rich became richer and more powerful . Next came Mr. Mills , who showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ricardo , the return to capital and labor applied to the work of cultivation , is " continually decreasing , " and the annual fund from which savings are made , continually diminishing . " The difficulty of making savings is * he adds , " continually augmented , and at last they must totally cease . " He regards it therefore as certain that " wages will be reduced so low that a portion of the population will regularly die from the consequences of want. *** In this manner , step by step , did the political economists pass from the school of Adam Smith in which was taught that agriculture preceded manufacture and commerce , the latter of which were useful to the extent that they aided the former , - to that new one in which was , and is , taught , that manufactures and commerce were the great and profitable pursuits of man , and that agriculture because of the " constantly increasing sterility of the soil , " is the least profitable of all . Hence it is that we find Mr. M'Culloch characterising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system as " the most objectionable passage " in his work , and expressing his surprise that " so acute and sagacious a reasoner should have maintained a doctrine so manifestly erroneous . " It is indeed true , says he " That Nature powerfully assists the labor of man in agriculture . The husbandman pre * Mills ' Elements of Political Economy , p. 40. // pares the ground for the seed , and deposits it there ; hut it is Nature that unfolds the germ , feeds and ripens the growing plant , and brings it to a state of maturity . But does not Nature do as much for us in every department of industry l The power of water and of wind which move our machinery . support our ships , and impel them over the deep  --  the pressure of the atmosphere , and the elasticity of steam , which enables us to work the most powerful engines , are they not the spontaneous gifts of Nature l Machinery is advantageous only because it gives us the means of pressing some of the powers of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal part of what we must otherwise have wholly performed ourselves . In navigation , is it possible to doubt that the powers of Nature - the buoyancy of the water , the impulse of the wind , and the polarity of the magnet , contribute fully as much as the labors of the sailor to waft our ships from one hemisphere to another * In bleaching and fermentation the whole processes are carried on by natural agents . And it is to the effects of heat in softening and melting metals , in preparing our food , and in warming our houses , that we owe many of our most powerful and convenient instruments , and that these northern climates have been made to afford a comfortable habitation . So far , indeed , is it from being true that Nature does much for man in agriculture , and nothing ft r manufacturers , that the fact is more nearly the reverse . There are no limits to the bounty of Nature in manufactures ; but there are limits , and those not very remote , to her bounty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended in the construction of steam engines , or of any other sort of machinery , and after they had been multiplied indefinitely , the last would be as prompt and efficient in producing commodities and saving labor as the first . Such , however , is not the case with the soil . Lands of the first quality are speedily exhausted ; and it is impossible to apply cal ) ital indefinitely even to the best soils , without obtaining from it a constantly diminishing rate of profit . The rent of the landlord is not , as Dr. Smith conceived it to be , the recompense of the work of nature remaining , after all that part of the product is deducted which can be regarded as the recompense of the work of man . But it is , as will he shown , the excess of produce obtained from the best soils in cultivation , over that which is obtained from the worst-in is a consequence not of the increase , but of the diminution of the productive power of the laborer employed in agriculture . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor employed in * Principles of Political Economy , Chap . VI . carrying commodities from where they are produced to where they are consumed , and in dividing them into minute portions , so as to fit the wants of the consumer , are really as productive as if they were employed in agriculture and manufactures . The miner gives utility to matter  --  to coal , for example , - by bringing it from the bowels of the earth to its surface ; but the merchant or carrier who transports the coal from the mine whence it has been dug to the city , or place where it is to be burned , gives it a further and perhaps more considerable value . ' * We have thus two distinct schools , that of Adam Smith and that of his successor . The one taught that labor directly applied to production was most advantageous , and that by bringing the consumer to take his place by the side of the producer , production and the consequent power to trade would be increased . The other teaches , that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended with diminished return , whereas ships and steam-engines may be increased ad infinituni without such diminution , the necessary inference from which is that the more widely the consumer and the producer are separated , with increased necessity for the use of ships and engines , the more advantageously labor will be applied , and the greater will be the power to trade . The two systems start from a different base , and lead in an opposite direction , and , yet , the modern school claims Dr. Smith as founder . While teaching a theory of production totally different , Mr. M'Culloch informs us that " the fundamental principles on which the production of wealth depends " were established by Dr. Smith " beyond the reach of cavil or dispute . " The error in all this results from the general error of Mr. Ricardo 's system which had for its object to account for difficulties resulting from the existence of a commercial policy which looked to obtaining for Great Britain a monopoly of the machinery for converting the raw products of the earth , and was maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the effects which must result from its continuance . Had he not been misled by the idea of " the constantly increasing sterility of the soil , " Mr. M'Culloch could not have failed to see that the only advantage resulting from the use of the steam // engine , or the loom , or any other machine in use for the conversion of the products of the earth was , that it diminished the quantity of labor required to be so applied and increased the quantity that might be given to increasing the amount of products that might be consumed or converted . We see thus , that while Dr. Smith taught that the man and the loom naturally followed the food , consuming on the land the products of the land , and giving value to the land itself , and that every attempt at interference with this great natural law is both unjust and impolitic , Mr. M'Culloch teaches that the wagon and the ship are as productive as the earth , and that while there are limits and those not very remote to the bounty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in manufactures , although if there were any What Constitutes the Real Freedom of Trade ? August , truth in the doctrine of " the increasing sterility of the soil , " the necessity for manufactures would be daily diminishing as the increasing difficulty of obtaining food rendered necessary the application to that primary object a larger portion of human labor , lcaving a smaller one to be applied to the purchase of clothes . In our next we shall continue this subject , believing that we shall be able to satisfy our readers that the modern English school , starting for a point directly opposite of that of Dr. Smith has continued to move in a direction that he would have denounced as unjust and injurious , has brought the nation into the difficulties which he would have predicted from it , and that while using tke word " free trade " its doctrines are directly opposed to those of the apostle of freedom of trade .
