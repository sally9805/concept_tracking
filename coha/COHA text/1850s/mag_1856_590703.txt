THE CRIME OF OFFICE . ALL office holders are , ipso facto , criminals , if not in public opinion , at least for all the intents and purposes of the manufacturers of public opinion  --  the makers of newspapers . The pet criminals of the press , are , however , the gentlemen-superior , and subordinate-who are entrusted by the Federal government with the duty of collecting the National Revenue . We hav&amp;a fancy for looking at the philosophy of the subject a little . It may be a very bold thing in us to do so . Probably it is ; because our philosophy may suit neither the newspaper men nor the office-holders . In point of fact , also , we do not care a button whether it does or does not . One man in his life plays many parts ; and in ours we have played both the parts referred to . We have held office , and made newspapers ; and upon our conscience we think , as a general rule , the first to be the more honest employment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth on his side ; in the second , his soul is hourly endangered by a fatal necessity for lying . In short , if your office-holder , like Touchstone 's ill-roasted egg , is " damned , all on one side ; " your newspaper editor has no side at all for heaven 's mercy to forgive . In respect , however , they are both public , they are both very vile lives ; and for both of them " as they are spare lives* they go against our stomach . " To our philosophy , however . Patrick Henry , in the Virginia Convention of 1788 , said : " To these are to be added oppressive excise-men and customhouse officers . Sir , the people have an hereditary hatred to custom-house officers . " And in another place he says : " On the other hand , there are rich , fat Federal emoluments-your rich , snug , fine , fat Federal offices ;  --  the number of collectors of taxes and excises will outnumber anything from the States . " To fan this " hereditary hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal " knaves of collectors , naval officers , and surveyors , has been the delightful employment of the public press from that day to this . When one party is in power , the other takes up the cudgels . Language fails to express their indignation at the enormities practiced by the " In 's . " Goaded and stung , as by // a swarm of thirsty mosquitoes , the people turn to and turn out the criminals . " The king is dead ! Long live the king ! " The Grand Chamberlain breaks his old rod , and picks up a new one . The " Outs " walk in , and the " Ins " walk out . But scarce is the change effected when the press opens again , like dogs baying the moon , with the same agonised howl of insulted patriotism , and outraged virtue . The poor people stand aghast . They have done all that was told them , and , lo ! they are no better off than before . The howl has only passed from one set of jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Whig throat as a Democratic . The good , honest , innocent souls turned out one set of tenants , and swept and garnished the house , and behold ! the new tenants are nothing but seven other devils , worse than the first . Now this would be very terrible , and heartbreaking , if it were not very farcical . And the worst of it is , that , like the majority of English farces , the jokes are all stale-veritable Joseph Millers , with venerable beards , hanging down to their waists , and hoary with the rime of age . The tirade of one party will stand for the objurgation of the other . The garment of curses fits either wearer indifferently well . Pick up a twenty-year-old file of an opposition newspaper , change nothing but names and dates , and your " slashing " article is ready to your hand . It is , in fact , matter for surprise that some enterprising printer has not had a set of stereotype plates cast , with blanks punched for those , and advertised something after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the best standing material of the trade , namely , articles on official peculation ; dereliction of duty ; enormous salaries ; dangerous perquisites ; illegal fees , etc. , etc . N.B. He would call attention particularly to his articles on Removals : ' they are copyrighted , and embrace the whole subject . The Infamous ' article is conceded to be a miracle of invention . Also , the Poor Inspector and his distressed family , ' which he takes this opportunity of assuring the public has not been used above eleven times since the last change of administration . " Really , those plates would pay . Get behind the scenes , oh ! sympathising public , before you spoil your eyes , crying at the tragedy . You will see the murdered men walk off as livelily , and with as good a stomach for a steak and a pot of beer , as ever . The disconsolate widow shall put off her weeds and " polk " marvellously the rest of the night , and the persecuted orphan go home to a jolly supper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes , if you please , a minute with you . It is a printing office . Be careful how you step , or you will make that sort of " pi " which printers have no relish for . There sits the editor of the paper which has aroused your indignation against Federal officials . That is the identical man who has thundered in your startled ears the tale of enormities practiced by collectors and surveyors . The man with whom secretaries of the treasury are " butchers , " and minor functionaries , boa constrictors . What do you think of him ? An honest-looking fellow enough , is n't he ? He told you last week how they made appointments at the custom-house , and your " hereditary hatred " grew rampant at the vile disclosure . You read how honest , good men were put aside , and party hacks and tools , the refuse and sweepings of every city , ward , or country village , appointed because they had done the dirty work of a political party . Terrible to think of-.was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credulous friend , what would you think if I should tell you that that large bun . dle of virtuous indignation was-an Alderman ? Yerily and truly , an Alderman . You know what an Alderman is now-adays . Read something in the papers , perhaps , about " Indict. ments . " Of course you did . You are posted . You can fancy how he got into the City Council , ca n't you ? If you be a New-Yorker , your imagination will not be much strained to conjure up " Broadway railroad lines ; Joseph Walker wrecks ; " felons bailed ; fighting men maintained ; a little murder , now and then , slubbered up ; and all that sort of generous devotion to the public interest , and the good of society . You will see it all , with your mind 's eye , at a wink . For you are shrewd , very shrewd , and " down on " all kinds of corruption . But you would be a little surprised , I know you would , if I should tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal government as long as any other man , and that the on dit goes he received something in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars in the way of salary , and public printing , and pickings from first to last . You stare . Your faith is a little shaken . You wo n't believe everything you read in the newspaper to-morrow morning , and it will be lucky for you if you do not . You have probably got enough of one of the public virtues . Let us try another . Step over the way into a second newspaper office . Here you shall see a round portly gentleman , who has howled as loud as any . In fact , you have fairly shud // dered at the pictures he has drawn of official corruption , and hardness of heart . You have wondered how any administration could hold up its head after such excoriations , such Maria Monkish disclosures of the revolting secrets of its prison-house . My poor friend , the writers of bad romances are not all dead , neither are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gentleman there , who dips his pen in everything except truth and common sense , was amongst the most eager grabbers of office . And do you know he never said anything about official corruption , or administration crime , until he failed to get a slice of the bag and a piece of the fish ? - Melancholy , but true , my dear indignant friend . You have changed your mind , on this showing , I see ; and are preparing to go away much perplexed . Farewell ! *-Think it over , and when we meet again , tell me what , in your opinion , constitutes the " crime of office . " Hold , a moment . Before you go , let me hint to you what my opinion makes it . It may help you to a solution . The crime of office is not , then , putting out one set of men , or putting in another . Speaking as Democrats , we say , and know , that the public service is safer in the hands of the Democratic party than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the people evinces their steady belief in its truth . It can not however be charged as a crime when the men of other parties are substituted . It is a great mistake , a deplorable mistake , and the people commonly repent their folly concurrently with its consummation . As they pay the piper , however , they have an undoubted right to choose the tune he shall play , and dance to it as long as suits them . Nor is it the manner of men who are appointed . It is the inequality of remuneration . An administration appoints its high officers ; and in their turn they place the crowd of subordinates . That these are not always chosen from the most virtuous and worthy of the community is too true . But the fault is not in the superiors ; it is in the system which makes them first , and controls them afterwards . Appointed for political services merely , they are compelled to carry out the system , and appoint in their turn for the same cause . Their electrnn is narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " workers " of a party , and the laborer is claimed to be worthy of his hire . They are not permitted to ask , " is this the best man for the place ? " - but , is the place the best that can be found for the man ? Thus , blind agents of a superior ne // cessity , beyond the view of the public generally , they become responsible for the character and conduct of a thousand men , of whose character and conduct they never knew anything , and never could know anything , but that they were sharp party practitioners , and must have their fee-in office . They are at the mercy of innumerable dependents , whom they feed , but can not control beyond a certain limit , and that limit a very narrow one . One or many of these men prove incapable , or dishonest , or vicious in any way  --  and the gentleman who appointed is instantly arraigned at the bar of public opinion , the grand jury of the press haul him up before them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him-for another man 's crime or folly . " There 's wisdom for you , " as Captain Cuttle says . Having some inkling of this , it is commonly charged by the opposition press that the heads of departments are converted into mere political machines for placing and displacing men in office . And beyond that-having , according to the fatal law of their own official existence , culled out all the " workers " of the party they hold of  --  the " ward wire-pullers , " and " convention makers , " and " resolution backers , " iind " ticket peddlers , " and public meeting packers and clacquettrs -- t hey are expected to keep them " working ; " to keep them in public meetings , and resolutions , and ward committees , and all the rest of the machinery of agitation and political " high life below stairs . " Of course , such business would be quite enough to occupy their time if they did it , and the " duties " of their respective offices as by law established , which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confided to the hands of deputies . These " subordinates " in that event must of course too , have all the brains and tact , and knowledge of the law , and business talent , which would fit them for the highest offices in the republic ? It is charged often by the opposition press that such is the fact . Do you believe it ? Would it be a natural thing to happen in this country ? Did you ever hear of a man really great , and fitted for high employment , who was at the same time a reliable Democrat , whom the people , God bless them , ever left long in a subordinate station ? Did you ever hear of one **ho could make popular Democratic music , who ever played second fiddle long to any other man ; unless he happened to be a drunkard , or a vicious fellow determined to spoil his own chances ? We never met with such an one ; and , depend upon it , that kind of talk is all bosh . You ca n't keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the power of rising . The people always take care of him , if he is true to them . // Suppose , for the sake of argument , all this twaddle of opposition , about the crime of office , were true ? How can you account for this fact , and it is a fact , that , with men appointed to office for every other reason under heaven than because their previous habits had fitted them for the particular place they fill , the public service of the United States is better carried on , and its enormous revenue more cheaply andT logically therefore , more honestly collected , under Democratic auspices , than that of any other known government ? Is not that a poser ? Will railing accusations rub that out ? And this , too , in the face of the fact that the subordinates are the most ill-paid body of public officers in the world . Their salaries are inadequate . Fixed many years ago , every article of consumption , the whole price of life , has advanced , whilst their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as under all Pemocratic administrations , " the chances " have been narrowed down to nothing . The man who makes a penny beyond his legal pay does himself great injustice by keeping his place ; he is certainly clever enough for much better things . He is fit for a Wall-street financier . Mr. Secretary Guthrie may not be the greatest Secretary of the Treasury that ever lived ; but he is certainly one of the most careful custodians of the people 's money . In fact , too , we should like to know how any Secretary of the Treasury can prove his fitness for the post , and fitness for a thing is greatness in that thing , except by the impartial exactitude and conscienti , ous honesty with which he carries out the routine prescribed by law . He makes no law . He originates no system . Alexander Hamilton originated the system . After him , the whole matter is merely executive . But to give you . my idea of the fault of the system which sometimes leaves an opening for the attacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their fault.finding , you shall have it in the words of Edmund Burke . The system of government in British India , so sternly reprobated by him , has a good many points of analogy " Another circumstance in that service , says Burke , " is deserving of notice . Except in the highest parts of all , the emoluments of office do not in any degree correspond with the trust , nor the style with the dignity . Under the petty appellations of the counting-house , you have administrators of revenues truly royal . The legal public emoluments that belong to them are very often totally inadequate . * * It is true that the greatest situations are often attended with // but little emolument ; yet still they are filled . Why ? Because reputation , glory , fame , the honest applauses of a grateful country , sometimes pay the cares , anxieties , and toils , which wait on great situations in the commonwealth . But glory is not the lot of subordinated merit . These must be paid in money what can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinate parts are officers who , in comparison with the offices and duties entrusted with them , are miserably provided for ; whereas the chief of each great presidency has emoluments securing him against every mode of temptation . * * Instead of endeavoring to find a series of gradual , progressive , honorable , and adequate rewards for the persons who serve the public in subordinate but powerful situations , he has left them to prey upon the people . I do not say that some of the salaries given would not sound well here ; but when you consider well the nature of the trusts , the dignity of the situation , whatever the name of them may be , the powers that are granted : I repeat , it is a source of infinite grievance-of infinite abuse ? ' So reasons Edmund Burke . Which may be reduced to this , that in every government where you put power and opportunity in men 's hands , and nuderpay them-if you expect them to be honest , you mistake human nature . The great crime of office in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is putting men in the way of temptation , and underpaying them . It has been said in CongressWhy , you can get as many men as you can shake a stick at , to do the public work at a dollar a day , instead of three or four which is now paid . Certainly you can . But that will help you little . The only difference would be that , supposing men to continue men , and beef to be 18* cents a pound , your one dollar men would be under the disagreeable necessity of stealing the difference from the public crib , being a clear additional loss to the public of two dollars ! " Steal ? A fico for the phrase . Convey  --  the wise it call . " We are not denying the possibility of human honesty . Happily for society , there are some honest men left . But a fine moral sense , and a lofty principle of self-respect and scrupulous honor , is not a common gift to mortals . The majority of men , it is also true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunt and prevent them ; but they will whip the devil very close to the stump . It is said , a Whig President appointed a friend to some subordinate office . The friend was indignant at being put off with such a pittance , and exclaimed : " Why , sir , the salary is only fifteen hundred dollars a-year ! * " Bah ! " replied // his Excellency ; " that 's the salary , John . I give you the place-that is worth more than mine ! " It is also related by many persons of veracity , that it is the common habit of heads of department , on the advent of a Whig administration , to say to their subordinates : " You have fomr years before you ; make the most you can out of them for the party , and yourselves . " Under Democratic auspices , however , and we speak by the card , the whole effort of its superior executive officers is directed to saving the people 's money , and narrowing the office-holders ' chances to as near nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the public service with a scrupulous exactness , and painful fidelity . And here the real " crime of office " is developed ; since the most oppressive weight of retrenchment and reform , always the inevitable work of the Democratic party upon coming into power , after an interregnum of Opposition license and peculation , falls upon subordinates . For superior officers the law provides emoluments . For inferiors it provides none . The idea of the framers of the law , regulating particularly the iRevenue service of the United States , appears to have been a very honest Federal aristocratic notion , that your great officers are a kind of Sevres porcelain , and will bear high glazing and fine painting ; whilst your common fellow must be kept as poor a piece of pottery as possible . It is scarcely a Democratic notion that one human vessel is to be fashioned by legislative legerdemain to honor , and another to dishonor . The logic which assumes that the head of a Department must be kept rich to keep him honest , and the tail poor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special pleading , as complete a " reductio ad absurdum , " as we have ever had the pleasure of stumbling over . The sauce for the goose is clearly no sauce for the gander in that system of dialectics . Our laws go further indeed , and whilst they provide emoluments for the heads of departments , they provide penalties for all below the head , who even coquet with so much " reward , " " emolument , " " guerdon , " or " remuneration , " as Costard 's " elevenpence ha'penny . " In the language of Burke , which is quite as applicable to this as to the folly of the East India Company : " The gentlemen at the head of the service have high legal emoluments . The orders of the government forbid inferiors to take any extraneous emoluments . The act of Parliament has fulminated against them . Clear , positive laws have no exception of circumstance in them , no difference quoad majus et minus . The // consequence is , that he who has taken but one penny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior or subordinate has no legal emoluments by our system , any more than he had under the British East India system , " he who takes but one penny " has taken an unlawful ernolument , and the law has no mercy for him ; official duty no pity ; his superiors no liberty to excuse . The penalty attaches as directly and in as exemplary a manner to the " one penny " as to a million . Does such a system square with common justice or common sense ? Is self-conceit weaker in the breast of the inferior than in the breast of the superior ? On the contrary , do we not know that men think after this fashion : Fortune has given you , A. B. , a big throw in the raffle , and you have a prize . But it 's mere luck . Why might not I , B. C. , have thrown the same ? Had I done so , you would have had my place , and I yours . " That is human nature . And if men think thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrower of sixes , ** and pains and penalties for the unlucky caster of " deuce ace , " with the political dice ; whose honesty , does it strike you , intelligent legislators of an intelligent people , is best provided for-whose honesty most certainly secured ; the man whose honesty is secured by " legal emoluments , " or the man whose dishonesty is punished by legal penalties ? Per Baccho ! We think penalties make rogues . All legal experience proves the fact . Hang a man for stealing " five pounds , " and a thousand pounds are stolen , where twenty are , if you make the penalty a six months ' imprisonment in the county jail . That fact has long been in evidence ; and undisputed . Yet , you will reply , men rush in as eagerly for inferior as for superior places . Certainly they do ; because like the Draconian penalty for a " five pound " larceny , under the old English system , the severity of the law 's vindication defeats the law ; and where one man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found not guilty by tender-hearted juries . The whole argument may indeed be condensed in this  --  to secure men s honesty , as a general rule , you must pay them in a fair ratio to the trust reposed in them , and not in the ratio of their work . If one man has the power to cheat you out of a million , and another the power to cheat you only of a thousand , the bonuses on their honesty must be relatively as the sums committed to their mercy . Some men will be honest , and starve in the midst of untold gold . But these noble specimen // of human virtue , whilst they elevate our opinion of humanity , and command our admiration , should never blind us to the fact that they are the shining exceptions to a gloomy rule . In opposition to the " Opposition , " we conclude , therefore , that the crime of office is not that one man holds to the exclusion of a better ; nor that dishonest men are selected ; nor that undue favoritism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any of the specifications and charges commonly exhibited ; but that the system and its theory is at war with fact ; that men hold office by a tenure which paralyzes their capacity for good , and developes abuse against the will and beyond the power of the best to prevent ; and that custom , the custom of every party , has established as a law the much-abused but inevitably-followed rule , that " to the victor belong the spoils ; " not that favoritism is displayed ; but that no legal opportunity is provided for its display in behalf of public virtue and public services in subordinate stations . These constitute the true crime of office . Democratic administrations of the Federal Government , from the highest position to the lowest , in all its ramifications and bearings , in spite of these vices of system , first originated by " Federalism , " and carefully imitated by all its anti-Democratic progeny , have been distinguished for their general fidelity . This has been so marked and palpable that the people , by a natural instinct , fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for relief . Four years of administration by any other party usually place the finances of the country in such a position , and introduce such a crowd of abuses into every office , that the chief occupation of the succeeding . Democratic administration is , inevitably , to restore them to the position in which its predecessor found them , and reThtroduce order , regularity , and honesty . This usually occupies the whole attention of one Democratic administration , and it is only during a second , immediately succeeding , that the people begin to see unmistakably how much has been done for them . It has been the fate of the present administration to carry out this work of restoration , this reinauguration of Democratic fidelity and economy in official life , and hence the vioYence with which it has been assailed . Abuse has found no shelter ; dereliction from duty no excuse ; and both have been as indignant and aggressive as they were before numerous and secure . A very little examination of the attacks levelled against it and the least inquiry into the personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this , which in the people 's eyes has been the virtue , has in theirs been its @rime of Office . We put this before the people not as the special advocate of this , but as the general advocate of all Democratic administrations ; and we point them to the nominee of the Cincinnati Convention of next June , be he who he may , as the only safe rallying point for all honest lovers of their country , its consti ution , and good government . @
