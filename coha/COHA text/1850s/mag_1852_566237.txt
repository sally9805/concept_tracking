txt ART . IV. - TIIE PRESENT MENTAL ATTITUDE AND TENDENCIES OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION . THE present article is the Inaugural Address of Dr. Worthington Hooker , as Professor of the *rlieory and Practice of Medicine , in the Medical School of Yale College . We have a deep interest in Medical Science , and we think that the feelings and dispositions of too many educated men are not just towards the Medical profession . The present Address takes up one of the most important subjects connected with the progress of medicine , namely , the true application of the Inductive Method to the facts of medical inquiry  --  the ignorance or disregard of which has , we are persuaded , occasioned most of the mistaken views which prevail in the community . We take great pleasure , therefore in publishing it , and the more so , as Dr. Hooker has been and will continue to be one of the writers of our Journal . We may add , that the address will be published also in a pamphlet form , for more extensive circulation . Called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-three years in its pursuit , it will be my aim to present to you , in the course of lectures which I am to give , the experience that I have gathered during that period of time . And by experience I do not mean simply the results of my own personal observation*alone , but coupled with these , nay , incorporated with them , are the results of the observation of others , collected from books and from intercourse with professional brethren . However much some may decry the past , and laud that experience which is strictly personal , as if such a thing were a possible attainment , it is true of every intelligent physician , *that he accumulates in himself , in a great measure , the past experience of theprofession . In doing this he makes it ac // 549 tually his own experience , by comparing it with his own observations ; thus verifying it , or modifying it , as the case may require . An exclusively personal experience , as I have just hinted , is not possible . No man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless he shut himself out from his fellow men . Vast is the amount of knowledge which every man unconsciously acquires from others ; and small comparatively is that , which is acquired without aid from predecessors and compeers , by even the most adventurous and original thinker . The grand difference between men , in their power to serve the science or art which they cultivate , lies in the amount of the world 's experience , wl ) ich , by the testing pro* cesses of observation , they have made their own . And it is the glory of the wise and skillful observer , who blesses his race with the fruits of a large and correct experience , that he has destroyed the mournful import of the old adage , ars longa , vita brevis , by compressing into his short life the experience of the past , and making the labors of the multitudes of his predecessors tributary to the results which he develops . The truth of this remark would be more fully realized , if we could always trace the exact connexion between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to light by the observation of man . But the suggestive influence , which one discovery has in the production of another , is seldom obvious , even in the case of those which are important and brilliant . Much less does it appear in the numerous minor discoveries , which collectively minister so much to the progress of science , and to the comfort and happiness of man . An idea which may seem to be independent , and the birth of the moment , may be the upshot of a train of ideas , reaching back through a long succession of minds , and even through many ages . Or it may be the result of the concentrated force of knowledge accumulated in one mind from multitudes of minds in the past and the present . The mutual dependence of man in regard to knowledge is then multifarious and abundant ; and the votary of every science or art bears an interesting relation to all who havebeen or are now engaged in its cultivation , or in the cultivation of anything which has even a remote connexion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , though he may be little conscious of it . And , on the other hand , he may be cheered with the idea , that whatever he may add to the knowledge already gained , however small it may be , will make its impress upon multitudes of other minds in all time , though he may be utterly unknown to fame . To him , therefore , who // would use all the appliances within his reach in the cultivation of his science or art , its actual present condition , or , in other words , the actual sum of its knowledge or experience , garnered up by its votaries , and winnowed from the chaff of error , is a matter of much moment , and furnishes to him a subject of earnest enquiry . To the medical man such an enquiry in regard to his science and art is one of peculiar interest . And it is to this subject that I wish to direct your attention , deeming it to be especially appropriate to the commencement of a first course on practical medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in this capacity , it is a matter both of deep interest and of great practical importance , to obtain a definite idea of the position of advancement to which practical medicine has arrived . Some lessons can be learned from such an enquiry , which will be of essential advantage both to teacher and pupil , in prosecuting our investigations in the course before us . But it is not my intention at this time to cover the whole ground indicated , but only a portion of it . The advance of our profession is commonly estimated by the amount of knowledge or discovered fact which is in its possession . To make such an estimate in the short hour allotted me would be impossible . It can be done more appropriately and thoroughly as I proceed in my course of lectures . For this purpose , I shall note quite particularly , from time to time , the actual advances which have been made in medical science , and bring out as far as possible its certainties from the uncertainties with which they are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite as important . It is the mental attitude of the general professional mind , as shown in the prevalent habits of thinking and observation . It is this particular view of our subject to which we will devote our thoughts for the hour which we are to occupy . A full description of all its points can not be expected in a single lecture , and I can only throw out some hints on the most imp ortant of them . The qualifications of the physician for the practice of his art are two kinds : First , his knowledge , or his acquisition of the facts and truths of medicine ; and , secondly , the mental habits which he has formed , and which he brings to the use of these facts and truths . These two classes of qualifications have this relation-the first comprises the means , the instruments which the physician has in his possession ; the second , his power nad skill in using these instruments . // The latter , which I deem to be by far the more important class of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated by medical men . Much account is made of the acquisition on the part of the student of the materiel of his art . For this purpose his mind is crowded with knowledge by an abundance of lectures , and great pains are taken to make the curriculum embrace as nearly as possible the whole range of subjects properly belonging to it . On the other hand , comparatively little pains are taken to impart to the mind of the student correct habits of thinking and observing . But the lecturer obviously neglects the most important part of his mission , if he fail to train his hearers in the application of the true principles of observation to disease and to the influence of remedies . The mechanic would not commit a greater error , who should exhibit to his apprentice the materials upon which he is to work , arid the various instruments which he is to use , and yet not teach him how to work the materials and use the instruments . And farther , however much of knowledge the lecturer may communicate , if he train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teachings are worse than useless . In such a case , when the student becomes the physician , and passes from the lecture-room to the chamber of sickness , he is at once entangled in errors , to which unfortunately he is rendered blind by the very process of his education . His personal experience as a practitioner may deliver him from them slowly , one after another . But to deliver him from them fully , it is necessary to revolutionize all his habits of observation . This is seldom done . The physician is , ordinarily , such as his teacher makes him to be . In the remarks just made I have alluded to what I consider the grand defect in the training of medical men . No art re* quires for its successful practice such carefulness in the application of the principles of evidence , as the art of medicine . And yet looseness in the application of these principles is , and ever has been , the great friult both of physicians and of the makers of physicians . It may be remarked , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medicine , that it does not so much affect the few of independent mind , who stand out by their genius and talents prominently before the world , as it does the great body of the profession . Consequently it does not so much affect the progress of medicine in relation to those great discoveries , which it is the privilege of gifted minds now and then to make , as it does in relation to the numberless little things , which , though scarcely noted , in the aggregate are quite as valuable as // the few great ones which have drawn forth the wonder and the applause of the world . This leads me to observe , as showing the importance of right training in science , that more good has often been done by those who have exerted their chief influence in such training , than by those who have been honored by the world as the discoverers of great facts . Who , I ask , did the greater work for science , Newton the discoverer , or Bacon the teacher , the maker *f discoverers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Bacon revolutionized all science , by showing how it should be investigated ; and he has ever been and ever will be putting multitudes of minds on the right track in search of truth . Bacon stands forth the universal teacher of mankind ; but Newton is but one among the many that exemplify the results which come from following his teachings . Newton has hung up here and there bright lights in some of the pathways of science ; but Bacon has put a light into each mind in the throngs of votaries of all science , directing in the discovery of truth and the acquisition of knowledge . And as Bacon preceded Newton , it may be that , either directly through his teaching , or indirectly through the influence which his teachings produced upon the intellect of the world , Bacon put the light within Newton 's mind which led to his discoveries . It is an interesting fact to note in this connexion , that the principle of gravitation discovered by Newton was palpably hinted at by Bacon . But Newton did not exert an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps true , that he did quite as much for science , by his exemplification of the true mode of observation and reasoning , inculcated by Bacon , as he did by his discovaries . While the ardor of youth was yet upon him , he made his great disco very of the compound nature of light , and yet he was betrayed into no wild speculations . In the modest letter containing the announcement of the discovery he utters that noble sentence , " I shall not mingle conjectures with certain ties . " In carrying out the great principle expressed in that sentence , he gave an impulse to the spirit of observation , in opposition to that of blind theorizing , which has been perhaps of as great value to science as are the treasures which he poured into her storehouse . It would be interesting and profitable to follow out somewhat particularly this train of thought in relation to the influence of great minds in medical science . But my limits will not permit jt . I will however remark , that those who have exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hailer , Hunter , // Bich at , and Louis , have done so , not by any grand discoveries , but by their example as observers . By exemplit*ing the dignity and effectiveness of minute , persevering , multiplied , every day observation , they have awakened the true spirit of discovery and improvement in multitudes of minds . Brilliant as is the fame of Harvey , and wide and marked as was the influence of his discovery upon the advance of our science , a vastly greater work was done for it by Haller the father of modern physiology , in the development of the phenomena of life , and by Hunter , the father of modern surgery , in the development of the phenomena of disease . And perhaps , as I have said of Newton , it may also be said of Harvey , that he did as much for science by his example , in the mode of his observation , as he did by the grand result which that observation accomplished. * What I have said of the individual physician , may be said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kinds of qualification for its duties-its knowledge , its material ; and its powers or capabilities in the use of this knowledge . It has a general mental character . It has prevalent habits in the observation of disease . It has in each age , certain mental tendencies characterizing it , which it is profitable to study . Let us study for a little time the tendencies of the general medical mind in this age of ours  --  the present mental attitude or condition of our profession-noting both its excellencies and its defects . Its condition may , without hesitation , be pronounced to be better , much better , on the whole , than it ever has been before , notwithstanding the croaking of IJoma*opathic and other radicals , who decry our profession , as wedded to ancient errors with an incurable obstinacy . Let us notice first , some of the better tendencies which it presents , and then some of the counter-tendencies which are impeding the progress of practical medicine . The medical profession has never been so free from the theorizing spirit , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been so prevalent among medical men , has ever been one of the greatest hindrances to the progress of medical science . It has diverted the energies of the profession from the work which is the only means of progress in any science  --  the work of observation . The framing of ingenious hypotheses , instead of the discovery of facts , has been very generally considered the highest labor * After writing this lecture I found a similar sentiment quoted from La Place , in Dr. Holland 's " Chapters on Mental Physiology . " The passage is this : " La Connaissance de la Methode qui a guide l'homme de g6nie , nest pas moms utile au progr6s de la science , et m*me * sa propre gloire , que ses decouvertes. " // of genius , and has been the means of acquiring its noblest honors . Every age has , for the most part , had its prominent theory or theories , which have not only conferred on their authors a world-wide fame , but have given an impress to the mental character and habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this subject , in order to prevent all misconception , it will be proper for me to state what I mean by theory . The word has unfortunately been used in several different senses . it is sometimes used to distinguish principles from their practical and individual application , or , in other words , the science from the art , as in the expression , theory and practice of medicine . It is also used as meaning the philosophical explanation of phenomena , as Lavoisier 's theory of combustion , or Harvey 's theory of the circulation . The term is applied in this case without regard to the truth or falsity of the explanation . But the most common meaning is nearly synonymous with hypothesis . Pure theory , or mere theory , as it is commonly expressed , differs from hypothesis only as covering more ground . Hypothesis is ordinarily limited to one point , or a few kindred points . It is generally a simple supposition , while a theory is an arranged system or collection of suppositions designed to account for a large range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , altogether composed of suppositions . Almost every theory will be found to be a mixture of mere suppositions with discovered general facts or principles . The only difference between theories is in the proportions of these two classes of ingredients . Some theories have quite a large admixture of truth , while others are exceedingly fanciful . A theory commonly has some central idea of a hypothetical character . This is made to appear as consistent as possible with principles already established , and some subordinate suppositions are added . The whole is woven into a system , and styled by the author as his theory , or , perhaps , his doctrine , or system of doctrines or principles-for these terms are very commonly used by the framers of theories as being synonymous . But let us not be deceived by such looseness of language . Let the distinction between a system of principles and a theory be most definitely preserved . The term principle should be applied to an established general fact , and to nothing else . A system of principles is a collection of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such facts mingled with supposition . The one is like a beautifully arranged collection of gems , while the other is an orderly arrangement of gems and worthless pastes. // it is a very common error to suppose that theory is necessa-* ry to arrangement in science . The theorizer calls the rigid observer a mere fact-hunter , and supposes that to him all science is a medley . But general facts or principles , discovered by the observation of individual facts , are capable of being arranged without the aid of suppositions . It is true that sometimes , on attempting such an arrangement , some gaps are found , which need to be filled up by farther investigations . But it is better to await the results of such investigations , than to plaster up the gaps in the structure with mere suppositions . A system cemented together by suppositions , as all experience shows , is easily demolished . Though it be composed in part of substantial material , so much of it is unsubstantial , that the winds of controversy soon overthrow it , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the claymingled with the iron in the feet of Nebuchadnezzar 's image that insured its speedy downfall , in spite of the iron . So the untempered mortar of hypothesis , with which theories are cemented together , insures their downfall , in spite of the solid truth with which it is combined . it is obvious , that what are ordinarily termed theories receive their name only in virtue of whatever of hypothesis there may be in them . The truths , or established principles which they contain , if sifted out from the chaff , merit a better appellation . And this leads me to say , that the great injury which the theorizing spirit does to science , results from this confounding of truth with supposition , of which I have spoken . It is manifestly essential to the advance of science , that the known and the supposed should be carefully kept separated from each other . When this is done , there is no harm , but often great advantage , . in entertaining suppositions or hypotheses . But to place them on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more to weave them together , so that it is difficult to distinguish them , is both degrading and injurious to science . Whenever , then , the scientific man indulges in hypothesis , let it be limited to its legitimate uses , which are only suggestive* Let not mere suppositions be dignified by an admission to the companionship of established truths , under the specious name* of theory . Let science be disabused of this evil . Let the separation for which I plead be scrupulously maintained . Let the example of Newton , in this respect , be imitated . lie did ' " not mingle conjectures with certainties , " splendid as some of his conjectures were . He had an hypothesis in regard to gravitation , but he did not mingle it with the " certainties " which he had discovered in relation to it . If he had been a theorizer // instead of an observer , he would have mingled his supposition of an etherial medium as the means of communicating the action termed gravitation , with the principle itself and its laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our profession , in relation to theories , is very gratifying at the present time . The dominion of the theorizing spirit , which has so much retarded our science heretofore , has , during the last half century , been passing away , and the spirit of a strict philosophical observation has been gaining more and more control over the medical mind . The mental habits of the profession in the observation of disease , are continually improving . Actual knowledge is now more rapidly accumulated than at any previous time , because the activities of the profession are not employed to anything like the extent that they have been , in ingenious but profitless theorizing . For the first time in the history of medicine , the medical world is destitute of a dominant theory . It is a glorious era in our science . And there is warrant for the belief that the age of theories has passed away in medicine . There are , and there may be hereafter , theories broached in regard to some circumscribed portions of our science ; but I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail in the profession . Hoffman , and Stahl , and Cullen , and Brown , and Broussais , belong to a class which is now extinct . The last of this brilliant succession was Broussais . This truly great man commenced his career in the patient work of observation ; and well ( lid he serve the cause of medical science in this work . But after a while he began to speculate . lie became absorbed with one idea as the key to a large range of phenomena in disease . He gave utterance to his new opinions ; and , as believei 's gathered around him , he became fascinated with the glory of being the founder of a sect , and he was transformed from the careful observer into the adventurous and ambitious theorizer . His sect became rapidly a large one , and his triumph was truly wonderful . But dazzling as was his success , his career soon ended . The spirit of rigid observation , which he himself had so effectually helped to cherish , had gained too fast hold upon the profession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of time . Long before his death his theory was almost universally discarded . And it is worthy of note , that Broussais was the first founder of a sect who lived to see his sect dissolved . If he had lived in an earlier age , when theories were in vogue in medicine , his theory would undoubtedly have outlived him , and his last days would have been crowned with honor , instead of being disturbed , as // they were , with disappointment , and bitter but unavailing con* troversy . When he ceased to be the humble observer , and became the aspiring theorizer , he retrograded into a condition suited to a darker age than this . Let others take warning from his error . As there are now*no prevalent theories in medicine , so there are no sects in the profession . The Ilumoralists , the Solidists , the Vitalists , the Methodics , the Dogmatists , &amp;c. , are all passed away , never to rise again . The medical profession is now wholly unsectarian ; and all the sects in medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , are outside of the profession , and are warring against it . Honkeopathists very summarily include the whole body of our profession in one great sect , and call us Allopaths . But we are no sect . We have no medical creed . There is no restriction upon opin ion among us . Education and character furnish the only basis of admission to the ranks of the profession . While the theorizing disposition is fast declining in our profession , it prevails to a great extent in the community at large on the subject of medicine . There are multitudes of dabblers in medicine , both learned and unlearned , who love to theorize , and to listen to theorizing . No matter how exclusive or fanci* ful the theory may be , it obtains credence with them , and they are blown about by every wind of doctrine in medicine . The general disposition of our profession to discard theories , is of course unsatisfactory to those among us who are governed by the theorizing spirit . Some of this class have left our ranks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines of Hahnemann full range for their mental wanderings . A large majority of those who have given up rational medicine for the vagaries of the German quack . have undoubtedly done so for mere pecuniary reasons ; but there are some who have honestly become Homo*opathists , from a peculiar cast of mind , disposing them to fanciful speculation , instead of rigid ob*erva* tion . If we consider the complex nature of the subjects to which the attention of the physician is directed , and the difficulties which consequently embarrass him in their investigation , I think it can justly be claimed , that medicine has made as great advances as any other science , in the work of disencumbering itself of the errors , which the theorizing spirit of past ages had accumulated . The physician is called to observe the affections , not of matter alone , as is the chemist , nor of spirit alone , as the metaphysician and the moral philosopher , but of matter and spirit held in mysterious connexion , and that , too , in a congeries von . x. 71 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . And it is also to be considered , that it is not simply the natural , healthy affections of this structure of mingled matter and spirit , that he is to study , but these affections , disordered , diseased , by the thousand agents a round it , and then acted upon also by agents intended to restore it to its natural state . Numerous and urgent are the temptations to theorize which such a complicated variety of phenomena presents . Medicine , therefore , has labored at a great disadvantage , in comparison with the other sciences , in the struggle to cast off the spirit of speculation and the errors which that spirit has accumulated from age to age . When Bacon revolutionized the mind of the scientific world , and the struggle to which I have referred began in all the domains of knowledge , the process of change was slower in medicine than in the less complicated sciences , because its certainties could not be as easily developed , and disentangled from the difficulties with which they are surrounded . And this continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as the struggle has gone on , and theories in the medical world have succeeded each other with their meteor-like brilliancy , humble observation has all the time been busily at work , making its almost unobserved conquests , and gathering slowly but surely the means of its final victory . And at this present time , medicine , with all the difficulties which embarrass its progress , is hastening , quite as rapidly as the other sciences , to the glotious consummation of the utter dethronement of theory , and the undisputed sway of a rational observation* It is an opinion which of late has been often expressed by clergymen , and other thinking men in the community , that medical science embraces but a limited amount of certainties , that it is preeminently under the dominion of hypothesis , and that therefore a good practitioner is only a good guesser . I have even heard it asserted by one of the most prominent theologians in our country , that practical medicine can show so little that is absolutely settled , that it is not entitled to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect . Though we have no authority in medicine , and can not appeal to " the law and the testimony , " yet we claim , that with all the certainties furnished to theologians from the word of God , theology as a science is , in this nineteenth century , in a worse condition than medicine , and because the great body of its votaries are more thoroughly under the control of the theorizing spirit , than are the mass of the medical profess*on . The change which has been going on so rapidly in medicine // during the last half century , is far from being confined to a few leading minds , but it is rapidly pervading the whole body of the profession . Multitudes of minds are now on the right track in the investigation of disease . A general movement in this respect is manifest . Minute records of large numbers of cases of disease in every form are now made , giving us results which could not be obtained in the more general , indefinite and sparse records which were formerly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave cases , of the disease under investigation , so that a full and correct representation of the disease and of the influence of remedies upon it is secured . The great advantages of such a mode of observation in medicine are so obvious , that I need not dwell upon them . Much credit is due to Louis for the introduction of this minute observation in medicine . He has been a very prominent agent , perhaps we may say the chief one , in effecting this great reform in practical medicine . He has however some glaring defects . He applies his minute observation to the effects of remedies by no means as rigorously and wisely , as he does to the history and diagnosis of diseases . And as a reformer he has certainly some share of ultraism . He is too exclusively fond of one mode of observation . Without entering into a discussion of this subject , which my limits will not permit , 1 remark , that it must be acknowledged , that Louis goes altogether too far , in applying his numerical method to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he ( loes to the phenomena of disease . In prosecuting this minute observation , the attention of the profession has been particularly directed to a discrimination between the natural efforts and tendencies , and the necessary movements of disease , on the one hand , and the effects of remedies on the other . I need not stop to remark on the importance of such a discrimination . The investigations made in this direction are relieving practical medicine of many errors ; and positive medication , while it is every day becoming more limited in its application , is also at the same time becoming more definite and discriminating in its aims . Great is the improvement which , in this respect , the profession is introducing into the treatment especially of what are termed self-limited diseasesthat is , those which can not be materially shortened by art , but must for the most part run their course . The present treatment of scarlatina , compared with what it once was , furnishes a good illustration of my remarks . The profession , and especially the public , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone to forget that , besides the // results which come from the natural limits set to many diseases , nature is constantly endeavoring to limit and to remove all disease by its restorative processes ; and that this effort of nature is in almost all cases the chief agent of cure . The public are especially apt to forget this fact ; and they are continually talking of the cures effected by the medicine of the physician or the quack , as if the medicine were really the chief , or even the only agent , in producing the result . This error is a deeply rooted one in the community . It meets us at every turn . It appears , not merely in the familiar conversation , but sometimes in the published reasonings , not of mere scribblers , but of even eminently scientific men . As an example of this , I will refer to a passage in President Hopkins ' admirable work on the Evidences of Christianity . In speaking of the experimental evidence , he remarks , " The analogy is often drawn in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between Christianity , as a remedy for the moral maladies of man , and remedies for bodily disease . It is plain that he who takes a remedy for bodily disease , may have an evidence and conviction of its efficacy entirely independent of any testimony or reasoning , and more convincing than either or both of these could give . He may try the remedy in such a variety of forms , may so watch the symptoms as he takes or omits it , that he can have no more doubt of its effect than he has of the rising and setting of the sun . i2iere is something which comes within the province of consciousness and of direct knowledge , and it is in vain that you attempt to destroy a conviction thus produced . You may tell him that he is not sick , and never was ; that the dose was the hundred-thousandth part of a drop , and therefore could not have done him any good ; but he may have had experience of such a kind that it would be practically irrational , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his medicine on the ground of any reasoning , or previous estimate of probabilities . " And then he goes on to compare the experimental evidence of Christianity with this evidence of the influence of remedies . The analogy here drawn is deficient in one very important particular . in man 's moral nature there is no recuperative tendency which of itself alone can restore him . Whatever opinions may be held in regard to the doctrine of total depravity , it is universally acknowledged as a fact proved by experience , that man left to himself , grows worse and worse , instead of recovering from his moral maladies . Some extraneous influence is *tbsolutely necessary to his being cured . In no case can his moral nature unassisted heal in him the " wounds , and bruises and putrefying sores " of his sinfulness . But it is not so with // his physical maladies . An abundant experience has demonstrated that the recuperative tendency , the vis medicatrix naturae , is not only in most cases the chief agent of the cure , but that in a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure alone unassisted by art . No errors are so common in medicine as those which arise from losing sight of this fact . The constant succession of wonderful remedies in the popular favor is to be referred to this cause . It is chiefly from this cause that at the present time great efficacy is often attributed to the one hundred-thousandth part of a drop " of medicine , as alluded to by President Hopkins , just as similar efficacy was once attributed to Perkins ' tractors , the royal touch , and St. John Long 's liniment . There is no truth more thoroughly established , than that the experimental evidence in relation to the effects of remedies is exceedingly fallacious , unless it is most carefully observed . So many are the agencies mingled together in the restoration from disease , and so large a play does the agency of the vis medicatrix naturae have in it in most cases , that ordinarily nothing but an experience , sifted over and over again , can determine the value of any remedy . But it is not so with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maladies . Christianity is demonstrated by all experience to be in every case the grand , the indispensable remedy ; and the evidence is such as to be clear not only to the subject himself , but to all candid observers . But while the analogy as drawn by Dr. Hopkins is essentially defective* it might have been used by him in such a way as to place the value of the experimental evidence of Christianity in a strong light . The ground which should have been taken is this . The personal experience of men in regard to the influence of remedies in the cure of physical disease is exceedingly liable to error . Yet there is commonly no hesitation in taking it as good evidence ; and with certain restrictions it is proper that it should be so taken . Much more , then , is it proper to rely upon evidence from personal experience in relation to the cure of man 's moral maladies by Christianity , because this evidence is , for the reasons that have been indicated , so clear and unembarrassed by difficulties . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent among medical men , to undervalue the office of the patient , humble observer . It is very commonly thought that it requires no great amount of talent to observe . But those who have done the largest service to science , have been especially eminent as acute , active , and correct observers . Nay more , it is observation , and observation alone , that has built up science . Such // work was never done , as it is claimed to be by one of llahnemann 's admirers , by " men of ardent genius , who do not always wait for the tardy steps of induction , but grasp by anticipation at conclusions , which future experience is left to confirm or annul . " Such men are mere dreamers , and retard , rather than advance , science . Let then the just estimate be put upon observation . And let us not undervalue the minor discoveries which it makes . These have as much to do with the advance of science , as the larger discoveries which from time awaken the admiration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discoverer . He may add something to the general store of the world 's experience . And these every day discoveries , though not noted , step by step advance our science , and though each by itself be insignificant , in the aggregate their influence is incalculable . And further , it may be said without hesitation , that no man ever discovered anything which is great , without first discovering many things which are small . Grand results in science are never reached by a leap , but through " the tardy steps of induction , " which dreamers so much despise . The pathway of such men as Newton and Harvey , to the eminence which they attained , was through laborious and minute observation . They never despised the day of small things . In certain departments of medicine , the minute observation of which I have spoken , has of late accumulated a large amount of valuable experience . This has been especially true of the history and diagnosis of diseases . It is here that Louis and others of kindred spirit have done important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing the application of the principles of acoustics to a large class of diseases , and thus laying before the physician a wide range of facts of the most satisfactory and interesting character , has given a great impulse to the profession in the labor of minute observation . But the great want of the profession at the present time is the application of minute and strict observation to the influence of remedies in disease . In this department there has not as yet been as much accomplished by this means as in some others , because the work is embarrassed with many difficulties , to which I have already sufficiently alluded . Definite results are not as easily and frequently obtained as in other departments ; and the observer , failing often to get a satisfactory reward for his labor , tires and lags in his duty . But the profession are removing these difficulties one after another , and are thus beginning to do a great work in this department of medi // cine . We have reason to anticipate a very rapid improvement in Therapeutics , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which I have just alluded , will not probably result , to any great extent , from the discovery of any new remedies ; but more from ascertaining modes of using remedies already discovered , and settling the principles and the circuristances which must govern their application . New remedies will undoubtedly be now and then discovered ; but if it be proper to judge from what has been during the first half of this century , there will probably be but few new remedies brought to light during the next fifty years . When a new remedy is discovered , the work of discovery in regard to it is far from being completed , and often it is but just begun . A vast amount of labor in observation is needed to ascertain the occasions and the limitations of its use . The discovery of anesthetic agents is an important discovery . But the benefits which are to come from their use can not be fully realized , nor the dangers attending them be entirely avoided , till numerous observations by multitudes of physicians shall definitely determine under what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be employed . I have thus spoken of the good tendencies observed in the general medical mind at the present time . But there are some tendencies of an evil character which I must briefly notice . I mention first the disposition to adopt too readily new remedies and-new measures . When anything new is proposed , if the evidence of its usefulness be satisfactory , it is the part of true wisdom to introduce it into practice cautiously , narrowly watching its effects , so that the circumstances which should govern or limit the application of it may be ascertained . But the reverse of this conmonly occurs . The use of every new remedy or measure is more free and extensive at first , than it is after the profession have become thoroughly experienced in its application . A few exercise the requisite caution , but the great mass do not . And the evil is increased by the popular clamor . The people demand of physicians the immediate and full use of new things ; and many who would otherwise be cautious , yield to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profession , that many cunning , or , as they are termed , shrewd practitioners , appropriate every new measure or remedy , that is bruited by busy tongues , as a hobby on which to ride into popularity . - The result of all this is , that at the first introduction of any new thing , there is little of patient , careful observation in re // gard to it , and much imprudent use of it , that leads to error , and to injurious , in some cases disastrous , consequences . Many examples might be given , but I shall allude to but one , that of Chloroform . As this is an agent of considerable power , there is special reason for caution in its use , until the circumstances which should regulate its application are ascertained . When this is done , the remedy will be of great value , and will be much employed . But when its discovery was first proclaimed , it was used at once very extensively , and incautiously , and many disastrous results have followed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession , and more largely still in the popular mind , must be repressed . The results of a calm and rational experience must be awaited , in place of this headlong rush after every new remedy or measure . Medical men as a body should resist the prevalent tendency , and the wise and influential of all classes should give them their assistance in the effort . The second evil which I shall notice , as opposing the good tendencies in our profession , is the very prevalent abuse of what are termed specialities . This is an evil which comes under a very specious form . With a special attention to any one thing is naturally associated the idea of special skill . But , to say nothing of the fact that this special attention does not always result in imparting skill , it often occurs in medicine , that a reputation for skill in some particular department is built upon the mere show of study and research . This is true of the great majority of those who make a hobby of some speciality . And it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity for acquiring skill , that the very fact that they ride a hobby incapacitates them for making those discriminations , which are essential to real skill . Indeed , that a speciality may be a source of large profit , or of a wide popular reputation , it is ordinarily necessary that accurate and sifting observation be discarded . This is especially true , if the speciality has to do with some class of diseases claimed to be suite prevalent , and thought to require a particular course of treatment . When this is the case , the majority of the patients who present themselves for treatment , are not proper subjects for it . But it would be bad policy to tell them so , if the simple object be to gain from the speciality wealth and popularity . The physician is strongly tempted therefore to forego those distinctions , which , both as a scientific man , and as an honest man , he is bound to make . If he yield to the temptation , as too often happens , it is easy to see that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between truth and // error , but all his influence as a medical man goes to produce the same effect in the minds of others . And the aggregate influence of many such men upon the general professional mind , in *iffecting its habits of observation , is an evil of no light character , and must essentially retard the progress of practical medicine . The physician who makes a hobby of some speciality , if he have shrewdness and tact , is sure to obtain large pecuniary profit , and a popular reputation for skill , not merely among the ignorant , but also among the well informed , and even perhaps the learned . It is true that he loses , to a great extent , the respect of his brethren ; and his strictly professional reputation is at least of a questionable character . And yet , so lax at the present time is the public sentiment of our profession , and so many are those who are allied with him in spirit and practice , that he is enabled to maintain his position before the public as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of his brethren is supposed by his patrons to be dictated by envy or partisanship . The prestige of his success helps essentially to maintain him securely in his position , for success has great weight with most men in determining what is right and true . The physician who makes a hobby of a speciality acquires success in the same way that the open quack does . His spe* ciality does the same service for him that the flaming advert isement does for the quack . It is a flaunting badge which gives him the notoriety that he otherwise could not have . If he publish a book on his speciality he the more surely attains his object , particularly if the book be quite as much calculated for the public eye as for the profession . The reputation which he thus gains is of more value with the community generally , than even the highest reputation for good judgment would be , although this is a sine qua non among the qualifications of the good practitioner . And yet , valuable and seemingly honorable as his reputation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the unblushing quack acquires . Let us draw the parallel more particularly . As the quack gives his remedy to many more than really require it , so does the medical hobby-rider apply his treatment to many to whom it is not properly applicable . The result is the same in the two cases . Some are benefitted , and they are zealous trumpeters of the fame of their benefactor . rJ7hose who are not benefit ted say little or nothing . Those who recover in spite of what is done , commonly think that they have had a great escape through preeminent skill , and of course their praise is abundant . Those who recover from other causes than VOL . X. // the hobby-rider 's treatment , or the quack 's remedy , are apt to attribute their cure to that upon which their thoughts and expectations have been fixed , and their meed of praise is added to swell the general triumph. * The evil of which I have been speaking , is one of great magnitude . It tends both to multiply the false facts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to perpetuate the loose , undiscriminating observation which so much prevails among medical men . It does this , too , even under the guise of strict and extensive observation ; for this is what all hobby-riders claim to be their excellence , and the community generally accord to them their claim . Besides , there is no one thing which has so much agency in fostering the inj*irious popular influences , which are corrupting the character of the profession , and breaking down the wall of separation between rational medicine and quackery . It enables the practitioner to gain all the popular advantages which quackery has to confer , and yet retain his position among medical men . This mingling of the offices and the privileges of the physician and the quack is an abomination which should be cast out of our profession . There should be such a state of public sentiment among medical men as to make this disgraceful alliance with quackery an impossibility . Let me not be understood to denounce altogether the following of specialities in medicine . Within certain restrictions they are of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not time now to point out , and it is not necessary to the partioular view of the subject which I have wished to present . Another counter-tendency of an evil character in medicine , is the looseness of observation which still prevails , and which is encouraged by the popular influences to which I have several times alluded . It would be interesting and profitable to trace out particularly the workings of this evil , but the limits of this lecture will not permit it . It is an evil of extensive influence ; and it appears in no small measure even in the recorded experience of the profession . False facts are far from being rare in these records . Some have such a disproportionate number of cases of some disease on which they report , that other physicians , with good reason , suspect that there must have been some * The celebrated John Wesley , who , as Paris says , was " more disposed to attribute his cure to a brown paper plaster of egg and brimstone , than to Dr. Fother. gill 's salutary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and horse exercise , " is the representative of a large class that has existed in all ages , nd is not extinct in this enlightened nineteenth century . // mistake on the part of the observers-that , from some crochet in the brain , they had the " optics sharp , " which enables them , as the satirist has it , " to see what is not to be seen . " Some report many cases showing the good influence of some remedy in some disease , but the results are not at all verified by the experience of others . In such cases , the inference is , either that the experience of the reporters was rendered very extraordinary by a fortuitous concurrence of circumstances , or that the observations are , to a great extent , false . But I can not pursue these illustrations farther . Another tendency , of an injurious character , is the disposition to theorize , which , like those tendencies already remarked upon , is fostered by influences without the profession . The framing of theories is so captivating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and is so much easier than the labor of strict observation , that it will he a long time yet before it will be entirely abandoned . I have already sufficiently remarked upon the influence of this evil in retarding the progress of medical science . The last obstacle to the good tendencies of our profession , which I shall notice , is the lax mode of education which is so prevalent . There are so many medical schools in the country , and the competition between them partakes so largely of the popular element , that medical degrees are obtained in some quarters much too easily , and the profession is therefore crowded with multitudes of loose observers . The result of this , combined with the other evil influences to which I have referred , is to induce physicians to study all the arts which belong to the science of patient-getting , to the neglect , to some extent at least , of the science of patient-curing . They are tempted to aim at the show of success in treating disease , rather than at success itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated to catch the popular eye , rather than in their legitimate work of observation . And so many yield in a greater or less degree to these urgent temptations , that the general character of the professional mind is materially deteriorated , and the progress of our science is much retarded by these evil influences . Notwithstanding the obstacles which I have noticed , the tendencies for good are so strong in our profession , that there is a constant advance both in discovery and in mental improvement . Leading minds among us are , for the most part , moving in the right direction , and their influence is leavening the whole profession . The mental habits of the great body of medical men are every day improving ; and the spirit of observation is continually // receiving fresh impulses from the gratifying results which it realizes . And with this advance intellectually , there is also a corresponding advance in all that constitutes professional character . Hence , there is increasing self-respect and self-reliance . Strictly professional reputation is becoming more valuable , while mere popular reputation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obtaining a wider and more thorough influence . This has been especially true since the formation of the great National Association , an event which constitutes an era in the history of medicine in this country . The community , too , are beginning to have right views of the value of our profession , and of the objects at which it should aim . They are coming back from the radicalism into which so many even of the good and sensible have been drawn on the subject of medicine . They are beginning to see that they have demanded more of our profession than they ought to have done , considering the difficulties which embarrass medical observation-that Homcaopathists and other radicals , who have delighted to exhibit the uncertainties of rational medicine , and have boldly promised to substitute for them such rich and abundant certainties , have amused them with mere shadows  --  and that it is best to return , therefore , to the old paths , to hold fast to that which is good , and not give up the results acquired in medical science from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are beginning to be convinced , that an educated , and therefore an organized profession , is needed , to secure for the investigation of the difficult science of medicine the services of accurate , persevering , and honest observers . Let , then , all medical men foster assiduously the good tendencies which I have endeavored to develop to you in this lecture , and faithfully repress those which are of an evil character ; and let the influential in the community give to us their confidence , and coöperate with us in our efforts for progress and reform . Then will the prospects of our science be bright indeed , and our profession will labor without embarrassment , and therefore with abundant success , in its appropriate work of observation .
