595 ART . VH. - PICTURES OF EUROPE , FRAMED IN IDEAS . Picture8 of Europe , . Framed in Idea8 ; by C. A. BARTOL . Boston : Crosby , Nichols &amp; Corn p any , 111 Washington street . 1855 . New ITaven : T. II . Pease . THE design of this book is thus described by the author , better than in the fanciful title : " I have written no exact Itinerary ; I have drawn no word maps of geogra. phy ; I have not been careful to tell where I went , or what I did tzext ; but , venturing to imitate some of the poets , have left the unities of time and place whenever I could so observe the higher unities of thought and reality , without , I trust , ever violating the proportions of any fact within my reach . In short , I have not told everything , but the things which made on me the strongest impressions ; letting all the rest , like the showers I passed through on my way , flow off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken hold of nothing which did not move me ; or like a child , who , from a thousand scenes he has witnessed in the street , comes back to tell his mother in the loud eagerness of juvenile eloquence what especially caught his fancy , so I hope only to interest others in what interested me . I have found the almost chaotic mixture of numberless particulars in my mind under reflection , stirring itself and forming into distinct cystallizations around separate points . I have given many delineations of my experience ; but my pictures , such as they were , framed themselves in my contemplations , and hung of their own accord under the light of ideas which showed them better to me , as I believe they may to others . Accordingly they will succeed each other in separate headings , like the several apartments of a hall , in which I have endeavored to include , under each particular theme , only what touches the broadest human concerns . " pp. *7 , 8 . This plan , which has been in many respects happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traveler 's tales , into the sphere of moral instruction and even of theological literature , and thus becomes deserving of more particular inspection , especially from the position of the author himself who is a colleague Pastor with the venerable Dr. Lowell , over a church designated in the Boston Almailac as the Congregational Church of that city , in distinction from those both of the Orthodox and of the Unitarian denomination . The themes discussed , commencing with physical beauty , ascend to the loftier subjects of the church , mankind , history , and destiny . We must , at the outset , enter a serious protest against the portion of this volume , which , from the arrangement of lines , we supposed to be poetry , and which we are even yet compelled to believe was intended to produce this impression , though whether it was designed to be blank verse , or simple . rhyme , we are still somewhat at a loss to decide . It is a curious phenomena , that one , so keenly sensitive to beauty in nature // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should not perceive the failure of his own attempts in this department . We have hardly detected , in the entire collection , a respectable stanza , either for originality of thought ; for beauty of metaphor ; or even for that tripping dance of words , which might be justified on Prior 's plea " For rhyme with reason may dispense , And sound has right to govern sense . " We open at one of these original contributions for a specimen . Take the first , less faulty than the average : " Something between me and the grave is gone ; Plainer I can discern my own tombstone ; But now more pleasant thither looks my road , To journey with thee when I drop my load . " We used to wonder why wind was allowed to rhyme v ith mind ; but our author evidently intended to improve on this hint , and distinguish his poetry by the peculiar pronunciation which causes gone to rhyme with stone , and sky with depravity , as here : " Than earth or sun , than sea or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which sometimes mar the writer 's prose , of careless figures , and of mixed metaphors , abound in these attempts , which we criticise the more frankly , because brilliant and redeeming passages indicate ability to do better , although Mr. Bartol seems to lack the musical ear for arranging his syllables in tuneful measure . He has also neglected , apparently , all search after dainty words to drape his choicest thoughts , and has been merely careful to conclude two consecutive lines with the same letters , thereby stiffening his style and detracting from its grace , until we rank these productions for poetic worth with Rouse 's version of David 's Psalms , which we once were compelled to hear lined out in the broad accents of a Scotchman . Let no one dream that poetry is mere sport , that those lines , which flow so easily and bear rich freights of thought and feeling , have sprung from the fountain without forethought or effort by their author . The poems which the world will not readily let die , have been the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master mind is exhibited in the execution , as really as in the conception . Willis , in one of his letters from abroad , describes the manufacture of a sonnet , and we would subscribe towards having the description published in a tract for amateur bards , illustrating the indebtedness of Nature to // Art , perfectly in unison with our author 's theory , although not in this case with his practice . The prose of the volume is generally picturesque , and is well suited to the topics which it exhibits , but we observe here and there a careless phrase or epithet , such as " carving of ornament , " and " pious architecture , " hardly admissible in undefiled English . Long involved sentences , where the metaphors change and shift , prevent a clear perception , and cause the style to resemble a kaleidoscope rather than a telescope . We have room for a single example : " Let me , then , not offend , but rather pay homage to the genius that has so altered and improved the sphere , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using half the means of the race for mere locomotion , to get from one point to another , and spreading myriad wings to second in its flight the winged soul-for , as Plato reasoned and Homer sang , the soul has wings ; and , if it crave rest , in the somewhat paradoxical language of the Psalmist , it would fly away , and be at rest . ' So , homage to the genius of science and art , that to its corporeal weight and slowness , adds the pinions ; nay , in chariots of fire speeds it at his will , and on revolving wheels , through opposing wave and breeze bears it on to conquer difficulties , in token and presage of its universal victory ; drawing aid for it by a million threads , without confusion , through the circle of the earth ; placing one creature in this position and another in that , by hills or in valleys , in cities and along shores , as though nature s own carriage were employed , with a lordlier privilege than ever belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her offspring to their several destinations , with the power of gravity and the precision of light . " pp. 27 , 28 . The awkward construction of this sentence must be apparent to every reader , where the thought is obscured and the mind dazzled with pinions ,  --  chariots of fire revolving through waves , ' drawing aid by a million threads ,  --  and cars of silver and gold . ' The ambitious style of writing is so much in vogue , that we are disposed to indicate its defects , and recall the simpler rules of rhetoric , especially when an author may be regarded as qualified to offer a model for imitation . The practice of composing simply to read before a congregation , produces a careless and faulty style , which moves lamely when set in t*rpe , and we have found the query suggesting itself repeatedly , while perusing this volume , whether these essays might not have been originally penned to be delivered , although , of course , we do not imagine that this is the kind of homily usually pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To atone for any appearance of fault-finding , we subjoin one of the many beautiful descriptions with which the volume abounds , that of the Dresden Madonna : " The spectator feels , at first , a little curious and puzzled to account for its effects ; for this astonishing picture does not seem to have been elaborated with // the patient pencil that has wrought so unwearied upon many other famous subjects , but rather to have been thrown off , almost as though it had been in water-colors by an inspiration of divine genius , in a sudden jubilee of its solemn exercise , with a motion of the hand at the last height and acme of its attainment . The theme of the Saviour of the world , a babe on his parent 's bosom , is of interest not to be surpassed . The dim shine of a cloud of angels flows from behind a curtain into the room , which is equally open to earth or heaven . All heaven , indeed , through the artist 's wondrous hinting of innumerable eager faces seems crowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into . ' All earth waits dumbly expectant and mysteriously attentive below . The mother is discovered standing upon the globe with her offspring in her arms . The pope , anticipated impersonation of the highest human authority , bends his knees with the half bald half hoary head , sending from his lowly posture only an upward revering glance , while he lays his mitre on the ground , and , as well he may , there lets it lie . A saint stands atth e other side looking down with the humility of a heavenly countenance , yet evidently taking in , with admiring contemplation , the import of the whole scene . Little cherubs from below return their silent loving gaze to the vision that drops downcast from above . But it is remarkable that the least and youngest figure in this company-regard it from what side you will-is at the head , and in command of the whole . The gray beard of ecclesiastic might , at whose waving thrones were to shake , and kingdoms be rearranged , is annihilated before that soft , childish face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances from its upper seat , wears the veil of modesty and bends into the stoop of worship before that earthly life just begun . The angels that sang with the morning stars , together over the foundations of the world , flock and crowd , as to a sight unequaled even by their old experience , in the antechamber , about the door , of their rightful sovereign , shaped as infancy that can not yet walk , while the winged seraphs , of age apparently little superior to itself that have descended from the sky , fall yet farther down beneath the floor , and cling by their beautiful arms to the edge , as , with their sight , they seek from afar their clay-clad companion , yet somehow Lord . The mother , herself that bore what she holds upon her breast , has a countenance in which strange submissiveness mingles with paternal care , and tenderness runs into forethought of future days . The child , as though in him a thousand lines converged , is the centre , and unity of the piece ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost extent that simplicity and innocence can reach . But , at the same time , there is in his look a majesty peculiar and unrivaled , which seem to justify and require all this angelic and terrestrial deference . In those delicate orbs ,  - -  shall 1 ever forget them I-turned full out upon the world , and gentle , and unpretending , too , as eye-balls sheathed in flesh ever were or could be , there is , in what manner I know not , by what art or inspiration painted , I surely can not tell , a supremacy of control which principalities above or below might well fear to disobey , as though that were the final authority of the universe . " Never before , by any like production , had I been quite abashed s , nd overcome . I could except to , and study , and compare other pictures : this passed my understanding . Long did I inspect , and often did I go back to reexamine this mystery , which so foiled my criticism , and constrained my wonder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , if no picture is to be worshiped , something is to be worshiped ; that is to be worshiped which such a picture indicates or portrays . But the problem was too much for my solving . I can only say , it mixed for me the transport of wonder , with the ecstasy of delight ; it affected me like the sign of a miracle ; it was the supernatural put into color and form ; for certainly no one , who received the suggestions of those features , the sense of those meek , subduing eyes , could doubt any longer , if he had ever once doubted , of there being a God , a heaven , and , both before and beyond the sepulchre , an immortal life . No one who caught that supernal expression of the whole countenance , could believe it was made of matter , born of mortality , had its first beginning in the cradle , or could be // laid away in the grave , but rather that it was of a quite dateless and everlasting tenure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light which played between those lips and lids , was Christianity itself-Christianity in miniature for the smallness of the space , I might incline to express it , but that I should query in what larger presentment I had ever beheld Christianity so great . Mont Blanc may fall out of the memory , and the Pass of the Stelvio fade away ; but the argument for religion ,  --  argument , I call it ,  --  which was offered to my mind in the great Madonna of Raphael , can not fail . " pp. 201-204 . We have quoted this passage both for its intrinsic excellence , and as a testimony to the writer 's estimate of the subject of the painting , to which we may wish hereafter to refer . The hook abounds in beautiful and graphic sketches , and in pages of finished rhetoric , which render the carelessness evinced by other portions more culpable . The great merit of the volume consists , however , in its s1ncer1*-ty . Mr. Bartol makes no effort after originality , by affirming startling paradoxes , nor does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula of belief , but in a quiet , unobtrusive manner says what he thinks , courteously and gently , yet clearly and frankly . One rarely reads a volume , which produces a higher respect for the author , who so freely exposes his views , and even his feelings , without fear and without pride . There are , for example , only two or three allusions to our national shame and crime , and these occurring incidentally , but they reveal the honest opinion of the man , uttered without restraint , and manifest his sympathy with the right . We instance the following : " Even , the slave on his master 's plantation-whom we may be too nice in our sensibilities to think we could ever approach , or take the hand ot ; or whose condition some self-condemning tyrant over his own servants abroad , or miserable scorner of mankind may make our welldeserved republican reproach ,  --  might say with a voice reaching from Charleston to Boston , and from Boston to London , Lo from my dark stained hands , the stuff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flavor of your drink , the pleasure of your freedom ! I , unpaid , have been among the builders of your so line social prosperity ! God grant me the justice in which man is so tardy ! " ' This passage , so unobtrusive and gentlemanly , would hardly pass the examination of the in ommittee of the American Tract Society , and still there is no rankling venom in the words , but only a Christian truth uttered in a Christian temper . We commend to Union Safety Committees the following : " Quaintly Charles Lamb says , It matters not to tell me how many mothers in the world there are , better than mine : she is my mother ; that suffices for me . ' So our country is our mother . We are made // Nov. of her dust , yonder by God , who is our Father . We are but unnatural children , when she is not dear to us . As we love our friends in spite of their faults ,  --  not , as some say , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never indeed join in the impious exclamation , " Our country , right or wrong ; " we should never love or defend the wrong in our country , but honor and laud only the right . Yet let us remember , that , by the law of mutual influence in the members of the same commonwealth , as of the same family , we share alike in her dignity and disgrace ; and while happy in the one , strive , not bitterly , but affectionately , to ri dher , as ourselves , of the other . " Who can fail to honor the dignified and manly assertion of such principles , and how mean must be the spirit that would shrink from their avowal ? Yet they are not paraded as though their announcement required especial courage , but for what they are the rational belief : , and therefore the natural utterance of a truthful soul . The same characteristic is portrayed in every allusion to religious obligations , and the work is calculated to accomplish a great good by its familiar introduction of his highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , in the workshop , the mountain pass , or the gallery of art . There is no attempt to be religious , but the pious emotion awakens and utters itself spontaneously , and without formality , and is neither thrust forth unwillingly , or secreted carefully as if it were a vessel of dishonor . That first essay , entitled " At home and abroad , " is singularly felicitous in these respects , and can not fail to instruct and improve the reader , whether he expect to travel or to abide . It exhibits a thorough conviction , that work and not play is the highest and noblest earthly employment , and that in all labor there is profit . The pastor returns from his journey rejoicing in his home , rejoicing in his tasks more than in the glory of all lands , and findin in is increasing love for his life-work , and in his enlarged satisfaction with his life-station , the abundant reward for absence . He thus concludes in regard to natural beauty : " If the grand things you go far in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind to the teachings of God everywhere , but make you dissatisfied with , or scornful of common spectacles , and ordinary passages in the great volume of his works , your visit is foolish , and vain . " This sincerity and outspoken frankness , as if lie were thinking aloud , occasions however unguarded statements , which are calculated to produce erroneous impressions in respect to the real and settled opinion of the writer , and oblige the reader to wait until in some new scene , or under different circumstances , he may hear the other side , and discover the // actual belief . Mr. Bartol takes it too much for granted , that we know all about him , and can judge of his printed sentences as if we were standing beside him , and able to watch his countenance , and interpose our questions . He gives unbridled license to the passing emotion , relying on some other chance opportunity for rectii*ying the erroneous opinions which he has conveyed . We were , for example , not a little confounded by the burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , greeted the cathedrals of Europe : " You feel that you are taking the adoring anthem from the lips of some , and sounding it on to the lips of others ; or standing , as you grow still with meditation , you appear to be leaning on the staff of the Almighty , by the venerable banner of God that floats in the breezes of eternity . " We have selected a single phrase from pages of unqualified adulation , both to the cathedral and its worship , until we expected to hear that our author had taken orders at Rome , anj. was officiating in the pomp of that gorgeous service , clad in priestly vestments and waving his censer to the chanting of the Sistine Chapel , or beneath the nobler dome of St. Peters ' . Thus foreboding , ' we followed our guide , wondering if he ever could enter again that homely brick meeting house on Lynde street , until our doubts vanished and our confidence was restored after fifty pages of misunderstanding , by a noble vindication both of the Puritan architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on liturgies and printed prayer that did our heart good , and a part of which we quote for the benefit of any readers who may open the volume on our recommendation , and who will require this explanation , to avoid a similar mistake . We have no space for the description of the service in Westminster Abbey , and of its effect on the worshiper , which was not complimentary either to the liturgical forms or to the preacher . We can not copy his frank avowal that he returns more independent than ever , but must satisfy ourselves with the following , as the summing of the matter : " What is essential in the church must of course have , and it will put on some clothing . It will be variously clad in one place or another . Only let those who are called Christians , in every place , beware of taking the clothing for the thing clothed , or of imposing their particular garment of Christianity as the only fit one upon others . Let them remember , too , that as with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , the lower is proved to be its life ; so the more the church is dressed , the less , in actual demonstration , is the vitality of the spirit . An excessive official and formalistic operation of the church may in some respects , be adapted to a low condition of mankind ,  --  of those learning their letters in religion ; but , in the name of God and Christ , the moment // Picture8 of Europe , Framed in Idea8 . Nov. they are susceptible of it , let them have a higher teaching and ministration . Otherwise , at length , as the Bible is true , " the letter killeth ; " the form will begin to extinguish the souL In fine , as so much has been said of the moving efficacy of forms , especially in the Romish church , in foreign countries , let one bear witness that nothing in these forms made any remote approximation in power or persuasiveness to the sermons and supplications in the same countries whose sincere accents fell on his ears in the Protestant communion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms more than to the spirit , then I hesitate not to say , let us go to Rome at once . In the Romish services there is often , at least , a warmth and earnestness , to which that of every other formal church in England or America , seems affected and cold . One can but admire the deep policy and masterly working on the human mind of the papal system ,  --  every sense of whosoever , in the stream that is perpetually flowing in and flowing out , enters any of its tabernacles taken possession of : the eye with paintings , statues , alcoves , altars , columns and costume ; the ear , with entrancing sounds of tongues , and pipes , and chords ; the smell , with fragrance from dexterously swung and adroitly caught , rising and descending censers ; the touch with holy water , in the ever-renewed emblem and motion of the cross* and whatever is weak , dependent , confiding in the human heart , at once seized by an ancient authority , held forth in manifold symbols , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogmatic creed , and now stalking , in the shape of ornamented , almost military , officers , through the submissive adoring throng . But you can not help asking , How would Jesus Christ look in such a scene I Quite at home , think you ? How would he , the simple , familiar , loving , and holy , like the strange mixture of superstition and despotism with humility and love ? Where would he prefer to stay ? Amid this pomp of praise , this aristocracy of rank and caste in religion ? or where even two or three in his name , in simple devoutness and modesty of mutual regard , were met together ? I can only say , Read the whole New Testament , and answer . " pp. 247-249 . The careless utterance of the passing emotion , which so easily besets this author , must be borne in memory , while perusing the volume and deciding in regard to the theories promulgated . We readily concede the important truth enunciated in the chapters entitled " the superiority of art to nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but they present only one side of the shield , and are therefore calculated to mislead the unthinking , and to induce a misapprehension of the author 's opinions . Man , we certainly believe , is commissioned to subdue and cultivate , and adoru the material world ; and the fine arts have their office in this grand achievement , while they also minister to the noblest intellectual and spiritual capacities of the human soul . Yet we are disposed to ask an explanation , when met by the assertiou in respect to this department of human genius . " But it is worthy of note , that the purely base and wicked things in the world which God abhors , are seldom or never chosen by art for its topics . They are as unfit to be reproduced as they are ever to exist . Art , therefore , in her plans and labors is essentially pure and lofty . One can hardly be in her palaces without a feeling of sanctity . " Does Mr. Bartol mean to say , that , in the galleries which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he discovered nothing calculated to debauch the mind and morals ? - then is he at variance with // other travelers , and with undeniable history , or we have read wrongly . We grant , that the fine arts have their place among the other gifts of God , but no gift has been more grossly perverted and prostituted . The subject , and the execution of many world renowned paintings , is sensual and demoralizing , and the devotion to the fine arts has hitherto , in the world 's history , been synonymous with idolatry . We shall find that the highest attainments in this department have been accompanied with a low standard of public morals , and with a disregard to the public welfare in relation to political and religious freedom . We wish that Mr. Bartol could have listened to a noble and cultivated Italian , mourning in our presence the influence of the fine arts upon his people , and praying for the destruction even of their noblest monuments and museums , that they might learn that the soul was more precious it was nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paint a martyrdoni , than to suffer for righteousness sake . We do not imagine that this is the writer 's opinion , but loose , unguarded eulogies produce the impression , and are to be rebuked . We had passed the matter silently , if this had been the prophecy of a future for art , but when a professed minister of Christ indulges in such rhapsodies without qualification , over the actual state and influence of this school of human instruction , we must enter our vote on the other side , although compelled to confine our denial to a paragraph . The real significance of the volume remains unconsidered ,  - -  that which has induced us to read and review its pages . The author , as we have already remarked , occupies somewhat of an anomalous ecclesiastical position . He claims for his church , a broader and loftier platform than that of any existing Christian denomination . He describes himself as " belonging to no sect in religion , " as " unconscious of a wish to plead for or against any section , or denomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted , what are the views of one so catholic ? We do not intend the slightest disparagement of the author , for we have ever heard of him as a sincere and upright man , of humble spirit , and his book awakens our respect for his character and intentions . We are , in fact , curious to ascertain how far he differs from our interpretation of the Gospel ,  --  whether upon essentials or non-essentials ; and we suppose that lie may be equally interested in discovering how his ideas affect the class to which we belong . Answering but for one , we will frankly declare our impressions , while we have examined the theories presented and illustrated in this vol // mne ,  --  - so far as they concern man 's religious nature , . and wellbeing . The free and uncontroversial style of these essays , exposes more accurately the author 's real opinion than any labored argument in defense of one definite proposition , and we infer that we possess his general views on the subjects which he has selected . We have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hearty sympathy with truth and virtue  --  and his appreciation of a simple and spiritual worship . We also believe , like him , in an enduring kingdom , in a history of progress  --  and in a destiny of peace and love . We , too , acknowledge with admirin* wonder and devout affection , " the unearthly sinlessness , the divine and aspiring nature of Him who came to redeerft and exalt our race " - " the incarnate spirit of God , " " the great Prophet of earth and heaven , " " a saintly soul whom we call Son of God , " " whose countenance is the brightest dawn of hope that ever rose upon the huiuan race , " " the author of our salvation . " We have abundantly conceded the manly religious sentiment which pervades the work ; but we laid it down with the conviction that there is a world-wide difference between the author and ourselves , which affects both our philosophy , our religious feelings , and our regard of the earth , of man , and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SiK . Our author takes much pains to vindicate the race from the charge of universal depravity , and narrates the pleasant intercourse of travel , the kind advice which was freely contributed to the stranger , and the amiable traits which were exhibited by chance associates , as evidence of inherent goodness . Thus he argues : " indeed , the general good humor of intercourse among those accidentally thrown together ; mutually helpful services freely rendered ; pleasant words ; affectionate religious salutations heard along road and river ; unaffected cordialities of kinsfolk and friends , pointing back to happy homes , did not to me prove man the brute or demon which by bigots and sceptics-who are more akin to each other than we may fancy-he has been called . " We confess to something like a smile , when in support of the theory that the race are not universally sinful , we were pointed to the epitaphs on their tombstones , with this sober , though novel assertion : " Than the grave yard there is , indeed , no more striking exposition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony he concludes , " unworthy , guilty men enough there have been for our warning in the great career of time ; yet , thank God ,  --  for it is important to our fundamental faith , essential // 605 morality , and needful encouragement ,  --  thank God that man himself , in his whole nature and tendency , is not proved false and delinquent , but of a temper generously endeavoring and grandly aspiring . " We do not purpose to cast any reflections on this method of observation , by which the character of the race is vindicated from their tombstones , although we can not help thinking of the witty lines pronounced on the burial place : " Here lie the dead , and Here the living lie . " We are desirous , however , of representing fairly Mr. Bartol 's doctrine . He thus states his views , speaking of the earth : " It is an adorned abode of a cunning and aspiring , though imperfect and . faulty race ,  --  a race , that , in comparison with its capacities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny of more spiritual being and heavenly progress , may indeed be described as wandcring and lost , but yet a race , which , with all the wickedness of its offspring and all the weakness of its abortions , has ennobled the sphere it dwells in almost beyond its own knowledge or imagination . " * * " The sons of mischief , who have sought out diabolic inventions , have gained for their doings and monuments a foothold relatively small to the space which the children of worth and genius , as the servants of God , have beautified with constructions of utility , and exhibitions of splendor , and seeds of all wholesome and nourishing growth , for the blessing and honor of their kind . This was God 's design from the beginning . And no man shall convince me that the Maker himself has wholly failed of his purpose in man 's creation ,  --  that he is quite disappointed in the race of his children , and finds , after all , in the humanity lie took pains to fashion and inspire , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsified . No ! sinners and rebels havc abounded ; but the whole moral world has not wheeled out of its orbit . " pp. 161 , 162 . And again : " Even in this poor world of ours , I have never been able to see sin as the great fact , evil as the centre , or misery as the law . What is bad in the human passions on this lower theatre of time , is indeed always rife , and rages often fearfully . Still it is but an exception ,  --  tremendous and overwhelming , exception though it be . He must be pitied , as narrow minded and not aware of the full love and mercy of God , to whom human existence is only a blight , a mischief , and a curse . The good predominates , and I declare it the more earnestly , because I think it for the glory of God and the welfare of mankind that it should be seen to predominate . " pp. 315 , 316 . We believe , equally with this writer , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , and should neither expect to Lneet a ruffian at every crossing in a foreign city , nor to leave all the courtesies of life behind , when we embarked for Europe . We certainly have never discovered any one who denied the facts on which Mr. Bartol grounds the inference , that right and goodness are the common rule of humaim conduct , but this has not been our method of detecting the nature and presence of iniquity . We go not abroad to discover sin , we tarry at home , and in the secresy of the closet // search our own heart and compare our character with the perfect law revealed in conscience and the Bible . Judg*d by that standard , we do not find ourselves bereft of all natural affection , or of all generous impulses , but we do discern alienation from God , a wrong purpose , a living for self in the present , rather than for Christ and eternity ; and our best endeavors to reform prove futile , until we cry with the Apostle , " 0 wretched man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this death ! " SIN IS not , according to our apprehension , an external act , but an inward state ; a breach of that first commandment , to love the Lord our God with all the heart , and under the conviction of personal degeneracy and of personal transgression , we learn to appreciate the promises of Scripture , to believe in Jesus Christ , and to pray for the Holy Ghost . The enormity of iniquity has been manifested by every new display of the divine goodness , and by its certain results upon our spiritual being in discord and degradation . We learn from conscious ill desert and helplessness to understand the necessity of a divine propitiation as our only chance of salvation , and of divine grace as our only hope of sanctification . We are instructed by the Bible that all mankind are in a similar condition , and so far as our investigations extend , we find on close inquiry that the human heart responds to this verdict , and when brought clearly to discern itself in the light of the divine law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rightful Sovereign . Had we undertaken a search after the character of man ; we should not have imagined when a gentleman gave us a polite reply to our civil address that he was to be canonized , nor when an innkeeper did not cheat us so badly as we anticipated , that he was necessarily a sincere Christian ; but we should have watched to ascertain whether faith in God and reverence for His law were the ruling principles of action . With our idea of duty we should never have inferred that " to esteem the noble rather than the saint , " " to regard this world and not the better , " were venial errors , which can be atoned for by the amenities of the parlor ; or by the subscription to a hospital . We should never have thought martyrdom a proof of the predominance of right feeling , or devised this ingenious plea , by which a very natural query is thought to be answered : some may exclaim , Martyrdom a glorious thing for mankind ! why then is it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agony , but that his fellow men were set in malignant , unappeasable wickedness against him ? Ah ! that is because at the time , as the great Martyr said , they know not what they do . ' Afterwards they adopt him , whom they hated and slew , into their highest honor and love . Yes , not a martyr was ever lost . The // heart of man reclaims all the holy suffering confessors of God , and by it reclamation and admiring affection , demonstrates its own capacity for seif-sacriflee. " p. 307 . We can not forget another affirmation of Him who is here styled the great Martyr . " Woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones and all uncleanness . Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
