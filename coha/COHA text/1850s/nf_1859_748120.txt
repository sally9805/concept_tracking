I visit all places of worship , from black prayer-meetings to the yearly gatherings of the Friends , go to hear Antoinette Brown and Dr. Hawks ; I will sometimes tell you what I have seen behind the curtain , and sometimes discuss the merits of a favorite actor on the stage . Pictures and parties , beaux and bores , all I study ; art and life , in all their phases I like to contemplate . I have peered among the purlieus of Justice , and burrowed in Knicker bocker corners for relics of our Dutch and Huguenot ancestry .

" 2 Henry IV . GOTTSCHALK , the adored of the ladies , is about to leave us ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another is announced . Gottschalk s career as " an American artist , both at home and abroad , relieves us from the reproach of neither producing nor appreciating genius ; for despite his numerous affectations , and his ad captandum artifices , the handsome piano-player is a ge nius . I heard him play , a week ago , at the concert of the Philharmonic Society , and never was more impressed with his littleness and his greatness . He lounged listlessly towards the platform , scarcely vouchsafed a bow of recognition as he snuffed up the incense of applause prof fered by his worshippers in pink bonnets , and sat down at the instrument . At first , his hands w r andered lan guidly over the keys , and his eyes , soft and dreamy , but with a blase expression strangely mingling with ift The Vagabond. their gentleness , were gazing , not vacantly , but still not intently , around the house . Occasionally the petted Adonis smiled as he caught the glance of an acquaint ance , and then the radiance which his worshippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , he is irresistible ; there is no use in denying it : be sides , the adorers in pink bonnets frown on all heretics who presume not to bow at the shrine . The fiery fur nace of their indignation is heated seven times for such presumptuous offenders . Have I not seen the Saratoga beauties , one on each side of Adonis , fanning him , as he sat exhausted after an unusual effort ? Do I not know Massachusetts blues , those cold and critical dames , who treasure up a finger of his glove , if haply they may catch some of the magnetism imparted by his inspired digits ? What wonder if a young and handsome artist has his head turned by such adulation ! But I have wandered from the concert . The pianist s hand rambled for a while carelessly and affectedly over the key-board , but at last the interest of the music ex cited him . And though this rambling style is not without its charms , the intenser sort is what carries the hearers away . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs nervously but , it strikes me , rather more than even his passionate nature suggests , catches at bits of paper and conveys them to his kissable mouth ( that adjective is a lady s ) , and chews them franti cally . As the music approaches a climax , he marks the emphasis with his head still more emphatically disorders his hyacinthine locks , especially the one that comes down over his forehead so negligently chews harder than ever raises his hands to a prodigious height as he Gottschalk and Tnalberg. 17 strikes the keys waves his body changes the position of his legs but does all this so gracefully , and wildly , and naturally , that he ends by catching you up in his own enthusiasm ; and , criticise as you may afterwards , at the time you are as foolish as he . The performance seems to me a mere performance , at first ; but he works himself into the frenzy , and at last can not help it if he would . All this he is shrewd enough to know contributes to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is an intoxication to his excitable nature ; it is , too , in part , the necessary expression of that nature . But I should do the artist great injustice if I stopped here without talking of his music so Avild , so dreamy , so passionate ; of his playing so exquisite , so Chopinlike , so inspired . Gottschalk has the real artist tempera ment . The odor of heliotropes affects him prodigiously , and we all know how susceptible he is to the charms of beauty . Doubtless the reputation of his successes with the sex , and of his cruelty , adds zest to their admiration . At any rate , he plays just as one would imagine a poet in love to do : he plays poems , and dreams , and passions . He reminds one of the description of Chopin , consump tive and down-cast in that deserted abbey in Madeira , playing for hours passionate fantasies and weird-like strains to his mistress . He makes you forget the con cert-room and the gaslights , your gloves and your lorg nette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you dream , you feel , you listen , you enjoy . This is all inde finite criticism ; but those who appreciate Gottschalk will tell you if such is not the effect he produces . You are not inclined to talk of the precision of his touch , or to count his time ; you lose sight of the mechanical means : i8 The Vagabond. you are interested only in the result . Those melting strains , those wailing passages , those inspired , exalted bursts , what have they to do with demi-semi-quavers and two-four time ? You might as well interrupt Rachel , in her imprecations on Rome , to parse the language of Corneille . We forgive our gifted countryman all his foibles , and forget them , too , for the sake of the tremulous , rapturous music he makes for us . We need not wish him success among the wild , excitable southerners , towards whom he wends his way . He had heaped up his laurels before he came among us ; though born here , his first triumphs were abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was already crowned with laurels placed there by the genius and the sovereigns of Europe . At the outset he was not appreciated , but he bided his time , and at last the harvest was ripe . He gave fifty concerts in New York last season , and at this moment is not only more a favorite than any American artist ever has been , among Americans , but better appreciated and bet ter liked than any artist in the New World . What a change from Gottschalk to Thalberg ! The one all genius , the other all art ; the one young , im passioned , irregular , fitful ; the other middle-aged , calm , unimpassioned , but omniscient and omnipotent as far as his piano is concerned . Gottschalk surprises , moves , en trances ; Thalberg diffuses serene pleasure , and performs unheard-of feats with perfect ease . One is Apollo , the other Jupiter . It is the old comparison ; the real and the ideal , Rachel and Ristori , Kemble and Kean . One excites , the other soothes ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no rivalry between the Gottschalk and Thalberg. 19 two artists ; their followers only contend , and how fool ishly ! Because a rose is sweet , must I not smell a vio let ? Because Naples is lovely , has Como no charms ? A Vagabond can enjoy all the romance and the fervor of Gottschalk , and none the less appreciate the marvel lous perfection of Thalberg . Still the battle rages furiously in the saloons of the metropolis ; rival forces attack each other at the opera and at morning visits . Not even the election campaign was half so bitter as this strife , which divides families and separates sets . Engagements are broken off , because the lover persists that Gottschalk s eyes have a greenish tinge ; and I have lost more than one invitation for not avowing myself an open adherent of Thalberg . Generally , the young muster under Gottschalk s ban ners . His beauty has subdued all the ladies under twen ty-five ( which includes all under thirty-five ) , while the young men find his music faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the last there is a spice of jealousy : they would support Gottschalk en masse , were it not he is so much admired by the pink bonnets ; whereas the travelled people , the blase , the critics , and that sort , prefer Thalberg . They like the music which it requires a more cultivated taste to appre ciate , which it implies bad taste not to admire . So , some are in a quandary ; they want to appear youthful , but would not for the world seem uncritical . What shall they do ? Thalberg s quiet ease and his unconstrained demea nor ( which Mr. Willis said was shopboy-like ) , pre possessed me in his favor . He never seems making an effort . He is conscious of his greatness , but so 2o The Vagabond. conscious that he need not obtrude it . He plays with perfect self-command . He has no inspirations , it is true ; perhaps he has only talent ; but when talent is so marvellously accomplished , when it produces such effects , it is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Thalberg involves and wraps his theme , at the same time letting you hear that theme , is among the most wonderful effects of art . It affords me as much delight , though of an entirely different sort , as the rhapsodical snatches of his younger rival . Then , his mastery of his instrument we all know surpasses that of any man living , and at times extorts the hom age of the most bigoted Gottschalkites . There are effects in his performance of UElisir cPAmore , of Norma , and of Mose in Egitto , which almost draw you to your feet . I have seen at these moments the most collected fashionables and the roughest-looking people in the room alike bursting with admiration , wonder and delight . Even the pink bonnets jump up here and there to see if he really does all that with one pair of hands . And it is not simply amazement that the master produces : the pleasure is exquisite enough to set one s nerves titillating , and that is my test of artis tic excellence . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acting , eloquence , or poetry . There is , however , one thing finer than Thalberg s playing , and which both great armies of admirers will admit to excel the separate excellence of either , and that is the combined music made by the two . They recently played a duet together , and in all my musical experience , I have seldom listened to such ravishing harmony . The audience rose and shouted , and little Gottschalk and Thalberg. 21 tiny hands in Fiench gloves were clapped , and delicate lace fabrics were waved , and the two great artists came back to gather their laurels . It was beautiful in them both , to add thus to each other s glory . It was especially delicate in Gottschalk , who had reigned su preme until the very king of pianists came to claim the first place : it was delicate in him , I say , to show no spite nor jealousy . He has , it is true , relinquished the field , but gracefully . He stayed long enough after the arrival of Thalberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he chose not to contend . He takes with him the good wishes and hearty admiration of a crowd of pink bonnets and of a Vagabond . I don t know whether I ought to say it , but I have lately heard that Gottschalk powders his face so prodi giously that his eyes look smaUer then they really are . It is , however , but just to add that my informant wears a straw-colored bonnet . /z/ Able to breathe life into a stone . " All s Well that Ends Well THERE is an evident affinity between the Scandinavian character and that of the Anglo-Saxon race . Sprung , indeed , irom the same stock , speaking cognate languages , each with the blue eyes and flaxen hair that mark their northern origin , it is not remarkable that the two branches of one great family resemble each other in national and individual traits . The gods of England and of Iceland were the same . Our forefathers worship ped Odin ; and Thor and Woden , the divinities of the north , are still commemorated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The same warm-hearted but reserved character , the same silent tongue , resolute look and strong arm , bear witness to the ancient kin dred . But especially in that development of character which is exhibited in art is this likeness apparent . The heroes of Ossian and the Norsemen of Icelandic sagas are german to each other . Goethe and Shakspeare are not dissimilar ; Jenny Lind found a warmer welcome in English and American homes than captious Parisian critics would accord ; and FrederikaBremer s works are better known among us than in continental Europe . Our national mind appreciates Scandinavian art . And in that form of art in which American genius has Thorwaldsen. 23 compelled the acknowledgment of unwilling Europe , in which only America has yet taken a position at all worthy of her material greatness , there too has the Danish cha racter found its highest development . The field where Powers and Greenough have reaped their laurels , is that where Thorwaldsen has achieved his triumphs . It is fit ting then that hither should have been sent some of the worthiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and to its commercial emporium , have come specimens of the glories of BertelThorwal dsen , of those works that his countrymen have garnered up from Rome and Berlin , and all over Europe , and treasured hi a great museum called after his own name . At the Crystal Palace are now the original plaster models of the " Christ and His Apostles , " whose marble copies stand in the Frue Kirke , at Copenhagen ; and in a little room on Broadway ( No. 297 ) , may be seen many of Thorwaldsen s famous bas-reliefs the works of the artist whom his nation delighted to honor , the first sculp tor of modern times . Statuary seems to be that form of art in which north ern nations most delight to clothe their ideas of the beau tiful . Whether it is that colder natures find the stone a fitting symbol of the calm which distinguishes them ; Avhetherits unchangeableness aptly represents the charac ter of temperate races , would be hard to say . But causes such as these do influence mind and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its powers of pas sionate expression , seems better suited for the mobile in habitants of the south , who have ever excelled in the pictorial art . And indeed , when the old Greeks resorted to statuary , they were fain to color their marble : the Parian stone was all too cold for their torrid tempera- 24 The Vagabond. ments . Ivory and gold adorned the statues of Phidias , and blue and gorgeous red enlivened the im.nges of gods and men admired by the Athenians . Our chaster but possibly not more correct taste , rejects these ornaments ; and though an attempt has been made by a modern Ita lian to revive the mode , critics of France and England disapprove . However , whatever cause may exist , the fact is undoubted , that the sculptor s art in later centuries is prosecuted with most success by the children of the north . Cold , the passionate southerners call us . They , brim ful of life , and their blood boiling under the rays of a torrid sun , can not endure our comparative immobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our character not fickle , not changeable , but when after years of labor and toil , excellence is accomplished , it is fixed as the marble . Neither is the northern character destitute of a suscepti bility to genius and to beauty ; of a power to render the whisperings of nature in music as exquisite as that which Italians warble ; to fashion the ideal into forms of ever lasting grace and dignity ; to compel ev on Rome to con tend for the residence of Danish and American artists . Witness Crawford and Thorwaldsen his master . No more splendid and beautiful representative of Scan dinavian art ever existed than Albert Bertel Thorwald sen . The child of the people , he became the companion of kings . Born of poor and humble parentage , a nation mourned over his funeral , and genius , rank , and beauty made part of the pageant of his life . His own genius was the personification of the aesthetic spirit of his race . All its wild beauty , all its delicate grace , all its majesty , all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his works . The exquisite poetry of an Undine is embodied , though under another name , by Thorwaldsen. 2 him . The sublime religious feeling , innate in the race , that feeling which pervades the mythology of the north ; the genius of their poetry , the meaning of their su perstition , the warmth of their hearts , are all uttered in his creations . To be sure , they find other names : the religious sentiment is embodied in his " Christ and Apos tles , " while the lighter graces sought the classic lore of Greece and Rome for illustration ; but it is the national spirit that has expression in either . Then the absence in all his works of the southern passion is equally re markable . Fulness of feeling he has indeed ; but no passionate Niobc or Laocoon , no Dying Gladiator gives vent to the over-charged heart or indicates the dramatic intensity that animates artists born in the sunny south . Of tearful meaning there is plenty but none of the wild fervor or divine agony of southern art . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crystal Palace . The figures are of the original size , are from the hand of Thorwaldsen himself , and save that they may lack the rounded fulness that only mar ble can display , are said to be in every way equal to the proudest ornaments of Copenhagen . They have all the beauty of form , the anatomical correctness , the won derful expression , the graceful fall of drapery , and the classic severity which distinguish the others . The Christ stands colossal in size , godlike in attitude , full of benig nity , beautiful as Raphael would have conceived , and grand as Michael Angelo would have executed , saying to the assembled disciples : " Come unto me . " The gen tleness of the invitation , the mingled mildness and ma jesty of the countenance , the union of power and love , are triumphs of the sculptor . The apostles , larger than /z/ 26 The Vagabond. life , but inferior in size to the master , are grouped around , each elevated on a pedestal , each distinguished by his appropriate symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys but each marked yet more plainly by his individual expression ; Thomas doubts and Peter promises , Paul preaches and John loves . The expres sion in attitude , and limb , and lineament , leaves no room to doubt their individuality . The height of the figures contributes very greatly to their effect . Size always conveys the idea of grandeur , and the increased magnitude of the Christ is in accord ance with the most approved canons of art . Their being elevated above the spectator , also , forces one to look upwards , and contributes to the sentiment of awe with which we regard them . But more than these minutia ? , the genius which is instinct in them makes them among the greatest specimens of Christian art ever exe cuted . They are a sermon in themselves . They preach love , and charity , and truth ; they speak of the Divine calm and holy peace of the God-man , they tell of Cal vary and Gethsemane . The exquisite angel form supporting the font is unri valled in grace , and extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted by his in timate acquaintance with Scandinavian literature , and by his being so imbued with the spirit as well as the lore of the north , to criticise and to feel the meaning of Thorwaldsen , declares the effect upon hims elf of this angel form to be magical ; but it has always seemed to me incongruous unfitted for the group , or for its original purpose . Graceful and beautiful airy , angelic , if you will it always suggests to me the supernatural creations Thorwaldsen. 27 of the northern mythology , rather than those of Chris tian belief . Holding a sea-shell for a font , it recalls to my mind the fascinating creatures of the sea Undine , or those fair beings who beguiled mortals to their homes beneath the ocean . I can not look at it in connexion with the Christ , and not feel an unfitness . Notwithstanding that Thorwaldsen is the embodiment of his national art , he is yet equally happy in portraying classic fable . Deeply imbued with the feeling of Greek and Roman mythology , he brings vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tor . He illustrates the odes of Anacreon with an exqui site felicity and a truth of rendering entirely unequalled . His Bacchus is the very god of wine crowned with vine leaves , naked , revelling , intoxicated with joy and pleasure , but refined , radiant , beautiful with it all ; his Venus is not coarse , though sensual ; his heroes are indeed demi-gods . At the same time , the original poetic fancies in which he indulges , the creations which his own imagination calls forth , are remarkable for beauty and delicacy of thought , grace of execution , severity of taste and finish of style . His " Day and Night , " and his " Four Seasons , " are poems equal to the most subtile fancies of Sappho or Shelley . Sentiment is embodied in them ; love and beauty are breathed over them . It is not often that on this continent lovers of the beautiful can feast their eyes at such a banquet ; can improve and correct their tastes in such a school . But those who look longingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions and envy not the owners of Corregios ; may for awhile forget the Venus of the Tribune , and the Apollo of the Vatican . 28 The Vagabond. /z/ " I am advised to give her music o mornings . They say it will penetrate . " Cymbeline . SHE seems to fike the prescription . It must peneti ate . The manager was well advised to give her music o mornings . Indeed , if I were fitted to advise opera managers , I should say , repeat the dose ad infinitum / or as often as the patient will bear it . Mr. Ullman might abandon altogether the exploded fashion of giving operatic entertainments at night ; w r e can all amuse our selves so much better by daylight . I say we , deliberately ; for though the matinees doubtless originated in a devil ish desire to tempt the weaker sex , yet , when the wo man declared the apple good , Adam thought he might relish it too . Though , at first , only the daughters of Eve attended the music o mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous . At the last matinee there must have been a thousand men . And not only fashionable fellows ; not only young men about town , or vagabonds whom you might expect to find following in the wake of woman , or lazily lounging in the lobbies of the Academy by day as well as by night . I saw great historians stand all the morning in the par quet ; and reverend divines gazing through their lorg- The Matindes. 29 nettes when Soto danced ; and South-street merchants comfortably ensconced in their boxes during Change hoars . All the beaux were there of course : endeavoring to penetrate the mass of crinoline , and , for the sake oi being agreeable to one woman , making themselves dis agreeable to twenty ; sitting on the floor of the boxes close between two chairs occupied by their female friends ; peering in through the half-open doors of the first circle ; promenading in the foyer , and stopping at each turn before the long mirrors to pull up their collars and fasten their cravats ; or Availing around the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they had nothing else to do ; they wanted to kill a morning , and then they were so fond of music ; and William might chance to leave the office in time to stop on his way up town ; and if they should meet Tom as they appointed yesterday . The women , at first , used to think themselves alone and unobserved at these matinees . And then you should have observed them . They went prying around the lobbies ; they stalked into the proscenium boxes without leave ; they climbed into the amphitheatre ; they tried the stage-door ; they were rude to each other , crowded and jostled , and said naughty words , and looked daggers , and I believe even pinched and trod on toes purposely , too : they certainly tore the laces , and sat on the camels - hair shawls of their neighbors . They went hours before the time , and crowded around the entrance , pounding at the doors , and demanding admis sion so vehemently that at last the manager was obliged to allow them access earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood immediately in front of the private 30 The Vagabond. boxes ; they took out chairs from the same ; they sat on the edges ; and , one morning , two Brobdignagians nearly smothered Gulliver , who was in the back seat of a box , by flinging their shawls , and furs , and crinolines over his shoulders . I do not , of course , imagine that any of my fair readers were guilty of these solecisms ; that any of them opened the doors of secured boxes ; that they pushed in the aisles , and scolded in the lob bies ; that they quarrelled with the ushers , and berated the doorkeepers ; but surely , ladies , you must have seen the women who did these things . Doubtless you were as much annoyed as any one at such conduct . Doubtless you have remarked the change in behavior since more men have attended the matinees . Well , was it not shocking ? And to what do you attribute the reformation ? It can t be that the softer sex need the refining influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be that when our charmers are alone they be have in this way ; that all the graces are put on for the sake of us ; that the natural woman is such as was mani fested at the first matinees . " Oh ! no ; on those earlier occasions it was not so fashionable to attend . A differ ent class of women went , and , of late , more ladies have been present ; and therefore , Mr. Vagabond , you per ceive a difference . No impertinent insinuations , sir . " " I assure you , madam , I did not intend any ; you furnish , of course , the only explanation that could present itself to a reasonable mind . " The matinees are a mystery to me . What in heaven s name the people go for I can t imagine . They can t see each other : the house is so miserably lighted that the best lorgnette only gives you a headache to use ; they The Matinees. 31 don t dress fine , so you might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , nor criticise your ac quaintances ; very few men can get around to visit ; you can t flirt and chatter as you could at the classic Philhar monic rehearsals ; the crowd is so great that locomotion is uncomfortable ; hundreds of the audience stand dur ing the entire performance women as well as men . And it does me good to see the malicious creatures obliged to stand . When I think how often I have had to get up in a railroad car for some one who bounced into my place without as much as a " Thank ye , " I m glad to observe them looking weary and worn out . I go into a private box on purpose to let them see a man at his ease , while they rest first on one leg , and then on the other , like a chicken at roost . But why does all the world go to the matinees ? I believe in the musical taste of New York . I believe in it very firmly . I swear by the ama teurs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prima donnas , besides a thousand people who doat on the last opera , whatever it may be ; but they can all go in the evening ; they do . Why , then , should they crowd in the daytime , when no place is secured ? I myself am indifferent musical , but I don t like opera well enough to stand three hours in a dark place with a bonnet and feathers stuck right in my eyes , and steel hoops knocking my knees on every side , even to listen to Laborde or to look at Piccolomini . I am not a regular habitue of the matinees . I go for an hour , and gaze , and wonder , and come away . There is but one way to account for the phenomenon , and that is , to say that matinees are the rage . Every body goes because everybody else goes . Everybody 2 The Vagabond. likes to be in a crowd , perceives the electric influence there evolved , gets en rapport with the music , thinks better , and brighter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoys more keenly . The performers themselves are not unsusceptible to this magnetism ; they sing and act better , and so exert a reacting influence . Thus out of the bitter comes forth sweetness ; artistic excellence results from fashionable folly . For all these people can not listen to the splendid strains of passionate music , callous , or indifferent , or fool ish though the majority may be , without many of them feeling the refining and ennobling effects . And not only the ear is touched , and through that the brain , and nerve , and soul , but the lust of the eye and the pride of life are gratified . The magnificent theatre crowded with human beings ; tier above tier of heads and faces ; the very obscurity making the hall look larger as well as dimmer ; the strange effect of the stage and the singers seen in this half light ; all make a confused sort of pic ture on the retina like the remembrance of a dream . The faces in the distance seem unreal and shadowy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restlessness of these thousands contrasted with their occasional and absolute silence to listen to a great air or a particular singer , this , too , has a strange fascination for some natures ; this brings some hither . For all is not nonsense that seems so ; many and many of those you meet in society are not so shallow as you think ; many receive vivid impressions from the gaiety of a scene who you imagine are absorbed in fri volity . While a man stands paying silly compliments to some little flirt just out this season , his eye takes in not The Matinees. /z/ only the fresh ana budding charms before him , but all the brilliancy of the ball . The gaily-decorated room ; the lofty walls covered with mirrors and pictures ; sta tues peering from behind the heavy curtains ; flowers , and frescoes , and gilding , and columns , making up the background ; dazzling light streaming down on the rest less throng ; beautiful women clad in elegant and dainty garments ; gallant men saying courteous things ; young forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumes , sparkling jewels , subtle perfumes ; white arms , half exposed ; exquisite bosoms , shrouded in deli cate laces : then the music of soft voices and gentle tones and subdued laughter , with some inspiriting strain from a distant band ; all this furnishes an intoxication , a sort of delire to an imaginative nature , that is not easily resisted . Should you get accustomed to the sight , enter the ball-room ; notice the merry feet of the dancers as they glide swiftly by in the mazes of the redowa ; feel your own blood tingle as the robes of a woman you admire are swept hurriedly by , and the influence of the wine mounts up to your brain ; catch the inspiration of the music and the moment , and approach some fair girl ra diant with youth and beauty , whose eyes beam softly and gladly when you ask her to join the dance .

And yet the blues and the old fogies can t understand why the young people like society , what charm there is in dancing .

And , doubtless , the pageantry does its share ; doubtless very many who would never be attracted to the opera by the sublime strains of the conjuration chorus , or the magnificent intensity of the great duet , find the pomp and circumstance worth seeing . But among those who understand the language of music , who need no interpreter to explain the significance of Raoul s notes or Valentina s song , whose temperament answers back to every sob or paean of the tune , there are not many who fail to find expression and meaning in Meyerbeer .

" How can he be deemed uninspired who penned the strains in that wonderful duet between Raoul and Valentina , where every passion is compressed into music , where a language infinitely superior to that of words , , or ges tures , or looks , is given to the subtlest and intensest feel ing of our nature ? But music is like mythology : it is Janus-faced ; it has one side for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veil . In the days of Homer and Menander , the fables of antiquity were all true for the vulgar , though the philosophers saw in them a hidden meaning , a life and a beauty that have endured till now , when their religious influence has been dead for centuries . Those who would might then discover that Hercules was a personification , that the legend of Prometheus had a double import , that Venus symbolized more than sen sual pleasure , and those who care , may now find in music a deeper significance , a profo under interest , than it awakens in the bosoms of most listeners . To many , an opera is a refined luxury , an artificial pleasure , an aristo cratic taste , exquisite , sensual , and nothing more ; but does any man suppose that the profound students , the great artists , the poets , the thinkers of the old world , who listen nightly to the strains of Rossini and Beetho- Meyerbeer. 37 ven , find in them a mere sensual titillation a mere intoxication as intense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opera because it is the fashion ? And in America , how is it that despite of prejudice , despite of mismanagement and quarrels , high prices and Astor-Place riots , opera , an exotic , has taken root in this furiously native soil ? Why is it that , all the world over , it has supplanted the drama in the estimation of the cul tivated and the refined ? A mere fashion lasts not so long as this ; extends not from Mexico to St. Petersburgh , from Paris to San Francisco . And the taste for the ajnusement is not confined to a fashionable class . Thousands are fascinated by music who never clothe their hands in the skin of kid before they applaud , and who listen without the aid of opera-cloaks and dresscoats to assist their sense of hearing . The truth is , music speaks an universal language : it speaks to the soul ; it is the form in which the feeling of this age finds its fullest and freest development . Indeed , all art is something more than a luxury : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic religion . Ignorant or grovelling minds may worship the statue and forget the saint may bow at the shrine and wonder at the lamp ; but he who knows what the meaning of all this is , sees and receives another influence . He only is the true worshipper , and this , too , whether the artist feels his mission or not . The unworthiness of the priest affects not the validity of the sacrament ; and the vanity or worldliaess of the artist interferes not mate rially with the emotions he excites in another . Art , in other times , has been expressed in other ways . The old Greeks gave vent to their love for the beautiful 38 The Vagabond. in the more tangible forms of architecture and sculpture , and the temples and statues that delighted the ancients have never since been surpassed . In the middle ages , it burst into flower in painting , and the gorgeous crea tions of the Italian masters were the result . To-day , art finds its development in music . Our painting is poor and our sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe in the music of the nineteenth cen tury ; and if we must yield the palm to other ages in other arts , here we can claim a super-excellence . The ancients had no conception of the power of music ; the moderns , until now , have been groping befwe the dawn of that day in whose meridian splendor we are basking . Compare the fugues and the cathedral music of two centuries back with the harmonic glories ushered in by Gluck , and brought to perfection by Beethoven and Mozart ! Compare even the discoveries of Palestrina with the science of Meyerbeer ! And if music culminates to-day , it is because it is the truest exponent of the feeling of the present age . Emo tions too subtle for other embodiment , sentiments too fleeting , passions too intense , feelings too profound even for poetry , are here all told ; and especially do I recognise in the music of this century the utterance of that feeling which struggles for expression in the deeper literature of the time the wild unrest , the earnestness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Margaret Fuller , are all expressed in the sublime music of modern composers , are all ex pressed in Meyerbeer . The pretty strains of Auber may do for some ; the passion of Donizetti and the intensity of Verdi , perhaps , are the fit correlatives of the outside Meyerbeer. 39 turbulence and revolutionary spirit of our age ; the ex quisite flow of Rossini and the divine calm of Mozart are soothing and religious ; but only the awful terror and unearthly wildness , the supernatural grandeur and unequalled sublimity , the fierce struggles and pierc ing agonies of Meyerbeer , combine all the character istics of this era . " Robert le Diable " tells of the spirit which breathes in Goethe s " Faust , " and pervades every page of the earnest literature of England , France , Germany , and America the peering into forbidden secrets , the dealing with more than earthly beings ; the scepticism , the doubt , the anxiety , the terror , and the struggle . Who that has ever heard the " Robert , toi que j @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound that cry to man to save himself but has thrilled with an intense reality that made him forget the pageant of the stage . For my part , I shut my eyes , and care nothing for the mimic life there represented ; the great genius has spoken to an inner being . The calm of Alice , the wildness of the incantation scene , the gloom that shrouds Bertram as with a garment , and the humanity of Robert , are all told as no poet ever told them . Robert is equal to Faust , Alice is greater than Gretchen . They stand out indi vidualized as distinctly in our memories as the crea tions of the greatest of poets , or the figures of the greatest of painters . Another such magnificent subject could not be found as the strife of a demon for his son , with the simple , pure peasant girl of Normandy , and the struggle of that son , beset by the entreaties of love and the seduc tions of hell ! It is the history of every man ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound ; it is the very mystery of being , set before us . Then in " Le Prophete " how vividly do we see the Ana-baptists ! How wonderful a creation is Fides ! How natural the variable Jean of Leyden now triumphant , now yielding , now lost a type again of man ! And Fides , with all the fervor and intensity of woman wo man in her purest , truest , noblest aspect , the mother all compressed into the " Ah , mon fils / " which rivals the " Jtobert , toi que j aime / " in depth of pathos , sub limity of expression , and intensity of meaning . These are the glories , the marvellous works of Meyerbeer . He has not the dramatic feeling of Doni zetti , nor perhaps the elan which Italian composers infuse into the expression of earthly passion . He does not represent love as they do ; but when something more than human is to be told , when something clear from every stain of human dross is to be expressed the cry of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo man to her lover to save himself Meyerbeer is equal to the emergency . No guilty raptures , no Favorita , no Norma , does he portray ; but the sublime purity of an Alice , or the holy fervor of a Fides . I have not spoken technically of this composer . I leave it to others to dilate upon the means by which he produces his effects : it is my task to treat of those effects and tell how he influences me . His learning and his science are great and manifest ; his combinations are peculiar , and his method superb , Others , if they choose , may treat of these ; it is enough for me to confess his power , to recognise his genius ; for it is the truest test of Meyerbeer s glories that he Meyerbeer. /j.1 awakens your sympathies , he touches your feelings quite as truly as any of his rivals .

" /z/ " She is sad and passionate . " King John , THE night of the twenty-second of January was cold and uninviting . There was no opera , and I know not why I was anxious to Avitness the debdt of a Western actress at Wallack s theatre ; but it was fated , and I sallied forth into the snoAV . I sat in the orchestra , and was not at all crowded . There came upon the stage a fine Avoman , with an easy manner , and Avho spoke two or three Avords in a natural tone . I was surprised at the phenomenon , and attended to what she should do or say next . Of course I was amazed at her daring portrayal of Camille ; but when the curtain fell at the end of the first act I acknowledged the spell of genius . As the play AA T ent on I became absorbed ; by-and-by , eye and car were both touched by an electricity that readied brain and heart ; and ere the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emotions , such a Avhirhvind of feeling , as made criticism impossible . All I had to do Avas to give myself up to the sway of the magician , to be swept away by the torrent of enthusiasm in which the Avhole audience Avas involved . I went again shortly , and again , and again . Each time excitement Avas almost painful . Not tears spoke the Matilda Heron . 43 depth of feelings that were roused , but absolute exhaus tion declared their power . It was not until familiarity with the performance of " Carnille " had in some measure blunted my susceptibility that I was able calmly to criti cise . Seldom , in a theatre , had my inmost nature been so stirred as by this new actress . " Medea " came next : it was not modern ; I was prepared to judge severely , and by comparison with the highest standard ; yet , even in this play , I felt at times the same overpowering influ ence , the same shaking of nerve and thrilling of frame . Miss Heron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your heart that she speaks to , your soul that she stirs . The brain , the intellect , is not untouched ; but when you get time to take breath from your own sobs , and wipe your eyes from the blinding mist that will rise ; when you rest your ears from the burden of those passionate accents , there is much in her acting that you do not admire . But admire her or not , I defy you to remain calm . Still , it is well to analyse her remarkable powers . And first of all is her naturalness . This first demands applause from the most discerning critic , and ends by provoking cavils . This first forces itself upon your notice , this first rivets your attention ; this is the great secret of her acting is her talent , ay , and her art . Surely naturalness can not be decried . And yet this is not only her great peculiarity , it is , perhaps , her fault . She is absolutely too natural . She portrays a character exactly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not its own , but with every touch of awkwardness belong ing to it . She not only adds nothing , but subtracts nothing . She not only idealizes not , refines not , elevates 44 The Vagabond. not ; she eliminates nothing of coarse or displeasing ; she spares no harrowing thought , no disgusting minutin ? ; she is not only terrible in her life-likeness , but at times offensive . And yet this very offensiveness adds to her thrall over you : you are held in spite of your dislike , because of it . The vulgarity of the earlier scenes in " Camille " is fearful in its truthfulness , but effective as well ; the repulsiveness of the sick-bed scene is painfully real . And here Miss Heron differs from any other actress I have seen . All others refine , in some degree , either by throwing a charm around a character that it can not really claim , or by concealing defects which it absolutely possesses . Here , too , Miss Heron differs especially from the great French actress , with whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has indeed thrust herself into the foremost rank , and is to be judged only by comparison with the fore most . As she is great , she must in many things be like her who is greatest ; but in her naturalness she differs from the Jewess . Rachel s conception was always idealized , was alw r ays unreal . Her exquisite taste , her refined intellectuality , made all things common and inferior seem unreal to her ; whatever she looked upon became in her eyes refined and elevated . And her execution corresponded with this idea . She was the living embodiment of Greek poetry and Greek statuary ; she was the spirit of anti quity made manifest in the flesh ; she was what JEschylus and Euripides dreamed of , what Praxiteles fancied ere he formed . She was what educated men of all time have since imagined the Roman maiden and the Grecian queen to have been , possibly superior even to the reality : Matilda Heron . 45 Phaedra could not have been more stately in her grace , nor Camilla more severe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either wilder in her woe or more terrific in her wrath ; probably both Pasiphae s daughter and the Alban s bride , in the storm of passion , lost or lacked some degree of that superlative grace that still crowned in Rachel the highest and fiercest abandonment . When she writhed in the agony of guilty love , or hurled denunciations on Rome , beyond the magnificent personation of passion , there was the strange beauty of attitude , the marvellous music of intonation . These gratified the taste , while the intel lect was satisfied at the representation . But was not the heart untouched ? Thrills of real hor ror Rachel did excite , the terrible emotions she did sway ; but tears she could not reach , tenderer feelings she could not evoke . When she essayed modern life , she descended from her pedestal : she was no better than others . In her own exalted region of high art , she was unapproachable ; but it was as really unreal as the pa laces of Olympus , or the personations of the opera . Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realization of your visions of Ilermione and Cassandra , and you must admit that she accomplished what she aimed at ; but ask if women , even in those days , did things according to rule , raged in such divine attitudes , or stormed in such magnificent tones , and you might as well suppose that their ordinary language was measured into hexameters , or their passions expressed in odes . Then , again , Rachel was cold ; beautiful , but so statuelike . Now , Miss Heron is the reverse of all this : she is not modelled , she is not stereotyped ; she has an inspi- 46 The Vagabond. ration of the moment . Seeing Rachel once in a certain part , you had seen her always : she never changed . True , why should she ? She had reached perfection ; change must be for the worse ; and she never changed , for better or worse . But this new aspirant is impulsive , fitful , variable ; undecided even . She changes her exe cution too much ; sometimes omits fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully por trayed , or makes wonderfully vivid what to-morrow may seem of less account . But she has not reached the acme of her art ; she is not sure of herself , she is pois ing her wing ; she is trying her strength . Miss Heron is not the calm , collected , self-possessed woman that a perfect artist is ; but though she has more blemishes for that , she has some greater excellences for the same reason . She paints not with the exactitude of a Denner nor of a Raphael ; but some touches are only the gift of inspiration . She is yet a novice , has much to learn , has capabilities undeveloped ; but the true gifts arc there : those which scarcely need cultivation , only direction , only restraint , only development , which tran scend all effects of culture , all results of art . This resolves itself again into nature . She is not only true to the nature that she plays , but true to her own nature . By looking to the one she is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of grace , but they are easy , at least , and sometimes brimful of passion , although she never achieves that wonderful expression of feeling in her whole form that Rachel accomplished . She has not the anatomical control of her muscles and limbs that the Frenchwoman possessed . Still , of all women who have ever played in America , she ranks next after Rachel in Matilda Heron . 47 this respect . Then her voice is not trained to cadences of such mellifluous melody ; she preserves not the music of intonation that marked the great tragic queen in all the depth of woe or fiercest bursts of imprecation . Miss Heron sometimes seems even to lose control of her vocal organs , and her elocution is often far from perfect but there is a weight of passion in her accents that I confess I did not always find in Rachel s . This is , however , only when expressing intense womanly pas sion ; for in embodying horror and terror Miss Heron comes far short of her own conception . She is not gifted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprecations degenerate into rant , her gestures are strained , her voice is utterly in capable of the fiercest expression , and she does not her self feel with the intensity with which she does other pans . She fails here ; of course , only by comparison with the highest ; still she fails . But she has her revenge : if she is not a sybil or a fury ; if she plays neither Eumenides nor Niobe ; if she lacks the statuesque majesty and the splendor of poetry and marble , or even which we have been wont to look for in the drama , she is more womanly than any actress who speaks the English tongue . She is of this day . Modem life is her field ; but only because in portraying modern life she portrays emotions common to humanity . When she plays Medea , and begs her children to come to the maternal bosom , " the breasts that fed ye , the heart that gave ye life , " she strikes a chord that would have waked an answering throb in Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrung their heart-strings , when Rachel would 48 The Vagabond. only have provoked their admiration . In the humanity deeper than all distinctions of race , in the instincts com mon to Greek and Puritan , here is this new actress greatest . She moves not with the stately step of Jason s queen , but she sinks on her knees and yearns towards her little ones as mothers in all ages would do , and cries to them with a harrowing tenderness for the absence of which stateliness could never atone . So in her love-scenes . Rachel could not love at least on the stage : she was too intellectual ; but Miss Heron is more of the woman ; none of the statue about her ; her full bust beats with the pulses of a sensuous nature ; her eye , that glares not with the snake-like , withering power of Rachel , burns with intense tender ness , and is radiant with an ecstasy of joy that the other knew not of ; her voice , though it breaks , and is harsh or whimpering , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves that Rachel could never strike ; its accents provoke tears , that none other can so won derfully excite . So she has a field all her own ; not classic , not ideal , not terrible ; but womanly , passionate , human . As yet her studies are incomplete . Continued labor , the culture of her taste , and the practice of her profession , will finish and polish her style ; but never give her the marvellous refinement of some , or the striking nobleness of others . She has her special traits , wherein she is super-eminent ; wherein others fall as far short of her , as she of them . Her excellence in these is surpassing , and in these , if she is wise , will she trust . /z/ " T is time we were at church . " Taming the Shrew . I HAVE always had a taste for theology . I read ser mons with as much interest as poems , study Jeremy Taylor and the judicious Hooker as ardently as their contemporaries , Massinger and Ford , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I would to see a picture or play . And it is not simply for the intellectual gratification that I read or listen ; though I enjoy the elaborate declamation of the French preachers , and love to fancy that I hear Bourdaloue or Bossuet delivering funeral orations in Notre Dame , or Barrow and Louth uttering their fine ideas in nervous English ; though my taste is gratified by the elegant language of Mr. Osgood , and my feelings sometimes stirred by the eloquence of the blind Milburn ; yet I find another interest in the pulpit , a profounder concern , a different feeling from that which mere dilettanteism in preaching can arouse . The subject which should engage the efforts of the preacher is to me all-absorbing : I read and listen with quicker sensibility , with livelier attention , with more earnest thoughtfulness when religion is the theme . Herein I am not fashionable . The world of New York goes to church in the morning for the sake of /z/ o The Vagabond. respectability , or in the evening for the sake of amuse ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it goes the next night to see Miss Heron , for the sake of the sensation . It likes to criticise ; to censure , or ap plaud the poetical quotation , the overdone rhetoric , the hackneyed morality , the large humanity of this popular preacher . It does not go to have doubts allayed , ques tions settled , spirits cheered , fears dispelled ; if it did , it would be disappointed . But as it wants only surface preaching , it is satisfied . As it has no doubts , or thoughts , or . cares , the shallow tide of Dr. Chapin s oratory floats it along : as it is not deeply religious , it likes his ser mons . I fancy I see my readers holding up their hands at this paragraph . Is the Vagabond also among the prophets ! the Vagabond talking about deep religious feeling ! But even the gayest may have moments of thought ; those most immersed in the cares or pleasures of the world may have times of hankering after some thing else ; the most indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretends to be no better than the rest of the world : the Vagabond is thoughtless , indifferent , absorbed , it may be , in the materialism of the age ; but he and his readers at times feel or think on theological topics ; at times long to learn the mystery of humanity , to solve the problem of destiny , to look into eternity . I appeal to my young readers if " it is not so . If you have acute sensibilities , warm feelings , quick perceptions , do not these very qualities at times oblige you to con sider religious subjects ? Does not the very vividness with which we , the young , enjoy this life , does not the intensity of our pleasure itself suggest another existence ? E. H. Chapin. 51 Does not the brightness of life , by comparison , call up death ? Does not the banquet ever have the skeleton at the board , if only to add zest to the wine ? Does not the beauty of the fresh garland remind us how quickly it is withered ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something unearthly in it ; genius is allied to divinity ; and this art , in its different forms , this art which I preach and love music , sculpture , poetry , painting , the drama has something elevating , links us with what is more than human , reaches out after the infinite . Those who are most susceptible to its influences must appreciate what I say . I speak not now of the thoughtful : they , of course , ponder on the most important of all concerns . I speak of the young and gay . They , too , have their moods of contemplation , their hours of soberness , when the awful uncertainty which surrounds us , the gloom of futurity , the tremendous interests of humanity will present them selves . We recover from these influences , we rush more eagerly to pleasure after a Lenten abstinence ; we go more gladly to the dance after a pause in the music , but we must acknowledge the reality of the influence . If we go to hear Dr. Chapin in one of these moods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us chaff ; that he is showy and unsubstantial ; intent on saying fine things ; pleased with the jingle of his own sentences , and delighted with the glitter of his own ideas , but utterly unsatisfactory to an earnest , craving mind . His fanciful conceits , his extravagant rhetoric , his swelling verbiage is at all times distasteful to a true culture ; but when one goes longing for truth , for earnestness , for help , all this is offensive . It is thrusting the man the speaker between you and God : it is mockery . 2 The Vagabond . Dr. Chapin never satisfies me : his ideas are always trite , his treatment commonplace , his philosophy what you may learn in the " Elegant Extracts " or the " Eng lish Reader . " Prettinesses of speech are substituted for real thought ; sentimentality takes the place of rea soning ; a large-minded charity , a generous morality , is held up as the host to which all must bow down . But important questions he ever shirks . He may touch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on temperance or truthfulness , but he discusses not eternity ; he avoids the profounder problems that perplex all thoughtful minds . He is good-natured and genial , he lends a help ing hand to every good work , he says a good word for every new enterprise , he preaches about to-day , which is all very well . He has a fling at every folly ; a sneer at every scepticism in which he does not himself share ; a stroke , and sometimes a right heavy one , at every wrong , no matter how gigantic in its proportions , or venerable in its antiquity , or imposing in its strength . He sympathizes rightly or wrongly , but earnestly , with every movement which he believes to be for the ame lioration of the race . Perhaps his judgment is wrong , his head sometimes weak , and his hand unsteady , but his heart is always right . But his attention to temporalities is too exclusive ; his vision magnifies near objects so that distant ones become obscure ; the glass of faith he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he never enters the holy of holies ; he never brings down a sacred fire . Like the priests of Baal , who cut them selves with knives and cried aloud from morning until evening , he labors , but in vain . He preaches , but with E. H. Chapin. 53 no unction ; he ministers , but with no effect . One is never moved by his discourses to anything more than a present or passing sympathy . A lofty influence , an exalted , pure , religious fervor , is entirely lacking in his sermons . Could he have satisfied the cravings of poor young Stirling ? Could he have silenced the doubts of Tennyson , or demolished the arguments of Carlyle ? A soul struggling for the light , wrestling with despair and anxiety , an " infant crying in the night , " would find no solace , no answer , no light for the darkness , no ease for a troubled mind with him . When will the preachers of this day learn how wide spread is the doubt that disturbs the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who avow themselves unbelievers , but among members of Christian churches , among those who seldom acknowledge their perplexity ; and stranger still , among those who appear immersed in business or pleasure , there are many who think earnestly , seriously , faithfully ; many who can not be satisfied ; who determine not to think , to drown doubts in the whirl of excitement , but to whom these thoughts return in spite of themselves , to whom they cling like the old man of the mountain to Sinbad , which they can not shake off . And yet preachers go lazily on , telling men and women that God is love , and will damn them all if they don t believe . While many , perhaps a majority of the leading literary minds of this and other countries are tinctured with free-thinking notions , no effort is made , or none commensurate with the need , to affect the age . Missionaries are sent to Boroboolah Gha , and a wail is made over the Five Points , but the mass of the educated people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . Dr. Chapin s style is second-rate . It is pretentious and tawdry , overloaded with ornament , crammed with fine words and far-fetched or commonplace figures , interlarded with Avitticisms , and stuck full of poetical quotations , which are recited in the worst theatrical manner . The arrangement is often faulty , the logic entirely wanting , and the really fine things are fre quently so obtruded as to become offensive . If he thinks of anything clever , or can say anything cleverly , in it conies , though utterly irrelevant . There is a con stant aim at effect , a constant straining for applause . The interest of his subject never so far absorbs him that he forgets himself ; when he makes a good point , lie stops and looks around , as if to cry " Plaudite nunc / " and a rustling is heard all over the house . lie seldom fails of a certain effect ; he produces in a pro miscuous audience a kind of mental titillation , but never impresses one soberly or permanently . Though occa sionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights are actually successful , his eloquence is , on the whole , too sophomoreish to please either scholars or people of high cultivation . The chastening effect of ripe mental culture is everywhere lacking . His earnest sympathy , his genial charity , his univer sal amiability , are traits that distinguish the man rather than the preacher or orator . His showy talents are the very ones to make him popular , just as the gaudy colors of a picture are sure to attract the uneducated eye , which the cultivated taste as surely rejects . The few effective things he says can no more redeem E. H. Chapin. 55 his reputation as an orator , than the praiseworthy cha racteristics I have mentioned can make him a true preacher . You leave the house after listening to his discourses , thinking of the clever man , not of the absorbing theme ; you have seen a brilliant display of fireworks , perhaps , but the smell and the smoke remain , and the darkness of doubt is deeper than ever . /z/ The house is a respected house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be abolished ; the time-honored " gar den " must at last succumb before the march of trade ; the house so long respected in the memories of play goers is hereafter to be respected in memory alone . On the first of May , the theatre must give way to the hotel . I am sorry . Some of my pleasantest recollections of the play-house are connected with Niblo s , as must be those of every aboriginal New Yorker . Since Vauxhall and the Park theatre disappeared , this has been the oldest theatrical landmark on the west side of the town ; in fact , the only one that has lasted half a generation the only one with any savor of age about it , or any halo of association , was the first place of amusement I ever visited . I recollect as well as if it were but yester day how I sat in the parquet , in my plaid jacket and cap , and saw the green curtain , with the inexplicable tight rope coming down over the footlights and the heads of the musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra , and the impression of " some thing rich and strange " it made upon my baby ear ; indeed , I am not sure but that the recollection of the Niblo s. /z/ music was , for long , more vivid than the memory of the spectacle that came after . But oh ! the wonderful fairy-land into which I was let when the curtain was first lifted before my eyes . Would you believe it , t is fairy-land yet , often and often to me , when the curtain is lifted . I have spent more happy hours in a theatre than I ever did out of it . I have known as keen enjoyment gazing upon the fairy world that lies beyond that curtain , as I have ever known away from its influences . Oh ! when I think of the exquisite gratifications afforded me by the stage ; when I remem ber the domain of the imagination all made real , the fancies embodied , the poetry incarnated in a theatre ; when I recall the strains of delicious music , with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of thoughts , and passions , and feelings , and fancies that are its slaves as the genius was of Aladdin the rage of Norma and the witchery of Freischutz , the passion of Lucrezia and the intrigues of Seville ; when I remember , too , the wit of merry Beatrice and the jealousy of dun Othello , the sublime agony of the ancient Phedre and the wretchedness of our modern Camille , the lofty sorrow of Lord Hamlot and the awful horror of Macbeth all the mingled intellectual and sen sual delights that I have received from the stage can I ever forget my first night in a theatre ? That was the vestibule to the temple ; the initiation to a whole realm of enjoyment . Grisi s wondrous tones and Sontag s delicate grace ; Forrest s Metamora , Ra chel s Adrienne , Heron s Medea , Wallack s Don Caesar , Burton s Dogberry , young Booth s Richard , all these were ushered in by the delights of that evening . These , 8 The Vagabond. a splendid company , stood waiting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when once they had entered , to be welcome . visitants for ever . Little did the boy who clapped his tiny hands at Gabriel Ravel s feats , dream of the big crowd of after pleasures that were destined to follow on the heels of the tumbler . Little did those who took him to the play-house imagine that in all his youth and early manhood he could find no pleasures , either in study , or travel , or gayer life ( and all of these he tried ) , that should rival those of the theatre ; plea sures which study and travel and society fitted him the better to relish and appreciate : for indeed all books and all culture fit one the better to delight in the expression and illustration of the choicest literature ; in the render ing of the most exquisite poetry ; in the uttering of the greatest tragedies and comedies . All travel and all ex perience make one a fitter judge of the naturalness of acting , a better critic of those representations of life and passion , of those pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the varied situations of the stage . Do you wonder , then , that I look kindly back on Niblo s ; that the house is to me a respected house ; that I retain a distinct remembrance of the very play that was performed on that eventful night ; that I recall the children dancers who since then have grown into men and women ; that I like to summon up again the panto mime , and the clown , and the rope-dancing , and the balance-pole , and the glittering background , and the handsomely painted men and the bright-eyed women , and all the paraphernalia that dazzled my infant senses so that they have not yet recovered . There were fire- Niblo s. g works , too , in the garden : for there was a garden then ; and we went upon a piazza to look on , but these were not half so wonderful to me as the pageant within doors . I was ever more interested in humanity than in its sur roundings , although I confess the surroundings have an influence on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more susceptible to the influences of passion than to those of taste . I preferred the plot of the seri ous pantomime within to the brilliant wheels and rockets out-of-doors ; and to-day I like people better than shows , and a play better than a spectacle . After that night I was not soon let go again . I talked and dreamed of nothing but the theatre , and those who had charge of me were afraid I might get stage struck , I suppose , or crazy ; so I used to steal away at nightfall , arid stand by th e door of Niblo s to watch the people as they entered the wonderful palace of delights . I was so young that I dared not go in alone , but I formed an acquaintance with the doorkeeper , and told him that I once had been within the magic precincts . I assured him that when the Ravels returned I was to be taken thither again ; once in a season I might hope to pene trate the mysteries of Melpomene . I got a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I stood at the portals beyond which I might not pass ; and though I could scarcely have had the faintest idea of its beauties , I pored over the volume constantly at home , because it was a book of plays . There s another habit of which I am not yet cured . Afterwards came children s theatricals , and all the early experience of Wilhelm Meister ; only as soon as I was at all able to appreciate good acting , my delight in 60 The Vagabond. witnessing it was so great that I lost any desire to take part in the performance . I went occasionally to Niblo s till I was about thirteen , and then I ventured alone . My memories of the place since , are like those of other people , I suppose . Others , besides me , remem ber Alboni , and Sontag , and Mo watt , and Cushman : others remember the most delicious singer in the world as Orsini , on that night when Salvi and DeVries were in the cast of " Lucrezia Borgia , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus so superbly given at the end of the first act , that the house nearly rose . I don t believe it has ever been as well sung in New York since . Others , besides me , remember Sontag in " Don Pasquale , " as bewitching a Norina as Piccolomini was last week ; Steffanoni too , storming so splendidly in the " Favorita , " and Thillon , the fascinating vivandibre . Then , later , there have been Mrs. Mowatt , and Burton , and Miss Cushman ; Armand , and Mr. Toodles , and Lady Mac beth ; and the dancers , the finest ballet people we have ever had in New York ; the Sotos in their prime , the Roussets , and the Pougauds , and the Rollas . I had a little adventure of my own when Mrs. Mow att was at Niblo s . It was the last night of her stage life ; the house was crowded to its utmost capacity with a fashionable audience , many of them personal friends of the lovely woman whose history all New Yorkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society that claimed her for one of its brightest ornaments ere the world at large knew of her talents or her charms . The throng was so great that I could find no place but the passage-way in the dress-circle , and there I sat on the floor . A fine grey-headed old man was on the sofa Niblo s. 61 next to me , and opened the conversation : remarked the immense concourse , and said it reminded him of the Theatre Fran9ais in the days of Talma . From the crowd to the actress was a ready transition ; so we fell to discussing Mrs. Mowatt . I said she was charming and clever , and wondered if her graces were natural or acquired . My acquaintance insisted that they were natural ; in fact , he knew they were so . Then I won dered if this were really her last appearance , and sur mised that she would soon return to the stage . " No , " said my friend , " she will be married in a month . " I knew of that before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not agree about the date , and the fine old grey-headed gentleman thought he ought to know best , since " he was her father . " Of course I admitted the probability of his being correctly informed , and apologized for the freedom of my criticisms ; he declared , however , that they had not been offensive , and even if they had proved unfavorable , that I was not to blame . But I could not remember having been very censorious , and we chatted away all the evening . I applauded very vigorously , as you may guess , and I remember going out to buy a bouquet . I was to be taken to the wedding , and thought I might as well secure a gracious recep tion . I went to the wedding along with two thousand other people , on a fine day in June , shortly after , and I was not the only one there who remembered Niblo s . But the time would fail me to recall all my adventures at Niblo s . There I first went behind the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beaux were flirting in the green-room and over the trap-doors wl ere Mazulme , the night-owl , was wont to descend ; 62 The Vagabond. benediction was repeated by the Chancellor right under the pulley that let down Pougaud ; and the college dons sat erect and precise on the very spot where Soto s pas was most enchanting . There , too , I have been with sweethearts innumerable ; I flirted only a week ago with half-a-dozen different pretty girls at a Philharmonic rehearsal , when I ought to have been listening to Schu mann or Schubert ; and I went one morning last week with a crowd of children to see the circus performances . I held a baby on my lap while Jack the Giant Killer pei-fornied his feats in the ring , and I had an adventure meanwhile quite as funny as the one with Mrs. Mowatt s father . This time I sat next a plain little woman not thirty years old , who , as I was reading the programme aloud to my charges , said to me proudly , " My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , our conversation became animated ; my friend gave me abundant information regarding the horses and their riders ; furnished me material enough to write a biography of Dan Rice and his horse , Excelsior ; told how much salary each gets a Aveek , and who was to play the giantess . When the tumblers came on she pointed out her husband , a tall , lank , sprightly fellow , and assured me he was all muscle and bone , every inch of him ; and to be sure he did deeds of dreadful note ; and as the giant appeared in the concluding spectacle , with a head bigger than a barrel , she exclaimed : " Now who d think that was my John ? I vow I wouldn t have knowed him ! " But , alas ! all these days and nights at Niblo s are drawing to a close ; no more operas nor pantomimes ; no flirting behind the scenes nor in front ; no philhar- Niblo s. 63 monic rehearsals nor circus matinees ; no adventures with fashionable men or unfashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives of mus cular gymnasts ; the fashion of this world passeth away . /z/ " Painting is Welcome . " Timon of Athens . FRANCE is the fulcrum that Archimedes wanted : he who rests his lever there can move the world . For Paris sets the fashion in revolutions as well as in dress , stamps the reputation of a singer , or lights the torch that puts Europe in a blaze . French ideas are at the basis of all that is distinctive in modern civilization , in our philoso phy , our art , and our life . Even England , prejudiced , sel fish , introspective , is influenced by her lively , magnetic neighbor , and Punch acknowledges that Mr. Bull has to take his time from Napoleon , while the rest of trans-At lantic Christendom openly follows in the wake of France . We , on this side of the ocean , are apt to think ourselves our own exemplar ; but lookers-on tell hoAV much New York is like a second Paris ; how the life in public the cafes , the showy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boulevards than of the Strand . And to go back to history , the truest democrats of 76 were men imbued with the spirit and notions of French philosophers . Many of the founders of this Union were indeed far from anticipating , or even desiring , the result which we witness . They preferred and worked to accomplish a sober , aristocratic form of government , French Art in New York . 65 where people of family and condition should quietly assume the lead . But Jefferson established another school ; a school which has completely and wonderfully triumphed , whose doctrines are now almost universally received ; and those doctrines were learned at the feet of French Gamaliels . Voltaire and Rousseau first pro claimed the ideas from which has sprung our modern American republic . Not only in philosophy , however , is that wonderful people in advance of the world ; her civilization is the completest , her art the most carefully studied of our day . It is that art , in those of its manifestations which have been presented to the metropolis of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficiently familiar to us . Unfortunately , its more unpleasant phases are most conspicuous ; still , the best authors of modern France are widely read and thoroughly appre ciated by cultivated Americans . We have also had opportunities of witnessing the culminating glories of the French theatre . We have seen Rachel , the incar nation of French art , we have studied the classic and romantic dramas as represented by their common queen ; but it is neither the influence and character of the French stage , nor of French literature , but of French paintings , upon which I propose now to remark . Fine paintings , master-pieces indeed of art , by great Frenchmen , have been at various times exhibited in New York . The productions of Horace Vernet , of Scheffer , and of De la Roche , have been submitted to our consi deration . They obtained the notice of those who loved pictures , and were variously criticised in the journals of the day . I know not , however , that they have been 66 The Vagabond. contemplated as indices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet the French mind is so alive to the influences of art , manifests itself so frequently through this medium , acknowledges the productions of art as fair illustrations of the national or individual character , that it seems fitting we should thus consider the specimens which have been in America . True , the American mind is , in the mass , as yet too ma terial to submit to be judged in a similar manner . The artistic development of our character is not yet sufficient for us to consent that it should be taken as a type of ourselves ; but we can at least consider others under forms Avhich we have not assumed . It is fair to the French to contemplate them under this aspect . The recent death of De la Roche of course recalls the productions of that master , three of whose greatest efforts are familiar to lovers and students of art in our midst . These are his " Napoleon Crossing the Alps , " which is still in New York ; his " Hemicycle of the Palace of Fine Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than any of his other works , " Marie An toinette before the Revolutionary Tribunal . " The pic tures of his father-in-law , the great Vernet , are not unknown to us . Mr. Bryan has in his gallery a little work of Vernet s , entitled " Napoleon before the Battle of Waterloo ; " and the Messrs . Goupil exhibited , not a great while ago , a brilliant picture of his , " The Breth ren of Joseph . Of Scheffer s works it is only neces sary to mention the " Dante and Beatrice , " " The Temptation , " " The Dead Christ , " and the prints of " Christus Consolator " and " Remunerator . " These three great masters are sufficiently individualized , and at the French Art in New York . 67 same time sufficiently marked in their nationality , to re present not unworthily three important phases of French art . I have no scruple in reckoning Scheffer among French artists ; for though by birth a Belgian , his stu dies and tastes are essentially French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his contemporaries . Some years ago the French seemed to have passed the era when genius culminates . The critical epoch had arrived with them ; the six days of creation were over , and the Sabbath of rest was begun . They were occupied in perfecting their taste , in elaborating their skill , in polishing their marble , and carving their stone : they no longer cut out Apollos , or built Notre Dames . The classic taste of Racine , and the Alexandrines of Corneille , reigned supreme on their stage . Even in enunciating truths and doctrines of the most astound ing import to mankind , the Des Cartes and Voltaires stopped to polish their epigrams and chasten their style . But the whirlwind of the revolution has evoked other ge niuses . On the stage , the romantic school now contends with the classic ; in literature , the burning eloquence of Madame Dudevant , and the intensity of modern fiction , have supplanted the calm wit and delicate satire of La Bruyere and De Sevigne . Something of the same sort may be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ary Scjieffer s studied attitudes and elaborate grace , his coldness and sentimentality , are counterparts of the ancient regime ; the gay brilliancy and theatrical exaggeration of Vernet ally him to the present century as well as to the past ; but the profound significance , the intense feeling , the passionate expression of De la Roche , make him the exponent of revolutionary Fance. 68 The Vagabond I confess these things do not speak so plainly from the canvas as from the printed page or from the theatre . The national mind of France has not been particularly directed to painting . No such outburst of intellect and genius is there apparent as in the Italian school , or the Flemish even , as in the statues of Greece , or the archi tecture of the middle ages . Still , he who looks close may find a meaning even in the comparatively meaning less pictures of France . Scheifer I can not admire . His tameness and his ele gance according to rule , remind me of Watteau and the three unities of Racine . Not all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some com positions , and the religious calm of others , compensate for the frigid , stilted air which pervades them all for the absence of deep feeling , for the lack of inspiration , which I remark in all his works . In the mild , insipid countenance of the Christ of " The Temptation , " for instance , or the very unimpassioned Dante of his more famous work , I can discover no trace of genius . Care fully cultivated talent , correct taste , real learning , but no feeling , no soul , no genius . He is , I think , the type of the worst phase of French art . A dead Christ , in deed , he paints ; but let him attempt no living one . No light burns in the eyes of his faces , and no life ani mates his figures . A chill strikes you on looking at them , like that you feel on entering a vault . He is the Delia Cruscan painter of France the Pope , or rather the Cowley , of French art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pencil of genius are worth a Louvre full of Schefier s paintings . Vernet s best works have never been in America ; but French Art in New York . 69 a tolerable estimate of his ability can be formed from those which have . He holds a middle place between the cold statue of Scheffer and the inspired man of De la Roche . He paints out-door life , the sun of the tropics , the sands of Africa , the gay colors and fiery chargers of war ; the armies of Napoleon , but not Na poleon himself ; the smoke and the carnage of battle , but not its poetry ; the Arabs of the desert , but no indi vidual man . A confirmed realist , a Dumas in painting , brilliant , gorgeous , truthful in outsides , but never pene trating beneath them ; excellent as far as he goes , hav ing a mission , and doing it well ; having a talent , and not hiding it in a napkin ; singing his song , painting his picture , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grasshopper does upon that of the nightingale than the faun half divine , can be said to assume the thunderbolts of Jupiter . Paul de la Roche is the greatest of all French paint ers . He only , or he best seems penetrated with the spirit of the wonderful age in which we live . He feels all its actuality and all its ideality , for it indeed combines the two ; intensely material , but finding more poetry in matter than ever was dreamed of in spirit . De la Roche loves outward nature , appreciates beauty of form and figure , but knows that the highest beauty of face is that of the soul limned in feature . His pictures are learned in art , are studies in drawing and color , have beauties enough for the eye of the connoisseur ; but more than all this , they speak to the heart of the man . The face of his Napoleon , full of genius , of character , of life ; the compression into eye and mouth of such a woi ld of meaning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Vagabond . Look into that face , and see Marengo and Egypt , empire and destiny . Then , for an example of touch ing tenderness , of queenly dignity , and womanly forti tude , the countenance of his Marie Antoinette is almost unparalleled . Tears start unbidden to one s eyes upon looking at this great picture . The hair , blanched by sorrow , the heavy eyelids , the proud , yet quivering mouth , and the form stately in misfortune all these are inimitable . His selection of subjects , as well as their handling , , proves the master s mind susceptible , shows the reflex of events , the influence of the age . In his works are imaged the wild republican fury and the love of military glory , the two passions which distract France . Here is mirrored the unrest that throbs in George Sand , and is uttered by Meyerbeer and Victor Hugo . Here is the truest exposition on canvas of the Marseillaise , as Rachel sang it during the days of February . Here we find another voice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shaken Europe again and again to its centre ; that volcano of thought and feeling which ever and anon belches out yet another eruption to overwhelm more than another Pompeii . De la Roche is modern France . /z/ " I can t acquit by wholesale , nor condemn . " CHURCHILL S Rosciad . Roscius had a defect in his eye , and Churchill found fault with Garrick ; but Cicero studied oratory with Roscius for all his squint , and Churchill finished hig lines by declaring : " Hence to thy praises , Garrick , I agree , And pleased with Nature , must be pleased with thee . " Mr. Forrest may or may not be a Roscius or a Gar rick ; we , who see him , can know of the others only by tradition ; but we do know that the great masters and models of the stage were not without faults and fault finders ; so we need not be surprised if there be those who refuse any praise to one of the first tragedians of our day , nor even if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forrest one of the first tragedians of our day . I know it is the fashion to decry him ; I know that his audiences , though large , are not generally com posed of cultivated people ; but they are sometimes as good judges of acting as the scholars and thinkers who affect to despise them . No acting is great which does 72 The Vagabond. not please more than a class . That which is addressed to , and intended solely for a few , lacks the truest con stituent of greatness , universality . Any work of literature or art , of poetry or oratory , as well as the drama , must , to produce the finest effect , appeal to the passions , or the feelings as well as the taste ; and passion brings men to a common level . The profoundest scholar , the most accomplished man of the world , loves and hates , fears and exults , just as the Bowery boy , or the plebeian of old Rome . When passion arrives at a climax , its manifestation is pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery are as good critics of the great points in a performance as the wits and blues of the boxes . Because then , Mr. Forrest has triumphed only or mostly over audiences not " in society , " he has triumphed none the less triumphantly . Neither is he altogether limited in this regard . Many a straggler from the high places of fashion finds his way into the Broadway ; and here and there you will meet an admirer of his , willing to do battle in a good cause , though against fearful odds . The fair sex espe cially would be glad to return to their allegiance ; for the time has been when it was the fashion to admire For rest ; when it was in good taste to take seats for his bene fit , and highly respectable to applaud him in Metamora , or to cry over his Damon . The present rage for staying away came in , as everybody knows , when Macready went out . Mr. Forrest offended the fashionable world , and it has pouted ever since . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary world , which has never forgiven him . But these quarrels don t affect his acting . His merits are as conspicuous now as before Edwin Forrest . 73 the Astor-Place riots , and his faults are no more glaring than when up-town crowded to see him as eagerly as down-town does now . Nobody disliked some points in Mr. Forrest s conduct more than the Vagabond , but I can do justice to his great talents for all that . In fact , I can not altogether debar myself the pleasure of witness ing his personations . What especially I find to admire in Mr. Forrest is his power to move me . He has great faults ; he rants un doubtedly ; he roars and bellows at times in the most unpleasant manner ; he conceives some parts very differ ently from my idea of them ; and I never see him with out disapproving of many things that he does . But I never see him without confessing his ability . He pos sesses the true dramatic talent the power to make you weep and shudder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is mindful of the old Roman s maxim : " Si vis me flere , dolendum est Primum tibi . " He is for awhile Damon , or Cade , or Spartacus . He forgets himself , and you forget him too . His humanity excites your sympathy , his passion strikes an answering chord in your breast , he moves you . Others may give a picture more critically exact , may read with more of the elocutionist s skill , may even dis sect a part with a truer philosophy ; but few will grasp more certainly the prominent features of a character , or give them half the expression , half the earnestness , the likeness , the reality that he does . I was particularly struck with this of late . Hamlet /z/ 74 The Vagabond. has been played by several fine actors within a ftw months . It is especially an intellectual role one which they say Mr. Forrest has no conception of , which he is utterly unfit for , and unable to render . I saw Mr. Wallack , Mr. Davenport and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Mr. Wallack was a rhetorician , an actor . He read beautifully , he threw himself into graceful attitudes , he convinced you that he was an accomplished scholar and a gentleman ; but henever evoked one spark of sympathy with the great crea tion of Shakspeare , he never let you forget Mr. Wallack , he never identified himself with the part . Mr. Daven port played in a gentlemanly , quiet style , with much less elegance than Wallack , and much more feeling . I regard his performance as decidedly the superior of the two . It showed deeper thought , it was less stagey and tricky , more manly and natural ; but still it was tame , and at times uninteresting . It never once excited any real emotion in the audience ; it never made us feel . Mr. Forrest s personation , however , was full of life and spirit . It may not have answered exactly the idea of an intellectual man ; it may not have been suffi sufficiently refined , sufficiently subtile , sufficiently elaborate ; but I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ness his interview with the ghost , without terror , or listen unmoved to his appeals to a guilty mother . I could not watch him during the intense interest of the mimic play , and finally observe his terrific joy at the climax , without confessing his genius . In what is universal , human , sympathetic , Mr. Forrest excels . His art is not equal to that of some ; but all the art in the world could not produce the effect of his wild Edwin Forrest . 75 rush upon the stage , panting , eager , full of rage , in the last scene of Damon . Your carefully-modelled men , your elocutionists and rhetoricians , could never rival his few simple touches of pathos in Metamora , at the death of his child . One or two words suffice to set a whole house in tears . This reminds me that Mr. Forrest is really and truly greatest in his quieter acting . The horror of his death scenes , the physical contortions which excite so much dis gust , display only a curious talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rant in which lie frequently indulges , especially in declamatory roles , is overdone and fails of its effect ; but his play in some ten der scene , some little bit of domestic fondling , some gen tle adieu to a friend , has frequently unmanned many a stern admirer . It is common , I know , to say that Mr. Forrest can not do such things well , that he can not play tenderly ; but I think this a mistake . Who that recol lects the parting with his wife in " Damon and Pythias , " or the family scene in the " Gladiator , " but will admit his possession of this excellence . His tones , too , when restrained , affect me more than in the very whirlwind of passion . They seem then brimful of pent-up feeling , which is always more awful than these gusts of unrestrained rage . Some hurried sentence , some half-suppressed exclamation , has often times more meaning than a world of violence . A quiet tone may speak volumes , when tearing the passion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comes not near their hearts . Mr. Forrest s physical qualifications are peculiar . His form is massive and well-developed ; though almost 76 The Vagabond. gigantic , its proportions are preserved . His appearance is always imposing , and has frequently a barbaric ma jesty , suitable to the parts he most often plays . A cer tain dignity of demeanor is generally maintained , though it must be remarked that this is utterly lost in the fiercest fits of Jack Cade and Metamora . His face is eminently expressive of the harsher emotions , and can certainly assume the most horrid aspect of any human countenance I ever gazed upon . He apparently possesses the power of foaming at the mouth , can swell the veins and muscles of his head and neck at will , call the blood to his temples , perspire , laugh , cry , just as he lists . His face can also at times express a vast deal of rough tenderness , all the more touching from the sterner guise it generally wears . His voice is tremendous in power , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavernous and guttural or subter-guttural bass , but contains no shrill or tenor notes in its register . Still , he can modulate it with skill and effect . It is at times terrible , and at times touching . His growls rival those of the hyena in hideousness , and resemble them in roughness ; his bursts of passion never fail for lack of force , and are often inexpressibly fine . He can give vent to all the sterner emotions without words . Of inarticulate sounds he has a whole vocabulary at his command ; one , too , under stood by all . He has studied , too ; but rather the execution than the conception of his parts . He is not an intellectual player ; he is rough , he is coarse , but withal he is great , he is human . Shall we , then , because of his faults , debar ourselves from witnessing his excellences ? Says Horace : Edwin Forrest . 77 " Ille poeta qui pectus inanitus angit , Irritat , mulcet , falsis terroribus implet . " According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real inspiration of genius that rarest of gifts . Any of us can acquire scholarship : genius never is ac quired . A Wallack is the product of the schools : a Forrest is never made . But he is adopted by the mil lion ; he is the pet of the masses ; and those who belong to the ten thousand will not admire him . " So much they scorn the crowd , that if the throng By chance go right , they purposely go wrong . " /z/ " Nightly she sings . " Romeo and Juliet , LA GRANGE is an artist in the best sense of the word ; she ib devoted to her art . None of the lyric queens who at different times have visited America ever equalled her in this respect . Her own fame , and what to a woman is more , her own appearance , are always made secondary to the interests of music . Thus , she often sings a part manifestly and utterly unsuited to her ability , because , if she refused , the opera could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Spin , " where her person is entirely disguised , and sacrifices her looks in " Le Prophete , " so that the most ardent admirer can not extol her charms . Thus , for the sake of a new composer , or a new artist , she is always ready to be come less prominent before the public . True , her gauge has been taken , her name is mad# , her position is ascertained and appreciated ; she can lose nothing in reality by this obliging spirit ; but , nevertheless , prima donnas are notoriously the most capricious and exacting , the vainest of God s creatures ; and when one of this most petted and most spoiled class possesses some of the worthiest and noblest attributes of woman , and manifests them in her art , it is a wonder worth chronicling . La Grange . 79 This utter abnegation of self is rare among any , among all artists . Heart-burnings and squabbles are common in schools of painting and in cliques of littera teurs , and disgrace people of talent all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have AVC , New Yorkers , not had sad experience of their trifling vani ties and ridiculous rivalries ? Does not the cause of music languish because of the soprano s Avhims and the contralto s spite ? because the tenor quarrels with the bass , and the orchestra is not of the same politics with the chorus ? All honor , then , to La Grange , who is ab solutely religious in her devotion to art ! I really con sider the dedication of all her faculties and time to this one purpose as approaching the heroic . She has done raore to elevate art and its consideration among Ameri cans , than any artist who has ever visited us . She has shown us that it may be made the object of a lifetime ; that its professors may be pure , and lovely , and of good report ; that they may be people of education , and taste , and breeding . She exemplifies the refining and exalting influence that the prosecution of such studies should have . She makes us recognise the legitimate object and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lief of great European writers and thinkers , who ascribe to art an influence over life , a real and tangible influence , extending beyond emotions to purposes and deeds . But apart from the general character of this fine artist , she has individual and particular traits to be discussed . And first of all is her earnestness ; a faculty of throwing all her energies into the work in hand . Whether she sings in " Guillaume Tell " an en tirely secondary part , or in " Norina , " where nearly the 8o The Vagabond. whole opera falls to her share , t is all the same . Whether she is subordinate to the composer , or assists at the debut of a second-rate contralto or a spunky tenor , she shows the same alacrity to aid another , the same anxiety to do well whatsoever her hands find to do . Her talent is manifest , however , in this : others might be as desirous as she to do well , and yet not succeed . Now it is im possible to hear La Grange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliancy of Rossini , the magnificent pathos of Meyerbeer , and the eternal fresh ness of Mozart , are all delightfully rendered . To be sure , she , as every one else , has her specialties . There are different degrees of success meted out to her in dif ferent rdles . Her Lucia is admirable , but her Norma to me is painful ; however , she always does her best , and al ways aifords some pleasure . Versatility is a remarkable peculiarity of her talent . I have heard her in every opera she has sung in America , from the " Barber of Seville , " at Niblo s , where she first exhibited her mar vellous powers of vocalization to an American audi ence , to the " Trovatore " of last week , in which she has performed perhaps forty times at the Academy . No thing could possibly be greater than the difference in style and method between Verdi and Rossini , between " II Barbiere " and " II Trovatore " the one elaborate and finished , exquisite in ornament and delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate . Rosina is arch and captivating , Leonora always sad and splen did ; yet I know not in which La Grange excels . In the one , her great dramatic talent is displayed ; in the other , her marvellous execution ; in both , her fidelity to the spirit of the composer . La Grange . 81 This leads me to speak of her great powers of inter pretation . It is these which make her more than a vo calist , which elevate her to the rank of a great lyric artist . Music , and especially opera , is more than sweet sounds ; it is the expression of the subtlest and loftiest sentiment , the rendering of the profoundest and intensest passion . More completely than painting or even poetry , does it catch and cage the most refined emotions of the human soul : it gives an utterance to the inner most yearnings of our nature , and wreaks upon expres sion the most terrific outbursts of feeling of which we are capable . It is one thing to sing mechanically the notes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand and appreciate , to embody the meaning of a great soul like Beethoven or Mozart ; it needs a sympathizing greatness in the artist to translate Meyerbeer . One must seize the thought of the master , one must feel it in all its depth and force , before he can interpret it to the hearer . This La Grange does . Other great singers have the passion that makes them feel Italian music , but are capable of nothing more or else . La Grange is not of an enthusiastic nature , and for that reason does not sing Norma or Lucrezia as Grisi did , but she makes music , such as the composer intended ; she interprets the feeling or the thought that prompted every note ; so her greatness is really more apparent in an opera that contains more than passion . New Yorkers like only music that expresses passion . The stormy interest of Verdi , the dramatic splendor of Donizetti , and . the tender sweetness of Bellini , only are appreci ated . But though these are great , they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm 82 The Vagabond. of Mozart , and the splendid science of Meyerbeer are equally worthy of study . And all these La Grange expresses worthily . I think her essentially French in feeling and in her art . She frequently reminds me of Rachel , and in many things is not unworthy of a comparison with that magnificent and marvellous artist . Neither has one of those passionate , impulsive natures like Ristori or Siddons , who feel their parts so intensely . Mrs. Siddons was said to sob for an hour after playing one of her great characters , and Talma had to be wrapped in a cloak and carried from the theatre . Rachel and La Grange are never carried away by a divine enthusiasm , never forget themselves , always know what they are about and do it . Nobody admires Rachel more than I ; none was more alive to the beauties of her acting , more keenly susceptible to its effects . I have shud dered at the death scene of Adrienne , and been unwil ling to speak for an hour after witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauline , and the " Jaime / " of Phedre still rings in my ears ; and yet I think Rachel has no genius . It was talent as marvellous as any genius ; it was art such as I believe the world never saw before ; but it was art . So is it in some degree with La Grange . She has not attained ( who but Rachel can attain ? ) that prodigious power of representing passion . She gives an entire character admirably ; better than the passionate Steffanones and Parodis ; but when the intense moment comes , she lacks the elan . Her Norma and her Lucrezia never move me ; I admire only . Her Semiramide makes me regret Grisi . Only twice have I known her seem La Grange . 83 inspired : in the last act of " Ernani , " when she snatches the dagger from the hand of Gomez , and cries out in an agony of terror ; and in the coronation scene of " Le Prophete " her entire acting and singing are electric . But her Norma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous , but apparent ; the effect is wonderful with her means , but the means are inadequate ; she is physically incapable of doing or looking the part . So in " Semiramide . " She sings the floi id music incompara bly , but the grand scenes are unequal ; you feel that it is acting ; you remember the royal dignity and mag nificent horror of Grisi , and La Grange is tame by com parison . Again , I say , in the general and complete representation of character , La Grange is fine , is great ; but at the tremendous moments of the grandest parts she fails . From this remark must ever be excepted her Fides . The part I regard as equal in grandeur of con ception to any on the lyric stage ; and La Grange s rendering is quite equal to the composer s idea . The intensity here is , however , of another sort from that of " Norma " or " La Favorita . " Yet one scene equals anything in those operas , and the music of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don t wonder that Meyer beer would not allow the opera to be performed until La Grange could be engaged to sing it . I was at the Academy last winter , with some friends who cared not for music , and ridiculed my rhapsodies . They laughed and talked through half the opera ; but the first notes of the " Ah , monfils hushed them , and when I turned round at its chpse , they were in tears . It is time , however , for me to speak more particularly of her singing . This has been so often and so admira- 84 The Vagabond. bly discussed that the attempt will be almost a work of supererogation in me . Nature has not gifted her so lavishly as she has many of the great queens of song ; La Grange has no wonderful sweetness of voice , no mar vellous volume , and I have even fancied that she some times sang sharp . Neither is her voice at all sympathetic . It is , however , flexible in an extraordinary degree , and for compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very delicate quality , somewhat worn , but clear as a bird s . For cultivation , it is unequalled in the world ; certainly no artist living can compete with La Grange in execution . Her facility in the performance of musical difficulties is little less than miraculous , and stamps her unrivalled . Several songs , written expressly for her , would puzzle any prima donna in Europe even Bosio or Cruvelli , probably the most finished singers liv ing , after La Grange . Thus the same qualities are appa rent in her vocalism as in her acting ; the same perfection of manner and method , the same scrupulous attention to minutiae , the same exquisite taste , the same feeling for her art . It seems almost superfluous to speak of La Grange s taste in dressing , which is at once correct , scrupulous , and superb ; witness Linda , Fides , and Lucia . Her manners are those of a refined gentlewoman .

No artist was ever more beloved , none ever earned her laurels more fairly , or wore them more gracefully . /z/ " The play s the thing . " Hamlet , " LEONORE , or the World s Own ; " is a tragedy in five acts , by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe , of which the plot is as follows : An Italian peasant girl , guiltily in love with a stranger nobleman , is deserted by him , but follows and finds him with his wife and child ; she is repulsed cruelly and coarsely , and devotes her life to revenge . To accomplish this , she becomes the mistress of her sovereign , plots and obtains her lover s ruin , and finally , glutted with vengeance , is overcome with remorse , and kills herself . This production has been the target of much bitter criticism and unmerited censure . It has been called immoral in tendency , unnatural and improbable in plot and incident , monstrous in character , and utterly unin teresting . Yet it is the fruit of long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous to its performance to some of the best cultured intellects of the country , and to some of those best calculated to judge of , its fitness for the stage . It is to be presumed that the objections which are now alleged against it , if they have any foundation , were at least considered before it was presented to the public . " The World s Own " is pronounced by some immoral , 86 The Vagabond. because its story is one of seduction , because the heroine is a murderess and the mistress of a prince . But if the wrongs of woman and her revenge are to be excluded from the drama , a new canon of criticism must be invented to accomplish it . The same strictures can be applied to the masterpieces of literature in every age and country . Lady Macbeth is a hideous portraiture in some respects , and quite as unnatural in her wickedness as Leonore ; Cleopatra is as voluptu ous , Beatrice di Cenci as revengeful as Mrs. Howe s heroine . The great tragedies of antiquity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathies of the learned , turn on plots as objectionable as this of " The World s Own : " represent passions quite as fierce and implacable . What is the theme of " Phaedra , " of the " Medea , " either of Euripides or of Seneca ; or inmodei-n literature , of the " Myrrha " of Alfieri , the " Andromaque " of Racine , or the " Angelo " of Victor Hugo , but the story of spurned and in jured women , of infuriated , erring , exceptional beings ? The greatest poems and plays in every literature must be tabooed , if dramatists are debarred from selecting topics that treat of crime . Besides , the tragic stage only aims at representing passion ; it does not hold up its portraitures as worthy of imitation . Mrs. Howe does not offer Leonore as a model for the women who witness her play ; she gives a superb creation ; a truthful representation of the fury of an Italian woman , no more immoral than a picture of the Crucifixion is immoral because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Paradise Lost . " As to naturnlness and improbability , if Mrs. Howe The World s Own . 87 sins here , she sins again in good company . The same names already mentioned might be adduced again in her support ; the poets who invented the horrid stories that have always been favorites on both the ancient and modern stage , that are the staple of the classic and the romantic drama , are in the same category . Is " The World s Own " more improbable than " Lear , " or more unnatural than " Othello ? " Will it compare in these re spects with the " Wallenstein " of Schiller , or the " Re morse " of Coleridge , with the heaped up impossibilities of the Elizabethan dramatists , or the inventions of Scribe in the modern French theatre ? Yet all these works are pronounced admirable in their degree ; many of them , and those the most unlike ordinary life , not only retain possession of the stage , but invariably attract crowded audiences . The truth is , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tragedy that ever was written . Is it supposed that men now for the first time weep or shudder over intense scenes or harrowing pages ? The crow r ds that filled the Grecian amphithea tre when the dramas of JEschylus were performed , were quite as eager as those that throng Wallack s boxes and parquet . Children died of fright , women miscarried , and whole audiences were subdued at the representation of Clytemnestra and Orestes sensationcharacters , which doubtless were decried in the circles of Athens as too intense , as unnatural and immoral . If the portraiture of passion is immoral ; if the dis play of its effects is improper ; if the selection of events Mich as history is filled with ; if the development of characters like Lucretia Borgia , like Catharine de Medicis or Semiramis , is unnatural ; if the working- 88 The Vagabond. out of a plot as truthful as the stories of Messalina , of Charlotte Corday , of Catharine of Russia , of Olyinpe de Gourges , of Mrs. Cunningham , of Polly Bodine , in improbable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improbable , is unnatural , is immoral . But censure that applies to Mrs. Howe must reach the drama itself ; if she is wrong , the stage is wrong ; human nature is untrue to itself ; its tastes have never been correct ; genius has always been distorted ; plays have always been written to pander to a vicious tendency ; the inclination implanted by the Creator in us all to delight in the theatre is also wrong ; the poets , the artists , the dramatists of all ages and countries have erred in por traying highly wrought scenes ; the whole race that has admired their productions is to be blamed . Faults the play has , like all human productions ; unity is lacking , incidents are intruded which certaiftly might have been omitted , characters come and go that at least delay the development of the plot . Some of the ideas , especially towards the conclusion , are not new , or fine ; the gipsy , the secret tribunal , and the child stealing , though they furnish occasions for much good writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but how many such faults may be found even in the dra mas of him who might have blotted a thousand lines with justice , and yet whom we would not wish to have blotted one . The action of every one of Shakspeare s plays is obstructed by scenes and characters that no one would be willing to lose . How does Mercutio assist in the development of " Romeo and Juliet ? " How does the advice to the players in " Hamlet contribute to the discovery of Gertrude s t guilt ? If " The World s Own " The World s Own . 89 is to be judged by the rules of the French stage , every thing to be eliminated that does not manifestly aid the progress of the piece , there are portions which need emendation . And I confess I like the French doctrine when applied to new writers . Those who have now to make our plays may as well conform to these rules ; may as well introduce no extraneous matter for representa tion at least . What is suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often absolutely unwel come on the stage . In this light , then , the " The World s Own " lacks the requisite unity in the concluding part . But there are other matters worthy of commendation : the situations are some of them surpassingly fine ; the meeting of Leonore with her betrayer and his wife and child is admirably managed , is most effective on the stage , and gives occasion for some nervous writing . The jeering of the peasant companions is also fine , and reminds me of the railing at Gretchen , in " Faust ; " yet is not sufficiently like to suggest the charge of plagiarism . The scene between Leonore and the prince is masterly both in conception and treatment ; and though we may deny the merit of naturalness to the masked interview , it is impossible not to acknowledge its effectiveness in a dramatic light . In characters strongly marked and interesting , the new play is deficient . Lothair is common-place ; Ed ward almost insipid ; the wife not sufficiently prominent to awaken much feeling , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the malignant little peasant in the second act . But there is character enough in Leo nore herself ; and I am not so sure but that it is better thus to concentrate the interest in one , than to scatter QO The Vagabond. it upon a dozen . Certainly when we are to have a woman of surpassing genius to play the heroine , I pre fer to be absorbed in her . Leonore is a great creation : it is original , it is slowly developed , assumes many phases , but under each retains the distinctive features the Italian passion , whether manifested in love or hate , the intensity whether of remorse or anxiety , the same fierce soul beaming out in the raptures of the first act , or the sardonic exultation of the fourth . I regard the character of Leonore a triumph , and as such sufficient alone to stamp the play . The delicious lover of the opening scenes ; the startled girl waking from her dream to the realities of desertion and igno miny , the woman eager as Evangeline after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurned ; the terrific portraiture of the prince s mistress , and the proud Ate-like creature of the close , the very goddess of evil , fallen yet unmoved , till recollections of early purity are evoked , and then the stormy remorseful woman surely these constitute a great character , a great work of art . The language is throughout the play exquisitely felici tous ; the rhythm melodic and constantly preserved ; the images charming , and sometimes spirited ; the dialogue flows easily . The diction is not , however , except in the language of Leonore , individualized or characteristic : it is everywhere the poet s , not Helen s , or Lothair s , or Ed ward s , and only occasionally does it rise to nervous ness ; only here and there is the real language of passion employed , that terse intensity used in real life when the feelings are excited . The use of imagery in passionate scenes is too profuse ; for instance , in the last act , there is some charming poetry entirely misplaced ; no Leo- The World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would stop to utter those exquisite thoughts . Feeling , too , is often de scribed when it should be expressed ; still , this common est of faults in dramatic writers is rare in " The World s Own " by comparison with others . Although , then , I see more blemishes in the language ( but only in its lack of fitness , not in the language itself ) than in any other feature of the piece , the author is still far beyond most playwrights in this very respect . Frequently the words are full of emotion . . When Lamartine was a young and eager poet , he took a play to Talma , who considered it carefully and thoughtfully , and finally exclaimed : " Wriiing for the stage may be either tragedy , poetry , or the drama Corneille , Racine , Shakspeare ; but the drama bears the palm ; the drama is natural , the others artistic . I have become what I am by following nature rather than art , by studying Shakspeare rather than the French writers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an epitome of criticism . Tragedy is the stilted style- in which the ancients delighted , which is indeed awful , impressive , and sublime ; which even contains a fire and spirit , that occasionally startle us , as in the " Cid " of Corneille or the " Hippolytus Stephanophorus " of Euripides . Poetry ( for the stage ) is the ex quisite description of events , combined with ornaments of figure and language , with the music of words , and the delicate graces of thought : like the flow of Racine , or the fancy of Addison , but cold and unimpassioned for all its beauty . The Shakspearean , romantic drama , alone represents life , nature , humanity . This speaks right home to every heart ; this is what we imperiously 92 The Vagabond. demand upon the stage . All else is impertinent , and in effective by comparison . Poetry has no business in the theatre at all ; it is meant " for the closet , for reading , not for acting . The true classic tragedy is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage ; but it needs superlative histrionic genius to make it en durable ; and even then , in absolute power it must yield to the drama , of which , of course , Shakspeare is king unapproachable and alone . Still , others may attempt what only he could achieve ; they may wander round the sides of that Parnassus on whose summit he sits serene . Applying this test to " The World s Own , " it must be pronounced unequal ; with striking beauties it also has striking faults ; it can not be reckoned a complete drama , because of its great lack of unity , and the infusion , or intrusion rather , of poetic sentiment ; and yet it is much more than a poem . Its passion , its one great cha racter , its dramatic situations give it a claim to another title . In the closet it will bear closer study ; you will there be willing to spare no splendid sentiment or ex pression .

Newport is as musical as the Fifth avenue : Catholic priests and Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those in the innermost pene tralia of society are afflicted by the same vertigo which whirls still faster the circles of the outside courts . So long ago as when the Astor Place opera-house was flourishing , young ladies were sent to convents because they would fall in love with tenors , and Mr. Willis had to exclude artists from society . ( Vide Home Journal , de Maretzek . ) In the course of tune , the Academy was opened , and after Grisi and Mario had gone home disappointed , and Mirate unappreciated , Brignoli , who sings through his nose , took the town by storm . He and his fat friend , who needed not Patania to caricature him , were invited everywhere . First , they sang at private parties with young ladies who had good voices , and the young ladies of course went to the opera on benefit nights . So Amodio and Brignoli were The Amateurs. 95 the rage . All sorts of funny and piquant stories were current about their triumphs and escapades . If Amodio entered a room , everybody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a lady say to her daughter , when the tenor was presented : " Rise , my dear , t is Mr. Brignoli ! " About this time , it was the fashion to go to vespers either at St. Stephen s or at St. Francis de Xavier s ; so - the opera singers must perform there ; and occasionally a programme was issued at Grace church to celebrate the debut of a new performer , or the passion of our Lord . By degrees , the belles who had voices began to culti vate them . They had the same masters who taught the tenors ; they discovered that they could sing as well as Yestvali , or , at least , as Ventaldi ; they tried " Stride la Vampa " and " Tacea la Notte , " and rather liked the Cifect . At receptions they were applauded : morning visits happened on the days when they took lessons , and were converted into charming occasions . By and by , their progress becoming considerable , it was determined to give a charity concert , at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the performers were to sing behind a screen . The tickets were sold only to friends , and not to be had at all in the shops . This was extremely agreeable , and exclusive and charitable . The benevolent songstresses were listened to respectfully , . and afterwards complimented ; but no vulgar applause was allowed in the churches . However , the importance of the aforementioned opera singers was magnified by this new fantasy . Few men in society can sing . There is one young person who takes his notes falsely , and is always in the bills of every private performance ; but 96 The Vagabond. he is the sole exception ; and he is only tolerated ( musi cally ) because he is alone . If anybody with a good voice and any manners at all wishes a social success , it can be assured him in New York . The belles say " Can he sing ? Oh , introduce him immediately : any man who can sing is such an acquisition ! " We should have had private operas long ago had there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shy of disposing of their wares in private . I was once at a concert where the tickets were disposed of only by in vitation , and at which Brignoli assisted . He was applauded , and an encore demanded ; but he caused it to be announced to the audience that if they wished to hear his song again , they could do so the next night at the opera . I don t wonder at Mr. Willis , myself . But about that concert : it was extremely brilliant , and as it was not in a church , and no tickets were sold , it was thought admissible to applaud ; this was an onward step in the march of musical improvement . Then another feature became apparent . Cards of invitation were issued for a performance at a Catholic church , to take the place of vespers , which were found to be rather tame , though for a long while the psalms had been sung to the music of " La Favorita " and " I Puritani . " But this performance was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , but no entrance allowed without a ticket ; so all the fashion and taste of the town went . I know how hard I tried to get a card , for they were in demand ; but a belle of my acquaintance took pity on me , and carried me in under her wing . Well , the music was superb : priests and fine ladies and artists made a delightful ensemble . The programme was an- The Amateurs. /z/ nounced from the altar ; and one of the performers being indisposed , a popular ballad singer kindly offered his valuable services , for this occasion only . But the arch bishop thought such proceedings scarcely proper for the place , and put a stop to them . However , they were resumed , shortly after , at a Baptist place of worship ; and as the ministers of that persuasion have no fear of archbishops before their eyes , morceaux from " La Traviata " and other high-toned operas were offered to the ears polite , sooth to say , not unaccustomed to the strains . I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order ; but about this time the young ladies began to sing on the outside of the screen , and in com pany with the tenors . Then , during the summer , there were triumphs at the watering-places , and some of them mentioned in the newspapers . It was not till last fall , however , that people in society performed at public con certs , for which placards were stuck up around the streets , and tickets for sale at the music-shops . We all know of these occasions : we know how names were ferreted out and published in the prints , and criti cisms freely passed on the amateurs . Then , too , during the season , concerts have been given in private houses not a few , where the tickets , though bought , were yet bought only by friends to whom they had been sent . Still , friends sometimes were anything but obliged by the compliment . Patronesses sent parcels of cards to their acquaintances , expecting them to take twenty-five at two dollars a card forcing charity upon one at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her carriage . As I was passing Stewart s , she bowed so /z/ 98 The Vagabond. graciously that I ran up uncovered , and on the frcnl seat she had a pile of concert cards . She secured me , by politely bestowing one with her compliments , and of course , what had I to do ? " Well , she was in the fashion ; they all did so ; it was for charity . She would no more have done it for another purpose than she would have garrotcd me . All the world has heard of the last of these entertain ments , which , though given at a gorgeous mansion , was not so successful . The town had got surfeited , and some of the sweetest of the syrens were not willing to risk any further publicity . Those , in fact , who got the rich est laurels were the first to shrink back into private parties and morning visits , where only lucky Vaga bonds can hear them . But these amateurs are really accomplished musicians . More than one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prima donnas ; more than one have cultivation that would put to shame that of artists who have sung with acceptance at the Academy of Music . But they are frightened ; the paying public will hear them no more . And it is scarcely to be desired that they should . When they are tempted to the stage or to Constanti nople , it is time the curtain should fall . To be sure la haute societe abroad indulges in just such freaks . Fashion is the same everywhere : Piccolomini is the De Wilhorst of Italy ; but brilliant as may be the career of both these artists , not many families are envious of such suc cess for their own members . All the Avorld went to see the American prima donna in " Lucia . " She looked beautiful and sang delightfully ; yet there are better singers in New York to-day than she .

Let the charming Cecilias keep their gifts for their friends and for society . Strangers have no right to hear them ; will hear them coldly , and are more likely to be harsh than kind in their comments . To be sure , t is piquante to criticise the performances of belles and heiresses ; but this is a dainty . I would not offer the jaded palates of the general public . Such entertainments should be kept for choicer friends . However , since Mrs. De Wilhorst has deliberately adopted the stage , I wish her all success .

His music is rendered in Mex ico and St. Petersburg with equal success ; it sets on fire the phlegmatic English fashionables , and is the rage , at the same time , in the capitals of Europe and America , Paris and New York . The outside barbarians , as Jules Janin is pleased to call us , and the acknowledged sove reigns and arbiters of taste , alike pay him homage , while his own excitable countrymen go wild over " Ernani " and " I Lombardi , " over " Louisa Miller " and " Rigoletto .

Yet there is a set-off to these triumphs ; there are those whose hearts cling to their old idols , who can not give tip Mozart and Von Weber , who will not swear by the ne* divinity . These prate of the noise of Verdi ; they declaim about his declamation ; they laugh at the " Anvil Chorus , " and hold up their hands in horror at " La Verdi . 101 Traviata . " But I notice that they never stay away on " II Trovatore " nights , while when even " Guillaume Tell " or " Don Giovanni " is given , their places are some times empty . Still , there is a certain force in the censure that the severely critical often pass upon Vei di . He is human , and therefore unequal . There is a degree of truth in the strictures of those educated to like other masters ; only I am tired of this wholesale abuse . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavillers will talk of Verdi ; then , when the fickle crowd fills the Academy at the production of the latest opera , and every prima donna selects the newest work for her debUt , then how the old people will look back lingeringly at the times when Verdi was the rage ! They will tell of " Trovatore " sung oftener in a year than all other operas together , of the hurdy-gurdies that taught the poorest to admire " Stride la Vampa " and " Tacea la Notte , " of the nightly ova tions paid to genius when " La Traviata " made the prud ish English Queen forget her prudery , and " Ernani " forced the most bigoted Bostonians to neglect Beethoven . Yet these are the people who now enlighten us on Verdi s faults . They can not forgive him that he is popular ; they will not discover that his passion is the secret of his power ; they will not acknowledge the genius which subdues all hearts , the fire that stirs us all , the sympa thetic influence that reaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion and form , down to the volcanic bosoms so often hidden beneath . Verdi is noisy , he is unfinished , he is fitful , he is fever ish . The " Anvil Chorus " is of the adcaptandum order , and the masking music of the " Traviata " can not be called first-rate . He repeats himself , too ; you can here and 1O2 The Vagabond. there trace the same ideas in " Ernani " and " II Trovatore ; " you will notice bars , and strains , and motifs , almost identical , in his different works . Then his mannerisms are undoubted ; more than an individuality , more than intense characterization is seen in his productions ; real , petty affectations cling to him , unworthy of so great a master . I own that some of his works are unequal and almost tame . I own that harsh passages too often occur in all his music ; that the exquisite finish of Rossini and the splendid science of Meyerbeer are everywhere lacking ; that noisy choruses and orchestral crashes are sometimes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r ants of Beethoven s spirituality and Mozart s grandeur . But I will own nothing more . If Verdi is not spiritual , he is intensely human ; if he is not religious , he is passionate beyond all composers ; if he has not the profundity of the Germans , the tender sweetness of Bellini , or the light , exquisite grace of the French opera , he has merits all his own , which none can claim but he ; which are striking ; which speak to us all ; which secure his triumphs ; which have placed him rightly where he is ; which have made him absolute king of all the opera houses in the world . I venture to say that , within the last two years , his operas have been sung in every great city of Europe or America oftener than the operas of all other compo sers . I venture to say that the airs from " II Trovatore " were familiar to more people within a year after the production of that work than ever happened before to any work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a popularity as this , there is no blinking the fact ; no amount of carping criticism can do away Verdi . j 03 with it ; no shrugging of shoulders or raising of eye-brows can affect it ; no sneering silence can answer why his works will crowd a theatre in any capital in the world , at times when any other opera would be sung to empty benches . Nothing but genius could accomplish this ; noise alone is not competent to such a task ; and not genius alone , but a genius eminently suited to the genius of the age . And herein I believe lies the secret of Verdi s power : he expresses , he embodies the fitful vehemence , the mate rial character even , the rushing , headstrong impetuousness , the stormy demonstrations of this demonstrative age . He is the most material of musicians . He is the Miss Heron of composers . His merits are of that ap parent sort which all can feel . Not only , however , the most uneducated share the emotions which he excites : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low alike love and hate ; the most careful critic and the most sensuous poet come beneath this sway ; the cra ziest lover and the coldest banker are stirred by the rush of feeling that speaks in Verdi s strains . To be sure , the impetuous , the young , the emotional feel it the most keenly ; those brimful of passion themselves are excited most by this exciting music ; but others , outwardly calm , are also affected by it . These appa rently phlegmatic people , who conceal such a wealth of intensity under their cold exteriors , these Jane Eyres and John Halifaxes all like Verdi s music . Who can not see the connexion , the similarity rather , between such geniuses as the author of Jane Eyre and Verdi , between Madame Dudevant , between De la Roche , and the passionate composer ? He does not at all represent the thinking , doubting phase of our age ; he has not the 104 The Vagabond. profound meaning , the subtle ideas of Meyerbeer , or of many of the writers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superhuman ; but he searches the depth of mortal feeling ; he shares the most violent emotions ; he expresses in the most absolute manner the unrest , the eagerness , the mad torrent of feeling characteristic of the nineteenth century . The agonizing wail of the " Miserere , " the wild leaping into song of the Di tale amor , the sad plaint of the finale of " II Trovatore , " what can there be in words to equal these ? What has there been in music to surpass them ? Then all this is done in melody . It is impossible for a composer to seize hold of the hearts of men without the aid of melody . The most elaborate ornamentation , the most admirable combinations , the most perfect har mony gratify indeed a cultured ear and satisfy a cultured taste , but do not touch the nerve and never rouse the feelings . We can listen calmly to the music that evi dences the completest science , when some snatch of singular or sweet melody shall bring tears to the dryest eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melody in as great a degree as any composer the gift of expressing passion in melody . There is not a strain in the " Trovatore , " from beginning to end , that is not at once beautiful and full of meaning , that lingers not in the memory ; and several pieces in " Ernani " are among the most wonderful Teachings out , the most tre mendous utterances of earthly passion that I have ever heard . The two great things of Meyerbeer , the JKobert , toi que j aime and the Ah , monfils , only can compare with them ; and of these , the latter is a mother s holy feeling , rather subdued and religious in character , and Verdi . 105 the former partakes in some measure of the unhumau nature of the " Robert le Diable . " Donizetti , too , resembles Verdi in this extraordinary intensity ; his music is certainly smoother , and at times as dramatically powerful ; but there are declamatory bursts in Verdi which surpass any similar attempts of the older master ; there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of " Ernani , " and in the soprano and tenor writing of the fourth act of the same opera , that transcend , in this respect , any single thing that Doni zetti has done . Verdi has more of this one peculiar quality that constitutes his greatness than Donizetti , and so is better liked than the other . When Donizetti approaches the intensity of Verdi , he is in more demand . The " Lucrezia , " the " Lucia , " the fourth act of the " Favorita , " are of this character , but still not so wildly , uncontrollably passionate as Verdi s greatest efforts . I do not call Verdi the greatest of composers , but I do call him the most effective ; I do not claim for him an absolute superiority to all others in all respects , but I claim that he who seizes and expresses the spirit of the age in which he lives , is a man of undoubted genius ; that he who so makes his mark , who can so affect a ma terial age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at its culmination , when music is of all arts the best appreciated and most loved , at the moment of its his tory when it has reached the highest point of excellence , he who triumphs then , triumphs indeed .

Here am I , enjcyirg myself amazingly under my invisible cap . I go aiound , like the prince in the fairy tale , and hear what my friends think of me , or of my other self . I get the benefit of some very impartial criticism , am censured to my face by the best bred people , and sometimes rated soundly by those who would not offend me wittingly or willingly , for the world . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my most charming acquaintances asked me if I read " The Vagabond " papers . I felt my heart in my throat , for I was particularly anxious for the god dess s good opinion , but repressed my agitation , and said inquiringly : " The Vagabond ? The Vaga bond ? " " Yes , in the Sunday Times . " I thought I had seen such articles ; and this most delightful of maidens refreshed my memory by mentioning the titles of several . She absolutely recollected what I had writ ten about : I was willing to fall down and worship her on the spot . But more , she remembered what I had said : she commented upon the style , she criticised the criticisms , she praised several papers , and lifted me up Myself . 107 into the seventh heaven , and then , alas ! she recollected that I had dispraised one of her favorites . And then the poor Vagabond , who had been swelling with pride , who had fancied himself an Addison or a Steele , who was putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so attentively , drew back in his shell . The malignant , shrewish young woman , whose tongue it must be owned is severe and of all things a caustic tongue is most un seemly in a young female ; this virago , this Xantippe , this Katharine , this Beatrice let loose her arrows at an unarmed , defenceless , and , as she thought , absent Vaga bond . He was unfair , he was unjust , he was ungentlemanly ( the unkindest cut of all ) . He was pedantic , he was ignorant , he was affected , he was ridiculously na tural . Oh ! the vocabulary of censure , the storm of words that she rattled down on me ! Hailstones and coals of fire ! And I , who had been on the point of raising my visor , of bowing my head , like Ivanhoe , to receive the laurel crown from Rowena s hand , I took my beaver instead , and wished Rowena a good morn ing . But I grow philosophical and tough : I begin to re semble eels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames of martyrdom as calmly as St. Lawrence in the picture of Domenichino , at Mr. Goupil s . Apropos of pictures ! Another of my ad ventures I must tell the story of . Don t every hero like to fight his battles o er again ? Don t every vagabond relate his escapades , especially if they are connected with the sex ? What if it is vanity of vanities , I talk under a veil . What if it is presuming to suppose that my readers want to know the story ! I am sure some of 108 The Vagabond , them are curious about my identity , because one of my own acquaintances asked me whether I knew who wrote " The Vagabond , " and I flatly told her " oSTo . " Sir Walter Scott denied the authorship of the Waverley novels , and so you ses .

But , apropos of pictures ! A Aveek or two ago , I received the most charming of letters , written in the daintiest of hands , directed to " The Vagabond , " and signed " Norah " a very pretty name , by the way . Irish , too , suggestive of Moore and Norah Creina . This delicate epistle began with the most delicate of flatteries , and was couched throughout in the dearest and delightfulest of language , and begged me to write more about pictures , and to speak of the artists . Thus inspired , what Vagabond could refuse . Not I , certainly . I studied the letter carefully , and de termined which of the artists mentioned I thought Norah cared most about ; some lover , or brother , or father I supposed . I went to the studio with a friend , saw the pic tures she had told of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I hope she has seen . If not , I will leave a copy of my criticism at this office , and she can have it by proving property , as the advertisements say . However , I have no doubt that I hit the mark , for I have since received a note of thanks , signed by another name , Myself . 1 09 but expressed in the same felicitous and flattering phra seology , impossible to be counterfeited ; and if my critical acumen is not sadly at fault , I know Norah , though Norah doesn t know the Vagabond . In the games of the carnival , if the mask falls , one is entitled to look at the black eyes it concealed . But I have another correspondent , one of those bewitch ing creatures , who in disguise are so daring ; who for get the story of Tancred and Clorinda ; who tantalize , and delight , and provoke by turns . This unknown , like the lady of the Green Mantle in " Redgauntlet , " veils herself under an initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different entirely from Norah characteristic , too , I am sure , often saying some civil things , but curtly and piquantly , and so of course with a seasoning that adds vastly to their gout ; she wants me to write on woman s influence and woman s sphere . You darling incognito , I think woman s right and duty are to charm the men , to write lively letters to Vagabonds . I think she adorns her sex when she captivates ours with mys tery ; ( what god was it , was blind ? ) that she is irresis tible when she makes no attacks ; that when Eve said to Adam , " God thy law , thou mine , " they were both in Paradise ; and if the head of the woman is the man , the heart of man always belongs to woman . But , my gracious correspondents , don t be angry ; I am not violating any decorum by talking Avith you in public : your secret is known , but not you . I wanted to answer your charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and in print ? I hope you don t think I have been no chevalier sans reproche in thus telling my triumphs ; for is it not a triumph to gain an interest lio The Vagabond. in the imagination of two such fair ones ? I was sure to preserve that interest only while the mystery was preserved . Why not let me heighten it ; why not let me intensify my personality ; why not let me gloat over my good luck to my friends who read these papers ? If two have felt so kindly towards the Vagabond , may not others have a sufficient concern to read the story with a sparkling eye ? Pray don t let your own glisten into spite , or those favorable sentiments turn to indignation . I wouldn t for the world incur your wrath . I said one of my correspondents gave me an initial : it is X. Now I don t know any X. family hi which there is a daughter who could write that letter .

As for the Vagabond , every time he is presented to a Miss X. , he will flutter until he discovers whether or not t is his X. So beware , my unknown ; be chary of the introduc tions you grant . The Vagabond is not now among your avowed admirers ; you need not try your powers of penetration upon the crowd who now strive for a smile , or , sweeter yet , a sigh ; but every time a new adorer bows at the shrine , it may be he who possesses your secret . I shall recognise you , and you not me . For you don t know whether I m an Adonis or a Blue beard : one lady thought me an old man , another con cluded I was a hunchback .

Cruel ones , do not say he also liked to contemplate himself , although this paper give you cause .

Who is there that appre ciates not a frank , manly expression of opinion , a fearless maintenance of doctrines sure to bring upon their advo cate somewhat of censure and even of reproach ? Who feels not a genuine sympathy with any attempt at inde pendence , with the struggle to get free from any tram mels ? Who admires not the courage that dares in behalf of others , that speaks in favor of a caste to those whose disfavor only that caste has received , that flings it self into the breach , sure to become the mark of many a bitter sarcasm and cruel criticism ; but careless of these if it can but say a good word for a great cause , can but relieve a great public interest from unjust odium ? The very importance of the aid which Dr. Bellows brings to the stage , arises more from his position than from his talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion exposes him in a peculiar manner to the harshest strictures , the unkindest misconstructions . All honor , then , to his boldness ! He believes himself to be right ; and , whatever men may think or say of the force or justice of his arguments , they must admire the abstract courage that prompts his conduct . Henry W. Bellows . 113 His courage in this instance , however , is of a piece with his general character . I have heard a number of his discourses at different times and at various intervals ; and the first characteristic to force itself upon my obser vation has invariably been the outspokenness of the man . Many a preacher of peculiar doctrines in this metropolis hides them for the sake of popularity . The Calvinists are said to reserve their sermons on predestination for rainy Sundays , when only the faithful are likely to per sist in their attendance ; a Unitarian scarcely alludes to the distinctive tenets of his sect ; and I have even heard a Roman Catholic priest , in all his robes , pro mise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heretic hearers . Not so with Dr. Bel lows : he holds unpopular doctrines , he arrives at con clusions entirely dissimilar from those generally enter tained ; but he never shirks their utterance , he never swerves from what seems to him the line of duty , he never scruples to avow openly , and in the face of the world , what he learns in his closet , in contemplation or study . What he learns in darkness , that speaks he in light ; and what he hears in the ear , that preaches he upon the house-top . Frequently his notions come into contact with those of even his habitual hearers ; but he believes in a free interchange of ideas ; he promulgates his own , upholds them with all the skill and ability of which he is possessed , and leaves the result to take care of itself . Akin to this courage a part , indeed , a cause of it is earnestness , sincerity , an abiding conviction of the correctness of his opinion and the justice of his course . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is 114 1h e Vagabond. ashamed , and certainly not so well for a cause in which his heart is not enlisted . The deep conviction of his being right makes him careless of consequences , while zeal , we all know , is better at times than skill or strength . And , whatever may be said or thought of other traits of Dr. Bellows , his earnestness is seldom questioned . Thus , character rather than talent is uppermost in him ; traits that make and mark the man seem to me more prominent than those which distinguish the preacher or the orator . I speak , of course , of those traits as they are unfolded in his public career , and especially in his public speeches . He belongs to a class peculiar to our time of serious , earnest , thoughtful , yet practical men ; men whom I respect most profoundly , though I do not always nor altogether concur with them ; men who think they have a mission , and speak it ; who have a work to do , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach it ; a class as different as may be from the ordinary orthodox ministers , and from the ordinary popular preachers . They are as much unlike the prosy , long-winded , nar row-minded , bigoted sermonizer , as to the shallow , selfish , flashy orator . They differ , too , from the talented and learned upholders of present ideas and present systems ; they are reformers , or at least progressive in their tendencies ; they preach of this life , but forget not the next ; they scorn not the concerns of this world , they believe in a religion which affects man s doings here , they care for his present well-being for his advancement for his comfort for his amusement ; but fail not to consider and teach him to consider , earnestly and anxiously , his future destiny . Whether they take Henry W. Bellows . 115 the right course , whether they direct our thoughts into the proper channel , whether they teach true doctrines in relation to religion itself is not the question to dis cuss here ; but I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds ; in looking to and caring for a complex nature ; in regarding the present as well as the future . They are scarcely , it seems to me , preachers in the technical meaning we attach to the word , but they preach and teach in reality . They cer tainly depart from the conventional rules and the con ventional idea of the pulpit ; but do they swerve from the rules dictated either by sound judgment or enlightened taste ? I confess I admire in them this double sympathy for the interests of here and hereafter ; this recognition of both the soul and body of man ; this Consideration for material and immaterial concerns ; this acceptance of fact and this endeavor after abstract good ; this realism and idealism combined . At the head of these men stands Henry W. Bellows . At the head , by force of character , by boldness of deed , by outspokenness of language , by his talent and learning , by his position as the teacher of a metropo litan aggregation , distinguished for wealth , refinement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add his taste , are more than considerable , are dis tinguished . As he seems to many to have attained a just medium in matters of higher moment , so in the culture of his intellect and the practice of his art . He is profoundly philosophical in the cast of his mind , and yet eminently practical in the application of his infer ences . An original thinker , he has enriched himself with stores of the soundest learning and most generous li6 The Vagabond. culture . Logic holds a higher place in his esteem than rhetoric , and his first care is to convince ; but he dis dains not to persuade and please . He is , however , more anxious to affect your reason than your other powers . It is the sound deductions of his fine intellect that compel your assent ; it is the exact appreciation of events and character that extorts your concurrence ; it is the wellbalanced mind that advances his ideas with vigor , that sets them forth with effect , that provides him with argument ments often incontrovertible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for his hearers to recede . A scholar , versed in the lore of ancient and of modern schools , he is yet free from prejudice or pe dantry ; a philosopher , he is willing to examine the systems of others , and find good in all , though not the good he is in search of . Though heartily convinced of the truth of his doctrine , and earnestly desirous to set forth its merits , he extends a Christian and courteous f ) rbearance to all , and is the farthest possible from dog matism or arrogance in the enunciation of what he be lieves to be true . But he is also far from neglecting the graces of style . His taste is as cultivated as his profounder powers ; his rhetoric at once chaste and ornate , correct and ele gant , his command of language ample and exceedingly felicitous , he unites the so often opposite qualities of strength and beauty . Lectorem delectando , pariterque monendo . His style must at once engage the attention of the indifferent and secure the approbation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both in thought and expression , and knows how to descend without shocking the most fastidious . Touches Henry W. Bellows . 117 of true and tender pathos , though rare , are not al together wanting in his sermons , and contrast finely with occasional bursts of elaborate oratory . However , he uses with a sparing hand these shining gifts . If there is any lack felt in his discourse , it is that of a burning , passionate , overwhelming eloquence . He never is inspired ; he never carries you away ; he is not of the impetuous , emotional order . There are times and places when a torrent of living , breathing words , or a soul-stirring , trumpet-like appeal to the conscience or heart , would be more effective than all his calmly considered and carefully expressed deductions . Though such emotions as eloquence excites are , with me , more transitory at least in their effects , they are , for the time , more exquisite than the approving interest which my judgment always dictates in Dr. Bellows s discourses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spell-bound attention , are effects unknown to his audiences . Once or twice I have known him touch nerves that go close to the heart ; but gene rally , he is no master of the feelings . He speaks to the intellect and taste . Whether the preacher should not rather address these than the heart , one might doubt , did we not know how powerful a motive passion is in influencing human character . Now Dr. Bel lows is the most convincing of orators , because the most dispassionate . On the whole , few speakers give me more unalloyed pleasure : some of those more highly gifted , at least gifted with the more striking talents which subdue and move the masses , educated and uneducated , some of these frequently err in matters of taste , occasionally ll8 The Vagabond. shock your notions of propriety , or offend you by the appearance of insincerity . But if Dr. Bellows never reaches the heights of the true sublime , neither does he ever sink to the depths of affectation , showy rant , or stupid insipidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp , the number of those who dissent from their teachings would diminish , though not perhaps disappear . If all the advocates of other doctrines were like him , the ineffectual fires of orthodoxy might pale . Yet truth does not depend for a lasting triumph upon the efforts of friends or foes ; and though in the din of the contest her voice be lost , it is never stilled though " crushed to earth , the eternal years of God are hers . " The recent address of Dr. Bellows before the Ameri can Dramatic Fund Society illustrates at once his talent and his character . It is marked by the peculiarities of the man ; but it has a further significance when consi dered in reference to the times . Its author is a representa tive man ; he has done an unusual thing ; he , the ecclesi astical descendant of the Puritans , has preached in a play house and to players , on the stage in behalf of the stage . He has said severe things aboxit the profession , plainly and to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and congratulated him afterwards ; he has stretched a kindly hand to those with whom his own calling has been at war so long , and that hand is quickly and warmly grasped , showing that there is no need for the fancied antagonism . He has perhaps inaugurated a revolution ; he has taken the first step which costs so much ; St. Denis can now walk with his head in his hand . He has recognised the theatre as a fact ; he has treated the drama as a practical man should , as a politic Henry W. Bellows . 119 preacher should , as a real philanthropist should . It exists , and centuries of abuse and enmity from the " unco guid " have availed nothing against it ; it flaunts itself in their faces to-day as proudly as ever . What they can not ignore or destroy , Dr. Bellows proposes to reform ; to praise where praise is due , to censure where censure should be bestowed . An instinct so ineradica ble , a passion so lasting , a taste so universal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended by God for good . Let us get the good out of it . I call him a wise man . I am willing to fight under his banners in this crusade . /z/ " The Art itself is Nature . " Winter s Tale . I HAVE been several times , of late , to see the young genius who is playing at Burton s theatre , and have recognised in his performances the indescribable and unattainable influence , which I confess I seek for in life and art under their various phases ; that alone which subdues the educated and the illiterate , the old and the young , the cold and the impulsive . I have felt the power of genius . To be sure , you sometimes have to sit through an act for the sake of one touch , or one point ; but when the time comes it is transcendant , it goes straight home , it compensates . Young Booth has the unmistakable fire , the electric spark , the god-like quality , which mankind have agreed to worship . The vein is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind ; the workman is raw , and his tools unwonted , but he is young , and all the more interesting just now from his faults ; they so evidently spring from inexperience , they are so palpably negative , they are so curable , that they enlist your sympathies , while four or five times in an evening he does something that requires no sympathy , no allowance , no toleration ; that commands , controls , overwhelms . American Art . 121 The young man is but twenty-three , handsome , grace ful , with a countenance full of a higher beauty than that of outline , full of expression , and mobile as any that I have ever watched ; with an eye , fitting window to the soul that looks out through it ; a voice musical and powerful and manageable ; with an impulsive , soul-full nature , that prompts such strokes as the rendering of the line in " Richard III. : " " What do they in the north , " When they should serve their sovereign in the west ? ; 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hamlet , " " Father ! " or the look that comes over his face in " Romeo , " after he has killed Tybalt . These things are alone enough to stamp his mettle , are such as no amount of labor and pains would enable an actor to do , as mark the great and impassable gulf for ever fixed between such as Booth and the clever , careful students , even ( I dare say it ) like Wallack and Davenport . Of course , he slurs over lines that they read elegantly ; of course , he is unequal Avhile they are finished ; of course , he is rough and they are smooth ; but give me one touch of real feeling , one breath of absolute genius , one spark of enthusiasm before all the finish , all the elaboration , all the study in the world . I do not , I am sure , inappreciate or undervalue culture , but there is something higher , truer , realler . I certainly am far from con temning care or study , but some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " So far shall ye go , and no farther . " This is not said to Edwin Booth ; there is no Rubicon he may not pass ; there are , how- /z/ 122 The Vagabond. ever , many for him yet to cross . He is undeveloped , chaotic , plastic . He is the type of American art ; he symbolizes the dawn , whose first streaks appear in the horizon . Every thing in art , here , is yet unformed , but the spirit of God has moved on the waters ; and there is a struggle , a quickening in the womb , that betokens life , a faint cry that shall yet grow into an aspiration , a few signifi cant attempts that shall yet be successes . All American art is of this nature , is impulsive , erratic , irregular , but yet full of promise and undeveloped power . I confess , I do not agree with those who see nothing to hope for in American art , because it has not received the last degree of polish , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so disheartened as those who seek for evenness of elaboration , but will not discern true touches of nature . Of course , America has yet produced no Rachel , no Milton , no Mozart , nor is she likely soon to do so ; but the stammerings of the infant muses are heard ; not unlike those that whispered centuries ago in Greece , as unmistakable as the numbers that preceded Homer , as the strivings of Perugino who preceded Raphael , as musical as the utterings of Cimarosa , who came before Mozart . Neither do I think that American art will ever assume the form which some are looking for , and because they do not find , declare it has no form : it will be turbulent and impassioned , even when developed ; not divinely calm , but intensely human ; not the divinity enthroned on Olympus , but the incarnate one that suf fers , and feels , and is tempted . The intimations already given assure us of this : the artists whom America has American Art . 123 already produced , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lave been emotional , brimful of earnestness , perhaps even stormy . In music , Gottschalk indicates the difference between European art , the digest of centuries , and American , the product of a young people . Thalberg and Gottschalk , both as composers and artists , fitly symbolize the cha racters of foreign and native genius : the one calm , collected , Jove-like , the other stirring , electric , Apollo . So , too , Miss Heron , the genius who crushes out criti cism , and sets coldness itself on fire , who forces you to feel though you may not admire , who gathers up all the strings of your nature in her grasp , and tightens or sweeps them at once , is certainly American in her enthu siastic , excitable style . Even our painters catch the spirit , and Mr. Church has embodied it in his " Niagara , " perhaps the finest picture yet done by an American ; at least , that which is fullest of feeling . The idea of motion he has imparted to his canvass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , of the glancing of the sunbeam , of the tossing of the rapids , of the waving of the rainbow , of the whirling of the foam , of the mad rush of the cataract , I take to be the great excellence of his production ; and surely this is akin to the in fluence which I describe as paramount in American art . Neither is this influence to be decried as altogether hasty and uneducated , or unformed . It is not only the fruit of ill-digested thought , it is not only the rapid utterance of youth , the boastful , coarse excitement of ignorance . If it is inspired by Niagara , it is grand and sublime ; it is natural to the nation , since nature herself 124 The Vagabond. lias given us such a type ; it is wild and ungovernable , mad at times , but all power is terrible at times . It is the effect of various causes ; it is a true development of American mind ; the result of democracy , of individu ality , of the expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ineradicable and lofty qualities in human na ture . It is inspired not only by the irresistible cataract , but by the mighty forest , by the thousand miles of river , by the broad continent we call our own , by the onward march of civilization , by the conquering of savage areas ; characteristic alike of the western back woodsman , of the Arctic explorer , the souther* fillibuster , and the northern merchant . So , of course , it gets expression in our art . Not in ours only . Let those who utterly condemn it look abroad : see how Verdi s music has usurped a place in the opera-houses of Europe , and holds sway over the universal musical taste of the world . Let them bethink them of Turner s pictures , undoubtedly stamped with the same impress , burning , speaking , instinct with this same feeling which I strive to indicate . Let them acknow ledge in the intensity of modern fiction , in the dramas of Dumas and the novels of Dudevant , in the terse , vigorous works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of the nineteenth century spirit , directed and guided , perhaps , to better advantage by those who have been at school for ages , but more unmistakably uttered here , more openly avowed , more absolutely expressed . What if our art , then , is in its infancy : it is at least born into the world . We way wish it had already attained perfection ; we may relish with a more delicate taste the exquisite pro- American Art . 125 ductions of the older world ; but let us not entirely de spise the first fruits of this western Atlantis . Instead of decrying whatever has the mark of pecu liarity , the freshness of flavor , the smell of the pinewoods , the raciness , the heartiness of youth and strength , would it not be better to recognise and appreciate what of good there is , and develop , and train , and culture it into perfection ? Instead of being angry with Palmer because he dared deviate from classic models of beauty , let us encourage him to embody the forms of loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Greek slaves , American originals to copies of old and effete ideas . In his profound and interesting volume on America and Europe , Count Gurowski comments upon many of our national peculiarities , but , to my mind , discusses matters of art with more skill than questions of races ; at any rate , arrives at conclusions in those domains with which I can more readily concur , and in particular enun ciates this idea , that the accord with culture and study of the inspiration conferred by genius is the problem of our epoch . Kingsley also , in " Two Years Ago , " declares that art is not only imitation , not only the fruit of labor , neither only the plenary inspiration , but the union , the marriage of the highest nature with the last results of culture . I accept the dictum , and believe that Ameri can art will solve the problem . It seems to me to pos sess the inspiration : the culture can be attained . Here of course is the lack . The genius is not gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . The beautiful maxim of Goethe is more applicable to us than to any other civilized na- 126 The Vagabond. tion : " Take care of the beautiful , for the useful will take care of itself . " We do not , as a nation , take care of the beautiful . The artists are not cherished , the arts are not fostered ; but improvement is visible even in these matters . A keener relish , a livelier interest is awakened for art : its influence spreads , the circles widen daily , like the eddies in a pool . I think I detect an in creasing consideration for such things . When I remem ber the kindly feeling evinced for Mrs. de Wilhorst ; when I recall the brilliant crowds that greeted her first at tempts ; when I reflect that the Academy of Music was offered her free of rent for her benefit ; when I hear that the subscription list for her farewell concerts is filled with distinguished names , and that it is in contempla tion to offer her a substantial token of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her departure , and thus mate rially assist her endeavors , I think that some progress is made or making . When I remember how instantly Miss Heron s genius was recognised , although exclusively American , and , in its excellences , unlike that of foreign schools ; when I remember the audiences that attended the first nights of " Fascination " and " Leonore " last winter ; when I think of the appreciation of Gottschalk , I say that American art will not always languish . I hope for the day when those whose tastes and faculties are cultured by study and travel , by intercourse with the gifted , and opportunities of witnessing the best in the various domains of art , will not unnaturally turn from what is American , because it is not perfect ; when they will blow every spark of genius into a flame ; when they will gladly foster our own art ; when Mr. Fry s " Leo nora " shall be sung at the New York opera-house , and American Art . 127 Mr. Jacopi , the American tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name .

" /z/ AT last we have American plays . Several times , of late , our managers have presented , with commendable care , the productions of American authors , or the repre sentations of American life . The stage seems about to assume its ancient office , to become again the censor of the people , and the picture of the times . Hitherto , our audiences have been content with the performance of English comedies , or tragedies whose tone and coloring were altogether of another date and era from our own . True , indeed , passion is cosmopolite , and all men are akin at one stroke of nature . We weep over the woes of Virginia , or are indignant at the wrongs of Othello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were native here and to our manner born . True , too , there is a charm in these pictures of other days and other times , like that of reading Walter Scott s novels or Macaulay s histories . I am no advocate for banish ing Congreve and Sheridan from our modern stage . I , too , delight in classic tragedies . But the theatre has yet another mission ; it has to speak to us of to-day ; to lash our follies , to portray our life , to show us how we of the nineteenth century live and love and hate : American Playwrights. 129 for there are traits in modern life as susceptible of humorous portraiture as any that caught the eye of Wicherly or Fielding in the days of merry Charles or stupid Anne ; there are incidents and characters around us as full of passion and pathos as those which engaged the pens of Sophocles or Racine . We are men still , and our nature is unchanged . The harvest is plentiful , but the laborers are few . I accept gladly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stage . I am glad to see the first fruits gathered from so rich a field , and to read in the bills " Never before acted , " and " Written expressly for this theatre . " The very tendency to imitation of French dramas , which has its repulsive features , has also something of good in it . For these French plays are at least modern . They describe modern life phases of modern life , it is true , which are not ( here , at any rate , thank God ! ) the most marked or characteristic ; but still they go not back hundreds of years for their plots , and personages and scenes . In this light , then , I see great merit in the play of " Fascination , " now or recently acted at Burt m s theatre . Apart from its moral tone , upon which I proffer no comment , it possesses this striking excellence of open ing the way in a new direction . It mirrors real life , holds up no glass that distorts the features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society of this day . Though the scene is laid in Italy , the people are such as we see around us ; for , in fact , well-bred people are as much alike to day all over the world in manners as they are in dress . The etiquettes of behavior are as widely spread as the fashions of boots and bonnets . /z/ 130 The Vagabond . And how delightful to see society pictured , r , ot tra vestied ! We are surfeited with the satires of these would-be Juvenals , with the imitations of those who have never seen the original . A picture of modern life , where princesses are not vulgar and artists not sycophants , is a rarity indeed on the New York boards . It is indeed a fact that " Fascination " has had prede cessors or pioneers in this path , the success of which is good proof of the demand which exists . How many times has " The Lady of Lyons " been played ! How hackneyed is " The Hunchback ! " And yet even these are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are in some respects provincial . There are manner isms about them , like swaddling clothes entangling the footsteps of the infant drama . Still their popularity shows how quickly any public recognises the attempt to hold the mirror up to its own nature . But a play for the children of this generation should not only take the comparatively untrodden field to which I have alluded . It is not merely the province of the modern stage to adapt itself in scenes and characters to modern life , and thus imitate the novel which has so completely dethroned the old-fashioned romance ; for who now reads " Clarissa Harlowe , " except as a curiosity or an historical picture ? Even the " Spectator " is set aside by the many for " Jane Eyre " and " The Newcomes . " None but students penetrate into the literature of a bygone century . Each age has its writers , each age must have its oyn plays . Our stage is for us ; and as we live intensely , the stage must furnish intense scenes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 131 of mind , but our passions and our manifestations of pas sion . Americans are proverbially excitable and excite ment-loving . They find " The Rivals " slow , and care not to go every week to see " She Stoops to Conquer ; " while " Camille , with all its impropriety , draws for an entire season ; not because of its impropriety , but be cause of its intensity . The interest of " Fascination " is not heightened because its heroine is a wanton . I can conceive alterations in the plot which should obviate the objections which have been urged against its mo rality , and yet leave the excellencies untouched . There is fearful , fascinating intensity enough in life without resorting to purlieus and characters that we blush to name . Neither is it your bloody melodramatic pieces which are destined eventually to bear the palm . The " Stran ger " and the " Lady of Lyons " excite as many tears as if they murdered their mistresses , or went mad them selves . The George Barnwells and Jack Sheppards have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than it did in the days of the Borgias . Lovers do not carry off beautiful maidens by force and arms , even on the highways of Italy . The poison and the dagger are not among the ordinary furnishings of gentlemen s cup boards and wardrobes . All this sort of thing is as com pletely out of date as the giants and enchanted castles of the troubadours . But a drama which should possess the eloquence of George Sand , without her outrageous violations of pro priety ; the admirable character-drawing and the fervor of French fiction generally , with the purity and the pro priety of the English sort , would inaugurate a new 132 The Vagabond. school . A modern play , based on modern life , with characters such as can be seen around us ; incidents such as are not of unusual occurrence , but placed in felicitous juxtaposition ; an interest that shall not flag for dulness is damnation in theatrical parlance ; and situations where the hideousness of vice may be made apparent , but its fascinations need not be so minutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard , doubtless , to discriminate ; to draw the line between proper dulness content to dwell in decencies for ever , and the flashy melodramatic style . But be tween these two lies an unoccupied province . The unusual skill manifested in " Fascination , " in the manage ment of incidents , in the portrayal of character , but especially in the passionate dialogue of some scenes , shows plainly enough that there is dramatic talent in our midst . I do not mean to present this piece as perfect in evei-ything but plot ; I think it has other faults . The catastrophe is badly contrived , and there are portions of the play that drag ; but the language is everywhere easy and terse , and the third act is absolutely superb . The excellencies that are prominent are the very ones most desirable in the class of productions that I call for , and that there is a need for . The play itself I regard as a sig nificant attempt , a feeling after the right . Whether the authors are the men destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success that will certainly be attained by some one , remains to be seen . Men some times make one effort , and place themselves near where they would be , but failing of a complete triumph , never attempt again . Men sometimes exhaust themselves in a single endeavor , and their after trials are but repetitions . American Playwrights. 133 Others , who do but poorly at the outset , subsequently eclipse all rivals . Many a playwright has failed at first : even Dr. Johnson s " Irene " was damned . Byron was not the only poet whose " Hours of Idleness " was twaddle , nor " Wordsworth the only writer of whom the reviewers declared , " This will never do . " The critics have united of late I mean the thinking , careful critics in censuring some attempts at portray ing American society ; and I confess these so-called American plays have gross and glaring faults . But still they , too , betoken this necessity ; they , too , strive to answer this call , and are indications of the craving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristo phanes . We want our Moliere . The pool is troubled , but no man steps in . These writers Avho have carica tured us have done something : Guido di Senna and Perugino came before Raphael . They who have paraded events which have occurred in families , though they made manifest their own barrenness of invention , yet showed observation ; and , in some instances , characters have been drawn nicely and carefully . There is room for comedy as well as for profounder dramas . The sock need not tread upon the buskin s heel ; and I am sure Mr. Burton has pictures of both Tragedy and Comedy over his door . But , in this millennium of the stage for which I am waiting , and which Dr. Bellows will probably pre dict when lie addresses the theatrical profession ; in this dramatic Atlantis , to rise out of the waters , Melpomene will , I fancy , preserve her ancient supremacy , and plays of passion be preferred to plays of manners . These are evanescent in interest as the fashions they portray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 134 The Vagabond . But both will be welcome . Meanwhile , let u &; appre ciate what of good the gods provide , and not go hungry because we can not dine on ambrosia , or even on pdte de foie gras. /z/ " Fashion and Ceremony . " Samlet . SOME people are never weary of condemning the parties of New York . They are continually talking of the frivolity of fashion , and the dulness of dancing . To hear them , you would suppose they preferred books to belles and beaux , and the armchair to the opera . Yet , I constantly see these critics in the rooms they say are so hot and crowded ; I constantly meet them at the parties they call so stupid , and talk with them at the concerts where the singing is so bad . Those who affect the profoundest contempt for American amusements , who declare the Bachelors Ball can not be compared with Almack s , who ridicule the opera , and think nothing endurable after a winter in Paris these never stay away when they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are out every night in the season . Despite the affectation of not being interested in society , they have been faithful to every little musical soiree during the warm weather , and crowded to every wedding , even if they had to go in the morning , and stay but an hour . Even on Sundays , they go to a reception , and they keep up their parties in June . The truth is , there is scarcely more frivolity in New York society than in any other ; the diary of a person of fashion in Fielding s days would 136 The Vagabond. answer for one now ; the fine gentleman in Joseph Andrews killed time nearly in the same manner as his modern rival in the new world ; and though Addison s Clorindas and Coquetillas received in bed , and wore patches , both which modes are just now out of vogue , they crowded to the play as ours do to the opera , and wore hoops and fluttered fans exactly in the style that is to-day all the rage . Not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the topics of con versation , the matter as well as the manner , remains the same . English folk of consideration , according to Thackeray , slander their neighbors , and discuss their dearest friends with as much freedom as is ever known in New York drawing-rooms ; and if you believe De Sevigne , the marquises of Louis XIV . s time were as devoted to dress , and lived as much with the senses and for the senses , as the shallowest of the newest people up town . And it must be always so . You can not expect very profound remarks at a ball . In a room full of people , where you know fifty , there is neither time nor opportu nity to do more than emulate Belinda in the " Rape of the Lock , " or Flutter , in the play . If the Vaga bond should meet Norah at a German , and begin dis cussing pictures or the characteristics of woman , while she was waiting her turn in the dance , she would cer tainly consider him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the picture gallery at least .

And I thought they showed their good sense . He who proses in the entr actes of an opera or a quadrille , who discusses phrenology , as I have heard some , at a supper table , or introduces disquisitions on tragedy between the morceaux of the amateurs , may be very wise and very learned , but he scarcely shows his taste in the same degree with his learning . Then the chatter and gossip are positively agreeable . One likes to hear who next is to be married , and who last was rejected ; to talk over the last party , with jits con tretemps , the merits of the dancers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relish a little raillery ; I pre fer a visit to people who , having eyes , see what is going on around them ; who spy out the ridiculous and laugh at it ; who can criticise their friends without abusing them , and censure their follies , yet own all their merits . I make no doubt that I take my turn ; when I leave a delightful place where we have canvassed our entire acquaintance , and found something severe to say of each , I feel like Sir Peter Teazle , that I d better take my character with me ; it isn t safe from inspection if left behind . But if they treat me well to my face , why not be content ? At any rate , whether I am or not , matters little ; my fate is the same . My friends discuss me ; the world will talk ; they say how poorly I dance , or how stiffly I bow ; what a queer coat that was ; how he blushed when Norah was talking ; how angry he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let them talk , so long as they don t absolutely abuse me ; I take my share with the rest , and I assure them , I have my revenge , in kind . 138 The Vagabond . There s one charming house where I m always sure of a feast ; where wit and personality make the talk so piquant , that I am content to sit by as a listener ; only when the subject is fairly exhausted I start another , as you poke up the fire that is burning too low . There I always stay too long in the morning , and go too often in the evening ; there I never send a regret , and am always provoked to be left out ; and there the talk is not often heavy ; it is refined , and even , after a fashion , intellectual ; that is , it is frivolous , but the fri volity is such as only intellectual people are capable of ; trifles are handled by those masters of the art of hand ling them , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what , your entertainment is delightful and piquant , and tempting enough to the most sated appe tite , but not too heavy to interfere with a digestion of the substantial viands that may be in store . But I did not intend to ramble off into a dissertation on fashionable small-talk ; parties are my theme to-day . Conversation belongs to visits ; the theatre and the picture-gallery are the places for intellectual gratifica tion ; operas and parties are social occasions where see ing and being seen , meeting those you know , and using your eyes , are the principal objects . Music and dancing , of course , and supper , must not be forgotten ; they con tribute to the sum total ; but what people go for is not for these . At any rate , the opera for the music , the ball for dancing , but a dinner is the only opportu nity for enjoying the pleasures of the table . What jus tice can be done to a pdte defoie gras , standing ! How can yon possibly appreciate Clos Vougeot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing ices to Norah Parties . 139 and salad to X. ! You might even confound the wines , and in your hurry take Hock for Heidsick , or pour out Chablis into a champagne glass . Those who understand these things , never attempt to indulge under such cir cumstances ; a deliberate dinner is the occasion for the delights of taste , or a game supper , if you will ; a wedding collation , or a stand-up supper after a dance , may be desirable as refreshment , but the connois seurs spurn them . This reminds me that I do not share in the supreme contempt entertained by some for an epicure . Every other sense is cultivated to a high degree of perfection ; we pique ourselves upon the acuteness of the ear , upon the correctness of the eye , why not educate the palate as well ? Why not enjoy in their perfection the subordinate tastes ? They are more animal indeed ; but man is part animal , and may as well drain every drop of pleasure in his cup , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower . I am not too etherial to relish a wine or a pate with considerable zest ; I can even understand the wish of Lucullus , for a neck as long as a crane s , that he might protract the savoring of his dainties ; and I don t think the opera less exquisite to me , or the play less entrancing , the picture less beautiful , or the book less absorbing , because I appreciate purely physical delights of a gustatory description . All things , I believe , were given us richly to enjoy . What is coarse let us refine , what is good , extract . Goethe s philosophy was not so bad as it is the fashion now to say : self-culture in all things is a very good aim , and self-denial , without some ulterior object to be attained I know nothing of . But the parties . They may be divided into balls , con- 140 The Vagabond. certs , literary receptions , and weddings . The first have been known the world over , and will last for ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they please , but the young will dance young New York especially . The women will say he dances like an angel , and dancing men will be invited ; no matter how great noodles they be ; the men will gaze with rapture at the exquisite grace of the fair divinities as they whirl in the maze ; while the lucky ones that whirl who shall describe their pleasure ? Not I. Young New York is celebrated for the excellence of its dancing . Mr. Bristed long ago made famous the rage for the polka in Fraser s Magazine ; and that waltz , so ugly to look at , so delightful to engage in , has stood its ground against all the moralists for a decade . Those who are left out are apt to say that the servants of Terpsichore could worship at no other shrine ; can dance but not talk . And indeed there are those who acquire great profi ciency in this accomplishment , but are not good for much else . Some dames are glad , they say , to have dancing and bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera or on the promenade , whom they are delighted to polk with , but are sure to be not at home if they call . They find a waltz very agree able in such company , but could not endure a visit . But if you think all the good dancers are fools , my friend , you are greatly mistaken . Some of the most brilliant people dance superbly ; the superiority they manifest in one thing is conspicuous in all . But why will they dance the German ? Of all the interminable and inextricable inventions that ever were known , the German bears the palm . And they dance Parties . 141 it with so much gusto ; from nine to one without a respite , not stopping for supper , and then not getting through ; not approaching the end of those three hundred figures . There is indeed a vague tradition that the German cotillion was once danced through by a set as indefatigable as the dervishes of the east in their saltatory devotions ; but some enterprising youth forthwith invented new figures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps upon Alps arose . Those who dance this , do well to seclude themselves , to give German parties where nothing else is done ; for to lookers-on at Vienna , to those Avho fear to trust themselves in the never-ending maze , to get down on their knees among the hoops , to wave banners in the eyes of the fair , to waltz with chairs for partners , tu dance under a nom de plume , to those who eschew all this , t is weary enough . But the German has the stamp of the highest fashion ; it is not known or prac tised outside of exclusive circles , and until it reaches others , it will be the rage . If the Lanciers could be introduced , I am sure that would be preferable . True , it is not so difficult , and does not so completely taboo those who do not essay it ; but the gay world need not hope to keep its favorite long to itself ; all its modes are imitated , and the outsiders will take even the pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ger mans do . And when outsiders learn that dance , the others will abandon it . Speed the day ! I have scarce left myself room to talk of the private concerts , which , however , I have already discussed when telling of the amateurs ; of the weddings which , sooth to say , are dull ; I admit all that the spitefulest 142 The Vagabond. old maid can say of them : five young women in a row , simpering and saying the same fine things to five hun dred people ; five young men for ever going back and forth like a pendulum between the door and the bride ; five hundred people puffing and perspiring constitute a wedding . Music and a table of presents , and a table of another sort , provide some sort of recreation ; but every wedding is like every other one ; two people are made happy and half a thousand miserable . Literary soirees , reading parties , private theatricals , tableaux , furnish too large a field to enter upon at the end of a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these things is gone by .

" TnE drama sprang from the dance , and religion has not , in all ages , disdained the aid of dancing men and danc ing women . Many are wont to call the ballet the last and most artificial refinement of modern civilization ; the very highest intoxication of pleasure ; the rarest spice in the cup , the maddest flavor in the wine of those to whom all other fascinations have palled . But though it may be and often is , as seductive as any of the delights of sense , it is far from being one peculiar to the nineteenth century , or to European culture and tastes . The choruses that Eschylus trained for the stage , the satyric dance , or , earlier yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and grace celebrated the rites sacred to the god of wine and mirth , bear witness to the early passion for this amusement a passion that must be instinctive with the race , since it has appeared alike among the classic nations of antiquity , in the barbaric splendors of oriental harems , and amid the elaborate elegance of the Parisian opera . 144 The Vagabond . The Greek chorus was similar in many things to the modern ballet ; the measured movement common in temple and theatre among the most careful students of art and pleasure in the ancient world , was not only the germ of tragedy , and so of all the great productions of Sophocles and Shakspeare , but itself a form of the same amusement which , to-day , after the lapse of thirty centuries , entrances crowds in the capital of the new world . How ineradicable must be the instinct " that prompted the sacred dances in the groves of Athens , that delighted the king of Judea till he sacrificed the head of a saint to the whim of a girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nile , and now excites a dollar-loving people to ecstasy as they gaze on the faultless form and bewitching grace of a foreign woman . Mankind is the same under all climes and all circumstances . I like to fancy that I share the pleasures of the gay and intellectual Athenian ; to know that what delighted Alcibiades affords me gratification ; that the dwellers in the luxury of a Sardanapalus revel led in no more exquisite " lusts of the eye , " than are now afforded to an American on the shore of that land not long ago rescued from the clutch of the red man . Some , I know , declare the ballet unnatural and awk ward . We all have read Carlyle s scathing criticism of the stage dance ; we all have heard our acquaintances dilate upon the absurdity of a woman sticking her leg up in the air , or walking on her toes . And , of course , as long as you talk of the ballet , you can ridicule it . It is in some respects unnatural ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no susceptibility to the fasci nations of form and color and motion may , very likely , The Ballet . 145 look on in amazement at what shall excite an uproar of applause in the theatre . Still , it is impossible that an amusement which has been found to possess such charms for the universal race , which is enjoyed alike by the wild savages of Otaheite and the most polished nations of modern times , which boasts to-day its triumphs in every capital in the world , which attracts crowds of those best versed in pleasure and most learned in art it is impossible that this should not have a basis somewhere in our nature . Its universality proves its naturalness . And even in the abstract , there is something to be said for it . It appeals to sense and feeling and taste . It is , indeed , like the opera , ridiculous if looked at logically ; nobody imagines that any dying Edgardo or Violetta would sing their souls away in strains like the Bel 1 alma or Gran Bio ; nobody imagines that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one leg , and flinging the other round the neck of a man . But for all that , the strains of " Lucia " and the " Traviata " do ravish and move the listeners ; for all that , the action of Cento and the grace of Carlotta Grisi set men s brains on fire . There is expression in the dance , there is meaning in the pantomime , there is soul in the ballet . Passion and sentiment and feeling are expressed not only in the eye and face , not only in the lithe form and exquisitely moulded limbs of beauty , but in the graceful motions and fascinating positions of the dance . Who that has seen the touching story of The Willies unfolded by Caroline Rousset , that has watched her floating , sylphlike gestures and delicate movements , but will acknow ledge the capabilities of the stage dance . Who that has been fired by the abandon and wild gipsy spirit /z/ 146 The Vagabond. of the Spanish Soto , but can tell of the delights of the ballet ? The furore created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and flowers and diamonds showered on Holla last Monday , the crowded theatres and prodigious applause that have rewarded her exertions since , re mind me of the triumphs of her predecessors , recall the days of other dancers now , alas ! grown stiff and old . I can just remember the sensation created by Elssler ; I know how the young men went mad , and the young women got jealous ; how the Park theatre was crowded nightly with the fashion and beauty of the town ; how they said the appearance of the divine Fanny was a new revelation ; how they talked of the antique statues inspired into motion ; how the greatest prudes took boxes , and the oldest fogies raved . But I could not then appreciate the excellences of the ballet : a third-rate dancer would have pleased me as well as the incomparable gyrations that have never since been equalled in America . Probably my brain would have been turned by Augusta as well as by Elssler ; the whirl of one s legs would have made me giddy as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably liked to see the performances of the Miss Madelines and Miss Adelines , the Ducys and Lucys who filled up the entr actes . The sparse allowance of petticoats undoubt edly excited my curiosity , and the sight of a woman s calf , covered only with flesh-colored hose , made my boyish blood run fast , though the steps its owner took were heavy and slow . However , custom blunts the edge of everything , and I got used to sights of . this description . After having stood behind the scenes talk- The Ballet . 147 ing to a ballet-girl while she chalked her shoes , and gone home with a bevy to supper all in their stage dresses , one isn t particularly interested in the perform ance as seen from the other side of the footlights .

The mystery is half the charm ; and when there was no mystery to me about these women , when I saw the ballet-master scold them at rehearsal , and observed their efforts in the morning to do what was to bring down the house in the evening , when I noticed the red and white chalk , the false eyelashes and the hired bouquets , there was no more enchantment . Then I longed for good danc ing ; then I discovered that Malvina s shape was bad , and Aldina s legs were long ; that one had big feet , and another moved heavily ; that this one was too stout , and the other so awkward ; then I waited for the Avatar of a new divinity . The Roussets , I think , came first after Elssler . The four sisters made an impression . Lecompte and Celeste and Augusta had been forgotten , and many who crowded to Niblo s to see " Catarina , " had never witnessed such dancing before . Then Adelaide , in her male attire , was very bewitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so exquisite as many that I have seen since , she was yet a fine dancer she was spirituel and delicate , more at home as Giselle than as " La Reine des Bandits ; " and though she led the evolutions of her military corps with skill and grace , though she danced 148 The Vagabond. the Manola with Adelaide with considerable spirit , her forte was rather in the waving , floating style ; she looked a very Giselle ; she seemed at times to have both feet off the stage , to be buoyed up in the air , so grace fully , so gradually , so exquisitely she moved . That excrescence of the ballet , a male dancer , was always got rid of in their performances the male dancers , who do nothing but spin around , till you wonder whether they will ever have done , and especially if they can ever get unwound again . Pougaud and Soto came together : fair examples of the French and Spanish styles ; the one all art , the other all fire ; the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and careful , and immodest and cold , dis playing her talent , making great efforts and superb poses , accomplishing whatever she aimed at , but doing it all for effect , and simpering and smirking for applause ; Soto , brimful of Andalusian animation , enthusiastic in her nature and passionate in her movements , whirling round in a perfect abandon , and whirling her audience invariably along with her , by far the most exciting dancer that I have ever seen . Too heavy to attempt the great achievements of her rival , not so lithe as many , and even lacking precision and aplomb , she yet flung her whole soul so into the dance , she so identified her self and her nationality with what she was about , that none could resist the entrainement . To see her come down the stage in the Manola , the very sound of the music of which is inspiriting and exciting to see her bright black eyes flash , and her Spanish blood mount into her cheek , as she whirled her body and flung her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a The Ballet . /z/ sight thai always made the house ring again . I have known the pit brought to their feet more than once by this dance . Pougaud s chef d oeuvre was the incanta tion scene in " Robert le Diable ; the enchantments of the wicked abbess , the unearthly wiles to lead a man to ruin , were the very ones her talent was fitted to portray . The insinuating grace , the seductive smile and action of Helena , have never been better given in New York than by Pougaud . I never wondered that Robert suc cumbed to such fascinations ; it would have been un manly to resist . Mathias , the exquisite pantomimist , the pretty Rus sian , never made so great a sensation as she ought to have done ; and Teresa Robert , the most perfect dancer of the French school that has ever been in New York , with the most faultlessly-formed limbs and the ugliest face imaginable , was not appreciated . They each drew immensely at first ; the town talked of them for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were no more thought of than if they had been second-rate . Whether Rolla will share their fate , remains to be seen . She is prettier than most of her predecessors ; she is well shaped ; she is refined and interesting ; she is full of expression in face and form ; her dancing all has meaning , but she does no wonders in her art . Her tours deforce are not equal to Robert s , and she has not the fire of Soto ; her chami consists in the exquisite and delicate expression of her dancing , in her little steps , and in her personal attractions . We don t have the grand ballet here yet , in the style in which it is given abroad . The principal artistes are excellent , but we want Cerito and Carlotta Grisi ; and 150 The Vagabond. more than that , we want the superlative splendors of the Parisian theatres .

When we have saltatory performances of this description , combined with the greatest artists in the world , as they say we shall have next winter , the ballet will not lose its charms in a month , nor a dancer grow stale in her prime . /z/ " Look here upon this picture , and on this . " Hamlet . WHOEVER has read " Jane Eyre " ( and who has not ? ) will remember the vivid description of the draw ings that Rochester found in the portfolio of the homely little governess ; the wonderful character of those sketches ; the immense feeling that struggled for ex pression in lines and colors till it was spoken as plainly as in words . The same idea of painting which prompted these , was common to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purblind sisters , full of pent-up genius and character , poring over the few prints that fell in their way , and spelling out the meaning of the artist , guessing at the thoughts that . originated his work , or deciphering the enigma veiled in his outlines . If Patrick Bronte had accomplished what he so wildly longed for , what he so wildly cried for in that wonder ful letter to Wordsworth , which harrows up one s heart to read : if he had made himself a name as an artist , it would , I dare say , have been as a man of feeling , as a painter full of power and meaning . The Brontes were right ; all lonely in their llaworth parsonage , out of the way of art , they had learned art s highest teachings The Vagabond. from her sister , nature ; they had hit instinctively upon what some arrive not at , after years of labor and study the knowledge that art is useless save as the utter ance of thought , as the expression of feeling , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every one of its departments ; elocution is not acting , so Mr. Wallack is infinitely infe rior to young Booth in essentials ; words are not poetry , so Pope , with all his cultivated numbers , is tame by comparison with the stammerings of Shelley ; science is not music , and the elaborate learning of Mercadante , and sometimes of Mendelssohn , is sounding brass and tinkling cymbal , to the melody that scintillates all through Verdi or Rossini . But in painting especially , the difference is eternal and the distance impassable be tween the true and its imitation . He who has nothing to say , no thought to utter , no feeling to express , may as well abandon his pallet and pencil . He may color and draw , he may elaborate with the painstaking fide lity of a Denner or a Mr. Hill , he may rival the effects of the daguerreotype , but he will give only the body without the soul . Without the inspiration which never is acquired , his color will be cold and his drawing stiff " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life , the breath , the spirit will be lacking . The statue will never speak to its Praxiteles ; the fire will never be in fused unless Prometheus steal it from the gods . All that I look for in the Academy of Design is some trace of this fire ; some spark , some show of feeling or of thought . The closest outside imitation without it affects me not , and one touch of nature gives me more pleasure than the most elaborate results of skill . I had rather The National Academy of Design . 153 see even a misshapen creation like that of Frankenstein , grotesque and monstrous , but yet alive , than the finest of fantoccini or the best dressed wax doll . I discuss no technicalities , for general criticism should be general , not technical . The student of an ai t is expected to master its secrets and be acquainted with its details ; but others , whatever interest they may feel in the sub ject , care for it only as it affects them and in its results ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic s function is to discuss the aim and object of art , not to descant upon the means by which that object is attained ; to appre ciate the beauties of a picture or a statue , to point out its faults , and impartially to discriminate between the true and the false , the beautiful and the plain ; but it is the province of the professor to say how the form should be rounded and where the color shoiild be laid on . Criti cism for artists exclusively , may be concerned with the study , the practice , the efforts , the labor . Criticism in general is concerned with the result . But because a man does not understand how to compose an opera is no reason why he shall not appreciate its beauties ; because I may draw worse than Ruskin says Claude Lorraine does , is not to say I can not tell a line of enchanting grace when I see it . The present exhibition at the Academy is an encou raging one ; there is more excellence than I have noted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More of the portraits have character , more of the landscapes reflect the spirit of nature . And of all in the galleries , that which is the fullest of feeling , at once the truest to externals , and the most instinct with expression per haps the most instinct with expression because the truest /z/ 14 The Vagabond. to externals is Mr. Church s " Andes of Ecuador . " His recent works place this artist at the head of American landscape painters ; and it is as landscape painters only that our artists have yet achieved any place ; it is in landscapes only that they have suc ceeded in caging any of the indefinable , subtle some thing we call genius ; in landscapes only that ideas are embodied ; by them only that impressions , sentiments , feelings are conveyed . American portraits are not often portraits of men and women , but of faces and gowns features without soul , complexion without character . Our historical works are attempts , not achievements ; showing an ambition which , alas ! is worth nothing without the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretentious efforts after greatness , denominated historical pictures , bare or tawdry in conception , crude and stupid in execution , are not redeemed because their authors wanted to excel . It is hard of course for them that they did not , but they are damned nevertheless . Aim can not be accepted for accomplishment : indeed , without the latter , it only makes a man ridiculous ; and such , sooth to say , are too many historical painters . Convinced of this , they have of late eschewed the branch of art in which no excellence seems likely soon to be attained by Americans . But in landscapes the sky is brighter ; there is ample field ; there is inspiring theme ; there is nature fresh and young as ever , but doubly new and fresh to those who seek her in the new world . The Andes and the Niagara are fitting themes for an American artist , and have been fitly handled by Mr. Church . Who that stands before the picture I speak of , and gazes at the The National Academy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant out line melting into the clouds , the hazy peaks , the shim mering sun of the tropics , the gorgeous-tinted earth and sky , but must acknowledge that the artist has caught and conveyed a new feeling to the mind . His canvas lives . You forget to discuss the admirable perspective ; the curious manner in which the fore ground is made to contribute to the general effect ; the mystery of tone which is hung over the picture like a curtain , subduing and mellowing every tint to a subor dinate effect ; the exquisite drawing of the hills , re minding you of Ruskin s simile of rocks like ribs clothed in living flesh , and swelling beneath the life-like garment all these are lost in the general effect . Some quarrel with Mr. Church that he makes everything sub ordinate to effect : that is , that soul is more to him than body ; but not so I. His pictures speak their meaning , have an influence , excite feelings , and even if sometimes his skies are impossible , or his foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , his works yet answer the higher purpose of awakening the same emotion which the sight of the landscape itself would inspire . This is art s noblest , truest function ; not to imitate nature , but to rival it . Mr. Durand is worthily represented , although his pro ductions are scarcely as much individualized as usual ; for sometimes they are individualized to such a degree as to be just on this side of mannerisms , but on this side still . He looks not at nature in the wilder , warmer aspects that most strike his younger peer . He wants quiet , refreshing glimpses ; June-like views , graceful elm trees , browsing cattle , gentle streams ; but he as 156 The Vagabond. truly mirrors nature . He catches another phase quite as successfully ; he sees her not in so imposing a garb ; he is not like Moses , who looked on God unveiled ; lie enters not the holy of holies barefoot ; but he is a true worshipper at the shrine . He can not paint a storm without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calming influence ; he soothes perturbed spirits ; he , too , is a real artist . Kensett is the other member of the trinity of land scape painters who excel all their brethren in this de partment . He is not so sumptuous in his tastes as Church , nor so like Goldsmith in his influence as Durand . He chooses not to portray the tropical atmo sphere nor the peculiarities of autumnal glories ; he is aflected not by placid lakes and softened hills ; he prefers wildness , but not the very wildness of Niagara ; a White Mountain view , with rough , precipitous sides , and scraggy rocks and stunted foliage , with black look ing tarns and racing torrents , a real American view . His masterpiece of last year was , however , finer than his best picture in the present exhibition . There was about it the same unity of feeling , the same harmony of conception , the same originality of treatment , and an apparently keener appreciation of the spirit of the place . A still greater seclusion appeared to pervade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , a blacker shade hung over the pool . He is perhaps quite as essentially American in his landscapes as either of the other two great artists who lead the van . Mr. Grey is the first of our colorists . His pictures all have a magical influence on me ; they leave a deep impression ; they strike me instantly and unmistakably . The National Academy of Design 157 He is called a mannerist , an imitator of old painters ; but , if it is imitation , it is such as no countryman of his can equal . If it is a mannerism it is full of character . He is not pretty in treatment , but effective ; he under stands tone , not as if taught , but as if inspired . What he does is not the result of labor , or others would share in his success . He has great merits in drawing also , but lacks , sadly lacks , expression . His " Hagar " is full of beauties of tone , is nicely drawn sometimes charm ingly but it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hagar . " His portraits are rather types of a class than absolute individualities . He is excelled in this respect by Elliott and Huntingdon , who give us the man especially wherein he differs from others . They discern what makes a man himself , what constitutes character ; they have the rare faculty of peering through the countenance into lines that lie deeper than features , and it is these Hires that they reproduce on canvas . This makes their portraits , portraits ; this sets them so far above others who attempt the same thing . Many of the other pictures have merit , but it is use less to catalogue them here ; I only attempt to say when one seems to me to rise far above the mass . I find much that interests me not ; but , on the whole , good cause for encouragement ; no reason to retract what I said two weeks ago of an onward movement in Ameri can art . The three landscapes of Church , Durand , and Kensett are alone enough to assure me that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; That is , a woman . " Measure for Measure . IT is now ten years since " Jane Eyre " was given to the woi ld ; but Avho does not remember the marvellous success of that marvellous production ? Who does not still more distinctly remember its effect upon himself ? For it is a work of genius ; it is one of those things that speak direct to the individual ; that penetrate through all swaddlings of circumstance and education ; that have a universal voice ; that affect the innermost nature . High and low , rich and poor , old and young , illiterate and educated , were all touched ; a chord was struck that vibrated in every heart . Since then other powerful books have come to us from the same pen ; " Shirley " and " Villette " also were full of the wonder ful influence , the magnetism of genius ; bespoke the same intense nature that was revealed in their pre decessor ; awoke responsive emotions in bosoms whose throbs the world never knew of , in breasts all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then came the first few intimations that the public got of the personality of the great writer ; her name , her age , her residence , and at last a voice in her own proper charac- Charlotte Bronte. 159 ter the preface to her sister s works . In this spoke out again the compressed feeling which had been the secret of " Jane Eyre s " power . However , only a few words were said ; and soon after followed the news that Charlotte Bronte was dead . Mrs. Gaskill s remarkable biography let us into the secrets of her character ; told us the story of that lonely parsonage among the York shire hills ; described the three caged sisters , full of repressed genius and feeling , pent up in their little par lor at Haworth , pacing up and down like wild beasts eager to be free , and with emotions quite as restless as themselves raging within their breasts as complete and sad a picture as exists in the history of English lite rature . And now , we have " The Professor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , coining to us with a peculiar interest since we have studied the character of its writer ; a book which read by the light the biography throws across its pages is full of as strange significance as any in the language . All of Charlotte Bronte s books are full of person ality . The author looked into her own heart , and por trayed what she saw , and felt , and was ; you believe in the reality of what she says , and therefore acknowledge her sway . One got to know much of her from her works , before the biography revealed her innermost nature . But when that singular production displayed the entire and uneventful career of Currer Bell ; when it laid bare her every feeling and thought ; when it dis closed the most secret recesses of her character , we seemed admitted to a confidence generally bestowed only on the nearest and dearest of friends . " The Pro fessor , " however , goes even a step beyond ; you can 160 The Vagabond. know the woman now even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , secrets of feeling , and tl ought , and passion , that none ever disclose to any friend . The veil is torn away from the most private and sacred parts of her nature ; everything is uncovered to the glaring light of publicity ; every stranger can rudely venture in and trace the growth of character , can watch the throbs of passion , the development of ideas in a being so strangely sensitive , so morbidly inclined to shrink from just this gaze . I feel , in reading " The Professor , " as if I were intruding where I had no right to be . You absolutely know the woman better than she could her self . You can say what incident in her real life sug gested this fictitious circumstance ; what throb prompted this burning line ; what nerve , touched to the qitick , started these words that speak and flash so vividly . And she , Charlotte Bronte , the reserved , undemonstra tive Avoman , who kept her feelings and her passions pent up and hidden , she to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cold , and ex posed , panting and bleeding , to the curiosity of the multitude ! They were strange friends who had such ideas of the duties of friends . And yet the fascination in the nature of the woman , and in her genius , the magnetic influence of human sympathy , will not let me turn away . Since those whose duty it was to decently close the eyes of the dead and bury her quietly , have chosen to strip off the shroud , and offer her form to the dissecting-knife , why should we hesitate to learn a lesson of human nature thus thrust upon us ? Let us approach reverently as is due to the genius , delicately as beseems the sex , truthfully as Charlotte Bronte. 161 befits the nature of her of whom I speak . CouH I mtch the spirit that animated Charlotte Bronte that earnest , honest spirit though her surpassing power of course would dazzle , that spirit might animate me , and help me to do her a measure of justice . The womanliness of Charlotte Bronte first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of wo manly feeling ; the height of womanly passion ; the way in which she has put herself into her books , little sus pecting that a key should afterwards be offered to the world which would unlock every mystery she chose to hint at in her words . The revelation of character is marvellous . The tenderer feminine traits are not so manifest , but the earnest ones of woman are all de veloped : the clinging with the whole soul around what she loves ; the eager reception of a passion ; the absorp tion of it into her nature ; the identification of herself with its object in a word , what constitutes the truest and noblest part of the truest and noblest woman . De monstrations are not common , are not lavished openly and freely : the first indications of any passions are repressed , confidence is not sought , but the tremendous force , the cataract of feeling at last sweeps everything before it , and rises to the heights of the loftiest tragedy . This I call one phase of woman s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who bestow not tears and kisses daily and nightly ; who have none of the youthful exuberance of Juliet ; who sternly repress what emotions sprout up , but who , in the whirlwind of pas sion , are all the more terrible from their usual calm ; who hide under equable exteriors , under the crust of quiet , a very volcano of feeling ; and such a woman 162 The Vagabond . Jane Eyre was painted , such a woman is everywhere developed in the works of Currer Bell , such a woman was Charlotte Bronte . For she nowhere creates ; she had not , in so great a degree as the world has thought , the inventive faculty ; she transcribes herself , her own emotions , her own feel ings , and ideas ; she pecks at her own breast for the lifeblood that warms her productions ; she clothes with living flesh not the figures of her fancy , but those that stood out in her memory . Here again I discern the woman ; man creates , woman receives ; one makes im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won derful genius is true to her womanly nature . She has none of the Shaksperean faculty , none of the universality of Goethe ; she does not beget a varied crowd of cha racters ; she does not speak into existence those whose identity is for ever established , and whose variety is as remarkable as their actuality . It is a few homogeneous beings that she sets before us , all having the same cha racteristics , the same intensity , the same depth of cha racter , the same tendency to repress emotions , the same outwardly-forbidding aspect , the same condensed , crowded feeling , the same power which she found and felt in herself . Rochester and Jane Eyre are the same being different phases of Charlotte Bronte ; her person ality is what gives them life . And the after books are still repetitions , each one weaker than the last ( the woman again ) ; she had crowded herself into one effort ; she had expended the intensity of her nature in the one burst . You heard the cry and your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves answered ; you acknowledge all the wonderful passion and genius of the Charlotte Bronte. 163 woman , but what more has she done since than she did then ? And not only does she not create characters , not only does she copy from herself the most important indi viduals of her works , and from her own family or the few she met in boarding schools , the supernumeraries of her little stage ; but even her events and plots are , in a great measure , transcripts of real life . Doubtless , they are only the more real for this : incidents are given exactly as they occurred ; scenery is described till it is mirrored before you ; language is repeated exactly as it fell from the lips of her friends . Of course this power of reproducing is prodigious , is what accounts for the great effect of Charlotte Bronte s writings , but it is a distinct and separate thing from that other and higher power , possessed only by a chosen few , of creation . She exhibits only that phase of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she portrays with the faithfulness of a Dutch painter the scenes in which she had mingled ; she sets down like Denner every hair , and those who have been thus daguerreotyped complain of the forbidding truthfulness which points them out after the lapse of twenty years as her originals . Not mere daguerreotypes though , for Char lotte Bronte s pictures are all instinct with life , all full of feeling , all teem with suggestiveness . The closest observation of character in her is com bined with the most searching analysis of motives ; she has the faculty of seeing straight through all disguises to the very core of things ; she penetrates to the reality . The most retentive memory of events does not interfere with the ability to discover the significance of those 164 The Vagabond. events ; and though her sphere is narrow , within it she is absolute master . She rings the changes in a mourn ful key , and on one instrument ; she breathes always the same s/id strain , now fierce and frantic in its earnestness , now more terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind but with all the monotony there is tremendous power . The sadness again , is womanly ; the consciousness of power is in her ever attended by the sombre feeling of fate ; her novels are almost like the Greek tragedy in this respect ; her novels and her life are both for ever under this pall . Even in the wild exultation of Jane Eyre , you feel the foreboding of coming sorrow , and the chastened joy at the close of her career is surely such as men are not apt to be content with . The intensity of feeling everywhere evinced in the works of Charlotte Bronte is allied to a degree of coarseness ; the rush of emotions crushes out delicacy ; tenderness even is forgotten when a master passion seizes hold of the soul . And I confess these novels have al ways seemed to me such as a woman of great refine ment could not have written . There is a certain coarseness of feeling everywhere evident ; not surpris ing in one educated under the influences that surrounded the Bronte family , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great delicacy could do or de scribe things that Miss Bronte describes her heroines as doing . The very abruptness and intensity of her cha racters are not of the sort common in a society used to a polish always in some measure deceitful . I do not , how ever , here allude to formal refinements , but to absolute and innate delicacy , which was , in some degree , lacking Charlotte Bronte. 165 in Charlotte Bronte s character . In fact , her we manli ness was of a peculiar sort : it wanted some features which are commonly thought indispensable to true wo manliness . It was a type of an uncommon kind , but it was womanly , after all , rather than manly . I shall not now discuss the literary merits of her works . What need to dwell on the compressed energy of her style ; upon her terse , forcible prose ; upon the way in which character is again mirrored here ; upon the absence of useless ornament ; upon the significance she gives to natural scenery ; upon the life-likeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de scriptions . These , of course , were the means through which her genius got expression ; but I trench not now on the province of those who criticise the writer , I rather attempt to say Avhat I think of the woman ; to tell my idea of her character . All artists , of course , dis play themselves in their works ; but in Charlotte Bronte , character and genius were so nearly allied as to become almost identical ; you could not say where one ceased and the other began ; you could not tell which it was that aifected you ; you only knew the effect . You mar velled at the insight into character , at the penetration that discovered , and the skill that portrayed motives ; you yielded to the sway of the hand that was placed beneath your heart and gathered up the strings to wrench them ; you submitted to the sympathetic influence , and for getting to criticise , became the willing subject of a magnetism more subtle at once and more powerful than any known to magicians or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and cried out " This is the finger of God .

Seriously though will you not oblige me ?

Could you Then follows a list of the artists and their works , and their studios ; after which my correspondent proceeds : " Have I failed in tempting you sufficiently , and in failing have I also betrayed which of these gentlemen it is that I am desirous should possess your good opinion ? I hope not with all my heart , and trust that yours will not permit you to refuse me , then like all the rest of the world , I shall not only sing the Vagabond s praises , but thank him heartily too . /z/ 168 The Vagabond . I beg my readers to observe the profusion of itali cised words and the scarcity of commas , together fur nishing incontestable proof of the sex of Norah , if any were wanting after that eminently feminine letter . And is not the letter itself irresistible ? It was to me .

Had I then been con tent , all would have been well ; but I must needs write a " Vagabond " article , mentioning these facts , when in stantly there came upon me a shower of letters , two of which I append . The first is from the indignant artist : " And must I ravel out My weaved up follies ? " It appears I must , that is if such a piece of folly as mine can be raveled - out , for while I simply wrote to thank you for what seemed to be a disinterested love of Art and its progress , I was egregiously fooled and find from your own statement that your kindness was no kindness at all , but merely a desire to please an unknown correspon dent who nattered you into flattering me .

Next came a letter on pink paper , some time in June ; t was just after I had discoursed about parties , and my unknown friend was angry because I defended small talk .

Doubtless I shall be inundated with letters next week ; but I warn the dear creatures who expect to see them selves in print , that unless they are as clever as Norah , their expectations will be disappointed .

" Henry V. AND what should set one to babbling of green fields if not the heats of July ? What should incline the swelter ing denizen of the hot city to dream of thick shades and overhanging branches , of running streams and rustling gales , if not the blazing of the dog star and the sun that shimmers down so fiercely on streets and paving stones ? I know , indeed , that banished Bolingbroke cried out when John of Gaunt would have consoled him , he could not hold a fire in his hand by thinking of the frosty Caucasus : but is it always so , that apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse ?

I look down into the green , glassy depths , and expect to see the outskirts of a coral grove , or hear a song wafted upwards from the sea king s palace ; and rolling , turn ing , over and over , round and round , in the liquid ele ment , I fancy I feel the metamorphosis begin I am my self becoming a sprite .

I turn upon my back , and folding my arms , float for a while , looking up into the blue sky , and fancy myself suspended in mid air , almost immaterial , almost flying . A moment ago , speeding along through the water like a dolphin , or a sea god in chase of a nymph , full of life , and my blood 176 The Vagabond. coursing quickly , though coolly , through my veins ; now lying in one element and gazing into another , languidly , or at least luxuriously , borne on by the current . I think of Egeria , and Neptune , and Arethusa , and all the beau tiful mythology of the sea , so much more exquisite , so much more vraisemblable than fairy lore of the land .

Leave that for Broadway or Saratoga ; we are far enough from either . Away from the road , with no danger of meet ing a fine carriage full of fine people , whp would stare , perhaps , at our plight ; away from farm houses , and louts who would bellow to us to get out of that corn , or off of those potatoes , we rambled . Into the woods and among the underbrush ; on the border of a stream whose tinkle we heard in the high grass ; trampling the blue flags and splashing among the bull-frogs ; every now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeds , or getting frightened ourselves at a sudden frisk of a grasshopper , as he came plump in our faces . Now we can scarcely make our way through the thick growth of shrubs ; the branches fly back in our eyes ; the grass is higher than our heads , and here we go , knee-keep in the marsh ; we must be near the stream . We stand still to listen ; the crows caw , and the blackbirds whistle , and the frogs croak , and the grasshoppers sing , and the wind rustles so that we can scarcely catch the purling sound ; but at last my ear distinguishes the clear sweet ripple , and in a minute more we have found the daik waters of the brook . A drink , of course ; and lying flat on the earth , we lap up the cool water , and moisten our faces , and look in the mirror that Indian girls use , and wonder who 178 The Vagabond. would recognise the sun-burnt , smeared visages there reflected for habitues of the town . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Isaac Walton for a while ; but fishing is too calm a pleasure for me .

Besides , my pole always breaks , and my line is sure to get entangled in the branches , and I never drop it in the right place , and I can never get the right bait , and the fish will never bite . So I would rather stroll till I am tired , and then fling myself down on the green bank-side , and watch the stream as it glides or rolls along ; sometimes turning over towards an opening in the trees and gazing at a distant hill-top , more often looking straight up into the branches , and counting the leaves , and tracing the form of the tree through the foliage , or noting the delicate harmonies of color the sad shading of the bark , the rich tint of the leaves , and the exquisite effect produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shakes light and color down on me .

I retain a vivid recollection of the whippings I got as a boy for this very thing , and the charm hasn t worn away yet . I dashed in yesterday with as much glee as if I expected to be spanked when I got home . Up the stream then , to a mimic falls , where the brook widens and divides ; where an island of rocks deepens the channel , and a tiny cataract eddies and foams and gurgles in the prettiest way imaginable . The trees meet overhead , the shade is thick , and only glimpses here and there of blue sky can be got ; only here and there a ray of the broad sunlight fleckers the wave and makes it seem to dance more mer rily .

I have seen Niagara and St. Anthony , the St. Lawrence and the Ohio , since I used to wonder at the Little Falls , but I liked them as well as ever yes terday. /z/ " Art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too ! " Much Ado About Nothing . A VAGABOND may go to Saratoga , I suppose . He may drive , and driiik the waters , may he not ?

True , you will be bored by stupid and vulgar people , who go to the watering-places as they go everywhere else . I have no doubt there will be some in heaven ; but would you stay away on that account ? True , you are incessantly annoyed by the consciousness of suffering unconscionable extortions ; you are handed over to Morris if you want a seat at the grand dinner , and after you have bargained with him to his heart s content , you walk in and expect to be supplied .

All this is vexatious , I admit .

You are colonized , perhaps ; sent off to sleep far away from your hotel , and compelled four or five times a day to run the gauntlet of innumerable eyes as you pass to the colony , before the luckier ones , who only mount a few stories when they want to dress . If you dislike dancing and gaiety ; if you have a horror of pretty women and crinoline ; if you are a misanthrope come to drink the waters , and incensed at your happy fellow creatures who have no need to drink them ; if you are suffering from the gout , or some other complaint brought on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay are now sharing around you ; of course all this life and excitement , this constant change , this amusement , annoys you , adds to your misery .

But no such testy old curmudgeon reads the Vaga bond s papers ; if any ever took one up , he quickly threw it down again , exclaiming " The forward youngster ! the 182 The Vagabond. foolish ignoramus ! " The Vagabond writes not for those who see the world through the glasses that discolor and distort : the Vagabond , mayhap , looks with no certain vision or correct gaze , but he sees such beautiful sights that he would not exchange his eyes , imperfect though they be , for the experienced ones of any grumbler in Christendom . The Vagabond sees as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in his company ; that a goodly number feel with him , think with him , en joy with him ; are enthusiastic and eager , foolish and fickle , it may be , but they enjoy themselves ; they are a class , and why not write for them ?

And the early morning hour ! meeting X. at the springs before breakfast , while the band is playing ; watching her in that exquisite morning costume , a piece of good fortune you don t often enjoy in town ; and if you will , quizzing your acquaintances as they make wry faces over the thirteenth glass .

Another phase not many have watched , I fancy : not many have gone to the springs in the evening , when the ladies maids drink the water . It is delightful to see the Abigails promenade down the hill . As their mis tresses wear no bonnets at Saratoga , the servants are of course in the mode ; they have thrown their coarse shawls over their shoulders in humble imitation of that graceful negligence which was so irresistible in the morning ; and , indeed , I saw more than one elegant lace that I had worshipped because it enveloped the form of some Norah or Fanny , wound around a great , coarse creature later in the day . Then they play off their airs at second-hand in the most amusing manner ; they inquire how their friends are affected by the waters ; they ask how you like the hotel ; whether you prefer Saratoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watering-places this year . 184 The Vagabond . Newport has delights all its own : the magnificent drives and the invigorating , exhilarating bath . One of the oddest sights in the world is the crowd assembled daily on the Newport beach to bathe . First , there is the long , hard , smooth beach , with the great , green waves rolling mightily up , and breaking in a line of surf on its edge ; there is the distant reach of the sea , and the fresh breeze cooling you on the hottest of August mornings . In the back-ground , the row of quaint little bathing-houses , as small as the prison cells at Auburn or Sing-Sing . Into these enter the gay children of fashion , sometimes bedight with care , and gather up their extended robes as they crowd through the narrow door , or stoop their lofty heads for luck ; and save a few stragglers or lookers on , the beach is nearly bare , for a while . One , here and there , more expeditious than the others , first peeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the brilliant but terfly is gone , and a thin , lank figure , ridiculously clad , scarcely reminds us of the elegant creature that disap peared so short a while ago . While we are wondering and laughing at the metamorphosis , a whole troop sal lies forth , looking as wild and uncouth as Indians ; bare-footed ( delicate , tiny , white feet you can see , if you look sharp ) , bare-headed , or else with the oddest of straw hats tied down in the oddest of fashions , and such robes ! Turkish trousers and Spanish doublet , a cosmopolitan costume . You can scarcely tell a man from a woman ; you can scarcely distinguish your acquaintances . You can not find the graceful charmer who was to be your partner in the bath ! Ah ! here she comes , shambling along ; her eyes , however , sparkle as The Watering-places. 185 brightly as ever ; you would know her anywhere by them ; and taking her hand ( how soft it is , to be sure , and how tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sea . But we are to be lookers-on to-day ; we are to notice the comical figures of our friends as they rush in and out ; the ungainly attempts at dignity of some in their unwonted costume ; the gleesome , childish folly , and frolic of the others . We are to hear the laughing tones , the occasional whoop of fun , the scream of . half-felt ter ror from some timorous maiden , as her lusty lover plunges the little head into the tenth wave . We are to watch the sports till the bathers are tired , and then we have a sport of our own . It was funny to see them go in ; to notice the attempts at finery and the fanciful dresses ; the pink trimmings and the blue bind ings . But what is it to see them come out ? Their dark , dripping garments clinging close to the form , re vealing every outline , and that not gracefully ; their hats broken , and their hair , mayhap , dishevelled ; their feet tender and tripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet not more than half ashamed ; too busy laughing at each other to care for themselves , they run up hastily to their little dens . One or two fat old dowagers endeavor to stalk statelily , but , unluckily , waddle instead . One or two incorrigibly vain maidens endeavor to pull out the wet trousers from their legs , and spread the scant allowance of skirt into an imitation of crinoline ; but they only make themselves more ridi culous . The best way is to accept the unavoidable evil , and laugh at it . You are ridiculous in bathing costume , certainly . If you are as graceful as a houri , or as finely i86 The Vagabond. formed as Apollo , your grace and beauty are effectually concealed . The bath is fine while you are in the water , but marvellously relaxing in its effect afterwards .

The proces sion of carriages filled with gay and beautiful faces , recruited from each hotel , winds along , it may be to the old fort , to listen to the music , or to Bateman s , to look at the sea .

The sea views are superb , and the air so invigorating , the roll of the waves so musical , the glance at the white , tossing crests so inspiring , that I won der not it is a favorite .

Perhaps t is so . /z/ " That s the scene that I would see . " Much Ado About Nothing . I RECOLLECT once watching a distinguished historian peep through the crevices in his stage-box , poke his fin gers into a hole in the wall , and spend nearly the entire act of a play in vain endeavors to peer behind the scenes . He took off his gloves , he tried opera-glass and eye-glass , he was as persevering as Robert Bruce , or his spider , but less fortunate , and at last was fain to content himself with the performance on the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to penetrate the mys teries of that hidden world ? Who has not been curi ous about the coulisses f Who has not wondered what they do in the green-room and at rehearsal ? The plays that pretend to give pictures of an actor s life are always popular ; the novels that treat of similar subjects are sure to be read . The success of Peg Woffington was half attributable to its vivid descriptions of the demi-monde . And how delighted we all were to see Rachel in " Adrienne Lecouvreur , " studying her part of Roxane . To be sure Pendennis got disenchanted when he met the Fotheringay off the stage , and George Sand describes a theatre by daylight as the most doleful of places : I never shall forget the dismal impression I got from reading the i88 The Vagabond. pages in " Consuelo , " where the Berlin theatre is so grimly portrayed . But the reality is not so bad . Ask Wilhelm Meister . The first time I ever was behind the scenes was at the old Vauxhall Gardens , years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and without the knowledge of the attendants ; it was late in the afternoon , rehearsal was over , and nobody there . We rummaged the propertyroom , we discovered the theatrical wardrobe , we han dled the pulleys , and finally raised the curtain and acted a play . It was glorious sport ; I remember looking out of a stage balcony , and spouting verses to one of my comrades beneath ; I remember wearing a great wig and a sword , and that some of us were mufiied in ermine robes , and stalked majestically across the boards only my sword would get between my legs , and my fellow nearly broke his neck by falling through a trap-door . We especially liked to change the scenes ; the promp ter s bell rang every two or three minutes , and the curtain rose and fell amazingly often . Finally , we got more perfect in our parts , and determined to have an overture performed ; so one of us jumped into the orchestra , and found some instruments left there . The next thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " for he heard the loud bassoon , " and we scam pered away without regard to stage directions , or exits to the right . We stood not upon the order of our going ; but went at once . My hiding-place was in a barrel , prepared for the farce that night , and when I emerged I was blacker than soot . However , the usher did not discover our retreats , so we lay quiet until dark , and then ran home . That very night I sat in front , and how Behind the Scenes . 189 strangely familiar everything looked to me , who had been initiated . I wondered no longer at the apparitions , and was particularly indifferent to the balcony scene ; I recognised our ermine on the stage king , and thought of the trap-doors as he strode so bravely on . That adventure , however , was soon forgotten ; I had not thought of it in a dozen years till I sat down to write this paper . The next time I went into the cou lisses was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play was on ; I stood in the wings , among the scene-shifters and supernumeraries , the managers , and prompters , and call-boys all huddled together in strange confusion . Some were bedizened in theatrical tinery , others clad in ordinary gear ; a noble in silk and satin , and paste jewels , by the side of a workman with his sleeves rolled up ; Pizarro talking with Mr. Smith , and the principal actress scolding her waiting-maid . In the midst of my conversation with an actor , he would rush upon the stage , declaiming furiously , and , if the scene was short , return and take up his last remark exactly where it had been discontinued . What particu larly amazed me was the indifference of the actors to their parts . Poor innocent I , had imagined that they were all so in earnest , so devoted to their art , so identi fied with the characters they assumed , whereas they never seemed to think of them a moment after they left the stage . Before entering , they smoothed down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for a stage strut ; but as for any thought of Sir Peter Teazle or Claude Melnotte , in the wings , you might as well look for it at a Methodist camp-meeting . They would ask after brandy , or remark how poor the house 190 The Vagabond. was , or joke with the actresses , or swear at the scer.eshifters ; but the grace , or dignity , or fervor , so wonder ful or winning when seen from the front , was not percep tible behind the scenes . This is true , I suppose , of actors generally . But I have been with those who identified themselves with their parts . I have been shown to my box by Hamlet in all his trappings and suits of woe , and with all the courteous and princely demeanor that became the Dane . I have talked with Romeo in his dressingroom , when he could not and did not divest himself of his splendid manner or his intense feeling any more than of his doublet and hose . When Macready played Richelieu , he coughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tragic actors , too , are often excessively exhausted after playing ; not only physically fatigued , not only unable to rise without assistance , after a fall or a death-scene , but intellectually wearied as well . I have known them laid on a board panting and perspiring for some minutes after a great point . Talma , they say , had always to be wrapped in a cloak and car ried from the theatre ; Mrs. Siddons would sob for an hour after one of her great performances ; and I have been with some of these geniuses who were excessively excited , as if by wine , for half the night , after the play . The immense tax upon nerve and brain , as well as the corporeal exertion necessary in the playing of great parts , of course makes them strangely unlike the rest of the world . And how strange a thing it is , this genius ! You may be talking all day with a man or woman , perhaps study ing with them the very part they are to play at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , criticising their con ceptions , and then go and see them transformed , cry over the very line you thought they misapprehended , shudder at the gesture you declared would be ridicu lous , and applaud as vigorously as any one at the act ing you contended against all day . There is no form in which genius manifests itself so palpably as this of his trionic sort ; there is no phase of humanity that is more a mystery to me . What talent , or perseverance , or study can accomplish is not wonderful , is at least com prehensible . If you can not do it yourself , you can understand how it is done . But this marvellous inspira tion that comes down on a man as suddenly and strangely and unaccountably to the actor as to the audience that transfigures him before your face , like Rachel in " Polyeucte " or young Booth in " Richelieu " this surpasses in strangeness any other gift vouchsafed to the race . A man may write a poem , or paint a picture , that shall move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the palpable presence and influence of genius are not so felt as when it works on the man him self ; when his own soul and body are his tools and his material . Nothing in life or art strikes me as so wonderful . However , to go to rehearsal with these people who get so inspired ; to watch Othello mumbling his part , or Desdemona sitting down in a chair in the fifth act , and saying in ordinary tones , " Oh ! oh ! oh ! " these being the rehearsal of her death groans ; this is not so wonder ful . I was amazed , when I first went to a rehearsal , that no more labor was bestowed on the business . I went to the wings to see an actor whom I knew . He 192 The Vagabond. stood on the stage , talking with a well-dressed woman , and I concluded not to approach him . He looked at me and bowed , but did not offer to speak , and after a while I discovered that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of a speech from Shakspeare they interpolate directions to the other players ; they stop short in some exquisite line to sug gest an entrance from the left ; in fact , they rehearse only the words and the positions .

If a star is rehearsing , he gives his orders how he shall be supported , tells this poor devil when to approach and when to go , the other subordinates how to emphasize that line , so that star may not lose his point , and arranges matters generally so as to suit himself , and pro duce the greatest effect ; which is all very proper , but can not be extremely agreeable to the second-rate people , as they may be supposed to have sensibilities , if not position or talent .

Then DeSdemona can not be found , and the last speaker repeats his cue half a dozen times , while the call-boy looks for the gentle Desdemona , and she comes hurriedly on without Behind the Scenes . the handkerchief . If we stay for the farce , we shall see the stage manager paying more attention ; he has to be civil to the stars ; he can not interrupt them when their readings do not suit him , but he revenges himself upon the stock company .

" But , Lake George is new to me . Its enchanting love liness first broke upon my eyes last week ; I then first sailed on its placid waters , and watched the shadows as they fell upon its softened hills ; I last week first clam bered over the gentle slopes along its sides , and rambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brink of the cascades that fall into its bosom , and through the cool thickets , where I could gaze my fill at the witching and varying charms of nature in her most de lightful garb . Why , then , should I not tell how drunk I got with beauty ? Why should I not revive to those familiar with the effects of clouds , and hills , and sun shine , and moonlight , and clear water , and sparkling waves and mirrored groves , as they are all blended in Lake George . Lake George ; why should I not endeavor to recall to them arid me the charms so fresh and so enchanting ? Why should I not essay to picture to those who have not yet been gladdened by the delicious beauty of Horicon , the peculiarities that make it a spot unequalled in the New World ? Then , too , all things beautiful and fair are ever young , are always new ; we never tire of scenes familiar to us from childhood , if they possess a real loveliness . And nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various aspects , that it is sometimes worth while to know how she affects another mind . When one is thoroughly imbued with the spirit of a landscape , the earliest impression quite subsides ; the charm of novelty is gone , and in its stead that of friend ship and intimacy is substituted ; we are won by another guise than that by which we first were wooed . Let me then tell how the loveliest spot in America first im pressed the Vagabond . And first , I have never been abroad . I know of Como and Geneva , only by description , by pictures and by imagination . I have fancied for myself a lake in Italy , from hearing Claude Melnotte s exquisite story , as who has not ? I have studied prints of those Swiss views , till I almost know them . I am sure I shall greet Mont Blanc and Luzerne as old acquaintances . Byron has made me familiar with the monarch of mountains , and lovely women have told me tales of embosomed lakes and towering hills , of picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm of such association have become indelible in memory . Indeed , my recollec tions of Lake George are firmly fixed , if only because I heard an accomplished and beautiful creature recite 196 The Vagabond . " Manfred , " as we sailed together on its bosom , and compare the Highlands and Bolton with the hills around Geneva , Nature showered all delights on lucky me ; and I , perhaps , am not a fair judge of the beauties of Lake George : a tamer spot would have seemed superla tive . Still , others agree in remembering its charms ; only , if one wants to see it to the best advantage , he should be so fortunate as to go thither in company with those whose society and sympathy add a new zest to the highest pleasure . To one , then , who has no memories of Europe , but who has seen most that America claims of lovely or grand , Lake George seems lovelier , and if not grander , more absolutely natural than all besides . The natural ness is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate your village scenery ; I like nature unadorned . These detestable cottages and aspiring towns that infest all beautiful spots ; these intrusions of man into the sacred places of nature Actreon ever in Diana s bathingplace this thrusting of vulgar shops and hideous houses into the wildest recesses and most secluded groves , I can not abide . I want either town or country ; the ab solute , crowded excitement of a great city , or the pri vacy of woods and streams . Cultivated scenery has no charm for me ; farming countries and grazing countries , nicely-painted barns and wells , crowing cocks and grunt ing pigs I leave for those who affect domesticity ; who like Herring s pictures of farming life . I can not away with them . I want groves which you can fancy the dryads of antiquity would love to haunt ; streams that you look into in search of Arethusa ; spots where Titania and Puck may come upon you unawares ; river-sides Lake George . gj where the culprit fay might strive to catch the drop as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Lake George . When you glide over its waters , into some nook that reminds you of Virgil s exquisite " Est in secessulongo , " or peep between branches where the Mohicans would still find themselves at home , and where indeed the tra ditions of the red men yet linger , you can throw aside all thoughts of the outer world . No curling smoke re minds you of culinary proceedings ; no glaring , white washed boards recall petty village scandal ; no aping , gothic turret bespeaks the bad taste of aspiring citizens . You may sail between the islands , looking down into the clear water of the lake , and watch the fishes as they chase each other far below , or , mayhap , catch glimpses of the pebbly bottom ; you may gaze at the sky and banks reflected there , or looking upwards , watch the fleecy clouds lazily lingering on the mountain summit , or rolling serenely along in the higher ether . I was struck with the important part that clouds and sky bear in a landscape . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without imagining the firmament ; you never gaze , especially at a distant view , without taking in as much of heaven as earth . Not only do the shadows flecker the hillsides , and soften the outlines , and vary the effect ; not only do the clouds descend to the heaving bosom of earth as she holds it up to the sun ; not only are the blue ether and the white heaped up cumuli reflected in the mirroring lake ; but the sky itself , with the varying shades of rain cloud and fine cirri , the big , white billows of the cumulus , all enter 198 The Vagabond. into the composition of the scene . The peculiar effects of morning and evening skies , the gorgeous tints of sun rise and sunset , of course are as remarkable as any beauties of the lower world . All these I watched on Horicon . It rained one day on the distant hills , and so shut out a portion of the view ; but after a while , the soft grey curtain lifted , and showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A glimpse was all we caught , ere the cloud descended , and we were ourselves enveloped . I sat on the wide piazza , looking down the lake , to watch the breaking up of the rain storm ; to count the peaks a they came into view , seeming almost to descend to us out of the clouds ; to get sight of a patch here and there of woods , while all around was grey ; to see the first sunbeam strike the water , which gladly sparkled back in recognition ; to follow with my eyes the storm as it passed away , and left the surface of the lake glittering with a purer brightness , the wooded hills clad in a fresher green , the heavens refulgent with a clearer blue . Ah , me ! those rounded hills , that winding lake , those dotting islands ! How can I imagine them ! I have said nothing but what might be said of any lovely scene ; I have given no idea of the enchanting loveliness of Lake George . How can the fleeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words ? How can the evanescent glories of morning and evening be painted with pen or pencil ? How can the superlative grace , the wild picturesqueness of the masterpiece of God be described by a creature ? Man can only strive to ap preciate . And yet , I can not stop without again attempt ing to say wherein consists the peculiar charm of this Lake George . 199 charming spot . Its entire naturalness I have already adverted to : its fringed islands , scattered all around , and taking every form , add vastly to the effect . They are small and large , wooded and bare , rocky and plain ; narrowing the channel at times ; again , one just dotting the wide expanse . Some are covered to a considerable height with thick woods ; some just crested with a sparser foliage ; some so tiny , they were fit mooring for the bark of Oberon ; others suggest the ambush of a dusky tribe . Then the wonderful variety and exquisite forms that the hills assume , coming down at times to the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through which it winds almost like the Hudson at West Point ; rising again to a lofty height away off in the distance , and leaving the waters to spread out into a broader sheet . Now softly moulded into forms that remind you of the exquisite outlines of womanly grace , now jagged and abrupt , but ever beauteous rather than grand . The picturesqueness is always subdued into grace ; the wildness is , if not tamed , yet softened . It is the wildness of an Indian girl , fresh , exquisite in outline , charming in grace , varying in expression and tender in everything ; not the grandeur of a mountain , or a cataract , or a Mohican chief . Rightly was it named Horicon the sparkling water ; rightly was it called the Sacrament the sacred lake ; rightly do they baptize its jutting capes Sabbath day ; the stillness and the glad sparkle combine to make it a place for all pure and beautiful thoughts . /z/ " Respue , quod non es .

So I sometimes show the manu script of a paper to a confidante ( notice the final e ) and am sure to receive a sincere criticism . I told Confidante I was going to write about the Howadji . Confidante thought the subject was injudiciously chosen ; Vagabond could not discover the injudiciousness : Confidante insisted that the discussion would be too personal ; that I would descant upon Mr. Curtis as a lecturer and a political speaker , as well as a writer ; that there had been no recent event to render such a discussion timely ; that I had no right to say anything about him except in his literary character . Vagabond replied that Mr. Curtis s entire public career was fairly open to comment ; that he was a subject sure always to prove interesting ; and that he had within a short while afforded a topic of discussion to the newspapers by his political address at a college anniversary . Who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Curtis has been re- The Howadji. 201 garded by so many , has of late been diminished in certain quarters . The detour he has made into the domain of politics , has let slip the dogs of war upon him , and many think havoc was not cried in vain . I do not , indeed , consider his success entire in this new career . I heard him speak in the political campaign , a year ago , more than once or twice . I have read both of his scholarly and exquisitely beautiful , but illogical and ill-timed harangues before college societies ; and though I recog nise sufficient evidence of a riper mind and a more manly tone ; though the very thing that was previously lacking in his efforts appears now to be infused into them , a purpose and an aim ; yet so many tares are mingled with the wheat , he seems to me to have done so many of those things that he ought not to have done , that the doing of those things he ought to have done scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his political endeavors . The bad taste of intruding his own notions and forcing his own doc trines upon a mixed assembly , one anticipating a purely literary entertainment , can not be excused because of his sincerity , or because of his belief in the importance of his theme . Neither can his own eloquent apology be accept ed . I remember very well to have read the opening of his oration at Middleton till my blood tingled . I remem ber to have felt all the force of his splendid illustrations of the scholar s duty in a great crisis not to remain idle or indifferent . I acknowledge the poetry of his thoughts , the charm of his expressions , and the rich array of orna ments with which he set them forth . But supposing everything to have been as he claimed it ; supposing his ideas on politics to have been correct , and admitting the 2O2 The Vagabond. force of his adjurations and illustrations , I could not dis cover their pertinency . He proclaimed the scholar s duty , but that duty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that Mr. Curtis selected . All that he said would have been appropriate at a political meeting , or in an assemblage of cultivated men convened to discuss public matters , or anticipating such an oration as Mr. Curtis delivered ; but , thrust upon an audience to many of whom it might have proved offensive , and to all of whom it must have been unex pected , it was ill-timed , ill-judged , and inappropriate . Neither do I think these efforts we*e successful , regarded simply as political efforts . That their literary merits are great is undoubted . They are finer written than any other of Mr. Curtis s productions ; they con tain passages full of genuine and tender feeling , and exquisite in melody as the syllables of Italian poetry ; they are rich in beautiful thoughts , and overlaid with orna ment ; at times indeed , rather profuse in embellishment , and so exceedingly mellifluous that the sweetness cloys ; at times so elaborate that the wealth of illustration seems almost ostentatious ; but , on the whole , delightful com positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he attempts to deal with harsher matter than is fit for his delicate handling . When he leaves his rounded periods and historical allusions , when he gets from Galileo and Milton , and summer skies , and flowers and breezes , to political history and political economy , he is not so successful . His mind is not logical ; he can not make out his case ; he can not even make these heavier matters interesting . I have read many a political dis quisition , many of the speeches on both sides of last The Howadji. 203 year s campaign , many a newspaper article from the Charleston Mercury or the New York Tribune , that was vastly preferable to Mr. Curtis s attempts ; many an effort from the hands of men greatly his inferiors in ele gant culture or poetical fancy , that was more telling , more convincing , more successful than the political endeavors of the Howadji . His luxurious muse was more at home lounging on the banks of the Nile , or lotus-eating at the Catskills or Niagara . Yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his generous enthusiasm ; I believe him to have been very much in earnest ; I appreciated his fervor , and acknow ledge that he did , here and there , infuse some of it into his orations ; but it was in those portions less distinctly political ; it was when he could talk of Leonidas , or gild his phrase with the pomp of rhetoric . The Howadji has a youthful ardor which can not fail at times to stir the blood , but I do not think he possesses the rarer power of reaching the heart . His eloquence may in time be moulded into something like the per fection of Mr. Everett s style , which is that of Thalberg the most consummate art ; the very perfection of ela boration ; the crowning elegance that Cicero attained in his full and polished periods ; but Mr. Everett , though he is a prose poet , and pleases your fancy and tickles your ear , though he delights your taste and satisfies your intellect , never moves you , never comes near your heart . Nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last result of oratory . The way to the hearts of men is known but to few ; it is never discovered by research ; t is found by a clue that those who possess may use , but never impart . So , with all the warmth 204 The Vagabond. of Mr. Curtis , with all his earnestness , greater now than Everett s , he never seems to me to have hold of this clue through the labyrinthine passages that lead to the human heart . He seems not to possess genius . His political speeches , made at mass meetings , were not so fine as the more elaborate efforts I have spoken of ; they especially lack the Demosthenean vigor so ne cessary on the hustings . He spoke often in covered rooms and when the front seats were reserved for la dies , and he could not always refrain from saying a word or two for the ladies , whose especial favorite he is . His arguments were either derived from analogy , or weak ; his appeals invariably lacked force ; his highest sallies failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wittily , but too nicely for the occasion . Though he evidently took great pains not to be fine , though he tried hard to use cant terms and slang phrases , , they would not come readily from his tongue ; he could not speak the speech trippingly ; he could not saw the air with his hand thus ; he could not split the ears of the groundlings . And it is not only the groundlings who want their ears split at a political meeting ; the best in formed and the best cultured prefer a telling speech to an elaborate one . Mr. Curtis knows this as well as any one , and endeavored to conform himself to the require ments of the situation ; but nature did not second his endeavor . She had not intended him for this purpose , and would not allow him to wrest himself from what she designed ; so the Howadji did not succeed as a political speaker . His purely literary career has been often discussed ; in parlors and libraries as often as in newspapers and The Howadji. 205 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potiphar Papers " and the " Lotus Eating ; " all New York and Boston , and I do not know how many other cities , went to his lectures . I have recently read one or two of his works again : " Prue and I , " in its collected form , and the " Nile Xotes ; " one , among the earliest , the other almost the latest of his avowed productions . They are both characteristic . In both I find the same richness of fancy , the same sweet tooth that will have mellifluous phrases and gorgeous images . The pomp of the east and the luscious odor of the lotus , are renewed , and re vived , and repeated till one is sated . His luxuriant style is very well for a while , or at times , but palls at last . It is , however , relieved by a vein of sarcasm , to which he might with advantage more frequently resort . There is a point in his irony , a sharpness in his satire , that one relishes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cultivate this talent more assiduously , and let the other alone . The skill displayed in the " Potiphar Papers , " though it was the skill of a neophyte , yet would warrant him in making other eiForts . Though he was much given to exaggeration , and his satire often degenerated into caricature , there was still a wisdom in his wit , a likeness in his caricature , that proved he had not mistaken his talent . I like him better as an essayist or a sketcher of man ners than as a critic . I did not often agree with his judgment of the great novelists ; I could not set Dickens so far above Scott ; I did not find all the geniality in Thackeray that he discovered ; I do not recognise Kingslcy as a master spirit . I am not a disciple in that school in literature Avhose doctrines Mr. Curtis has so warmlj 206 The Vagabond. espoused . But it is not only because I do r.ot concur with his criticisms , that I do not admire them . I have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely disagreed . But I did not detect in Mr. Curtis s lectures any peculiar critical acumen ; he opened my eyes to no new merits in his subjects ; he dissected them not with any extraordinary skill ; he set their characters in no new light ; he gave me no new ideas about the modern British novelists . When he sketched the men or the times in which they lived , he was graceful and vivid ; he was always interesting and frequently witty ; but his lectures scarcely made a definite or an abiding impression ; they simply afforded an agreeable mode of spending an evening . I believe some work is reserved for Mr. Curtis more suited to his talent than any he has yet undertaken . I confess myself one of his admirers ; I find a fascina tion in almost everything he writes , though upon calmly considering it , I frequently see nothing so wonderful ; but the fascination proves the power : and there are thousands like me , in this regard . The man who can exert this influence must have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Spider-like , let him spin the web that shall entangle us all in its meshes . I , for one , am very willing to be enthralled . /z/ " DON PEDRO . Maybe she doth but counterfeit . CLAUDIO . Faith , like enough . " Much Ado About Nothing . I HAVE no doubt that many who witnessed Miss Cushman s performance of Meg Merrilies were glad to re mind themselves that what they saw was counterfeit ; they were glad to shake off the horrible impression left by that weird figure , that ghost-like movement , that crazy face , that shrieking voice . Many have told me that they could not sleep after seeing this acting ; the tall , gaunt gipsy haunted their dreams , the wild , un earthly tones startled them from their pillow , the fierce eyeballs glared through the dark night on them . Many , too , have told me that the acting is overdone ; that the conception and execution of this part are beyond what Scott imagined , are melodramatic , are too frightful to be natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strange a creation as that which Miss Gush man em bodies . I think the actress in this transcends the novel ist ; her imagination - is wilder than Scott s ; she docs carry his idea beyond anything indicated in " Guy Mannering . " But so much the more praise ; so much the more admiration have I for the actress who combines an imagination to conceive with the surpassing ability to 208 The Vagabond. execute so singular an idea as that of Meg Merrilies , That Miss Cushman s idea is exaggerated , I can not ad mit . It is utterly unlike anything not only on the stage , but with which in real life we are now familiar ; but I can find nothing in it extravagant . It verges upon the supernatural ; it is great enough for one of the witches of " Macbeth ; " it is as grotesquely terrible as Hecate herself ; but no more untrue to itself , no more unnatural when you consider the type , than the horrors of the Eunienides , or the grandeurs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest , and that inde finable something that invests the whole , and makes what would otherwise only be repelling , truly great ; that makes tragedy ; that is akin to the awe inspired by the " Inferno " of Dante , or the incantations of " Der Freischutz . " The embodiment of this idea is perfection . From the first rush upon the stage , which almost takes away your breath , and the fixed attitude , the strained limb and eye , when Meg recognises Harry Bertram , to the last shriek of exultation and the death rattle in her throat , all is great . Not only eminently effective at the moment , but vivid and wonderful in the recollection ; not only startling when you see it , but equally so when you think of it afterwards . The character loses its repulsiveness to me . I see the dirt and rags ; I see the wrinkles and elf-locks , the wild eye and the shrivelled limbs ; I hear the hoarse and broken tones of age and passion , the convulsive laughter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear more . I see the creature inspired to foretell and accomplish the restoration of an ancient house ; full of the passion of her race , yet with one Charlotte Cushman. 209 sympathy that connects her with humanity ; tender and earnest when she thinks of her bairn . The crooning over Bertram s hand , the tears that blind her eyes when she fain would gaze into his face , the sobs that choke her utterance in striving to speakhis name , make the old hag human ; awake sympathetic emo tions even for Meg Merrilies : for she owns an affection , that , in its holiness , as well as in its intensity , is anything but unnatural . The fact that Miss Cushman has contrived to crowd all this character into the few lines given her in the abortion of a play that is put upon the stage , makes her abilities all the more admirable . What Scott only hinted at , even in the pages of description and narrative allotted to Meg in the novel , the great actress has seized upon , amplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few words . Her marvellous talent for what is technically called " making up , " presents us with the picture that lives so indelibly in our memory ; her exquisite elocution enables her to accommodate her voice to the necessities of the unusual situations of the play , to break it with age , to thicken it with the choking sensation of death , to loosen it in the cry of agony , to repress it to the hollow murmur of despair ; while the genius that makes her feel so acutely the proprieties of the character is only equalled by the consummate art that dictates and accomplishes such touches as her sliding , sidelong gait ; her frantic but significant gestures ; her attitudes , so ungainly , but so wildly expressive , that they speak more forcibly than words . I can conceive of no more " exact , no more effective picture , than that afforded by Miss Cushman s performance of Meg Merrilies. 21 o The Vagabond . But in nothing else do I so admire her . In Romeo and Rosalind she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language and the sentiment , and especially of the wit of a part ; her gestures are always full of meaning , are always appropriate , are occasionally fine ; her intonations generally please a scholar and a man of taste ; but she entirely fails to move me in either part , and in her conception of each character she differs entirely from my own idea . Romeo , indeed , I have never seen played to suit me . I have seen one who looked a Romeo , who had all the beauty and voice I fancy in the love-sick Montague , but who failed entirely to infuse any spirit into the words he lavishes on his mistress ; and Miss Cushman so fails to look the charac ter , that this alone would prevent my deriving any satisfaction from her performance . Then her actions are not youthful , her manner not sprightly , her tones not spirited , her passion not intense enough for the lover of Verona . Her Rosalind lacks the captivating sim plicity , the arch coyness , that I look for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no comic talent . The lightness , the grace , the ease , the charming vivacity of comedy , are talents not vouchsafed to her who plays Meg Merrilies . Siddons and Rachel , before her , discovered that the tragic muse receives no divided homage . Neither am I so great an admirer of Miss Cushman in her more womanly characters . I prefer Miss Heron to her in Bianca , and Rachel in Tisbe . With her rendering of the former part , one could not but be greatly pleased ; I acknowledge the force and expres sion of her attitudes , the correctness of her gene- Charlotte Cushman. 2 1 1 ral conception , and , above all , the admirable taste of her reading . Everything indicated a careful student , an accomplished artist , one who appreciated thoroughly the thought of her author ; but the performance failed to affect me . I did not once experience that intense emotion Miss Heron caused in the same play . I re member distinctly that in all rendering of womanly feeling , in harrowing tenderness , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Heron was supe rior . She kept you in a constant state of excitement ; you had no time to criticise ; you were shivering or choking by turns . When Miss Cushman played Bianca , I was cold ; I admired , I observed , I perceived what was done and what was left undone ; I was on the look out for sensations that she did not arouse . And in Tisbe , oh ! how sadly I felt the contrast be tween her and the great Frenchwoman ! Miss Cush man was powerful , effective , excellent ; she gave a coarse picture in strong colors and masculine outlines , a wild , fierce creature , a real Bohemian ; but again she failed to move me , though I confess I saw handkerchiefs in use around me . But in this play I noted especially the inferiority of Miss Cushman , not only to Rachel , but to many other great geniuses of the stage . Here she was not truly tragic : she was only dramatic . She lacked entirely the classic grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she was earthly and common ; she was not at all imaginative . Rachel in Tisbe , was the very incarnation of Italy . The stately mistress of a Paduan duke , the haughty actress pour ing out curses on a guilty duchess , the suspicious crea ture glaring around the bedchamber of a rival , the 212 The Vagabond. gipsy s daughter saving her whom she hated , were by the great Jewess all rendered , not only so as to move you with terror and sympathy , but so as to provoke your admiration too . There was a symmetry , a statuesque beauty , an enchanting grace that one would look for in vain in Miss Cushman s Tisbe . I seldom have been able to detect true tenderness in Miss Cushman ; I have seldom noticed real womanly feeling . Those characters in which she excels are mas culine ; the Meg Merrilies has no touch of femininity ; and in whatever there is of great about anything else she does , it resembles or approaches this ; a tone , a ges ture , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is a person of unmistakable ability , but of very limited expression of that ability ; of much greater talent than genius ; whose excellences are mostly acquired ; of greater intellect than feeling ; possessed of profound insight into character , rather than inspired with an appreciation of it . She does things by rule ; she learns by heart ; she studies and perfects herself ; she is not of those whose limbs quiver with emotion they know not how , whose eyes light up with a fire that burns within them they know not whence , whose tones speak a passion that descends upon them irresistibly like the afflatus of a god . /z/ " For " Warwick is a subtle orator . " 3 Henry VI . THE palmy days of eloquence are past ; the press has become in a great measure the substitute for the orator .

Will you tell me that the speeches are reported , and so have their effect ? Yes , but what then becomes of the three essentials of oratory the action action ac tion of Demosthenes ? Delivery , according to Quintilian , is as important to the orator as invention ; but of what importance is delivery to the orator at Washington who addresses us in New York ?

Oratory that moved masses of men ; that was invented by the gods ; that was compared to the honey of Hybla and the afflatus of Apollo ; oratory , that persuades , and excites , and terri fies ; oratory like that which was sparkling in Sheridan , and scathing in Randolph , magnificent in Burke , insi nuating in Clay , overwhelming in Pitt , and everything all at once in Mirabeau !

The pulpit , one may say , still offers a field for the ora tor , and Spurgeon seems to prove it ; but people follow a popular preacher just as they go to the play , for an excitement . He may add to the number of his hearers , but not often to that of his denomination . The pulpit is either so soberly and staidly respectable as to be dull besides , or else affords only a momentary pleasure , some times intellectual and refined , sometimes impulsive and emotional . As to any permanent effect it produces , I confess I don t see much . To be sure , there is a natural disinclination to receive the distasteful doctrines we hear in church , and a still greater to follow the hard instructions we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the cause , very few pulpit orators expect to convert their hearers , and those few are disappointed .

The bar does afford scope for the orator ; limited it 216 The Vagabond. may be , but a talented or skilful orator may hope to change the opinions or influence the verdict of the twelve men in a jury-box ; upon his exertions does depend the success of his cause ; not only mediately his own reputation , but immediately the ruin or fortune of his client ; sometimes the life or death of a human being . Here the opportunity is as great as it was when Cicero spoke for Milo or Demosthenes against Midias ; here there is a field for the display of various abilities , and occasion to call them forth ; here is demand for feeling and earnestness ; and here by consequence we find them . Intellectual effort , of course , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only before a jury can the real orator find himself at home . It is true that there is an immense deal of public speaking in our day ; perhaps more here and now than ever before or anywhere else ; but this is because men like to hear fine things well said ; because the love for oratory is innate , like the gift itself ; because even if any absolute effect is hopeless , those who can speak must do so ; " it is in them , " as Sheridan said , " and it must come out of them . " And the rest of the world are as bent upon hearing as the orator upon speaking . It is for the gratification of taste , or the excitement of feeling , that we go to hear a great speaker , and it is because he is a great speaker that he declaims ; because he is prompted to it by his nature , because he can do it , because he must do it ; but he would do it vastly better , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly moved , if some great thing were to be achieved by his efforts .

The audience had paid their dollar apiece , and he truly said , so far as he was concerned , the object of the occasion was attained before he had spoken a word ! " What a condition for an orator ! But it exemplified entirely what I have been saying ; it proved that people went to hear him who is called the greatest American orator , just as they would go to see a great actor ; to be gratified or interested ; to receive an intellectual entertainment ; and that the greatest American orator spoke simply because he could speak well and wanted to ; but neither he nor they expected any ulterior results to come of his effort . Nobody will give a penny more to the poor because Mr. Everett lectured on charity . One would be more likely to do this after seeing the " Poor of New York " played .

You are delighted , you retain a vivid recollec tion of the grace of style and the poetic fancy , and the exquisite diction of the orator ; but anything more ? Mr. Everett has indeed done much for the memory of Washington . He has paid a splendid tribute to his name , and revived the recollections of his history ; he has presented a spectacle to the eyes of the world quite equal to the classic triumphs of antiquity ; an eloquent orator journeying all over this broad republic , and sum moning the people in every city to pay homage to the memory of its father and founder , he has laid on the tomb of Washington his worthiest eulogy . He has secured that tomb to be the property of the nation , and indissolubly linked his own memory with that of the great /z/ 218 The Vagabond. man he commemorates . When pilgrims from all parts of the world shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where repose the bones of him whose name and fame are the purest in history , they will fail not to remember that to the oratory and patriotism of Edward Everett they owe the opportunity . This is a worthy object to attain ; but it is not attained by the absolute effect the orator produces on his audiences ; as far as each audience is concerned , it is attained before they hear the oration . Mr. Everett is undoubtedly the man of all alive who has made oratory his greatest study ; who is most ambi tious of the fame of an orator ; who risks his reputation upon his oratorical efforts ; who bends all his energies and devotes all his faculties to the attainment of such a fame . And he has determined that the bar , the forum , and the pulpit furnish not the widest or the most effec tive theatre for oratorical display ; that no field for an eloquence such as that Avhich roused the Athenians or stirred the Quirites now exists ; that elaborate and grace ful orations are what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some men are more innately orators than he ; move their audiences more absolutely ; have more of the action which constitutes an orator ; the livecoal of genius is laid on other lips , the inspiration descends on other frames that are quivering with emo tion , and full of that magnetism which is sure to extend to the hearers ; but this is all momentary it passes away and leaves no trace behind ; while Mr. Everett s elegant and learned discourses are read next day , and their effect is as great then as it was the night before . Nothing with him depends on manner . To be sure , his Edward Everett . 219 voice , is agreeable , his gesticulation graceful , his utter ance measured , his bearing dignified , and his action ap propriate ; but he is not dramatic ; his elocution is not overpowering , his feeling not intense ; he is no orator as Brutus was ; he is not one of those who steal men s hearts or stir their blood , and yet he can create an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful recitation ol the long oration he has committed to memory , his nicely elaborated periods , his calm delivery , his finished style constitute a different thing from my idea of an orator , full of big , burning thoughts that come out in burning words , with fire in his eye , and fire in his gesture , and fire in his whole frame and fire in his soul . Who could report such a speaker ? Now Mr. Everett loses nothing in the report . He is simply a most elegant writer , a master of all the rhetorician s arts , a man of varied acquirements , among them not the least that of moulding into forms of exqui site music , and suggestive beauty the choicest words of the English tongue . He is a man of charming fancies , of true , and pure and lofty sentiment , of vivid imagina tion , of refined taste , but especially gifted with a delicate appreciation of the shades of difference in the significance of words and a marvellous faculty of selecting the very word out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as carefully joined together as a piece of mosaic Avork , in which each little stone must be of the very size and color or the effect is lost . Not only in these minutiae , however , is his taste apparent ; the selection of his themes , the division of his subjects , their appropriateness to the audiences before whom they are delivered , the fitness of his allusions and ornaments to whatever topic , the chaste , yet ornate beauties of his 22O The Vagabond. style , all these are evidences both of the elaborate care with which he has cultivated his natural gifts , and the taste which must have pre-existed to enable him to cul tivate to such good effect . He has , too , more than beauties of style ; he has beau ties of thought , beauties which constitute real eloquence ; ideas as truly poetical as any you will find in the writings of Spenser , or as exquisitely delicate as the fancies of Keats ; he pours out at times a torrent of charming figures , of lively images , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most musical and most appropri ate language ; such as I have never heard any other man utter , and such as I believe few living prose writers can equal . In this way is he truly eloquent . Gentle , grace ful , sometimes touching , his mind grapples not with great problems , nor seizes upon vigorous or tremendous thoughts . He is no Milton , no Dante , no Shakespeare in prose ; but a Gray , a Petrarch , or a Virgil . His in tellect resembles that of Cicero in some things , but lacks the profound philosophical turn , the originality of thought , and the energy of the great Roman orator . Sweet and tender at times , trite and tame it must be owned at others , neither uttering new ideas nor suggesting them , not attempting to arouse or excite his hearers , Mr. Everett is yet the finest and most accomplished writer of eloquence that America has produced . Among the speakers , he will not hold so high a rank . /z/ " Your gallery Have we passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SCULPTURE seems to be that form of art in which the American mind finds its most natural development ; that form , also , in which the American mind most delights ; the only form of art in which Europe recognises any excellence in American eifort . Whether there is any congruity between the nature of the art and the pecu liarities of our national mind ; whether there is a like ness between this embodiment in cold and passionless marble of human passion and human beauty , and the unrest , the excitement , the intensity of the yet unde monstrative American character ; or whether it is a fact that sculpture is an inferior art , as some proclaim , that it never can attain to the excellencies of painting , that it is second to painting , as comedy is to tragedy , it might be hard to say ; but whatever the explanation may be , it is true that we have taken onward steps , and arrived at a degree of excellence in sculpture , that is far enough from being attained in painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powers and Grcenough are known and admired where Durand and Allston were never heard of . The art , too , is appreciated 222 The Vagabond. among us by many who are blind to the harmonies of color and the exquisite beauties of tone . Form always seems first appreciated in the progress made by a nation in culture . The savages mould clay figures before they attempt to paint ; children admire tangible outlines be fore they recognise the excellencies of color or of light and shade ; and sculpture has always first attained per fection in a national histoiy , or at least has first been culti vated . It may be doubted whether the old Greeks ever knew the superlative excellence that since their day has been reached by painters ; the stories of their pic torial artists , of Zeuxis and Apelles , all give the idea that imitation was the great desideratum . They tell of grapes painted so that birds would peck at them , and curtains represented on their canvas so that even the judges were deceived , but they had no notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression we moderns have infused into music ; they dreamed not of harmonic combinations of sounds ; and many have doubted whether the harmonic combina tion of color , the art of putting expression upon canvas , was not also one of those mysteries that the art-loving , art-worshipping* Greek never solved . But sculpture reached its efflorescence in antiquity . The art culminated in the days when the Apollo and the Laocoon were carved . Yet I am far from believing with some , who , by their knowledge and appreciation of the beautiful , are well calculated to judge , that sculpture is inferior to any art . It comes before others in point of time ; but the sublimest utterings of poetry always precede the tamer . Homer came before Pindar , Shakepeare before Byron , the Golden Age before the Silver ; American Sculpture . 223 invention precedes elaboration ; eloquence has never since the days of Demosthenes attained such an excel lence or such an influence as it then knew ; but is the art inferior because it is a lost one ? Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the despair of modern builders ? . The mere fact that sculpture is the first in any national history to be culti vated , does not stamp it as inferior to painting . And can it be called inferior in beauty or expression , the two objects of all art ? To embody the beautiful , to express feeling , I take it to be the aim of art . Sculp ture certainly accomplishes both these aims by different means , but quite as fully , quite as admirably , as painting . Who that has looked upen even a cast of the Apollo Belvidere , will say of any canvas that it exceeds the marble , either in beauty or expression ? Who that has studied the Laocoon will prefer a picture ? I have felt the highest influences of art while gazing on copies from the antique , while studying the Torso , the Niobe , the Venus , but above and beyond anything , the Apollo and the Laocoon ; no more wonderful embodiments of pas sion , no more lofty images of beauty can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d.efinite idea than form ; it certainly is no more palpable ; it is certainly no more ideal than the pale , refined marble . Whether you ask for w r hat shall stand out like an actuality before the bodily eye , or whether you demand what shall satisfy the imagination and elevate the fancy by its exquisite ideality , sculpture will afford it . So the strivings of America in this direction are no evidences of inferiority ; true she has not yet created , probably she never will create another Apollo ; we have 224 The Vagabond. not the belief in gods who walk the earth , that the an cients had , to infuse life and divinity into our works . When a modern attempts the classic style , he may be severe and beautiful , but he never is so full of fire , and life and passion , as the old sculptors . The reason is pal pable . The ancients believed in the reality of these divinities ; they got inspired by their works : the mo derns are students only , not worshippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as none but a good Catholic could paint a good Madonna , none but a good Pagan could have given that wondrous life and godlike beauty to the Belvidere . The finest modern marbles are the " Christ and His Apostles , " of Thorwaldsen ; the reason is that Thorwaldsen s feelings and his faith were enlisted in the work . But Americans are no worse off than others when they copy the antique ; the rest of the world has fallen away from its belief in those grand old divinities that inspired Homer and Phidias ; Canova s Hebe is exquisite , but it is not Hebe ; Thor waldsen s classic bas-reliefs have all the grace , all the exquisite fancy of antiquity , but none of the soul . And all modern statuary is copied after the antique ; whether the subject be selected from classic pages or not , the style is always remodelled after classic origi nals ; for classic originals are perfection . But is , then , sculpture an art which has seen its best days ? Lacking the vital breath breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it became a living soul , must our modern art be only a copy , only a shadow , only a remembrance , an echo a beautiful transcript , but still a transcript ? American sculpture is as yet nothing more . Craw- American Sculpture . 225 ; ford , the most classic of our artists , so much adr lired at Rome , the favorite pupil of Thorwaldsen , he , whose loss the nation now deplores , Crawford , in his noblest efforts , created not . His " Orpheus , " one of the finest works of art ever executed by an American , one of the proudest trophies of modern statuary , is nothing but an imitation of the antique . It is exquisitely beautiful , severely classic , recals vividly to one s imagination the fable of Eurydice , delights the eye , but never has one suggestion of anything more ; never elevates , arouses , moves . And bay what you will , the calm sense of beauty is good , the delight afforded by perfectness of sound , or form , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . Many critics call this demand for something more a vulgar want of excitement : but is it not rather that irrepressible longing of the human heart for something more than human ; that reaching out after the infinite , which whether it awakens to sympathy or stirs to exal tation , yet is the noblest thing in man ; the spring of his noblest thoughts ; the universal aspiration , the craving of the race . This is not satisfied by Crawford . His " Beethoven " is massive , and grand and severe : you can not readily find fault with it , since it fulfils all that one requires ; but a great genius would do more than you require ; it would suggest what never occurred to the critic . If you can measure every excellence of a statue or a poem , it is not divine : if there is not some thing undefinable , subtle , yet overpowering and irresisti ble in its influence , or its effect , or its beauty , it belongs not to the first rank . No one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The works of Powers are like Crawford s in one re-/z/ 226 The Vagabond. spect , they are beautiful ; but they are not equal to Craw ford s , because they have nothing but beauty . The " Greek Slave " is of course exquisite in proportion , and full of grace and softness , yet it lacks expression ; it might be called anything else as appropriately as a Greek slave . I feel always in Mr. Powers s works this want ; in the " Proserpine , " in the " Fisher Boy , " in the " Eve ; " in his most admired productions there is need of more meaning ; there are outlines and outsides ; re presentations , not realities ; beautiful exceedingly , but spiritless , all . Other American sculptors excel Powers in this regard : one perhaps excels even Crawford in this single particular ; I mean Horatio Greenough . I have seen few American sculptures with so much meaning compressed into the marble as Mr. Greenough s .

Brackett s " Shipwrecked Mother and Child " is also very full of meaning ; it tells its own story ; it is modern too ; is an indication that the moderns must look to their own life for their subjects , must catch the spirit of their own times , if they hope ever to rival the ancients in this magnificent art , if they would put " life into a stone . " The Palmer marbles also indicate this feeling : all of them deviate from the classic model of beauty . The " Indian Girl " is of no Grecian type , is American in conception and idea , as well as in execution ; is , if I American Sculpture . 227 mistake not , the work of one who has studied in no foreign workshops , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classics , I am sure . I can never hope to derive the satisfaction from half-fledged efforts in any sphere , that absolute perfection must afford ; but my only hope for an American school in art is , that artists will be American ; will live in the present and not in the past . There is enough now and here to inspire them . If they get rid of traditions and shackles , they huve a field before them ; and genius is a gift that God vouchsafes in all ages and climes . Here and there , one may see indications of it now . /z/ " And there live we as merry as the day is long . " Much Ado About Nothing . ALL the world goes to " Washington just before Lent ; and as vagabonds follow the tide , whether it leads to the country or the capital , I went with my fraternity to Washington . There were all the somebodies , and very many of the nobodies ; the latter in large numbers , but the former in larger . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening receptions , matinees dansantes and balls , suppers without women and women without suppers ; indeed , the whirl was so incessant , that I was at last glad to get out of it , and rest from my labors . We think in New York that we know what gaiety is , but ours is tame by comparison with the intensity of Washington dissipation . We have some sort of a respite during the day . If , at the height of the season , we go to two , and once in a great while , to three parties a night , we lie late next morn ing , and gather strength for the next night s efforts . But they never sleep in Washington ; tired nature s sweet restorer is not " received " there ; no arrange ments are made in regard to her ; you dance at a ball till four o clock in the morning , and are expected to be prompt at a breakfast with Congressmen who go to the Washington Society . 229 House at twelve . Now , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or some other recherche fete , and not found the ladies " at home ; " the fatigue incapacitated them for receiving ; but in Washington there is a nightly occasion , and a round of visiting besides , which allows you no intermission to recruit . Beranger s Wandering Jew would find himself in com pany : " Toujours , toujours , Tourne la terre ou moi je cours , Toujours , toujours , toujours , toujours . " The day receptions are pleasant , however ; they are not like the matinees in New York , attended almost exclusively by the beau sexe ; you will find a cabinet minister at home with his wife and daughters , and see half a dozen of the most prominent statesmen in the country flirting in the half-light of the parlors , or two or three well-known soldiers hanging over some charmer at the piano . Indeed , the most distinctive feature of Washington society is the presence of men of talent and character . Everybody knows and bewails how much New York society is given up to boys and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our balls ; how comparatively lowered the tone of conversation thus becomes ; how sadly deficient the most brilliant saloons are in brilliant talkers . Dancers we have in abundance , and here and there a musical house can be pointed oiit ; but the number of ladies who are able to gather around them a circle of prominent or talented men for an evening can be counted on your fingers . They manage these things better in Washington . They 230 The Vagabond. dance there as much and as Avell as we do ; the people who can do nothing but dance are accommodated ; the Landers music is heard " as regularly every night in every parlor as you enter , and as constantly till you leave , as it is here ; but this is not all . Older people , and people who have other than social position , men who have made their mark in the world , are to be seen at all the entertainments ; are not rare enough to be lions ; are the rule rather than the exception . A belle scorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She demands a name as well as a man ; a name , too , known outside of a single set ; something more than irreproach able manners , faultless toilet and divine dancing ; some thing more than fortune , or family , or fashion . She may be exorbitant , but she asks for talent , and the distinction which this has brought its possessor ; no inglorious Miltons , no guiltless Cromwells will serve her turn ; the man must have achieved some of his greatness if he hopes to make an impression upon these exacting fair ones . And when statesmen , successful politicians , generals , diploma tists , and men of this stamp crowd the rooms , it is impos sible that the entire tone of the society they frequent and compose should not be affected . So there is at once dignity and ease , distinction and savoirfaire . The con versation is finer , and the society is more cosmopolitan ; there is neither the provincial coldness of Boston , nor the hauteur of Philadelphia , nor the pretence of New York manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be anything but exclusive ; everybody is admitted , but the influence is good , and you see as little bad manners as in the most select circle elsewhere . Some lament the facility with which the entree to Washington Society . 231 society is obtained . An American Lady Kew exclaimed to me in horror-stricken tones , that the daughter of one of the members of the cabinet had been seen dancing with a tailor . She didn t know she was telling this to a vagabond . But it is impossible to prevent people who behave well from visiting ; the officials must receive ; the President s levees are the most accessible of all , and everybody follows his lead . And I really could not perceive the ill effects of the system . Some people , doubtless , learn good manners who have had no previous opportunity ; but those who were well-bred before lose nothing by the contact ; and you will generally find that those suddenly elevated are extremely anxious to com port themselves so as not to allow others to suspect that their position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this universal democracy ; everybody introduces ; in every drawingroom you will observe the repetition of the everlasting formula . If you are at a morning visit or an evening ball , it is supposed you want to know every one there , and that every one wants to know you ; and you are to remember the introduction and recognise the acquaint ance . Nobody asks permission before presenting you to a lady . I was talking with a belle when an ambassa dor came up to her and said : " One of my attaches is anxious to know you , miss ; " and forthwith trotted away to bring up the attache . So even the foreigners fall into the fashion , and do as the Romans do , when they are at Rome . To be sure , this universality of introductions has its disadvantages ; the usage in the best houses here and abroad is preferable ; one doesn t want to be forced to know people , especially when such a motley crowd is 232 The Vagabond. " out " as that at Washington ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger almost imme diately the acquaintance of the entire Washington world . Every one who is able to procure an entree has thence forth admission everywhere ; and so many go to Washington merely as transient visitors , and yet are anxious to see its society , that this custom is , on the whole , agreeable . It allows those who are permanently at the capital to meet all the new-comers , and affords the temporary members of the throng opportunity to see all that is to be seen . The number of disagreeable men in Washington is prodigious . In the first place , many of the prominent people are not necessarily pleasant to meet , yet however disagreeable , must be endured ; and then there is a per fect tribe of insipid and ordinary ones , who , I suppose , seem unusually uninteresting , because of the contrast with those who are really brilliant . The men of talent who abound dwarf the noodles ; after listening to the conversation of the leader of a party , or one of the mas ter intellects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nothings inflicted on you by some bore W 7 ho has an office , or has had one , or expects one . I think I never met so many extremely stupid , and yet perfectly well-bred men , as in Washington . To be sure , that is better than talent and vulgarity : if my associates can not be both talented and refined , give me the refine ment by all means ; this affects me , while the talent is a matter that concerns them more . Still , the class of wellbred idiots is distressingly large everywhere , and causes an immense deal of suffering . They would be abso lutely intolerable at Washington were it not that the Washington Society . 233 brilliant people outnumber them . Your chances are really better for meeting a clever person than a fool ! Think of that , and remember the mortal hours you have endured in society without encountering a single man or woman with brains .

They are of course extremely sought after , and from their position and fashion , give the tone to much of the society . Con sequently people are more talked of even than in New York . ( Monstrous as this assertion seems , I am sure it is warranted . ) I relish gossip myself , and even a touch of scandal doesn t spice the dish too highly for my taste , though I only indulge in this luxury in private ; but the rage for picking one s neighbor to pieces is so prodi gious at the capital , that even the Vagabond was amazed . Parties are pronounced *ores before you leave them , and your character is discussed while you are on the opposite side of the room . The men are quite as much given to the practice as the women ; they dissect their dearest friends with as much skill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard just as much ill-natured talk at dinners and suppers from which women were excluded , as took place even at receptions where the Vagabond was the only man pre sent .

I strongly suspected that several of the dear creatures who were freest in their comments upon the widows , were themselves excluded from the ambassador s balls . At any rate , they couldn t have said anything more severe if they had been . While their conversation was at its height , a bevy of beaux arrived , and these were forthwith informed of the subject of talk . They were very anxious to know who the wi dows were , probably with a view to paying their court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candour could riot ; the utmost they could be induced to disclose in identification , was that one of the widows was she whose receptions were so universally popular , and who had allowed a distinguished civilian to close her shutters at one o clock in the morning . /z/ " In our fine arts , not imitation , but creation , is the aim . " /z/ AFTER studying " The Anti-Puseyite Lady " and " The Eve of St. Agnes , " till I thought myself fully aware of their aim , and able to appreciate their execution , I went the other day to Mr. Bryan s gallery , to compare the real Pre-Raphaelites with their imitators . I was struck immediately , as I had often been before , not with the exactness of detail , not with the truthful attention to exterior nature , not oven with the uncouth drawing , and stiff , angular outlines of the old artists , but with the spirit that animated those outlines , and gave life and meaning to those details ; with the religious fervor of Giotto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartful energy of Guido di Sienna ; with the reverent , pious feeling of them all . This is in reality what gives the predecessors of Raphael all their power , this is what makes them now , after the lapse of centuries , acknowledged as true artists . This is what the modern Pre-Raphaelites profess to aim at ; this is all that makes the theory of the new school anything more than realism ; this is what the practice of the new school fails to attain . Its disciples rival their models in the careful delinea- 236 The Vagabond. tion of trivialities ; they will paint you the back of a chair that shall be carved as finely as the work of Albrecht Dtirer , or the elaborate embossment in the pictures of Giottino ; they will mark every sheep in a pen with his brand , and dot the earth everywhere that a sunbeam flickers through the leaves ; they will count the hairs like Denner , and mark each shred of grass like Valkenburgh ; but they have not the motive that the old painters had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I eligious . People paint no pictures for cathedrals , they carve no images of saints which they afterwards adore ; or if a man happens to work on an altar-piece , he looks not upon the purpose as sanctifying the labor . The spirit that ani mated the real Pre-Raphaelites does not exist ; it is dead and buried , and even the eloquent conjurations of a Ruskin can evoke nothing but its ghost . The disciples of the Oxford graduate are then realists ; the doctrine of the Oxford graduate , if it lose this only savor wherewith it should be salted , is realism ; and though its apostle claims for Pre-Raphaelitism that it possesses the saving savor , it is only a claim , and one which neither the doctrine nor its results can establish . The theory that truth is in art of more importance than beauty is not correct ; the notion that beauty should be sacrificed to truth harsh , bare , repelling truth , is itself at once unlovely and untrue ; the teaching that nature is always , and under all circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often unlovely , and its effects disagreeable ; truth to nature , under such circumstances , is falsehood to art ; and though eloquence , and sophistry , and rhetoric be employed , with all the splendid talent of one of the greatest masters of English prose , they can- Pre-Raphaelitism. 237 not upset the notions that mankind has held for centuries . What , indeed , in any art , would you do with plain , bare nature ? Would you have the sculptor carve out the grossnesses and imperfections of the human form ? Would you have him represent the moles and pimples , the coarse flesh and the dirt of the " Fisher Boy , " or the " Torso ? " would you have the poet put the foul and common lan guage of the stews or the market into the mouth of his Dogberries and Pistols ? Would you have a comic actor represent all the odious vulgarities , the revolting indecencies of low life ? This is not art : art , whose aim is to elevate , not to debase , to ennoble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object is the beautiful ; the true , certainly , but not all that is true ; truth in ex pression , but not in the expression of what is mean and common ; truth in the representation of nature and cha racter , but not nature that is disgusting , nor character that is ordinary . If you paint me tin pans and carpets , you may do it well ; but you are not an artist for all that . If we want nothing more of painters than abso lute representations of old buildings , or copies of oak trees and fern leaves , Pre-Raphaelitism is very well ; but if artists are to awake emotions , to excite sentiments , to arouse feeling , then Pre-Raphaelitism is not well . For there is a higher truth than that of detail , there is a higher truth than that which is apparent in confor mity to oytsides , which consists in daguerreotyping or mirroring external objects ; there is a truth of sentiment , a truth of feeling . The artist must catch this higher truth , must put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forms and features , must infuse a spirit or a thought into his work ; else it is but sounding brass 238 The Vagabond. and tinkling cymbal . If the life is more than meat or the body than raiment , then is the thought of man worth more than its dress ; then is the ideal loftier than the real . It is all very well to ridicule the notion of improv ing upon nature , to laugh at the presumption of those who you say attempt it ; but will you accept coarse , ordinary nature , or look you for that nature not to be found every day nor everywhere ? Will you have nature in which a divinity is incarnate , or nature like that of the brutes that perish ? If a man in search of common truths fail to notice higher ones , he is as far out of the way as he who sees none at all . Would you be blind to the light of the stars , and see only sticks , and clods , and stones ? This fault I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a worship of the material ; to an ignoring of the ideal ; to putting outsides and externals on an equality with the essential and superior . This one would say after studying the doc trine in the expositions made by its chief and selfappointed advocate . He who should read Mr. Ruskin s " Modern Painters , " with the subsequent pamphlet and lecture on Pre-Raphaelitism , must come to the conclu sion , without seeing the pictures , that all this tends to realism . To be sure , there are denials of the tendency ; there are contradictions innumerable ; there are deifica tions of invention , and hymns to imagination ; but for all this , the only logical deductions from the reasoning are in favor of realism . And if this is the notion you get from the eloquent defence of the school , how firmly is it fixed by the sight of the works themselves . What do you see in all these Pre-Raphaelitism. 239 careful pictures but the most marvellous accuracy , the greatest degree of mechanical skill , the most remarka ble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enable a man to weave a Brussels carpet , or an old woman to put together a patchwork bed-quilt ? Do you call painting a tree , in which every leaf is marked out , art ? Do you call the delineation of every figure in a tapestry , of every blade of grass in a meadow , art ? What end is attained by this ? What sentiment des such a picture inspire ? What emotion does it awake ? What beauty does it present to the soul ? You may look at these elaborate photographs all day , and get no ennobling feeling from them . There is a certain excellence in their correct copying ; but , again and again , imitation is not art . This will do for those who can accomplish nothing more ; but it goes so far and no farther . The men without genius may give themselves up to it if they will , but when the real magi cian comes along , we shall all cry out , with the old Egyptians : " This is the finger of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves ; while their faults are all their own . They overlook great things in search of small ; they are really untrue to nature , for all their hue and cry about truth : their perspective is untrue . No human being distin guishes distant objects with the same degree of accu racy as near ones ; no human being could perceive leaves and flowers at the distance represented in many of these pictures . Then , many of them , in aiming at certain traits of the older artists , have caught faults and mannerisms instead of excellences . They all fail in em bodying that religious feeling which Ruskin says truly 240 The Vagabond. is the great distinguishing characteristic of Giotto and his contemporaries ; they , many of them , imitate the bad drawing , the angular outlines , the harsh , stiff atti tudes , the uncouth appearance of the old pictures ; and they lack tone always and altogether ; while their merits are such as all the world shares . When a Pre-Raphael ite is a man of genius , in so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict rules of his school . When he does anything great , he ceases to be peculiar ; he does what other great artists have done before . For instance , the expression of the " Ophelia " of Hughes is very sad and sweet ; the vacant look , the mournful atti tude , and the entire sentiment of the picture are admi rably expressive , or indicative , rather , of the character and fate of the fair Ophelia ; but these characteristics the picture would possess if Pre-Raphaelitism had never been heard of . The truly admirable things in Madox Brown s " Lear , " are the attitude of the crazed old king , the straw stuck into his grey locks , and the drawing of his weary limbs ; but what of these did the artist owe to Pre-Raphaelitism ? Here he had to resort to imagi nation ; here he did not what Mr. Ruskin so often in sists the artist should do , represent what he saw ; not what did exist , but what he imagined ought to exist . In " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers so elaborately drawn and colored , the curious workmanship of the Saviour s robes , and the general quaintness of treatment ; but not the expression of the Christ , not the sentiment of the picture , not the really beautiful traits of the work . I leave to the ardent admirers of the new school , the " Monarch Oak , " a fair sample of its monstrosities , the Pre-Raphaelitism. 241 " Two and a Half Years Old , " and the " Home from Sea . " Whoever can admire such pictures as these is too far gone for me to argue with ; whoever believes them , as I do , to be legitimate results from the teaching of the school , will either receive that teaching implicitly , or else reject entirely that which puts flowers and humanity in the same scale ; that which appreciates a stick as highly as a soul , and lavishes as much labor on the por traiture of a pan as Da Vinci would have bestowed on the " Last Supper , " or Raphael on a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ( as I may say ) whirlwind of your passion , you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness . " Hamlet . I KNOW of no one who has acquired and begot this temperance of which Hamlet speaks , in the same degree with Mrs. Kemble ; I know of nothing that more exactly describes the style and school of elocution in which she excels , than this advice to the players . The Kembles all believed that dignity and grace and taste could be combined with the expression of the intensest feeling ; they all acted upon this belief . They never relinquished their stately demeanor for effectiveness ; they never sacri ficed their elegance to rant ; they were well-bred when they raged , and measured when they wept . And their representative is faithful to the traditions of her race . She too preserves the music of intonation in the most tremendous outbursts of passion , and forgets not her art when her genius is most apparent . For it was the peculiarity of this extraordinary family , that its mem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of the cold , unimpassioned sort who elaborate sounding declamation without feeling it ; who portray and copy life , but are not themselves alive ; they infused meaning and expression into their eloquent tones and Mrs. Kemble . 243 graceful attitudes ; their t iste added a crowning orna ment to their feeling , but interfered not with its utter ance or embodiment . Mrs. Kemble is a true Kemble in this ; it is impossible to hear and see her without ap preciating at once her exquisite skill and her magnetic influence . " Yet with her , as it was with the other Kembles , art is supreme ; if the two come in collision , nature must give way . I like nearly as well as its most devoted admirers , tLe style of this school ; I believe that grace and dignity can be , combined with passion and feeling ; I delight in the music of elocution , and am gratified by the stately walk and dignified postures of less true to nature when he writes in blank verse than in prose ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to these exalted influences . It is this nature in us that admires the ideal in art ; that frowns on materialism ; that is affected by the truthfulness of Lear and Raphael , by the music of Mozart and the readings of Mrs. Kemble . Though these geniuses do not represent human nature in her coarsest or commonest garb , though they lift us up for a time into a higher sphere , we feel that they do not trans gress the promptings of nature , that they are truthful , that they are natural , as well as impressive and effective . Yet John Kemble was supreme till Kean came , and then the sceptre departed from Judah . You could ima gine nothing finer than Kemble s Hamlet , till you had felt the influence of Kean s Richard or Othello ; and exalting and refining as are the readings of Mrs. Kem ble , I like her better as a reader than as an actress . I 244 The Vagabond. mean that her intellectual powers are greater than her dramatic ones ; I mean that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be acted , she is inimitable , but that I have known others move me more in the rendei ing of Richard in the tent scene of the same play . You feel no lack if you have not seen or heard these others who are transcendent ; but if you have , the Kembles pale their uneffectual fires . There are two sorts of reading ; one elocutionary and the other dramatic . In the former , Mrs. Kemble is absolutely unapproachable ; in the latter , she probably excels any one else , but she becomes so much of an actress that it is impossible not to contrast her with other actors who , in their turn , excel her . Of course , it is unfair to make the comparison ; for in the reading of an entire play , it is impossible for any one to become so completely identified with a single part as in acting it . Doubtless , Mrs. Kemble could give every passage with greater effectiveness and intensity were she playing tho role ; but it belongs to her style to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains the tem perance and smoothness in the very whirlwind ; she never loses her self-control when her excitement is at the high est pitch ; she never becomes absolutely the individual whom she represents . Now , I believe that perfection in the histrionic art is not reached until the performer thinks and feels , for the time , that he is Richard or Desdemona ; till he ceases to imitate , and feels instead of feigns ; till he no more restrains himself than a man in a real passion does : yet if he be a genius , this abandon ment , absolute as it is , shall still be lofty and magnificent as well as effective . Mrs. Kemble . 245 I repeat it is unfair to compare Mrs. Kemble s read ing with another s acting ; but it is the highest compli ment I can pay her . Without the adventitious aids of dress and scenery , she is able to bring up the various individuals of the play nearly as vividly as a stage full of performers . You see and hear Othello and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can not avoid criticising her as an actress ; for she possesses the mar vellous faculty of expression in face and form , that is as necessary to an actress as intellect or voice , and contri butes as much to success as either . She has also the power which the very greatest geniuses of the stage pos sess , not only of enchaining the attention , but compelling an unconscious imitation of her looks in those of her hear ers . I have at times caught myself responding to her expression or copying with my own features the varying emotions depicted on her mobile countenance . Then I knew that I had been not only absorbed but forced into a state of subjection to her genius ; and looking around I saw the entire audience also subject . When she expressed anger , they looked angry ; when she portrayed fear , they looked fearful . They were en rapport with her ; she swayed them at her will , as the skil ful magnetizer does his patient . This is a power that the very greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel , Grisi , and young Booth exert it ; and its possession alone stamps Mrs. Kemble a woman of genius . Then how wonderfully her face expresses passion ! how radiant it becomes with that highest beauty , of soul ! The features , which in repose are too massive and heavy to be absolutely beautiful , then assume a life and spirit that transcend all other beauty . You wonder not at 246 The Vagabond . Othello s love when she looks Desdemona ; you can par don Desdemona s infatuation when she beams out the pas sion of the Moor . I think the most magnificent intensity of expression I ever saw in her , was that which accom panied the death of Desdemona the awful attitude of Othello as he held the smothered victim down , and the black frown that indicated he was a murderer . This fol lowed so instantly on the last shriek of Desdemona that the scene was brought as vividly before the imagination as on the stage . I have never seen an Othello or a Desdemona equal it . This reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these readings . I mean the versatility of feeling which enables Mrs. Kemble to throw herself so instantly from one character into another ; to share alike the fear of Desdemona and the determination of Othello ; the scorn of Gloster and the hate of Margaret of Anjou . This compensates for the occasional lack of intensity is , indeed , incompatible with it . It affords the listener a more continued gratification , a more even one than he can ever have in a theatre ; for no play can ever be so well rendered throughout as Mrs. Kemble reads it . We are bored by no miserable creatures in the subordinate parts ; she is sure to be well supported ; she reads every line exquisitely ; and as Shakspeare is so crammed with meaning , and wit and poetry , t is doubly delightful to have every shade of expression so fitly rendered . This versatility makes her comic readings to the full as great a pleasure as her tragic ones ; she gives the drunken scene of Cassio delightfully ; she renders the jibes of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy , Mrs. Kemble . 247 quite as well as the deep mutterings of his hunchback uncle . Indeed I think her more delightful still in comedy than in tragedy ; the intensity there is not needed ; and it is impossible to conceive of anything more exquisite than her " Midsummer Night s Dream . " All the delight ful poetry is poetically read : the humor of Bottom and the malice of Puck , the grace of Titania , are made reali ties to the imagination and to the ear , if not to the eye ; indeed , more palpable to the sight , as they are expressed on her changing features , more real than if they were portrayed by people of ordinary talent , who would only disenchant you when they essayed to deceive . In passages indicative of tenderness , of love , of deep but not harsh feeling , the wealth of passion lavished by Romeo and Juliet , the manly ardor of Othello , the touching address of Wolsey to Cromwell , and the death scene of Katherine of Arragon , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry VIII. , of course , she reminds one of Miss Cushman , and seems to me to possess more feeling . Miss Cushman s taste and intellect are quite as remarkable as those of Mrs. Kemble ; but the Englishwoman is more of a woman . She can be touching , she can move to tears , when the other would only pro voke to admiration . Her forte is not so much the terrible and harsh emotions , not the awful fright of Richard or the hurry of the battle scene , not the intense malignity of lago or the bursts of rage in Lear ; she does not occasion these shocks of strange delight that some actors cause , but in the rendering of familiar or tender passion , in graceful comedy , in tasteful poetry , in versatility , and in the general pleasure she affords , Mrs. Kemble must stand unrivalled . I can imagine no 248 The Vagabond. more intellectual gratification than her reading , no finer lesson to the taste ; and if at times I fancy that I might experience a more acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more refined or loftier pleasure . /z/ " Examine other beauties . " Romeo and Juliet . I HAVE been jilted of late ; so it I write snappishly or spitefully , my readers are forewarned , and can take their granum salts . At any rate , I shall write with feeling . You will think so , for I had intended to say my say about an opera to-day , and had even written the title at the top of my page ; but the uppermost emotion would have its way ; so I scratched out " The Hugue nots , " and set down instead " American Belles .

Pelican-like , then , picking my own breast to feed the curiosity of my readers ; poet-like , drawing from my own feelings to /z/ 250 The Vagabond. make my strain more truthful , I begin . Musa ! mihi causas memora ! American belles ! belles like Beatrice , so queenly , and tall , and elegant and fascinating ; belles like Norah , with dark , flashing eyes , and merry laugh , and shrewd sense and keen wit ; belles like Cornelia , sumptuous , and superb and lazy ; belles like Kitty , dashing , and racy , and brilliant and coquettish ; belles like them all inclined to flirt , inclined to be fast . The characteristics I first mentioned are such as any woman may share ; are not peculiar to Americans . French women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bewitching and Italian women are brilliant ; but if American belles can be distinguished , as a class , by any traits peculiarly their own , it is by their love of flirtation and of frolic . Other belles , when they play with men at the dangerous game of love , play in earnest ; their passions get involved instantly ; they can not touch the edged tools without cutting them selves ; and therefore other women are more closely , and scrupulously and wisely guarded than ours . But an American girl can touch the brink of all we love without falling over ; can engage in a desperate flirta tion without feeling one spark of passion , and without eliciting one in her partner . Is this because she is inca pable , or cold ? I recollect reading some French book that treated of American society , and nothing surprised the foreigner like this facility of flirtation ; the very word as well as the theory was unknown to him . There is no equivalent for it in that language , which has a word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for every pha.se of thought . So my Frenchman adopted American Belles. 251 our phrase , and spelt itfleurtecheunej but a fleurtecheune is not flirtation . No Frenchwoman coiild realize even from the vivid description of her countryman the possi . Lility of such a delightful state of affairs as exists here . For it certainly is delightful . You have all the plea sure of love ; all the piquant , interesting charm of la belle passion , without any of the painful intensity . A man and woman may like each other well enough to spend many a pleasant hour together ; may even prefer each other to any one else they have met ; may be good friends ay , they may even be and do all this , and be young besides , and yet not be plunged into that horrible gulf of love , which has no pleasure , only a painful one . At least , this is possible in America . Romeo and Juliet , I know , foolish creatures ! could not see each other without going madly to work and loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a ball , would have been content with a flirtation . They would have said , perhaps , as pretty things as Miss Capulet and Mr. Montague did at the masquerade , but they would have stopped short of the hand-kissing ; they would only have talked of it . And can any one imagine an American belle standing on her balcony after a party , and ranting about a beau who had just been introduced to her , as Juliet did about Romeo ? Can any one ima gine a member of the Union Club clambering over into the back yard of a family with whom his own was not on speaking terms , and eavesdropping while the belle apostrophized him in rhapsodic strains ? How much more sensible for these young people , who are just as handsome and agreeable as the Veronese couple , to dance " The Lanciers , " and promenade the avenue ( not arm 252 The Vagabond. in arm ) , to visit and be visited at the opera , to go out with a chaperone or without , according as mamma is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poi son , and go down into vaults , to visit friars cells , to fling themselves on the earth , to die for each other , and all that . My modern pair , after a few months very vio lent flirtation , after dancing indefatigably together an entire season , after being seen in public invariably at the same time and place , after exciting some little talk among their set , suddenly subside ; and , though they are good friends thereafter , neither suffers from the subsidence . The young man devotes himself more attentively to busi ness , or to some other charmer , of another style ; the belle accepts the richest or the most distinguished of her admirers , and there is a great wedding , a matinee dansante , to which Mr. Montague will certainly be invited . The trouble is that a belle must carry on several flirta tions at once . Every young lady in society finds at least a single admirer ; but the popular one , the particularly rich , the particularly beautiful , the particularly fascinat ing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is probably very agreeable to her , but I am sure it is distaste ful to the worshippers : I myself never enjoy a ball or a party while I am in love , for I am a man of taste , and always fall in love with belles ; I can t expect to mono polize the attention of a brilliant girl during an entire evening , and I don t like to see her dancing with a bet ter-looking man than myself . I vastly prefer a morning visit , when nobody else is likely to come in , and I never choose reception days . I think a box at the opera infi nitely better than a soiree , even if I am the escort . But the skilful manner in which a professed belle plays off American Belles. 253 her different attendants ; the tact with which she will distribute a smile to one , a look to another , and a word to a third , each fancying that nobody else gets such a look , such a smile , so soft a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are only a looker-on . The belle does not intend to be coquettish ; she really likes all the fellows , but for different reasons ; one is so handsome , another so good-natured , another so clever ; Tom sends her such bouquets , and Ned is an old friend of the family , while Mr. Montague is so much admired by all the girls , and especially by Rosalind , that she must keep him at her shrine . Thus she has a reason for being civil , ay , more than civil , to each ; besides , they all like her , they all are her friends , and she can t be so ungrateful as to wound their feelings ; so she keeps them dangling . American girls are very good-natured , you see . They all have good hearts , though not very warm ones ; they would not do much for a friend ; you couldn t expect them to make a great exertion or a great sacrifice in your behalf , but they appreciate what you do for them ; they wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they wouldn t set one in motion . There are hateful , malicious ones , who possess the dangerous gift of wit , and spit out spiteful words in your face ; who say things that make a man feel very unpleasant , and which he can t resent because they are said by a woman ; but these are few . Most girls are not brilliant enough to say such things ; their wit is only sportive ; and most of them would not willingly give pain ; they may - some times quiz you to your face , and boast of it afterwards , but not often ; they may laugh at a man s peculiarities 254 The Vagabond. and foibles when he is away , but that is fair ; the men talk up the women as well I can vouch for it ; we know all your weak points , darlings ; don t flatter yourselves , that you escape . Sometimes , after you have been snuffing up the incense of adoration for a whole evening , tvo or three of your admirers will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar , or a supper , after a starvation party , say how badly you were dressed , or how awkward you moved in " The Landers ; " they don t admire your singing , or you are pretty , but you know it too well . All the belles are fast ; married or single , in their first winter , or almost passee , the beauties and the wits , all the women who make a sensation in society are prononcee ; perhaps only a little so , but they must be distin guished from the rest to be belles ; they must dare do things that the others will not do ; they must have more manner , more confidence , very likely more cleverness , but all this makes them rather fast . Perhaps I do not choose my word with sufficient care ; perhaps there is none that exactly expresses what I mean . But is it not true that those who are most admired , who are most invited , who are never neglected at a ball , and always have a crowd around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who talk most , who laugh most , who go out most , who accept most attentions , who are called by the men , not only brilliant , but fast . The greatest southern belle whom I have known was a woman of large fortune , and used as all belles are not from her earliest years , to the highest companies . She had been abroad , spoke several languages , danced divinely , and was rather good-looking , when well dressed . But she lived at a hotel , and told me of changing the American Belles. 255 gentlemen s boots at night , as they stood at their doors to be cleaned ; she told me of wearing men s clothes ; she went to the Jardin Mabille in Paris I have her description of the scene now in a letter before me ; she said , the severest and rudest things to people ; in fact , she said some to me . Yet this lady has a position that none can gainsay , and never was seen without a train of admirers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go everywhere , do everything , without being immodest or vulgar ; they are decidedly piquant in their daring , like Di Vernon or Lady Gay Spanker , and sure always to make an impression . I remember seeing the daughter of a United States senator , for a wager , order a drink at the bar of the Astor House ; and she tossed it off bravely too . The New York belles are by no means of this sort ; are undoubtedly well-bred , can be dignified when they choose ; but the enthusiasm of the American character may be seen in their manners , subdued in a degree by elegant associations ; still , they lack repose . They like Verdi s music , and prefer the " Trovatore " to " The Huguenots ; " they think " Stride la Vampa " superb , but the romanza of Raoul tame . /z/ " Either for tragedy , comedy , history , pastoral , pastoral-comical , historical-pastoral . " Hamlet . HOWEVER much one may dislike to own it , there can be no doubt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultivated part of man kind . As long ago as Voltaire s time , indications of this state of affairs were perceived by that astute observer , who declared that " the most sublime tragedy and the most artful comedy are not so frequently revisited by the same person as an indifferent opera . " A critical judg ment must indeed always place the intellectual merits of the drama above the effeminate charm of the opera ; and for myself , much as I enjoy the delights afforded by music , I reckon the highest pleasures of the theatre superior , simply as pleasures . There is , after all , nothing but sense and passion gratified by music , but in the theatre intellect also is called in play ; and , if you lose the exquisite raptures that tickle your ear , at least as intense an emotion is excited , one that compensates for the lack of sensual titillation . Still , the highest dramatic sort of entertainment is very rare , and ordinary theatri cal performances can not be compared with second-rate operatic amusements . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rather hear an indifferent opera than see an indifferent play : I can get some plea- Carl Formes. 257 sure out of the one , while the other is an unmitigated bore . The great world agrees with me and Voltaire ; it frequents the Academy in crowds , and straggles in only occasionally to the finest performances at the theatre . As a result of this , great artists will prefer the operatic stage : one would rather be appreciated by those best qualified to judge ; one would rather display his talents before the most distinguished audiences ; and , unless the actor can compel crowds to follow him like those that attend Ristori or Rachel , he must do as Formes does , and sing ; that is , if , like Formes , he happens to possess a mag nificent voice . For the great basso was intended by nature for an actor rather than a singer ; his musical abilities are uncommonly fine , but they are quite thrown into the shade by his dramatic ones ; he himself enjoys acting more than singing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what we have seen than of what we have heard , superb as the last may have been . In fact , there are times when his acting is so excellent that it absolutely interferes with your apprecia tion of the music ; it distracts your attention ; you are watching the comic face of Basilio when you should be listening to the notes of " La Calunnia ; you are laugh ing at Leporello when you should be enjoying the song of his master . However , if Formes had been merely an actor , he would have delighted smaller audiences ; he would have been a German actor , and appeared only in German theatres , and mostly before the middling class of people ; whereas , by leaping on the operatic stage , he secures every nation for hearers , and accomplished people all over the world for admirers . He does not , however , fail to affect all sorts of people . My barber is 258 The Vagabond. in raptures with him as well as my minister ; I have heard them both praise him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other in " The Messiah . " Things have changed since Addison s day ; the sneer ing tone in which he wrote of Nicolini , the he-singer , is not that in which the critics have discussed Carl Formes . The genius and the art of this last comer have done much to elevate the consideration and position of operatic artists . No person of sense or taste can see the great basso and not acknowledge him to be a man of more than ordinary abilities ; and not acknowledge that he is in exactly the sphere for which nature intended him ; can possibly rank him with the singers in the pope s chapel , or the Nicolinis who used to scramble on the stage with lions . If then it is apparent that all these gifts could not have been lavished on a man for naught , if he is possessed of gifts that can be exercised in no other way than on the operatic stage , if he does exercise them there in the most splendid manner , who shall deride or despise him or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or foppish tenors who spend their lives in squabbling and squalling ; but don t confound true artists Avith fools who happen to possess a voice . Voice and genius are very distinct qualities : I enjoy the gratification one affords me , but I reverence the other . I see no reason why a genius for the stage should be denied the personal appreciation which it sometimes covets more than the applause of theatres . If a man is a gentleman , or a true man , his being an actor is no more against him than his being a pork-merchant surely . And yet , fools rush in where angels would get the door shut in their faces . Carl Formes. 259 When I first heard Formes sing the incantation music of " Robert le Diable , " and saw him compel Alice to descend from her post at the foot of the cross ; when I first listened and looked while he pleaded with Robert in the grand trio of the same opera , and with all a father s earnestness , and all a demon s intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gratified hate at overcoming the Norman peasant ; when I watched his attitudes so full of meaning and passion , his looks so intent and devilish , his hands so expressive in their play , his stride , the sweep of his robes , the very toss of his hair , and the instinctive , nervous twitchings of his limbs , I recognised the true dramatic nature . More than this , however ; Formes has a nature that seeks expression not only in form and face , but in song as well : though with him , song is but one part of a stupendous whole . His voice , so rich , so full , so melodious ( when true ) , so sweet , but above all so sympathetic , is fitly joined to such abilities as he possesses . It is natural for him tosing ; he sings to give vent to his feelings ; you do not perceive the absurdity of opera vhile you listen to his notes ; you are not amazed that Bertram calls the guilty nuns to earth by means of song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involuted strains . He so feels the music that he makes his audience feel it too . He takes you up along with him into the region where all these things are possible and probable ; where demons cry to their sons in heart-rending ti ios , and valets shudder in terrific tones ; where Mozart and Meyerbeer lived when they composed , where great artists live when they em body great ideas , where you and I must follow these geniuses if we would appreciate their efforts .
