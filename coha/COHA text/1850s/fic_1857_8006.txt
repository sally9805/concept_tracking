Higginson , Thomas Wentworth , 1823-1911 : Strength of the Erring from Strength of the Erring ( 1857 ) Editorial note : 1Kb 1 1 Yes ! prayer is strong , and God is good ; 2 Man is not made for endless ill ; 3 The offending soul , in darkest mood , 4 Hath yet a hope , a refuge still . 2 5 Thou , God , wilt hear ; these pangs are meant 6 To heal the spirit , not destroy ; 7 And even remorse , for chastening sent , 8 When thou commandest , works for joy .
