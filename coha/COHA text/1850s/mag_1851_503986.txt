has possessed advantages , which fall to the lot of few , of making himself acquainted with a region rapidly growing in political and commercial importance . Possessing , as he does , every requisite for producing a much more ample work , from the materials that have come within his reach , we sincerely hope that he will present the public with a full narrative of the revolution , and with such information , in regard to the country , as he is so well qualified to impart . Of the Reports made five years ago to the Secretary of State concerning Chili , by Judge Bland , and Mr Poinsett , we have thought it unnecessary to speak , as they are already familiar to many of our readers , and accessible to all . At a future period , however , we shall have occasion to refer to these valuable documents in a view , which we propose to take , of the revolutionary history and political condition of Chili . ART . XVILI. - The Pilot , a Tale of the Sea . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Wiley. 1823. 2 vols . OUR literature , to use a trite comparison , is like our territory , the greater part as yet uncultivated and wild . The yeoman who goes into our forests , and opens a little prospect of habitations , and fields of grain and of grass , in the midst of the wilderness , may be regarded as a sort of peaceful conqueror ; a champion , who subdues the land and makes it pay tribute . So the author of any literary work , upon a subject peculiar to ourselves , and truly American , undertakes a like enterprise ; he peoples the regions of fancy and memory ; be reclaims and makes fertile the intellectual waste ; he opens the solitude to the light ; and , under his hands , it begins to teem with life and action , and to present a thousand pleasing objects . Now , in the case of the woodsman , if he supplants the forest trees with fields of wheat and corn , the main purpose is effected , and we acknowledge , that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering too critically , whether in his sowing and planting he has followed the broadcast // or drill method . So in regard to original works of imagination and taste ; if an author really succeeds in adding something to the permanent intellectual stock ; if , on the whole , he produces objects worthy to remain and be admired , he is entitled to our good will and praise , and ought not to be judged by the minor imperfections , the quaedam maculae , from which no work of art is free . The author of the Pilot seems to us to have fully and decidedly established this claim upon the public in his favor , as he has produced works , which welldeserve to be , and will be , a permanent part of our literature ; and in a province where very few adventurers have preceded him with any tolerable success . The scene of this story is laid in the *northeastern coast of England , and the neighboring part of the German Sea . During the war of our revolution , an American frigate and schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to approach this coast at a point where the navigation is dangerous , and at a time , when a stoim , approaching from the northeast , seems to threaten them with certain shipwreck . A Scotchman and Irishman , who are of this group , are made to describe , in their respective dialects , the appearanc:e of the vessels as they come in sight from behind a headland . The immediate purpose of coming into this dangerous place , is to procure a pilot from on shore . This pilot , a small man in a drab pea-jacket , ' is afterwards plainly intimated to be Paul Jones ; but he remains , through the story , incognito ; he is a mysterious personage under the name of Mr Gray , on whom much depends , as many of the events turn upon his conduct and interference . He is at first known only to Munson , the captain of the frigate , and afterwards to Griffith the lieutenant ; the reader is not expressly let into the secret . Characters of this description are substituted for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic poetry ; for the gods of the ancient writers , and the witches , fairies , and other supernatural beings , introduced into the older of the modern writers of fiction , to bring the other personages into situations , which would otherwise be too improbable , or help them out , when they could not retrieve themselves . But a giant , a wizard , or spirit , not excepting the White Maid of Ayenel , makes but a sorry figure in a modern story , in which the author affects any regard to probability . Yet the reader must // be interested , and his feelings must be disturbed by imminent perils , desperate situations , and hairbreadth escapes ; and it is rude and inartificial in the author , to resort only to good fortune in these emergencies . In the conclusion of the story , it is quite excusable to hurry to a happy result , with a flush of good luck , in the death of rich uncles , liberality of the government , exposure of knavery , clearing up of misunderstandings , the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it shows poverty of invention to bring affairs into such a conjuncture in the midst of the action , that unless the wind changes , or some of the personages are killed off , the story must end . Some extraordinary and powerful agent is needed for the trying occasions , about whom the author casts something of mystery and obscurity , that the reader may magnify to himself everything belonging to this personage , and give credit to the prodigies told of him . The Pilot is a personage of this description . He interposes in times of difficulty ; and he is probably also intended by the - author to give something of historical reality to the story . But to the reader , he is quite a secondary character in the piece . The beginning of the story is taken up in extricating the vessels from their perilous situation , in doing which the Pilot of course bears an important part . There is at first no remarkable skill displayed in the dialogue , nor any very striking exhibition of character or conduct in the actors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the characters has just commenced . From the first appearance of the vessels in the evening , until their escape from the impending perils the next morning , the dangerous situations , the combinations of incidents , the pictures of the heavens and the ocean , and the management of the vessels , inspire the reader with intense interest and anxiety ; while , at the same time , his imagination is filled with a succession of grand and vividly drawn images . The vessels being brought into a secure position under a clear sky , a consultation is held by the officers and the Pilot , in which it is determined to land , for the purpose of seizing and bringing off some members of parliament and other persons of distinction , whom the Pilot supposes to be amusing themselves at a hunting seat upon the coast . The author // seems to make some effort in this consultation , and , as it appears to us , without very brilliant success . His purpose , in this expedition on shore , is to change the scene to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , who has brought with him his niece , Cecilia Howard , who had been betrothed to Griffith , the lieutenant of the frigate ; and his ward , Katharine Plowden , also already betrothed to Barnstable , a junior lieutenant , and commandant of the schooner Ariel . The author 's intention , as the reader anticipates , is to make two happy couples of these parties ; but the course of true love never did run smooth , ' for the old tory , though he esteems Griffith as a man , detests him as a whig and revolutionist , as heartily as he worships his sovereign lord , the king . Besides , he has with him , as one of his household , his loyal nephew , Mr Christopher Dillon , learned in the law , and , withal , of a sallow , shrivelled aspect , a lean , unsightly figure , and mean spirit ; who thinks himself , and is thought by his good uncle , a surprisingly fitting match for his fair and wealthy cousin Cecilia . The old man supposes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ermine , and the title of my lord chief justice of Carolina , whereupon Boroughcliffe , an English captain , and a guest , as well as guard in the house , says , God forbid that our friend shall lose his title , and he dubs him , upon the spot , Cacique of Pedee . Among the other personages introduced here , is Alice Dunscombe , who acknowledges , that , in her youth , she had regarded the Pilot not with indifference ; but she has too much loyalty to make irrevocabl9 vows to one whom she almost persuades herself to regard as a pirate , and she strives to supplant whatever of affection for him she once indulged , by piety and a rigid sense of duty . This character is not badly conceived , but it is not sustained very successfully . Her argument with the Pilot upon the subjects of loyalty and love is too set , and makes one of the very few parts of the book of which there seemed to be too much . But we may be mistaken , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not disposed absolutely to find fault with Katharine Plowden , though we doubt whether she is really so sprightly , free , and debonair , as she affects to be . Cecilia Howard is intended as a conspicuous figure in the piece , and were she // 318 April1 the only one , we should hardly think it too much to say , that her portrait bears marks of being done by an unpractised artist . The defects seem not to be so much those of negligence and haste , as of difficulty and embarrassment in the execution . The author entitles himself , however , to have done more of this group still more indifferently , by the bold , free , and masterly style , in which he has hit off Captain Boroughcliffe . The characters are brought together , one after another , at the house of the refugee , where the plot thickens , and affairs appear to be approaching a crisis . But we will not attempt to give an account of all the maneuvres , plans , reverses and successes , that follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boroughcliffe and the refugee , over the madeira , is kept up with great spirit , and does not flag on the introduction of the Pilot , Griffith , and Manual , the captain of marines , who had come on shore in disguise , and were detained by Boroughcliffe . The incident of the detention and detection of these three persons is particularly well managed . But what we formerly said of some parts of the Spy , is applicable to some of these scenes , in which the ladies bear a part , which sometimes labor and disappoint the reader . On board of the Ariel , in the meantime , things go on more triumphantly , and we there meet with personages who all act with promptness and freedom , and speak without apparently being at any loss for thoughts or words . The Ariel lies in a small bay , where she had landed the party on shore , and on board of her are Barnstable , the midshipman Mr Merry , and , above all , the hero of the piece , our very pleasant acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Coffin , and his mother a Joy . Barustable and long Tom Coffin being out in a whaleboat , the former exclaims , by heaven , Tom , there is the blow of a whaletis a fin-back . ' No , sir , t is a right whale , ' answered Tom ; I saw his spout ; he threw up a pair of pretty rainbows . He s a raal oil-butt , that fellow . ' And thus he could not resist the temptation of having a stroke of the harpoon at that impudent rascal . ' While they were pulling towards their game , Long Tom arose from his crouching attitude in the stern-sheets , and transferred his huge frame to time bows of the boat , where he made such preparations to strike the whale as the occasion required . // The tub , containing about half of a whale line , was placed at the feet of Barnstable , who had been preparing an oar to steer with , in place of the rudder , which was unshipped , in order that , if necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their approach was utterly unnoticed by the monster of the deep , who continued to amuse himself with throwing the water , in two circular spouts , high in the air , occasionally flourishing the broad flukes of his tail with a graceful but terrific force , until the hardy seamen were within a few hundred feet of him , when he suddenly cast his head downward , and , without an apparent effort , reared his immense body for many feet above the water , waving his tail violently , and producing a whizzing noise , that sounded like the rushing of winds . The cockswain stood erect , poising his harpoon , ready for the blow ; but when he beheld the creature assume this formidable attitude , he waved his hand to his commander , who instantly signed to his men to cease rowing . In this situation the sportsmen rested a few moments , while the whale struck several blows on the water , in rapid succession , the noise of which re-echoed along the cliffs , like the hollow reports of so many cannon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster sunk again into his native element , and slowly disappeared from the eyes of his pursuers . " Which way did he head , Tom ? " cried Barnstable , the moment the whale was out of sight . " Pretty much up and down , * returned the cockswain , whose eye was gradually brightening with the excitement of the sport ; " he * run his nose against the bottom , if he stands long on that course , and will be glad to get another snuff of pure air ; send her a few fathoms to starboard , sir , and I promise we shall not be out of his track . " The conjecture of the experienced old seaman proved true , for , in a few minutes , the water broke near them , and another spout was cast into the air , when the huge animal rushed , for half his length , in the same direction , and fell on the sea , with a turbulence and foam equal to that which is produced by the launchin of a vessel , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution , the whale rolled heavily , and seemed to rest from further efforts . His slightest movements were closely watched by Barustable and his cockswain , and when he was in a state of comparative rest , the former gave a signal to his crew , to ply their oars once more . A few long and vigorous strokes sent the boat directly up to the broadside of the whale , with its bows pointing towards one of the fins , which was , at times , as the animal yielded sluggishly to the a*vtion of the waves , exposed to view . The cockswain poised his // harpoon , with much precision , and then darted it from him with a violence that buried the iron in the blubber of their foe . The instant the blow was made , long Tom shouted , with singular earnest-ness " Stain all * * Stern all ! " echoed Barnstable ; when the obedient seamen , by united efforts , forced the boat in a backward direction , beyond the reach of any blow from their formidable antagonist . The alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own power , and of the insignificance of his enemies , he sought refuge in flight . One moment of stupid surprise succeeded the entrance of the iron , when he cast his huge tail into the air , with a violence that threw the sea around him into increased commotion , and then disappeared , with the quickness of lightning , amid a cloud of foam . " Snub him * shouted Barustable ; " hold on , Toni ; he rises already. ** C* Ay , ay , * replied the composed cockswain , seizing the line , which was running out of the boat with a velocity that rendered such a manouvre rather hazardous , and causing it to yield more gradually round the large loggerhead that was placed in the bows of the boat for that purpose . Presently the line stretched forward , and , rising to the surface , with tremulous vibrations , it indicated the direction in which the animal might be expected to reappear . Barustable had cast the bows of the boat towards that point , before the terrified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was , however , no longer wasted in his sports , but who cast the waters aside , as he forced his way , with prodigious velocity , along their surface . The boat was dragged violently in his wake , and cut through the billows with a terrific rapidity , that , at moments , appeared to bury the slight fabric in the ocean . When long Tom beheld his victim throwing his spouts on high again , he pointed with exultation to the jetting fluid , which was streaked with the deep red of blood , and cried " Ay ! I ye touched the fellow 's life ! it must be more than two feet of blubber that stops my iron from reaching the life of any whale that ever sculled the ocean " I believe you have saved yourself the trouble of using the bayonet you have rigged for a lance , " said his commander , who entered into the sport with all the ardour of one whose youth had been chiefly passed in such pursuits ; " feel your line , Master Coffin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the course he is steering , as he tows us from the schooner . " " T is the creater ' 5 way , * said the cockswain ; " you know they need the air in their nostrils , when they run , the same as a man ; but lay hold , boys , and let us haul up to him . " // The seamen now seized the whale-line , and slowly drew their boat to within a few feet of the tail of the fish , whose progress became sensibly less rapid , as he grew weak with the loss of blood . In a few minutes he stopped running , and appeared to roll uneasily on the water , as if suffering the agony of death . " Shall we pull in , and finish him , Tom ? " cried Barnstable ; " a few sets from your bayonet would do it . " The cockswain stood examining his game , with cool discretion , and replied to this interrogatory " No , sir , no-he s going into his flurry ; there s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon in taking a whale . Stain off , sir , stain off ! the creater 's in his flurry * The warning of the prudent cockswain was promptly obeyed , and the boat cautiously drew off to a distance , leaving to the ania clear space , while under its dying agonies . From a state of perfect rest , the terrible monster threw its tail on high , as when in sport , but its blows were trebled in rapidity and violence , till all was hid from view by a pyramid of foam , that was deeply dyed with blood . The roarings of the fish were like the bellowings of a herd of bulls , and to one who was ignorant of the fact , it would have appeared as if a thousand monsters were engaged in deadly combat , behind the bloody mist that obstructed the view . Gradually , these effects subsided , and when the discolored water again settled down to the long and regular swell of the ocean , the fish was seen , exhausted , and yielding passively to its fate As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and when the white and glistening skin of the belly became apparent , the seamen well knew that their victory was achieved . ' Vol . I. pp. 231-235 . We are not afraid that our readers will be tired with the repetition of this passage , although they may have read it more than once before . We will not say we do not know how a better description could have been given , since , but for the author , we should not have known how it could have been given so well . The whale being vanquished , a more formidable foe appears . The lean and spiteful Christopher Dillon , having learned the situation of the whale boat , had hastened to give intelligence to the captain of one of the king 's cutters , at anchor in a neighboring port , and he went on board himself , in order to point out to the captain the place where the American boat might be found . The whale was no sooner des .. patched , than the royal cutter appeared in sight bearing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she rounded a head- // 322 April* land , but a short half league to the windward of the boat . The escape of the boat is well described , and the circumstance that the report of the gun of the cutter , firing at the boat , induced Mr Merry to get the Ariel under weigh , soon enough to meet the boat and rescue the crew , is happily conceived . The manceuvering of the two vessels in preparation for a battle , and the battle itself , are in fine style . We can not but remind our readers of long Tom Coffin 's preparation for the approaching contest . When the drum beat to quarters , he threw aside his jacket , vest and shirt , with all the discretion of a man who had engaged in an undertaking that required the free use of his utmost powers. * He was standing at the breech of his long gun , with his brawny arms folded on a breast that had been turned to the color of blood by long exposure , his grizzled locks fluttering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of all near him . ' " Speak to him , Tom * said Barnstable , " and let us see if he will * " Ay , ay , 5jr , ** cried the cockswain , sinking his body in such a manner as to let his head fall on a level with the cannon that he controlled , when , after divers orders , and sundry movements to govern the direction of the piece , he applied a match with a rapid motion to the pri .. ming . ' Barustable sprang lightly on a gun and watched the instant when the ball would strike , while long Tom threw himself aside from the line of the smoke with a similar intention . ' " There go the chips , ** cried Barastable . " Bravo ! Master Coffin , yon never planted iron with more judgment ; let him have another piece of it . " " Ay , ay , sir , " returned the cockswain . ' Vol . I. pp. 243 - .245 . We should have been more pleased , had not the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing up by the channels of the cutter , with his *rizzhed locks drenched in salt water , and bearing his harpoon , reminded the author of Neptune and his trident ; which we think a disparagement of long Tom . But the allusion , whether well or ill , is of small importance . The cutter being captured , long Tom is sent on shore , in company with Dillon , to propose an exchange of prisoners . But Dillon , whom the author does not spare , for he means to drown him , breaks his parole of honor , and instead of effecting the proposed exchange , causes long Tom to be made prisoner . Boroughcliffe visits long Tom in his place of con* finement , and the cockswain takes this opportunity to seize // I The Pilot , a Tale of the Sea . upon the captain , and leave him bound , and gagged with the hilt of his own sword . He then makes prisoner of Dillon , ties his hands , and fastens the cord to his own belt , and carries his captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Ariel lay , under the shadows of the hills , and the sudden illumination of the scene by the blaze of the cannon from a neighboring battery ; the management of the schooner in escaping from a situation exposed to the enemy 's guns ; the signs of a gale from the northeast ; the sea tumbling in , with the tide setting upon a lee shore , are all admirably well given . We can hardly name the author , who would not have reason to be proud to have described the wreck of the Ariel , with the incidents attending it . The characters of Barnstable and Merry are sustained with great success through the whole of this scene , and , together with long Tom and Dillon , are so grouped and contrasted , as to exhibit each in admirable relief , and the whole passage is one of great harmony and power . Without any elaborate attempt at pathos , there are some effectual touches , and it is very excusable in the reader not to go through some parts of this scene unmoved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstitions , and those of the seamen , are suitable preludes to the event . The men began to look to the leeward oftener than Barastable would have them . Merry was sitting upon a gun singing as if he were a chorister in his father 's church . ' The cockswain requested that Captain Barnstable would please to call Mr Merry from the gun ; for I know , from having followed the seas my natural life , that singing , in a gale , is sure to bring the wind down upon a vessel the heavier ; for He , who rules the tempests , is displeased that man 's voice should be heard , when He chooses to send His own breath upon the waters . ' Barnstable watched the appearance of the weather , as the light slowly opened upon them , with that intensity of anxiety , which denoted , that the presentiments of the cockswain were no longer deemed idle . On looking to windward , he beheld the green masses - of water that were rolling in towards the land , with a violence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were moments when the air appeared filled with sparkling gems , as the rays of the rising sun fell upon the spray that was swept from wave to wave . Towards the land , the view was still more appalling . // The cliffs , but a short half league under the lee of the schooner , were , at times , nearly hid from the eye by the pyramids of water , which the furious element , so suddenly restrained in its violence , cast high into the air , as if seeking to overstep the boundaries that nature had affixed to its dominion . The whole coast , from the distant headland at the south , to the well known shoals that stretched far beyond their course , in the opposite direction , displayed a broad belt of foam , into which it would have been certain destruction for the proudest ship that swam to have entered . ' At this moment of appalling apprehension , the cockswain exhibited the most calm resignation . He knew that all had been done , that lay in the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was now too evident to his experienced eyes , that it had been done in vain ; but , considering himself as a sort of fixture in the schooner , he was quite prepared to abide her fate , be it for better or for worse . The settled look of gloom that gathered around the frank brow of Barnstable , was , in no degree , connected with any considerations of himself but proceeded from that sort of parental responsibility from which the sea commander is never exempt . The discipline of the crew1 however , still continued perfect and unyielding . There had , it is true , been a slight movement made by two of the oldest seamen , which indicated an intention to drown the apprehensions of death in ebriety ; but Barustable had called for his pistols , in a tone that checked the procedure instantly , and , although the fatal weapons were untouched by him , but were left to lie exposed on the capstern , where they had been placed by his servant , not another symptom of insubordination appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a 1 andsman might seem , a dreadful affectation of attention to the most trifling duties of the vessel ; and the men , who , it should seem , ought to be devoting the brief moments of their existence to the mighty business of the hour , were constantly called to attend to the most trivial details of their profession . Ropes were coiled , and the slightest damages occasioned by the waves , that , at short intervals , swept across the low decks of the Ariel , were repaired with the same precision and order , as if she yet lay embayed in the haven from which she had just been driven . In this manner , the arm of authority was kept extended over the silent crew , not with the vain desire to preserve a lingering , though useless exercise of power , but with a view to maintain that unity of action that no even a ray of hope . w could alone afford them " She can make no head against this sea , under that rag of canva55 , " said Barnstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded arms , and an air of cool resignation , was balancing his body on the verge of the quarter deck , while the schooner was plunging madly into waves that nearly buried her in their bo // som ; " the poor little thing trembles like a frightened child , as she meets the water . " Tom sighed heavily , and shook his head , before he answered " If we could have kept the head of the mainmast an hour longer , we might have got an offing , and fetched to windward of the shoals ; but , as it is , sir , mortal man ca n't drive a craft to windward-she sets bodily in to land , and will be in the breakers in less than an hour , unless God wills that the winds shall cease to As the only means of safety , it was determined to anchor , and cut away the masts , When a dreadful cry arose among the men forward , and which sounded with increased horror , amid the roaring of the tempest . The schooner rose on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , falling off with her broad side to the sea , she drove in towards the cliffs , like a bubble on the rapids of a cataract . ' The cockswain called to the men , " Look out-secure yourselves ! " and at that instant the Ariel settled on a wave , that melted from under her , heavily on the rocks . The shock was so violent , as to throw all who disregarded the warning cry from their feet , and the universal quiver , that pervaded the vessel , was like the last shudder of animated nature . ' Vol . II . pp. 95-102 . The scene is sustained to the end with unabated power ; the more remarkable passages of which are no doubt fresh in the recollection of our readers , such as Dillon 's being driven back from attempting to get into the boat , by the threatening looks of the men ; long Tom 's seating himself on the heel of the bowsprit , refusing to join his shipmates in the boat , and expressing , with a terrible composure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to be his coffin , and saying , God 's will be done , I saw the first timber of the Ariel laid , and shall live just long enough to see it torn out of her bottom , after which , I wish to live no longer ; ' his seeing , after the boat was dashed in pieces on the rocks , the heads and arms of the men , at short intervals , rising on the waves , some of them sinking , while others were making well directed efforts to gain the sands ; his hearing the hollow sound under the deck of the Ariel , which he said to Dillon , was the poor thing herself giving her last groan ; the water is // breaking up her decks , '  --  and the final yielding of the wreck to the overwhelming waters , when its fragments , together with the body of the cockswain , were swept away and scattered in the tumult of the waters . The cockswain considered drowning to be , as to himself , a natural death , which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often prefer to die on the field of battle , rather than upon a featherbed , and as Nelson chose to die on board of his ship in the midst of an engagement . The author seems to consider the drowning of Dillon to be in the nature of an execution , for which he had taken care to qualify him , and to which the reader is well enough reconciled . He also readily sympathises with Barnstable and Merry , in their regret for the loss of the cockswain . Merry contributes greatly to the interest and beauty of the scene on shore ; he is a very happily conceived character , and is well supported throughout the story . Those , who were saved from the wreck of the schooner , are , as was to be expected , brought to the residence of the old refugee whence , after some plots , surprises , and adverse incidents , all the surviving persone dramatis , excepting Boroughcliffe and Alice Dunscombe , are , by the sudden appearance of the pilot , brought safely off , and embarked on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the propriety of the quarrel between Griffith and Barnstable , we mean its consistency with the characters given to the two , and its probability , under the circumstances related , it certainly gives a rude shock to the interest in Barnstable , before excited in the reader . As far as this incident is made the occasion of showing off Cecilia Howard , we do not think it of much importance ; but the other use made of it , in the reconciliation of the two lieutenants after the subsequent battle , is natural and happy , and justifies forcing circumstances a little in order to introduce it , if this could not be otherwise done . The murmurings and jokes of the men , as they are marching to the shore , even admitting them to be both characteristic and true , as they indeed seem to be , have hardly enough in them to recommend them to the reader . The death of long Tom would have been a sore calamity to the reader , had not Boltrope survived , with whom he is now made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dialogue , action , and interest of the // 1824 . The Pilot , a Tale of the Sea . story , which , but for some such successor , would have been left vacant by the death of the cockswain . We shall not be understood to say , that the two characters are alike . The conversation between Boltrope and the chaplain , as they are waiting in the cutter for the party to come off shore , is ad-. mirably well sustained . Boltrope has a mortal aversion to knee-breeches , which , as he imagines , constitute a part of the devil 's costume . On seeing the two ladies coming on board , Boltrope says , I should as soon have expected to see Mr Barnstable come off with a live ox in his boat , as a petticoat ! The Lord only knows what the ship is coming to next . What between cocked hats and epaulettes , and other knee-buckle matters , she was a sort of no. man's.land before , and now , what with the women and their bandboxes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder they did n't all come on board in a coach and six , or a one horse chay . ' Vol . II . p. 231 . As one more specimen of the sailing master 's character , after the bustle of embarking , the drinking , the songs , jests and laughter of the men had gradually subsided , and they were one after another bestowing themselves , some upon deck and some below , with such preparntion for comfortable rest as their narrow accommodations would permit , Boltrope groped his way into the hold among the seamen , where , kicking one of the most fortunate of the men from his birth , he established himself in his place , with all that cool indifference to the other 's comfort , that had grown with his experience , from the time when he was treated thus cavalierly in his own person , to the present moment . ' Vol . II . p. 233 . The next morning is gorgeously ushered in . The first appearance of the American frigate , as seen in the distance , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away towards the fog and gradually disappearing ; and the English frigate showing remotely a small white sail above the horizon , and the man of war rushing , all at once , into full view from the fog bank , are all well imagined ; and the subsequent chase , the battles with the frigates , and the death of Boltrope , are among the finest passages in the book . In the quotations we have made , we have , for the sake of conciseness , in some instances selected detached sentences , and even parts of sentences , and should thus have done the // author injustice , had we not been writing for readers , wh&amp; are already acquainted with the story . In regard to the style of execution , the work has one fault which was mentioned in our jiotice of the Spy ; it is in some instances , and more especially where the author speaks in his own person , overloaded with epithets , and the detail of particular circumstances . The author leaves too little to his readers , and from his solicitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of everything related or desci'ibed , he impairs the vivacity and force of the expression . Some few passages are perhaps a little too harsh , as , in the battle , one buries his weapon in the heart of one of the enemy ; ' so long Tom pinned the English captain to the mast with his harpoon . ' We do not think that the agonies of Dillon , in drowning , are too palpably given , the reader being reconciled to the exhibition of them , by the hatred and loathing he had before conceived towards the creature . But without some good reason of this sort , a vivid display of extreme physical suffering , ghastly objects , or horrid cruelty , are more shock .. ing than . interesting . Such descriptions do not require great skill in a writer ; they may , however , be introduced with great effect , where the reader is fully l ) repared for them .
