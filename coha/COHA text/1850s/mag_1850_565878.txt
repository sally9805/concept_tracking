ART . VIII*-DAVID IIALEE Memoir of David Hale , late Editor of the Journal of Corn . ' merce ; with &amp;lections from his Miscellaneous l'Vritiug-s . By JOSEPH P. THOMPSON , Pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle Church , New York . Ne*v York : John Wiley , 161 Broadway ; and 13 Paternoster Row , London . 1850 . IN our present number we have already brought to the notice of our readers the memoirs of three distinguished ministers of the gospel . We now call their attention to the memoir of an eminent Christian layman . And we are pleased with an opportunity of doing this , because the religious memoirs of laymen are comparatively too few . This class of persons constitute the chief part of Christian communities ; and it is therefore more important perhaps to teach by example how a layman should live , than how a minister should live . there are many reasons which justify a memoir of the life of David Hale , and a collection of his writings , and which call for a notice thereof in our pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a high moral tone , which spoke daily to tens of thousands ; and one of the ablest editors in the Union : a posi .. tion hardly surpassed in influence by any other . He was an active and liberal supporter of Christian principles and institutions . He was an intelligent , thorough , untiring and generous advocate of the ecclesiastical polity of New England , His life was an nn* usual exemplification of Christian constancy , frankness , integrity , purity and charity . And we may add that his character has been extensively misunderstood-that prejudices against him , unjust and often violent , have obtained wide currency-prejudices excited , partly by his fearlessness , independence and straight-for. ' *vardness in what he thought the path of duty , and partly , by his nentrality , as an editor , between political parties , the manifest leaning of his personal sympathies toward the democratic side , and his open and able advocacy of some theories which of late years have been favored by the party calling itself democratic . It is said of an eccentric clergyman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian education of children , he stooped short , and abruptly remarked ; " After all , brethren , there is a great deal in the breed . " this is a truth which , in one form or other , is generally recognized ; and while it does not justify that pride of blood or family , which is quite common yet totally and intensely anti-Christian , it does excite a proper inter . est and a legitimate curiosity respecting a person 's descent . David Hale , the subject of the memoir before us , was a full blooded Puritan . His father , Rev. David Hale , the pastor for // some years of the Congregational church in Lisbon , Ct. , was descended from Robert Hale , who came from England in 1632 , and was one of the founders , and a deacon , of the first church in Charlestown , Mass . His mother , Lydia Austin , belonged to a family of the New Haven Puritans , well known for their piety and worth . On his father 's side , he was nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American liberty , Captain Nathan Hale , who , undertaking a perilous feat in his country 's service and being taken prisoner by the British forces , just before his summary and savage execution , exclaimed , " My only regret is , that I have but one life to give for my country ; " and , on his mother 's side , he was the nephew of Dr. Samuel Austin , who was pastor at first of a church in New Haven , Ct. , and afterwards , for twenty five years , of the first church in Worcester , Mass. , and then was President of the University of Vermont-one of the ablest preachers and theologians of New England . Mr. Hale 's parents were of the best type of New England character , and gave their only child such a training and example as such parents are wont to give . They were well rewarded , by experiencing in him the fulfillment of the promise included in the familiar declaration of Solomon . When a youth of sixteen , according to the description of a gentleman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( then the residence of his father , who had been compelled by ill health to retire to his paternal farm , ) he was trusty and faithful , frank , truthful and magnanimous . Not satisfied with the opportunities and prospects of a clerk in a country store , at the age of eighteen , in the year 1809 , he went to Boston , and sought employment there . After spending about three years in that city , in the experience of both bad and good treatment as a clerk in the service of different employers , he returned to Coventry , in the faIl of 1812 , soon after the commencement of the war with Great Britian . Not long before leaving Boston , he experienced , at the age of twenty-one , that gre at change , which the Scriptures denominate a new birth , or the passing from death unto life . Before this period , his moral principles were good , his moral conduct was pure , and he was accustomed to keep the Sabbath , and to read the holy Scriptures , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but he was a stranger to the faith which embraces Christ and unites the soul to him in vital and saving bonds . Under the earnest and pungent preaching of Rev. Dr. Griffin , upon whose ministry in Park street church he was a regular attendant , and whose sermons , to use his own words , often sent him home trembling to his room and to his knees , he was effectually called to repentance and faith in Christ . Mr. Hale remained in Coventry about three years , ( with the exception of a short time which he spent , as sergeant of a // company of " Connecticut Guards , " which had been called out for the defense of New London , ) employing himself on his father 's farm , and teaching a district school . In the early part of this temporary residence at home , he made a public profession of religion ; and towards its close , he was united in marriage to his cousin , Miss Laura Hale of Canterbury , Ct. , to whom he had long been ardently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition , culture of mind , refinement of manners , and deep fervent piety , rendered her worthy of the enthusiast , ic admiration and affection with which he ever regarded her . More than a year after her death , he married , in Aug. , 1825 , Miss Lucy S. Turner of Boston , who survives him . At the close of the war , early in 1815 , Mr. Hale returned to Boston , and soon entered into mercantile business : in which lie continued , experiencing various changes , prosperous and adverse , more of the latter however than of the former , yet ever preservirig an unsullied integrity , till he removed to New York , where he took charge of the commercial and business department of the Journal of Commerce , in September , 1827 , the time of its origin . During this period of twelve years , Mr. Hale was an enterprising , active and steadfast Christian . In Park street church , with which he at once connected himself , he was a leading member of the choir , a faithful teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance at the conference room , bearing an acceptable and edifying part in the services of that place . He was one of those , who , in the year 1822 , went from Park street church , to unite with a similar colony from the Old South church , and a fragment of the Essex street church , then on the verge of dissolution , in forming the Union church . " This was the first aggressive movement of any importance on the part of the Orthodox since the development of Socinianism in Boston . It was therefore a movement of peculiar interest and responsibility . A gentleman familiar with the enterprise observes , There was plenty of work to he done by the infant church , for the whole current of popular influence was against them . A congregation was to be collected ; Sabbath Schools were to be gathered and instructed ; religious meetings were to be held , in the conference-room and in private houses ; and a multitude of benevolent enterprises , yet in their infancy , presented strong claims for aid . ' " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents and all his zeal . He was a member of the choir ; he was chosen superintendent of the Sabbath School and was very efficient in that capacity ; he was on the business-committees both of the church and the society , and assisted in compiling their manual and laws ; lie was accustomed to visit the poor , to hold meetings in halls and in private houses , and in every way to labor for the kingdom of Christ . A gentleman of Boston , who was associated with Mr. Hale in the Union Church from its organization to the time of his leaving the city , says of him , He was one of the most active and efficient members of the churchalways present at our public and private meetings-always ready to lead in our devotions and instruct us by his exhortations-unwearied in his labors *n our several committees , for visiting families-examining candidates for admission to the church  --  and conducting our church music . Of his labors as su // qwq // David Hale. 133 The important position of associate editor , and joint proprietor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two years . That paper originated in a true regard for the interests of morality and religion . The plan ( which we believe has been faithfully carried out ) was to have " a first rate commercial paper , " without the customary violation of the Sabbath by labor , in the office , or in the collection of news , or in any way , during its sacred hours ; without any participation in the gain of those fashionable vices which sap the foundations of morality and religion ; and with the habit of plain speaking against moral delinquencies . It was established by the princely liberality of Mr. Arthur Tappan ; who , after expending upon it during the first year thirty thousand dollars , relinquished it to his brother , Mr. Lewis Tappan , who , in a few months , made an arrangement by which Mr. Hale and Mr. Gerard Hallock became its editors and joint proprietors . The character of Mr. Hale as an editor , we will give in the words of his biographer , Mr. Thompson , and of Mr. Hallock , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sec ond by Mr. Hallock . " Although it was expected that Mr. Hale would devote himself rather to the commercial and business department of the paper , than to the departments of literature and politics , yet neither his thoughts nor his pen could be idle , and by the vigor and pertinence of his articles upon a great variety of subjects , he soon proved himself to be one of the ablest editors in the Union . Self-taught as he was in every thing beyond the rudiments of education , unskilled in the rhetoric of the schools , he yet wrote with a precision , a correctness , and force of language , to which few attain . Elegance of composition he never attempted ; but his words fitly spoken* were sometimes like apples of gold in pictures of silver . ' He always expressed himself clearly , concisely , forcibly ; and sometimes with that nice discrimination , both in words and ideas , which indicates the true philosopher . When we consider that he had no editorial sanctum ; that his articles were written-not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by tortuous staircases and labyrinth passages , and guarded by spring-locks against all who could not give the magic Sesame '  --  but in the business office of the Journal , of late years on the corner of XValI and Water streets , at a desk directly facing two doors , amid the rumbling of carts , the cries of street venders , the hum of conversation , the receiving and disbutsing of money , and incessant interruptions from calls and questions requiring his personal attention-when we consider that his articles were written by snatches , in such a position , and were often sent to the compositor without revision , we are filled with astonishment at their excellence both of thought and style , and at the power of abstraction and of self-government which must have been acquired in order to produce such compositions in circumstances so unpropitious. " - pp. 51 , 52 . " I own that at this time I did not appreciate , nor fully know , the strength of his intellectual powers ; nor did either of us dream that he would ever take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ablest editors in the Union . I only expected to receive occasional aid from his pen , and that not of the highest order : but in point of fact , while he made his own ( the commercial ) department of the paper all that could be desired , he became a most efficient coadjutor in the editorial department proper . For vigor of conception , force // of reasoning , and aptness of illustration , some of his articles would not sulter in comparison with the leading editorials of the London Times . Language he did not study , having had but a common school education in his youth ,  - -  yet by long prictice , he acquired a facility of expression which many of the best scholars are not able to command . Thoughts he never lacked . They flowed faster than his pen could indite thern. " - pp. 138 , 139 . In New York , as in Boston , notwithstanding the increased pressure of his business , Mr. Hale uniformly gave his chief interest , and proper attention , to the affairs of religion . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congregational over the Presbyterian polity . But his experience of the latter for a few years resulted in a thorough investigation of the subject , and a very decided and active choice of the former . After being connected , * chiefly on account of the change of his residence in the city , with several Presbyterian churches , with a growing dissatisfaction at what he deemed the too free exercise of official prerogatives , and the too limited liberty of the brotherhood , he joined , in the year 1837 , a Congregational church , worshipirig in the Broadway Tabernacle , which soon formed a union with the Dey street Presbyterian church . The united church , which was , by agreement , of a modified Presbyterian type , soon settled Rev. Joel Parker as its pastor , and was harmonious and prosperous for several months thereafter , until some disciplinary action by the session , deemed by some very arbitrary , created dissatisfaction . The circumstances , which constitute quite an important link in Mr. Hale 's history , and indeed in the ecclesiastical history of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of New England , are thus briefly narrated by Mr. Hale 's biographer . " An anti-slavery society was about to be formed in the Tabernacle Church . The session being opposed to the movement , cautioned the church against it . This produced much excitement among the friends of the society , one of whom , in particular , Mr. Lewis Tappan , then a member of the church , publicly denounced the course of the session as arbitrary , and insisted upon the right of forming such a society . At length Mr. Tappan was cited before the session as a disturber of the peace of the church , and a slanderer of its officers ; but without being tried on the original charges , he was condemned for contumacy , and suspended from church privileges . From this sentence he appealed to the higher judicatories of the Presbyterian Church , and the decision of the session was finally reversed by the General Assembly . One great point in controversy was the right of Mr. Tappan to employ a reporter to attend on his trial before the session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right the session denied . " Mr. Hale , with his ardent love of liberty of thought and speech , and above all , liberty of Christian action , and with some personal experience of ecclesiastical dictation , could not remain an indifferent spectator of such an affair . He had no sympathy with Mr. Tappan 's anti-slavery opinions or measures , and was not then on very friendly terms with Mr. Tappan himself . But he felt that great principles were involved in the trial , and that Mr. Tappan was wronged and oppressed by the session . After expostulating with the elders in vain , he availed himself of the provision in the articles of agreement between // the united churches for occasional meetings of the whole church for business , and had a church meeting called by public notice for the prayerful consideration of a case of discipline . ' " - pp. 63 , 64 . At this meeting Mr. Hale made an extended speech , which ( as the church voted to admit a reporter , who took notes of all the proceedings ) has been preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It manifests a thorough knowledge of important principles of Christian liberty and church government , and a manly , bold and yet fraternal spirit . At the conclusion , he proposed that the following should be added to the permanent rules of the church . " 1 . In the discipline of this church no member shall be obliged to make his defense before any judicatory other than the session of this church , and any member tried by the session shall have the right of appeal to the whole body of his brethren assembled in church meeting . " 2 . The first church prayer-meeting in each season of the year shall be a business meeting , at which any member of the church may introduce any proposition which he deems proper , and meetings for business shall be held at any other time by direction of a majority of the members present at any weekly prayer-meeting ; but such meetings , other than at the commencement of each season , shall be notified on the Sabbath preceding their occurrence . The covenant , or confession of the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a meeting specially notified for important business . " 3 . At the annual meeting in April , a church clerk shall be chosen who shall record all the resolutions and other proceedings of the church in a book , which book shall always be accessible to any member of the church during ordinary business hours . * * * " After a protracted and animated discussion , the Moderator put the question on the resolutions submitted by Mr. Hale , and declared the vote by voices to be in the negative . The result was doubted and a count loudly called for , but the Moderator did not notice the call , and so the meeting was immediately adjourned. " - pp. 77 , 78 . The result of these and subsequent discnssions and measures , is thus described in the volume before us . " The effect of this discussion on the mind of Mr. hale was to increase his jealousy of official prerogatives in a church , and his love for the free ecclesiastical institutions of New England . He began to study more attentively the Word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polity therein contained . Thus the providence of God was preparing him to be , as it were , the parent of a new movement in the religious affairs of New York , and in the midst of ecclesiastical systems so long established here as to claim a sort of prescriptive right to the soil , to introduce successfully that simple and efficient system of church polity which has existed in New England from its first settlement , which is believed to have been substantially the system of the primitive churches , and which best secures Christian liberty and best develops Christian character . For such a movement there was needed a leader who could confront jealousy and bear the opposition even of brethren ,  --  who should be able to defend the cause which he espoused ,  --  one who could go forward , if need be , alone , and in face of a virtual excommunication from Christian fellowship , to do what he felt to be important for the interests of truth and of ( *hrist 's kingdom . " - pp. 95,96. // One very important result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Broadway Tabernacle , and the formation therein of a pure and flourishing Congregational church . This transaction is thus described by Mr. Hallock . " This purchase was made in the year 1840 . Property and credit were at the lowest ebb . Money was worth two per cent . a month . Rich men felt poor , and the poor men felt like beggars . In such a state of things it was announced that the Tabernacle was about to be sold under a foreclosure . It had been occupied as a Presbyterian church , and a pure Gospel had been preached there . It was now liable to fall into the hands of errorists , of one kind or another , and in that case , instead of being what it had been , and was intended to be , it would become a grand center of mischief . Various efforts were made among the good people of the Presbyterian denomination to raise the necessary funds , but without success . At length David Hale came to me , and inquired if Iliad any objection to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing that he really had no money to spare , and that all the receipts of the firm would be required for a considerable time for the payment of debts ; yet I gave my consent . I however remarked to him that his motives would be misconstrued ,  --  that it would be said he was speculating in churches , and all that ,  --  and I would advise him , on the spot , to place the matter in such a shape that under no circumstances could he realize more than seven per cent . on the money invested . He approved of my suggestion , and governed himself accordingly . He might have made *15,000 or $20,000 out of the transaction , and he fully believed so at the time ; but instead of this , he raised money wherever he could obtain it , either from his own resources , the good will of personal friends , or friends of the cause , and then loaned it to the society at seven per cent . Such was the effect of the operation , though in form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this is not all . For several years after the purchase , he had the sole management of the building , renting it from day to day , and evening to evening , as he had opportunity , for public purposes , receiving pay for the same , and in various ways expending time and labor about it ,  --  tor no part of which has he ever received or desired to receive a single cent for his own benefit . Every dollar realized from such meetings , or from the building in any way , has been applied toward the extinction of indebtedness upon the property , the payment of interest , &amp;c . The result of the matter is , that a considerable portion of the cost of the edifice has been extinguished by its own earnings . It is now the property of the society worshiping in it , at a cost not equal to half its value ; and the only pecuniary advantage that Mr. 1-Jale has ever derived from it , is , that he has been largely out of pocket on account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4000 or $5000 , which , however , we understand , is about to be paid to his heirs . " Take it all in all , the purchase of the Tabernacle ought to be regarded as the crowning act of his life . For not only was it one of the most liberal acts ( considering the pecuniary circumstances of the purchaser at the time ) to be found in the annals of benevolence , but it was a parent act , of which the offspring have already risen , in goodly numbers , both in this city and Brooklyn . Since the purchase of the Tabernacle , arid by a process easily traced back to that event , not less than ten or eleven Congregational churches have been or ganized in the two cities , most of which are large and flourishing , and provided with pastors of distinguished talents and piety . " - pp. 140 , 141 . The liberality of Mr. Hale is worthy of special mention . His partner testifies , that , when he had money , he freely laid it on the altar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he want .. ed money for was to give it away . On this point , we quote the following statement from the memoir . // " From the beginning of* his Christian life , Mr. Hale was distinguished for liberality . In Boston , when his means were limited , he gave hundreds of dob lars to benevolent objects , and when afterwards in this city his income increased , his contributions increased , as they should , in a higher ratio , until he gave away thousands annually , and in the aggregate tens of thousands , to promote various objects of Christian benevolence . " Of late years Mr. Hale 's contributions were turned very much into the channel of Congregational enterprises . This was not owing to mere sectarian feeling . As we have seen , Congregationalism was with him a matter of prin .. ciple . He did not value it as an jam , but as an embodiment of the free Spirit of the Gospel , as the best system of church organization for all the practical ends of such organization . Therefore he contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be honored . But besides this , he was of opinion that Christians who had the means of doing good on a large scale should have specific objects under their care , as for instance that one should sustain a college , another a church , a third a missionary , &amp;c. , and so he looked after interests which others were apt to overlook . I can not ascer* tam how much he contributed towards Congregational objects . He gave thousands of dollars to individual churches in this city and in Brooklyn , and sometimes assumed very heavy responsibilities for a new church enterprise . He gave large sums of money to feeble churches or new organizations in Western New York , and in regions farther wesL He usually supported from his own purse one or more missionaries at the West ; at one time three , at an average salary of $500 . The establishment of a Congregational church in Detroit would not have been attempted but for him . When the brethrep who contemplated forming that church felt that they were too few and feeble for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of the pastor ( $600 per annum ) for two years , while at the same time he eupported a missionary evangelist among the feeble churches of Michigan . Says the late pastor of the church in Detroit , Two tkoueqnd dollars came from him to me and through my hands to sustain the cause in Michigan . ' " - pp. 118 , 119,120 . Did our limits permit , we would gladly transfer to our pages the description which his biographer has given , with clearness and fidelity , and we doubt not with impartiality and truth , of the prominent features of Mr. Hale 's character . We must content ourselves with a single paragraph ; which we select , because it sets forth an example worthy of imitation by all who have any thing to do in ecclesiastical affairs . After describing Mr. Hale 's devotion to the idea of duty  --  a devotion , which , if occasion offered , would have made him an unflinching martyr-his frankness , his integrity , his aversion to stratagem and trick and maneeuvering , his firmness and decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral subjects seemed at times to be formed intuitively . Especially was this true where great principles were involved . There were certain principles of moral science , ecclesiastical polity , and po .. litical economy , which he had weighed and settled . Some of these were original in the sense of having been thought out by and for himself ; all of them had been made his own by being subjected to the rigid analyeie of his own mind . His principles were fixed , and he usually made up his mind promptly and decidedly ; and when his mind was made up in view of truth and duty , who or what could change him ? Opposition could not turn him ; neither obloquy nor entreaty could induce him to retract . And yet with all this decision and firmness , which , in the view of some , amounted even to ob*. stinacy , there was one principle to which ; as a Coiigregationalist , he faitAifi4ly // adhered ; and that was , always to yield to the decision of the mctjority . This he invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party in the church , or to make others uncomfortable by constant irritation . I have seen him laugh heartily at being conquered in a fair debate . He could not be driven from his principles , but he would cease to drive them , when he found that the case was fairly decided against him . Hence he made no difficulty in the church . In the present Tabernacle Church , he had no occasion to contend for the right of speech , and he respected the rights of others . In debate he was always calm and cheerful . The perfect self-control which enabled him when assaulted in the Exchange to refrain from blows or anger , and when spit upon by an excited politician , on board a steamboat , calmly to wipe his face with his handkerchief , remarking only that it was " a dirty trick , " - that complete self-possession to which he had attained , made him at once a formidable and an agreeable opponent in an argument . He would not betray anger in debate even under strong provocation , but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found that his own views were likely to prevail , if the minority was large , and the proposed measure likely to produce ill feeling , he would not press it to a decision , but would ask a postponement for the sake of friendly conference , or would endeavor to harmonize the parties on some common basis . His influence on the church in this respect was eminently happy . " - pp. 122 , 123 , 124 . A very pleasing view is given in this memoir of Mr. Hale in his domestic relations , as a Christian father , son and husband . We *vil1 give a single illustration . In 1846 , he received a severe blow by the death of a daughter , Mrs. Lydia Devan , whom he tenderly loved , and whom two years before he had given up , with a joyful resignation , and a grateful sense of the honor thus conferred by Christ upon him , to the missionary work in China . The intelligence of this event reached New York on the day of the weekly prayer-meeting of the Tabernacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place , the object of regard and sym* pathy to all present . His bereavement , though not formally mentioned , affected the selection of the hymn , and gavo direction to the remarks of the pastor . " Scarcely were these remarks finished when Mr. Hale rose and said , I suppose you hardly expect me to speak to-night , and yet I know not why I should not speak to-night if ever . I can not mourn for my daughter ( and here his utterance choked ) -I bless God that He gave me such a daughter , and that He inclined her to go and serve Him among the heathen ; and now that He has taken her to himself , shall I mourn ? How different are my feelings from those of a parent whose son has fallen on a Mexican battle-field ! I might have reason to mourn if a child of mine had died in such a war as that in which we are engaged against a weak , half-civilized , sister nation . But now I have no tears to shed . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to have them around me  --  to dandle them always upon my knee ; nor do I desire to ; I have something else to do , and I trust they have also . I have consecrated them to God , and have endeavored to train them for usefulness , and now if Christ honors one of them with a call to serve Him any where in His kingdom , shall I object and complain ? No ; I will rejoice at it . We ought not to tall* of such things as a sacrifice , and make an ado about parting with our children for Christ . I say to these young converts ( it was a season of revival ) if any of you shall go to serve Him among the heathen , i 'll help you with my prayers , I 'll help you with my money , but I wo n't shed a tear ; I 'll rejoice over it . ' " - pp. 110 , 111. // Mr. Hale 's active usefulness was terminated very suddenly and unexpectedly on the 11th of June , 1848 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon rallied for a time , and he was able to journey for his health ; but after a few months another disease supervened , and terminated his life on the 20th of January , 1849 . He died , not only resigned to the Divine will which dictated hisdisease , but desirous to depart , commending his soul to his Savior , and his children to that faith in Jesus by which he had been ruled in life and was supported in death . A large part of the volume before us , 376 pages out of 520 , is occupied by " Selections from the Miscellaneous Writings " of Mr. Hale . These are characterized by profound thought , and directness and vigor of language ; arid , being for the most part on subjects of deep and lasting interest , are well worthy of being taken from the neglected and almost forgotten files of daily and weekly journals , in which the chief portion of them were published , and put forth in this accessible and permanent form . In making these selections from Mr. Hale 's writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects , on which , espepecially that of free trade , Mr. Hale wrote much , and with great ability , arid has limited himself mainly to topics of a moral arid religious nature . The most important subjects treated in the Selections which have been made , are the theater , permanent funds , colonization and abolition , church polity and ecclesiastical matters . Romanism and collateral topics , arid the Mexicau war . His " letters on the theater , " first published in Boston in 1826 , are a judicious and forcible argument against that school of corruption . His articles on permanent funds for religious , literary and charitable associations and institutions , contain many important principles , most of which have come to be generally adopted , and manifest much profound , arid some crude , thinking . A specimen of the latter may be seen iu the following paragraph . " What reason is there in endowing a college , beyond the mere purchase of an establishment ? Men in the ordinary pursuits of life must furnish themselves with shops and tools . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished to them without cost , can not earn their own living , they ought to starve . " ( p. 172 . ) If Mr. Hale had known as much about the - operations of a college as he did about the management of the Journal of Commerce , he would have known that a college , thorough in all the departments of academical discipline and learning , without endowments " beyond the mere purchase of an establishment , " beyond " a shop and tools , " can not be sustained , except by raising the price of tuition beyond the ability of all but the sons of the rich ; he would have known , that such an education as a good college gives , can not be afforded at a price which can be paid by // the great body of those who now send their sons to college , and whose sons are our best graduates , arid the most useful men in professional life , except by a college well endowed with funds ; he would have known , that his plan would have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly-aristo. ' cratic institutions . The collection and publication of Mr. Hale 's articles on " Cob .. nization and Abolition , " prove the impartiality of the compiler* but reflect no honor upon Mr. Hale . We ought to except , how. - ever , those which advocate and defend , in a truly philanthropic spirit , the wise and benevolent plan of African colonization-a plan which has been brought ( by whose fault we do not say ) into an unnecessary and unnatural conflict with anti-slavery and abolitionism . But those which treat of anti-slavery , of its men and its measures , we can not approve , but feel bound to censure . Indeed , how a man , who loved Justice and human freedom as Mr. Hale did , could have had so little sympathy as he had with the ardent opposers of slavery and the advocates of emancipation ; how a man , who was so strenuous and uncompromising an advocate of free discussion as he was , could have frowned and sneered as he did at the discussion of the subject of emancipation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations to slavery ; we do not understand . We must insist that his heart was not right on that subject . However , it ought to be borne in mind , that in this matter Mr. Hale was not alone , but was one among many good men , whom various causes conspired to place in a false position on this subject of anti-slaverya position , of which they will be more and more ashamed , we doubt not , in the light of future time , and especially of the future world . On the church , its nature , its polity and its relations , Mr. Hale wrote much , and , in the main , very profoundly , justly , scripturally and forcibly . This part of the volume deserves high commendation . We would gladly quote freely from it , but can not . We advise our readers to get the book . We would direct their attention particularly to an article on " The true church of Christ ; " and to one on " the distinctive principles of Congregational Church polity . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such subjects as apostolical succession , and Christian union . " When the venerable Lyman Beecher was a young man , returning on a certain occasion to his native town in Connecticut , he fell into conversation by the roadside with an old neighbor , an Episcopalian , who had been mowing . Mr. Beecher , ' said the farmer , I should like to ask you a question . Our clergy say that you are not ordained , and have no right to preach . I should be glad to know what you think about it . ' Suppose , ' replied Dr. Beecher , you had in the neighborhood a blacksmith , who said lie could prove that he belonged to a regular line of blacksmiths which had come down all the way // from St. Peter , but he made scythes that would not cut ; and you had another blacksmith , who said lie could not see what descent from St. Peter had to do with making scythes , so long as they were well made , and this man made scythes that would cut . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man who made scythes to cut , certainly , ' replied the farmer . Well , ' said Dr. Beecher , that ministry which cuts *s the ministry which Christ has authorized to preach . ' In a recent conversation on the same subject , Dr. Beecher gave his opinion by relating this story . " - p. 269 . " We shall not go so far out of our proper course as to make a theological argument to prove how much is essential to Christian discipleship . The doctrinal basis ' of the Alliance shows why they could not find the union which they sought . The sixth and shortest article discloses the mischief . Say the Alliance , The justification of the sinner is by faith alone . ' If this is so , then faith is the onl*j essential , and all the other articles are extra-judicial , nonessentials , about which disciples may differ , and still be disciples . If we remember right , this is very much as Christ preached , and laid the matter down himself . We can not recollect that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to discipleship . Wha ' - wha ' - wha ' - what do you say ? ' stammer a thousand tongues ; that we must take in every man who says he has faith ? Why , that would include Quakers , Czerski , and even Papists . Monstrous ! Monstrous ! ! ' Well , monstrous as it is , you must , according to your own showing , gulp it down , if you would have Christian union in its perf*ctness . All the rest may be very great truths , and very necessary to be believed , in order to the most perfect Christian character , but you have made them all non-essential by your own great declaration , faith alone is the ground of justification . " - p. 340 . The principles and claims of the Roman Catholic Church , Mr. Hale ably discussed , in the Journal of Commerce , and with a freedom and independence quite rare in our secular papers . His articles against Bishop Hughes 's project of sectarian schools , are just and forcible , and would , in the main , apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterians for sectarian or parochial schools We quote , from an article on the Pilgrim Fathers in answer to an attack on them by the Freeman 's Journal ( Roman Catholic ) , a brief specimen of the manner in which he dealt with the arguments of Bishop Hughes . " Bishop Hughes , in the versatility of his genius , delivered a lecture two or three years ago , in which he demonstrated , as he seemed to think , that Popery naturally tends to liberty and civilization , and that if it had not always produced these results , it was owing to accidents . ' The Reformation under Luther he thought a great misfortune , as it interrupted the regular development of the blessings of Popery . The Bishop felt sure that the bombshells which were found in the Pope 's nest just at that time were the genuine eggs of the republican goose ; and that , if Luther had not scared her off , she would have hatched out , in due time , a brood of liberty , religion , and literature . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there had burst out a thousand iron slugs and all sorts of murderous things ,  --  that was only an accident . Republican eggs will sometimes hatch that way . At any rate , the Bishop proved to demonstration , that the most hideous despotism which ever crushed our race would have produced liberty , order , and virtue , if only it had been left alone . " - p. 387 . Mr. Hale 's series of articles in opposition to the Mexican war was written with truth and force , and in a manly , patriotic and Christian spirit . Would that all our political journals had had // the justice and courage to take the same ground ! We can quot'e only the introductory and closing paragraphs . " Thomas Jefferson has been ranked by the more religious part of the comrnunity as an infidel . Yet some of his sayings are worthy of the highest place in the esteem of all good men . He could not have been the worst of infidels who said in reference to the slavery which then pervaded almost all the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is just ; ' and in reference to government , that which is morally wrong can not be politically right ' This last declaration stands in high condemnation of that disregard of moral obligation which proclaims , Allis fair in politics ' , ' - ' Our country right or wrong . ' According to Mr. Jefferson 's maxim , governments and political parties are bound by the same moral principles which bind individuals . This is the doctrine of the Bible , and must be the doctrine of all intelligent Christians and philanthropists . The opinion has been industriously inculcated , that a state of war puts an end to the common liberty of free discussion , suspends the law of morality , for the time , and binds every good citizen to unite with ail his powers in support of the government of his country , whatever his private opinions may be of the rectitude or wisdom of its measures . But the opposite of this must be true , upon the rule of Mr. Jefferson . War is so terrible a calamity that govcrmnents ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , governments ought to be restrained by the consciousness that if they allow themselves to be involved in war , they will be called upon to give ample reasons for so great an evil , and during the progress of the war , will be held to a rigorous scrutiny , lest under the influence of its great temptations , they adopt measures which are immoral . That in these days a rution is at war , seems olmost of necessity to imply a want of wisdom or sound morality . There was force in that declaration of a Senator who exclaimed , Of what value is your diplomacy , if it can not save us from war . ' " - pp. 478,479 . " In the midst of all the dangers that surround us , there is but one clear way of either sound morality or sound policy . It is to come out of the difficulty by the same path through which we entered it . In short , to abandon the war ; to call home our young men , and leave Mexico whole and entire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boundless prosperity which Providence bestows upon us . The cry , No more appropriations br the tear , must go up from all parts of the nation . It is the only cry that can place us in safety . To express opposition to the war , without declaring that the war is to be abandoned ; to oppose it , and still vote supplies for it , is only to support the administration in carrying it on . No man in the nation would be more relieved than the President by seeing an end of the war . If I understand his feelings , he would have been happy if Congress had refused appropriations at their last session . But no one dares to take the responsibility of recommending an abandonment of the war . What a disgrace it implies upon the Christianity of our country ! The President . recommended the war , and Congress , afraid of the people , voted it . lie points out the means of carrying it on , and they vote the men and money through fear of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence and morality of the people . Let the people speak , then , and undeceive their rulers . Let them know that they stand at the head of a nation , not of military rowdies , but of Christian men , full of the wisdom of peace and good will . At any rate , the tide must be turned by the people , and it can only be done by a bold and loud demand that the war should be abandoned . No more appropriations Jbr the war. - Gome away ,  --  LET MExIco ALONE ! ! must be pr*c*aimed through the land . Let no man call himself a friend of peace who is not willing to take this attitude . All other opinions are upon the whole in favor of war . " But whatever my countrymen may please to do or say , I do not intend to live or die with any of the blood-stains of this war upon me . DAVID HALE. " - ' - pp. 491,492. // We feel constrained to allude in conclusion to the political big .. otry and intolerance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hale . We think that no one , who reads this memoir , or looks at any impartial account of Mr. Hale 's life , can doubt that he was an eminently good man . Yet , while he lived , he was looked upon with distrust and suspicion by not a few even among Christians . His motives were impeached , and his conduct was misrepresented . Many men , and ( we blush to say it ) many in our evangelical churches , were wont to say that they had no confidence in either his integrity or his piety . He was often . denounced both privately and publicly , and sometimes in violent language , as a knave and a hypocrite . His deeds and plans of self-denying and far seeing liberality were called acts and schemes of selfishness ; and his uniform and manly Christian profession and conduct were named hypocrisy . We remember reading a paragraph in a leading political paper of Ne*v York , just after a presidential election , in which Mr , Hale was likened to one of the most brutal ruffians ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censured , in very coarse terms , the conduct of the Journal of Commerce during the political struggle which had just ended , and remarked , that " the Dirk Hatteraick of the concern voted the loco-foco ticket ! " Now why all this ? Simply because Mr. Hale differed from these men on such difficult questions as those respecting the currency and the tariff-questions , on both sides of which are some of the most thorough political philosophers , and pure minded Christians , of whom this country can boast ? The truth is , there is no bigotry or intolerance in this coutitry , even among the most narrow spirited of our religious sectarians , to be compared with the bigotry and intolerance of the members of our political parties . We have no bigots who deserve to be mentioned in the same day with our political bigots . To belong to an opposite political party is thought by many to be proof positive , that one can be neither pious , nor honest . We have not infrequently heard even religious men say , that they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we think that the authors of such expressions , and those who were wont to use such language as we have referred to respecting Mr. Hale , would not offend a holy God more should they s*vear , or steal . And we feel constrained to call upon all our readers , and especially our Christian readers , to look at the odiousness and sinfulness of such intolerance , as it appears in the light of this memoir . We call on them to look upon it , in the light of the fact , that within ten or fifteen years , political questions and plans , on which parties were formed , have become " ohsolete ideas , " and matters of no difference at all . We call on them to apply the principles of candor , justice and Christianity to // the subject of political differences , and to judge of those who di. *agree with them in political opinions and conduct with that fairness which sees things as they are , and that charity which " thinketh no evil . " The manner in which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing this volume , deserves our decided commendation . In narrating the events of Mr. Hale 's life , and in drawing his character , he has made a skillful and felicitous use of the materials which care and industry could collect ; and we can not see that love for his friend has affected his impartiality . The collection of Mr. Hale 's writings , gathered by him , as a considerable portion of them were , in an examination of more than six thousand numbers of the Journal of Commerce , and identified as Mr. Hale 's by his inquiries of the associate editor , Mr. Hallock , must have cost far more time and labor than the preparation of the memoir . The fact that Mr. Thompson has performed this laborious task , while attending to the duties of pastor of the Tabernacle Church and of associate editor of the Independent , is an illustration of how much work there is in some men .
