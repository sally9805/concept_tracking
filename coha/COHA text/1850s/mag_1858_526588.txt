AARON BURR. * THE life of Aaron Burr is an iidmirable subject for a biographer . He belonged to a class of men , rare in America , who are remarkable , not so much for their talents or their achievements , as for their adventures and the vicissitudes of their fortunes . Europe has produced many such men and women : political intriguers ; royal favorites ; adroit courtiers ; adventurers who carried their swords into every scene of danger ; courtesans who controlled the affairs of states ; persevering schemers who haunted the purlieus of courts , plotted treason in garrets , and levied war in fine ladies ' boudoirs . In countries where all the social and political action is concentrated around the throne , where a pretty woman may decide the policy of a reign , a royal marriage plunge nations into war , and the disgrace of a favorite cause the downfall of a party , such persons find an ample field for the exercise of the arts upon which they depend for success . The history and romance of Modern Europe are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Scott . But the full sunllght of our republlcan life leaves no lurking-place for the mere trickster . Doubtless , selfish purposes influence our statesmen , as well as the statesmen of other countries ; but such purposes can not be accomplished here by the means which effect them elsewhere . He who wishes to attract the attention of a people must act publicly and with reference to practical matters ; but the ear of a monarch may be reached in private . Therefore there is a certain monotony in the byes of most of our public men ; they may be read in the life of one . It is , generally , a simple story of a poor youth , who was born in humble station , and who , by painful * The L ( fe and Times of Aaron Burr . By J. PARTON . New York : Mason , Brothers . 186*. effort in some useful occupation , rose slowly to distinguished place ,  --  who displayed hightalents , and made an honorable use of them . Aaron Burr , ' however , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading men of his time , his romantic enterprises , the crimes and the talents which have been attributed to him , his sudden elevation , and his protracted and agonizing humiliation have attached to his name a strange and pecullar interest . Mr. Parton has done a good service in recalling a character which had wellnigh passed out of popular thought , though pot entirely out of popular recollection . As to the manner in which this service has been performed , it is impossible to speak very highly . The book has evidently cost its author great pains ; it is filled with detail , and with considerable gossip concerning the hero , which is piquant , and , if true , important . The style is meant to be lively , and in some passages is pleasant enough ; but it is mi*rked with a flippancy , which , after a few pages , becomes very disagreeable . It abounds with the slang usually confined to sporting papers . According to the author , a civil man is " as civil as an orange , " a well-dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unobserved action is done " on the sly . " He affects the intense , and , in his pages , newspapers " go rabid and foam personalities , " are " ablaze with victories " and " bristling with bulletins , "  --  the pubbe is in a " delirium , " - the politicians are " maddened , " - letters are written in " hot haste , " and proclamations " sent flying . " He appears to be on terms of intimacy with historical personages such as few writers are fortunate enough to be admitted to . He approves a remark of George II . and patronizingly exclaims , " Sensible King ! " He has occasion to mention John Adams , and sa // lutes him thus : " Glorious , delightful , honest John Adams I An American John Bull ! The Comic Uncle of this exciting drama ! " He then calls him " a high-mettled game-cock , " and says " he made a splendid show of fight . " Such little foibles and vanities might easily be pardoned , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain portions of our history hitherto not perfectly understood , and it contains many statements for the truth of which we must rely upon the good sense and accuracy of the writer ; yet it is full of errors , and often evinces a disposition to exaggeration little calculated to produce confidence in its reliability . Our space will not permit us to point out all the mistakes which Mr. Yarton has made , and we will mention only a few which attracted our attention upon the first perusal of his book . His hero was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel when only twenty-one years of age , and the author says that he was " the youngest man who held that rank in the Revolutionary army , or who has ever held it in an army of the United States . " Alexander Hamilton and Brockholst Livingston both reached that rank at twe , nty years of age. - Mr . Parton tells us that Burr 's rise in politics was more " rapid than that of any other man who has played a conspicuous part in the affairs of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the political arena , he was advanced , first , to the highest honor of the bar , next , to a seat in the National Council , and then , to a competition with Washington , Adams , Jefferson , and Clinton , for the Presidency itself : " He could hardly have crowded more errors into a single paragraph . Burr never attained the highest honor of the bar . His first appearance in politics was as a member of the Legislature of New York , in 1784 , when twenty-eight years old ; five years after , he was appointed Attorney-General ; in 1791 he was elected to the S*nate of the United States ; and in 1801 , at the age of forty-five , seventeen years after he fairly entered public life , he became Vice-President . Hamilton was a member of Congress at twenty-five , and at thirty-two was Secretary of the Treasury ; Jefferson wrote the great Declaration when only thirty-two years old ; and the present Vice-President is a much younger man than Burr was when he reached that station . The statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Presidency , is absurd . Under the Constitution , at that time , each elector voted for two persons ,  --  the candidate who received the greatest number of votes ( if a majority of the whole ) being declared President , and the one having the next highest number Vice-President . In 1792 , at which time Burr received one vote in the Electoral College , all the electors voted for Washington ; consequently the vote for Burr , upon the strength of which Mr. Parton makes his magnificent boast , was palpably for the Vice-Presidency . In 1796 , the Presidential candidates were Adams and Jefferson , for one or the other of whom every elector voted ,  --  the votes for Burr , in this instance thirty in number , being , as before , only for the Vice-Presidency . Even in 1800 , when the votes for Jefferson and Burr in the Electoral College were equal , it is notorious that this equality was simply the result of their being supported on the same ticket ,  --  the former for the office of President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , that , in the House of Representatives , Burr would have been elected on the first ballot , if a majority would have sufficed ; and that Mr. Jefferson never received more than fiftyone votes in a House of one hundred and six members . Had he taken the trouble to examine Gales 's " Annals of Congress " for 1799-1801 , he would have found that the House consisted of one hundred and four members , two seats being vacant ; and that on the first ballot Jefferson received fifty-five votes , a majority of six. - We am several times told that Robert R. Livingston was one of the framers of the Constitution . Mr. // Livingston was not a member of the Constitutional Convention ; the only person of the name in that body was William Livingston , Governor of New Jersey. - Mr . Parton comes into conflict with other writers upon matters affecting his hero , as to which he would have done well if he had given his authority . Matthew 12 . Davis , Burr 's first biographer and intimate friend , says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family at the time of the birth of Burr 's father , says that it was Puritan and had flourished in New England for three generations . Mr. Parton makes Burr a witness of a dramatic interview between Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Prevost shortly after the discovery of Arnold 's treason , the particulars of which Davis says Burr obtained from the latter lady after she became his wife-Our author is not consistent in his own statements . Upon one page he describes Mrs. Prevost , about the time of* her marriage , as " the beautiful Mrs. Prevost " ; a few pages farther on he says she was " not beautiful , being past her prime . " He informs us that it is the fashion to underrate Jefferson , that the polite circles and writers of the country have never sympathized with him ,  - -  and in the very same paragraph he remarks that " Thomas Jefferson has been for fifty years the victim oP* incessant eulogy . " This carelessness in reciting facts is associated with a certain confusion of mind . Mr. Parton does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same thing . He describes Hamilton as honest and generous , and then accuses him of malignity and dishonorable intrigue . He says that Wilkinson , at that time a general in the United States service , may have thought of hastening the dissolution of the Union " without being in any sense a traitor . " How an officer can meditate the destruction of a government which he has sworn to protect , and not be in any sense of th' word a traitor , will puzzle minds not educated in what the author calls " the Burr school . " But the most curious exhibition which Mr. Parton makes of this mental and moral confusion occurs in a passage where he attempts to prove his assertion , that " Burr has done the state some service , though ' they know it not . " This service , of which the state has continued so obstinately ignorant , consists mainly in having invented filibustering , and in having brought duelling into disgrace by killing Hamilton . " That was a benefit , " our moralist gravely remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a benefit as Captain Kidd conferred upon the world ; he brought piracy into disgrace by being hanged for it . As to the invention of filibustering , we are hardly disposed to rank Burr with Fultom and Morse for his vduable discovery ; but perhaps the shades of Lopez and De Boulbon , and the living " gray-eyed man of destiny , " will worship him as the founder of their order . It is impossible to define Mr. Parton 's opinion of his hero . It is not very clear to himself . He is inclined to admire him , and is quite sure that he has been harshly dealt with . In the Preface he intimates that ' it is his purpose to exhibit Burr 's good qualities ,  --  for , as he says , " it is th' good in a man who goes astray that ought most to alarm and warn his fellowmen . " The converse of which proposition we suppose the author thinks equally true , and that it is the evil in a man who does not go astray which ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the volume Mr. Parton makes a summary of Burr 's character ,  --  says that he was too good for a politician , and not great enough for a statesman ,  --  that Nature meant him for a schoolmaster ,  --  that he was a useful Senator , an ideal VicePresident , and would have been a good President ,  --  and that , if his Mexican expedition had succeeded , he would have run a career similar to that of Napoleon . We do not dare attack this extraordinary eulogy . To describe a man as not great enough for a statesman , yet fitted to make a good President , as a natural-born schoolmaster and at the same // time a Napoleon , argues a boldness of conception which makes criticism dangerous . Mr. Parton occasionally assumes an air of impartiality , and mildly expresses his disapprobation of Burr 's vices ; but in every instance where those vices were displayed he earnestly defends him . In the contest with Jefferson , Parton insists that Burr acted honorably ; in the duel with Hamilton , Burr was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad man ; so that , although we are told that Burr had faults , we look in vain for any exhibition of them . In the cases where we have been accustomed to think that his passions led him into crime , he either displayed the strictest virtue , or , at most , sinned in so gentlemanlike a manner , with so much kindness and generosity , as hardly to sin at all . - There are three ways of writing a biography : one is , to make a simple narrative and leave the reader to form his own opinion ; another , to present the facts so as to illustrate the author 's conception of his hero 's character ; a third , and the most common way , to proceed like an advocate , to suppress everything which can be suppressed , to sneer at everything which can not be answered , to put the most favorable construction upon all dubious matters , and to throw the strongest light upon every fortunate circumstance . Mr. Parton has tried all three modes , and failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor story-teller , and a worse advocate . His book , despite its spasmodic style , lacks vigor . It indicates a want of fii:mness and precision of thought . It leaves a mixed impression on the mind . We venture to say , that two thirds of its readers will close the volume with an indefinite contradictory opinion that Burr was a sort of villanous saint , and that the other third , by no means the most inattentive readers , will not be able to form any opinion whatever . There are four periods or events in the life of Burr which are worthy of attendon : his career in the army ; his po litical course and contest with Jefferson ; the duel ; and the Mexican expedition . Upon the first and most pleasing portion of his life we can not dwell . He entered the service shortly after the battle of Bunker Hill , and in two years rose to a Licutenant-Colonelcy . Though engaged in several important battles , he did not have an opportunity to display great military talents , if he possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than many other young men . He resigned in the spring of 1779 ,  --  as he alleged , on account of ill health , but more probably because the failure of the Lee and Conway intrigue had disappointed his hopes of promotion . As an indication of character , the most important circumstance of Burr 's military life was his quarrel with Washington . This difficulty is said to have grown out of some scandalous affair in which Burr . was engaged , a belief which is strengthened by his intrigue with the beautiful and unfortunate Margaret Moncrieffe a few months after . But aside from any such cause , there was ground enough for difference in the characters of the two men . Discipline compelled Washington to hold his subordinates at a distance of implied , if not asserted inferiority ; and Burr never met a man to whom he thought himself inferior . Mr. Parton 's explanation is , that " Hamilton probably implanted a dislike for Burr in Washington 's breast . " The only difficulty with this theory is one which the author 's suppositions often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that Burr was in Washington 's family , Hamilton was probably not acquainted with the General ; he did not enter his staff until nine months after Burr had left it . Burr entered public life at the only period in our history when a man of his stamp of mind could have played a conspicuous part . At the close of the Revolution , in addition to the Tories , there were already two political factions in New York . As early as.1 777 the Whigs had divided upon the election for Governor , and George Clinton was chosen // 1858.1 Aaron Burr . over Philip Schuyler . The division then created continued after the peace , but the differences were , at first , purely personal . Schuyler was the leader of a party made up of a few great families , most prominent among which were the Van Reusselaers and Livingstons . The Van Rensselaers have never been particularly distinguished except as the possessors of a great estate ; the Livingstons , on the other hand , second only to the great Dutch family in wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Van Rensselaers and Schuylers were connected with the Livingstons by marriage ; and This powerful association , made more powerful by the banishment of the wealthy inhabitants of New York city and Long Island , was still further strengthened by the connection with it of Alexander Hamilton , who married a daughter of Philip Schuyler , and John Jay , who married a daughter of William Livingston . The Schuyler faction excited that opposition which wealth and social and political influence always excite . A party arose which was composed of men of every condition and shade of opinion ,  --  those who were galled by the exclusiveness of the aristocracy ,  --  those who had joined . the opposition to Washington ,  --  the young men who had made their reputation during the war and were eager for professional and political promotion ,  --  and all those who were converts to the new doctrines of government which the dispute with England had originated . At the head of these was George Clinton . Though a man of liberal education , and trained to a liberal profession , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he possessed in an extraordinary degree those more sturdy qualities of mind and character which , in a country where distinction is in the gift of the people , are always generously rewarded . He had great aptitude for business , a clear and rapid judgment , and high physical and moral courage . He was faithful to his friends , and though an unyielding , he was a magnanimous foe . At a time when politics were looked upon almost wholly as the means of personal and family aggrandizement , and the motives of party conduct such as flow from the passions of men , he , more than any of his opponents , adhered to a consistent and not illiberal theory of public action . At the outset of his political career , Burr acted upon the policy which always governed him . He attached himself closely to neither party . When the political issues grew broader , he was careful not to connect himself with any measure . He did not heartily oppose the abolition of the Tory disabilities , nor the adoption of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to prevent him from attempting to defeat Clinton . With a few adherents , he stood between the two parties and maintained a position where he could avail himself of any overtures which might be made to him ; yet he was careful to be so far identified with one side as to be able to claim some political association whenever it became necessary to do so . His success in this artful course was remarkable . Nominally a Clintonian , in 1789 he supported Yates , and a few months afterwards took office under Clinton . In 1791 , while holding a place under a Republican governor , he persuaded a Federal legislature to send him to the Senate of the United States . In the Senate he sided with the opposition , but so moderately that some Federalists were willing to support him for Governor . The Republicans nominated him for the VicePresidency , and shortly after , the Federalists in Congress , almost in a body , voted for him for the Presidency . During all this time , his name was not associated with any important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion of his elevation to the Vice-Presidency is a perfect illustration of the accidental circumstances and unimportant services to which he was generally indebted for advancement . From the commencement of the Presidential canvass of 1800 , it was evident that the // action of New York would control the election . That State then had twelve votes in the Electoral College ; but the electors were chosen by the Legislature , - not , as at present , by the people . The parties in New York were nearly equal , and the result in the Legislature was very doubtful . The city of New York sent twelve members to the Assembly , and usually determined the political complexion of that body . Thus the contest in the nation was narrowed down to a single city , and that not a large one . This gave Burr a favorable field for the exercise of his peculiar talents . His energy , tact , unscrupulousness , and art in conciliating the hostile and animating the indifferent made him unequalled in political finesse . He did not hesitate to use any means in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion in a Federal caucus , and revealed to him the plans of his opponents . He had become unpopular , and had brought odium upon his party by a corrupt speculation ; he therefore declined presenting his own name , and made a ticket comprehending the most distinguished persons in the Republican ranks . George Clinton , Gen. Gates , and Brockholst Livingston were placed at the head of it . The most urgent solicitations were necessary to persuade these gentlemen to consent to a nomination for places which were beneath their pretensions , but Burr answered every objection and overcame every scruple . The respectability of the candidates and the vigorous prosecution of the canvass carried the city by a considerable majority , and insured the election of Mr. Jefferson . Mr. Parton finds in this abundant material for extravagant eulogy of Burr . But most people will be surprised to learn that such services constituted a claim to the Vice-Presidency . If being an adroit politician entitles a person to high office , there is not a town in New York which can not furnish half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Burr 's nomination , however , was not solely due to his labors at this election , but in part also to his subsequent address . The importance of New York made it desirable to select the candidate for the Vice-Presidency from that State . A caucus of the Republican members of Congress directed Mr. Gallatin to ascertain who would be the most acceptable candidate . He wrote to Commodore Nicholson , asking him to discover the sentiments of the leading men in the State . The names of Livingston , Gcorge Clinton , and Burr had been suggested . Livingston was deaf and Nicholson is said to have determined to recommend Clinton . Burr , however , saw him afterwards , and persuaded him to substitute his name instead of Clinton 's in the letter which he had prepared to send to Philadelphia . Col. Burr was accordingly placed upon the Republican ticket . The tie vote between Jefferson and Burr , which unexpectedly occurred in the Electoral College , has given rise to the assertion that Burr endeavored to defeat Jefferson and secure his own election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , but does not succeed in making a very strong argument . The evidence of Burr 's treachery is as positive as from the nature of the case it can he . Of course , he made no open pledges ; it was unnecessary , and it would have been impolitic to do so . The main fact can not be deuicd , that for several week before and after the election went to the House of Representatives , Burr was openly supportcd by the Federalists in opposition to Jefferson .. Burr knew it ; everybody knew it . Why was this support given ? It will require plain proof to satisfy any one who is familiar with the motives of political action , that a party would have so earnestly advocated the election of any man without good reason to suppose that he would make an adequate return for its support . There was but one course which Burr , in honor , could take ; he should have peremptorily refused to permit his name to be used . A word from him would have ended the matter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side consists of some statements made several years after , by parties concerned , which are by no means so direct and unequivocal as might be wished ,  --  and of a series of depositions taken in some lawsuits instituted by Col. Burr to investigate the truth of this charge . One circumstance , which seems to have escaped the notice of our biographer , casts suspicion upon all these documents . Burr applied to Samuel Smith , a United States Senator from Maryland , for his testimony . Smith gives the following account of the transaction : - " Col. Burr called on me . I told him that I had written my deposition , and would have a fair copy made of it . He said , Trust ft to me and I will get Mr. to copy it . ' I did so , and , on his returning it to me , I found words not mine interpolated in the copy . " It is not worth while to discuss a defence which was made out by forgery . His election to the Vice-Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party , and denounced by the Republican press . Burning with resentment , he turned upon his enemies , and , supported by the Federalists , became a candidate for the Governorship of New York , in opposition to the Republican nominee* Hamilton , who alone among the Federal statesmen had openly opposed Burr during the contest for the Presidency , again separated from his party , and earnestly denounced him . Burr was defeated by an enormous majority . his disappointment and anger at being again foiled by Hamilton prompted him to the most notorious and unfortunate act of his life . In speaking of his duel with Gen. Hamilton , we do not intend to judge Col. Burr 's conduct by the rules by which a more enlightened public opinion now judges the duellist . He and his adversary acted according to the custom of their time ; by that standard let them be measured . Mr. Parton thinks that the challenge was as " near an approach to a reasonable and inevitable action as an action can be which is intrinsically wrong and absurd . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Burr was in accordance with the etiquette which then governed men of the worid in such affairs . We think differently . During the election for Governor , Dr. Cooper , of Albany , heard Hamilton declare that he was opposed to Burr , and made a public statement to that effect . Gen. Schuyler denied the truth of this assertion , which Dr. Cooper then reiterated in a published letter , saying that Hamilton and Judge Kent had both characterized Burr as " a dangerous man , and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government , " and that " he could detail a still more despicable opinion which Gen. Hamilton had expressed of Mr. Burr . " Nearly two months after this letter was written , Burr addressed a note to Hamilton asking for an unqualified acknowledgment or denial of the use of any expression which would justify Dr. Cooper 's assertion . The dispute turned upon the words " more despicable , " and as to them there obviously were many difficulties . Cooper thought that the expression , " a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins of government , " conveyed a despicable opinion ; but many persons might think that such language did not go beyond the reasonable limits of political animadversion . Burr himself made no objection to that particular phrase ; he did not allude to it except by way of explanation . The use of such language was common . In his celebrated attack upon John Adams , Hamilton had spoken of Mr. Jefferson as an " ineligible and dangerous candidate . " The same words had been publicly applied to Burr himself , two years before . He did not see anything despicable in the opinion then expressed . A man may be unfit for office from lack of capacity , and dangerous on account of his principles . The most rigid construction of the Code of Honor has never compelled a person to fight every fool whom he thought unworthy of public station , and every dem // March , agogue whose views he considered unsound . If Dr. Cooper , then , was able to discover a despicable opinion where most people could find none , might he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some remark equally innocent ? Burr did not ask what were the precise terms of the remark to which Cooper alluded ; he demanded that Hamilton should disavow Cooper 's construction of that expression . He took offence , not at what had been said , but at the inference which another had drawn from what had been said . The justification of such an inference devolved upon Cooper , not Hamilton , - who by no rule of courtesy could be interrogated as to the justice of another 's opinions . These difficulties presented themselves to the mind of Hamilton . He stated them in his reply , declared that he was ready to answer for any precise or definite opinion which he had expressed , but refused to explain the import which others had placed upon his language . Unfortunately , the last line of his note contained an intimation that he expected a challenge . Burr rudely retorted , reiterating his demand in most insolent terms . The correspondence then passed into the hands of Nathaniel Pendleton on the part of Hamilton , and William P. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the part of Burr . The responsibility of his position weighing upon Hamilton 's mind , before the final step was taken , he voluntarily stated that the conversation with Dr. Cooper " related exclusively to political topics , and did not attribute to Burr any instance of dishonorable conduct , " and again offered to explain any specific remark . This generous , unusual , and , according to strict etiquette , unwarranted proposition removed at once Burr 's cause of complaint . Had he been disposed to an honorable accommodation , he would have received Hamilton 's proposal in the spirit in which it was made . But , embarrassed by this liberal offer , he at once changed his ground , abandoned Cooper 's remark , which had previously been the sole subject of discussion , and peremptorily insisted that Gen. Hamilton should deny ever having made remarks from which inferences derogatory to him could fairly have been drawn . This demand was plainly unjustifiable . No person would answer such an interroga. tory . It showed that Burr 's desire was , not to satisfy his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It establishes the general charge , which Parton virtually admits , that it was not passion excited by a recent insult which impelled him to revenge , but hatred engendered during years of rivalry and stimulated by his late defeat . Burr must long have known Hamilton 's feelings towards him . Those feelings had been freely expressed ; and Burr 's letters discover that he was fully aware of the distrust and hostility with which he was regarded by his political associates and opponents . A man has no claim to satisfaction for an insult given years ago . The entire theory of the duello makes it impossible for one to ask redress for an injury which he has long permitted to go unredressed . The question being , not whether the practice of duelling is wrong , but whether Burr was wrong according to that practice , we have no difficulty in concluding that the challenge was given upon vague and unjustifiable grounds , and that Gen. Hamilton would have been excusable , if he had refused to meet him . It may be said , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same condemnation as the one who gave it . But , even on general grounds , some qualification should be made in favor of the challenged party . His is a different position from that of the challenger . A sensitive man , though he think that he is improperly questioned , may have some delicacy about making his own judgment the rule of another 's conduct . Besides , there were many considerations peculiar to this case . The menacing tone of Burr 's first note made it evident that he meant to force the quarrel to a bloody issued Hamilton , jealous of his reputation for courage , could not // run the risk of appearing anxious to avoid a danger so apparent . Moreover , he was conscious , that , during his life , he had said many things which might give Burr cause for offence , and he was unwilling to avail himself of a technical , though reasonable objection , to escape the consequences of his own remarks . Neither could he apologize for what he still thought was true . These considerations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in camps ; his early fame had been won in the profession of arms . He was a man of the world . He had never discountenanced duelling ; he himself had been engaged in the affair between Laurens and Lee ; and a few years before , his own son had fallen in a duel . Neither his education nor his professions nor his practice could excuse him . It was too late to take shelter behind his general disapproval of a custom which was recognized by his professional brethren and had been countenanced by himself : It is true that he would have shown a higher courage by braving an ignorant and brutal public opinion , but it would be unjust to censure bim for not showing a degree of courage which no man of his day displayed . He and Burr are to be measured by their own standard , not by ours ; and tried by that test , it is easy to see a difference between one who accepts and one who sends an unjustifiable challenge ; it is the difference which exists between an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks between the message and the meeting . This was required by Hamilton to finish some important law business . When he went to White Plains to try causes , he was in the habit of staying at a friend 's house . The last time he visited there , a few days before his death , he said , upon leaving , " I shall probably never come here again . " During this period he invited Col. Win . Smith , and his wife , who was the only daughter of John Adams , to dine with him . Some rare old Madeira which had been given to him was produced on this occasion , and it was afterwards thought that it was his intention by this slight act * express his desire to bury all personal differences between Mr. Adams and himself . These , and various other little incidents , show that he felt his death to be certain ; yet all his business in court and out was marked by his ordinary clearness and ability , all his intercourse with his family and friends by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth of July , Hamilton and Burr met at the annual banquet of the Society of Cincinnati . Hamilton presided . No one was afterwards able to remember that his manner gave any indication of the dreadful event which was so near at hand . lie joined freely in the conversation and badinage of such occasions , and towards the close of the feast sang a song ,  --  the only one he knew ,  --  the ballad of the Drum . But many remembered that Burr was silent and moody . He did not look towards Hamilton until he began to sing , when he fixed his eyes upon him and gazed intently at him until the song was ended . Hamilton was living at the Grange , his country-seat , near Manhattanville . The place is still unchanged . His office was in a small house on Cedar Street , where he likewise found lodgings when necessary . The night previous to the duel was passed there . We have been told by an aged citizen of New York , that Hamilton was seen long after midnight walking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last hours both parties wrote a few farewell lines . In no act of their lives does the difference in the characters of Hamilton and Burr show itself so distinctly as in these parting letters . Hamilton was oppressed by the difficulties and responsibilities of his situation . His duty to his creditors and his family forbade him rashly to expose a life which was so valuable to them ; his duty to his country forbade him to leave so evil an example ; he was not conscious of ill-will towards Col. , Burr ; and his nature revolted at the thought of destroying // human life in a private quarrel . These thoughts , and the consi&amp;rations of pride and ambition which nevertheless controlled him , are beautifully expressed in language which is full of pathos and manly dignity . lie had made his will the day before . He was distressed lest his estate should prove insufficient to pay his debts , and , after committing their mother to the filial protection of his children , he besought them , as his last request , to vindicate his memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letters to Theodosia and her husband are mainly occupied with directions as to the disposal of his property and papers . The tone of them docs not differ greatly from that of his ordinary correspondence . They do not contain a word such as an affectionate father or a patriotic citizen would have written at such a time . They do not express a sentiment such as a generous and thoughtful man would naturally feel on the eve of so momentous an occurrence . There are no misgivings as to the propriety of his conduct , nor a whisper of regret at the unfortunate circumstances which , as he professed to think , co*ipelled him to seek another 's blood . He addressed to his daughter a few lines of graceful compliment , and , in striking contrast with Hamilton 's injunction to his children , Burr 's last request with regard to Theodosia is , that she shall acquire a " critical knowledge of Latin , English , and all branches of natural philosophy . " The combatants met on the 11th of July , 1804 , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey side of the Hudson ,  --  the usual resort , at that time , for such encounters . Burr fired the moment the word was given , raising his arm deliberately and taking aim . The ball struck Hamilton on the side , and , as he reeled under the blow , his pistol was discharged into the air . " I should have shot him through the heart , " said Burr , afterwards , " hut , at the moment I was about to fire , my aim was confused by a vapor . " Burr stepped forward with a gesture of re gret , when he saw his adversary fall ; but his second hurried him from the field , screening him with an umbrella from the recognition of the surgeon and bargemen . Hamilton was carried to the house of Mr. Bayard , in the suburbs of the city . The news flew through the town , producing intense excitement . Bulletins were posted at the Tontine , and changed with every new report . Crowds soon gathered around Mr. Bayard 's house , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors were permitted to pass one by one through the room where Gen. Hamilton was lying . From the first , there was no hope of his recovery . This opinion of the most eminent surgeons in the city was concurred in by the surgeons of two French frigates in the harbor , who were consulted . Gen. Hamilton was a man of slight frame , and a disorder , from which he had recently suffered , prevented the usc of the ordinary remedies . He retained his composure to the last ; nor was his fortitude disturbed until his seven children approached his bedside . He gave them one look , and , closing his eyes , did not open them again while they remained in the room . He expired at two o'clock on the day after the duel . He was not the only victim . His oldest daughter , a girl of twenty , whose educa. tion he had carefully directed , and whose musical talents gave him great pleasure , never recovered from the shock of her father 's death . In her disordered fancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told her friends that she crossed the river and returned before morning . Her mind soon gave way entirely ; and only last spring death released her from a total , though gentle insanity of fifty years ' duration . The sudden and tragic death of Alexander Ilamilton produced a universal feeling of sympathy and sorrow . As the leader of the bar , the advocate of the Constitution , the statesman who had given the law to American commerce , the most accomplished soldier in the army , and connected with the still recent glo // ries of the Revolution ,  --  his name had become familiar to every ear , and was asso. ciated with every subject of popular interest . His career was , in all respects , an extraordinary one . lie came here a stranger , without fortune or powerful family connections . While yet a school-boy , he had borne a creditable part in the discussion of public affairs . At an age when the ambition of most young soldiers is satisfied , if ; by the performance of their ordinary duties as subalterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in a position of responsibility , and occupied with the most serious and complicated matters of war . He was one of the youngest and at the same time one of tbe most influential members of the Constitutional Convention . To this distinction in affairs and arms he added equal distinction at the bar . It will be difficult to find in our history , or in that of England , an instance of such eminence in three departments of action so distinct and dissimilar . Although it may be sai ( l of Hamilton , that he had not the intuitive perception , which Jefferson possessed , of the necessities imposed upon the country by its anomalous condition , yet , as a statesman under an established government , he was surpassed by no man of his generation . His talents were of the kind which most attracts the sympathies and impresses the understandings of others . He was a grave man , occupied with business affairs , but not unequal to occasions which required the display of taste and eloquence . His solid qualities of mind inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions which were not the subject of political dispute . There were many plain Republicans of that day who were firmly attached to the principles which Jefferson advocated , but who thought that Jefferson was a dreamer and an enthusiast , and that Hamilton was a far safer man in the ordinary affairs of government . The myief which the death of Hamilton caused in the nation reacted upon Burr ; and when the correspondence was published , a storm of condemnation burst upon him . Indictments were found against him in New York and New Jersey . In every pulpit , upon every platform , where the virtues and services of Hamilton were celebrated , the features of his malignant foe were displayed in dramatic contrast . He was compared to Richard IH. and Catiline , to Saul , and to the wretch who fired the temple of Diana . This feeling was not confined to orators and clergymen , nor to this country . It reached other communities , and was shared by men of the world like Talleyrand , and retired students like Jeremy Bentham . The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American gentleman , that Burr , on his arrival in Paris , in 1810 , sent to him and requested an interview . The French statesman could not well refuse to receive an American of such distinction , with whom he was personally acquainted , and by whom he had formerly been hospitably entertained , and told the gentleman who brought the message ,  --  " Say to Col. Burr , that I will receive him to-morrow ; but tell him also , that Gen. Hamilton 's likeness always haim , , s over my mantel . " Burr did not call upon him . Talleyrand directed that after his death the miniature should be sent to Hamilton 's descendants , with some newspaper scraps relating to him , which he had thrust into the lining . When Burr was in England , he became intimate with Bentham . The latter , in his " Memoirs and Correspondence , " makes a brief allusion to the acquaintance , in which the following passage occurs : " Burr gave me an account of his duel with Hamilton . He was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it little better than a murder . " Previously to his retirement from the Yice-Presidency , in March , 1805 , Burr had formed the design of seeking a home in the Southwest . Little more than a year before , Louisiana had been annexed , and then offered a wide field to an ambitious man . Encouraged by some a*-quaintances , he projected various political // Cal and financial speculations . In April , he repaired to Pittsburg , and started upon a journey down the Ohio and the Mississippi . On the way , curiosity led him to the house of Herman Blennerhassett , and he thus accidentally made the acquaintance of a man whose name has become historic by its association with his own . Blennerhassett was an Irishman by birth ; he had inherited a considerable fortune , and was a man of education . Beguiled by the belief that in the retirement of the American forests he would find the solitude most congenial to the pursuit of his favorite studies , he purchased an island in the Ohio River near the mouth of the Little Kanawha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and adorning his grounds . The house was a plain wooden structure and the shrubbery , in its best estate , could hardly have excited the envy of Shenstone . Men of strong character are not dependent upon certain conditions of climate and quiet for the ability to accomplish their purposes . But Blennerha.ssett was not a man of strong character ; neither was he an exception to this rule . He was , at the best , but an idle student ; and his zeal for science never carried him beyond a little desultory study of Astronomy and Botany and some absurd experiments in Chemistry . His figure was awkward , his manners were ungracious , and he was so nearsighted that he used to take a servant hunting with him , to show him the game . His credulity and want of worldly knowledge exposed him to the practices of the shrewd frontiers-men among whom he lived . He soon became involved in debt , and at the time of Burr 's visit his situation made him a ready volunteer , for any enterprise which promised to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was unfit for it , only made it more attractive to his imaginative and simple mind . The fancy of Wirt has thrown a deceptive romance around the career of Blennerhassett , yet there is enou0h of truth in the account of the misfortunes which Burr brought upon him and his amiable wife to justify the sympathy with which they have been regarded . Soon after his arrival at New Orleans Burr seems to have formed bolder designs . From this time we find in his correspondence , and that of his friends , vague hints of some great undertaking . This proved to be a project for an expedition against Mexico , and the establishment there of an Empire which was to include the States west of the Alleghanies subsidiary to this , and connected with it , was a plan for the colonization of a large tract of land upon the Washita . It is difficult to believe that a design so absurd can have been entertained by a man of common sense ; yet it is certain that it was seriously undertaken by Burr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his talents and a signal exhibition of his folly and his vices . His high standing , his reputation as a soldier , attracted the vulgar , and brought him into intercourse with the most intelligent people of the Territory . The fascination of his manners , and the skill in the arts of intrigue which long discipline had given him , enabled him to sustain the impression which the prestige of his name everywhere produced . The details of his political conduct could not have been accurately known in a region so remote . The affair with Hamilton had not injured his reputation in communities where such affairs were common and often applauded . The circumstances of the time , to his superficial glance , seemed to be encouraging . A large portion of the country bad lately passed under our flag ; - many of the inhabitants spoke a foreign language , and retained foreign customs and predilections ; - the American settlers were an adventurous race , and eager for an opportunity to indulge their martial spirit ; - Mexico was uneasy under the Spanish yoke ;  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spain held out a faint hope that the initiatory steps of his , enterprise might be taken with the connivance of the gov // 609 eminent . To recruit an army among the hardy citizens of Kentucky and Tennessee , to excite the jealousies of the French in Louisiana , to subdue feeble and demoralized Mexico , and create a new and stable empire , did not appear difficult to the sanguine imagination of a man who was without means or powerful friends , and who at no time had sufficient confidence in those with whom he was engage ( l to fully inform them of his plans . But he pursued his purposes with a tenacity which leaves no doubt of his sincerity , and an audacity and unscrupulousness seldom equalled . A few whom he . thought it safe to trust were admitted to his secrets . Upon those in whom he did not dare to confide he practised every species of deception . He told some , that his intentions were approved by the govemnment ,  --  others , that his expedition was a ainst Mexico only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He represented to the honest , that he had bought lands , and wished to form a colony and institute a new and better order of society the ignorant were deluded with a fanciful tale of Southern conquest , and a magnificent empire , of which he was to he king , and Theodosia queen after his death . So thoroughly was this deception carried out , that it is difficult to determine who were actually engaged with him . Without doubt , many acceded to his plans only because they did not knc w what his plans really were . He made rapid journeys from New Orleans to Natchez , Nashville , Lexington , Louisville , and St. Louis . In the winter of 1805 he returned to Washington , and in the following summer again went down the Ohio . Wherever he went , he threw out complaints against the government , - charged it with imbecility ,  --  boasted that with two hundred men he could drive the President and Congress into the Potomac ,  --  freely prophesied a dissolution of the Union , and published in the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separation of the Western from the Eastern States . Gen. Eaton had been denounced in Congress , and had a claim against the government Burr tempted him with an opportunity to redress his wrongs and satisfy his claim . Commodore Truxten had been struck from the Navy list ; he offered him a high command in the Mexican navy . He took every occasion to flatter the vanity of the people ; attended militia parades , and praised the troops for their discipline and martial bearing . Large donations of land were freely promised to recruits men were enlisted ; Blennerhassett 's Is ' - land was made the rendezvous ; and provisions were gathered there . At length his movements began to cause some anxiety to the public officers . The United States District Attorney attempted to indict him at Frankfort , Kentucky , but the grand-jury refused to find a bill . Henry Clay defended him in these proceedings , and in reference to his connectioa with the case , Mr. Parton makes a characteristic display of the spirit in which his book is written , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He quotes the following passage from Collins 's " Historical Sketches of Kentucky " : - " Before Mr. Clay took any active part as the counsel of Burr , he required of him an explicit disavowal , avowal , upon his honor , that he was engaged in no design contrary to the laws and peace of the country . This pledge was promptly given by Burr , in language the most broad , comprehensive , and particular . He had no design , he said , to intermeddle with or disturb the tranquillity of the United States , nor its territories , nor any part of them . He had neither issued nor signed nor promised a commission to any person for any purpose . He did not own a single musket , nor bayonet , nor any single article of military stores ,  --  nor did any , other person for him , by his authority or knowledge . His views had been explained to several distinguished members of the administration , were well understood and approved by the government . They were such as every man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this paragraph Mr. Parton makes the fol // lowing extraordinary comments : - " Mr. Clay , there is reason to believe , went to his grave in the belief that each of these assertions was an unmitigated falsehood , and the writer of the above adduces them merely as remarkable instances of cool , impudent lying . On the contrary , with one exception , all of Burr 's allegations were strictly true ; and even that one was true in a Biirrian sense . He did not own any arms or military stores : by the terms of his engagement with bis recruits , every man was to join him armed , just as every backwoodsman was armed whenever he went from home . He had not issued nor promised any commissions : the time had not come for that . Jefferson and his cabinet undoubtedly knew his views and intentions , up to the point where they ceased to be lawful . " To this miserable tissue of sophistry and misrepresentation the only reply we have to make is , that Burr 's statements were the unmitigated falsehoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very time stores were collected on Blennerhassett 's Island ; other persons were bringing arms for Burr 's service and with his knowledge ; the winter previous he had offered commissions to Eaton and Truxton ; and a month before this statement was made , his agent had arrived at Wilkinson 's camp with the direct proposition to that officer , that he should attack the Spaniards , hurry his country into a war , and enter upon a career of conquest which was to result in dismembering the Union . And yet Burr solemnly declared upon his honor that he was engaged in no design " contrary to the laws and peace of the country , " and that " his views were such as every man of honor and every good citizen must approve , "  --  and Parton says these averments ' were true . We have no wish to deal harshly with this writer ; but such an impudent defence of a palpable falsehood is a disgrace to American letters . Every well-informed person knows the miserable issue of this ill-contrived conspiracy . The only emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of it could ever have entered a sane mind . A wilder or more chimerical scheme never disturbed the dreams of a schoolboy ; yet no one has ever pressed a reasonable undertaking with more earnestness and confidence than Burr his visionary purpose . He exhibited , throughout , an infatuation and a degree of incompetency for great achievements , which would cover the enterprise with ridicule , were it not for the misfortunes which it brought upon himself and others . We do not desire to linger over the last period of Burr 's life . His deadliest foe could not have wished for him so terrible a punishment as that which afflicted his long and ignominious old age . In 1808 he went to Europe to obtain aid for his Mexican expedition . While in England , he made another display of his adroitness and boldness in falsehood . The English government became suspicious of him ; whereupon he had the hardihood to claim , that , although he had borne arms against Great Britain and had held office in an independent state , he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was an amusing instance of Burr 's lawyerlike audacity . " Less partial judges will probably find a harsher term to apply to it . After his return to this country Burr resumed his profession in New York , but never regained his former position at th' bar . The standard of legal acquirements was higher than it had been in his youth , and the obloquy which rested upon him excluded him from the respectable departments of practice . During all this time , by far the longest period of his professional life , he never displayed any signal ability . His society was shunncd ,  --  or sought only by a few personal admirers , or by the profligate and the curious . When seventy-eight years of age , he wheedled Madame Jumel , an eccentric and wealthy widow , into a marriage . On the bridal trip he obtained possession of some of her property , and squandered it in an idlo speculation . A continuance of such practices led to a // separation , and his wife afterwards made application for a divorce , upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been false , but which we have reason to believe was true , and which was so disgusting that we can not even hint at it . It is our duty to notice one chapter in this book , which , more than anything else it contains , has given it notoriety . We refer to its defence of ; or , to speak more mildly , its apology for , Burr 's libertinism . All the faults of the author which we have had occasion to notice , examples of which are scattered through the volume , are concentrated in these few pages , - his inconsistency , his inaccuracy , his disposition to draw inferences from facts which they directly contradict , and to rely on evidence which has nothing to do with the case in hand . He argues at great length upon the assumption , that Burr 's correspondence with women was unfit for publication , and then , . in contradiction to Burr 's own positive declaration , asserts that there were " no letters necessarily criminating ladies . " To prove this , he publishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Burr in his seventy-fourth year , for having addressed a young woman in an improper manner , and the other is a letter from a female , couche ( l in language much warmer than an innocent woman could use . Mr. Parton attacks Davis because that writer stated that Burr left his correspondence to be ( lispOse ( l of by him , and eulogizes his hero because he ordered that the letters should be burned . To establish this position , he quotes Burr 's will , which directed Davis " to destroy , or to deliver to all persons interested , such letters , as may , in his estimation , be calculated to affect injuriously the feelings of individuals against whom I have no complaint , " - thus giving Mr. Davis all the discretionary power with which he claims to have been invested , and making him the judge as to what letters should be destroyed . We have no more space to expose Mr. Parton 's blunders and sophistry . The evidence of Burr 's debauchery , of his heartless vanity , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst of men , does not rest upon the admissions of Davis alone . Those who are familiar with a scandalous book called the " Secret History of St. Domingo , " which consists of a series of letters addressed to Col. Burr by Madame D'Auvergne , will need no further illustration of his influence over women , nor of the character of those with whom he was most intimately associated . The night before his duel with Hamilton , he cominitted all the letters of his female correspondents to the care and perusal of Theodosia , saying that she would " find in them something to amuse , much to instruct , and more to forgive . " When in Europe , he kept a journal in which he recorded his various amorous adventures . This book , as published , is one which no gentleman would place in the hands of a lady , and the editor tells us that the most improper portions of the diary have been expurgated ; yet this journal was written , not to amuse a scandal-loving public , not for purposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can be said of a man who could expose the lascivious expressions of abandoned females and retail his own debaucheries to a gentle and innocent woman , and that woman his own daughter ? The mere statement beggars invective . It shows a mind so depraved as to be unconscious of its depravity. 7 The character of Burr is not difficult to analyze . His life was consistent , and at the beginning a wise man might have foretold the end . Our author complains that Burr 's reputation has suffered from the disposition to exaggerate his faults . This may be true ; but it is likewise true that he has been benefited by the same disposition to exarn*eration . A character is more dramatic which unites great talents with great vices , and therefore he has been represented both as a worse and a greater man than he really was . Burr can not be called great in any sense . His successes , such as they were , never appear to have been obtained by high // mental effort . He has left not a single measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important subjects that came before him , to which one can point as an exhibition of superior talents . A certain description of ability can not be denied to him . He did well whatever could he done by address , courage , and industry , joined to moderate talents . Ths chief power lay in the fascination of personal intercourse . His countenance was pleasing , and illuminated hy eyes of singular beauty and vivacity ; his bearing was lofty ; his self-possession could not be disturbed ; he had the tact of a woman , and an intellect which was active and equal to all ordinary occasions . But even in society his range was a narrow one , and he seems to have been successful mainly because he avoided positive effort . It is usual to speak of him as a remarkable conversationalist ; but if by that term we mean to describe a person who is distinguished for his eloquence , grace of expression , information , force and originality of thought , Burr was not a good converser . A distinguished gentleman , who , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what his personal attraction consisted , replied , " In his manner of listening to you . He seemed to give your thought so much value by the air with which he received it , and to find so much more meaning in your words than you had intended . No flattery was equal to it . " We think that this anecdote reveals the entire power of the man . He was strong through the weakness of others , rather than in his own strength . Therefore he was most attractive to young or inferior people . He was not on tcrms of intimacy with any leading man of his time , unless it was Jeremy Bentham , and the precise nature of their relations is not understood . The philosopher , who could not then boast many disciples , was favorably disposed toward Burr , because the latter had ordered a London bookseller to send him Bentham 's works as fast as they were published . Upon acquaintance , he must have been pleased with a gentleman with whom he could have had no cause for dispute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting forms of society and government , and whose adventurous and romantic career differed so widely from his own life of study and thought . Burr 's conduct in his various public situations affords a perfect measure of his abilities . As a soldier , he was brave , a good disciplinarian , watchful of details , and an excellent executive officer . At the head of a brigade he would have been useful ; but he did not possess the foresight , the breadth of mental vision , nor the magnetism of nature awakening the enthusiasm of armies , which are necessary to a great commander . He was an adroit lawyer , an adept in the fence of his profession , skilful to avail himself of the errors of an opponent , and to play upon the foibles of judge or jury ; but he had not the faculty for generalization and analysis , nor the nice discrimination in the application of general principles to particular instances , which must be combined in a great lawyer . He can not by any figure of speech be called a statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to discover and one of the most skilful in the use of those unworthy arts which have brought the pursuit of politics into disrepute ; but we doubt whether he could have succeeded upon the broader field of the present day . Perfectly competent to manage a single city , he would have failed in an attempt to govern , a party . His talents were well defined by Jefferson , who spoke of him as a great man in little things , and a small man in great things . One of the qualities most frequently attributed to Burr is fortitude ; upon this characteristic his biographer frequently dwells . And indeed , when one reads of the misfortunes which came upon him ,  --  the disappointments which he encountered ,  --  his poverty abroad ,  - -  his terrible afflictions , and dreary old age ,  --  and how gallantly he bore up under all ,  --  unblencbing , unmurmuring , struggling cheerfully and patiently to // 613 the end ,  --  one can not repress a feeling of admiration for the courage which endured so much misery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Such a feeling would be justified , if we could believe that fortitude was a positive trait in his character . That is to say , if he had been properly sensible of the odium which covered his name , and had really felt the sorrows which visited him , - if these things had moved him as they do others , and he had still gone on calmly and bravely to the end , hiding the wounds which tortured him , and giving no sign of pain ,  --  he would , indeed , have been worthy of admiration ; he would have been a hero . But we think it will appear , upon a closer examination , that his fortitude was a negative , not a positive quality ; it was insensibility , not courage . He did not suffer , because he did not feel . The emotional part of our nature he did not possess ; at least , it did not show itself in any of the forms which it usually takes ,  --  in love of country , or of kindred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects which occupied his thoughts . The first act of his manhood was to join in the resistance of his countrymen to foreign oppression . But it was no love of liberty that urged him to arms . He went to the camp at Cambridge from the mere love of adventure . The sacred spirit which gave nobility to so many ,  - -  which transformed mechanics , tradesmen , village lawyers , and plain countrygentlemen into statesmen , philosophers , diplomatists , and great captains ,  --  which united the children of many races into one nation , and roused a simple people to deeds of lofty heroism ,  --  awakened no enthusiasm in him . He was in the very flush of youth , yet to his most intimate friends be did not breathe a word of even moderate interest in the cause for which he had drawn his sword . His political life was passed during the first twenty years of our national existence , when men 's minds were exercised in the effort to adapt one government to the various and apparently conflicting interests of many communities widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these complicated and momentous subjects , so absorbing to all thoughtful men , never weighed upon his mind . He was in Europe when Napoleon was at the height of his power , when his armies swept from the Danube to the Guadalquivir ; but that strange story , which the giddiest school-girl can not read with divided attention , drew no remark from his lips . It is said that he was fond of his daughter ; - it was a fondness of the head , not of the heart . He admired her because she was beautiful and intelligent ; - had she been plain and dull , he would not have cared for her . He made no return for the affection , warm and generous , which her noble heart lavished upon him , liberal as the sunlight . Had that earnest love touched , for a single instant , a responsive chord in his heart , he could never have written those foul , foul words to make her blush at the record of her father 's shame . Nowhere does he express regret for the misfortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hamilton ,  --  the ruin of Blennerhassett ,  --  the victims of his passions and his ambition . He spoke freely , as if they were indifferent matters , of things which most men would have concea*led . He laughed at his trial , - alluded to Hamilton as " my friend Hamilton , whom I shot , "  --  and used to repeat some doggerel lines upon the duel , which he had seen in a strolling exhibition . It is said that he was courteous and amiable , and that he did many kind and generous acts . His courtesy and amiability did not restrain him from perfidy and debauchery ; neither did he ever do a kind act when an unkind one would have served his purposes better . As we have seen , Mr. Parton has described Aaron Burr as suited to many very incongruous conditions in life . If we were to select an epoch in history and a form of society for which he was best adapted , we should place him in France during the Regency and the reign of Louis XV . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and a well-turned leg did more for a man than the best mind in Europe , Burr would have risen to distinction . He might have shone in the literary circles at Sceaux , and in the petits soupers at the Palais Royal . Among the wits , the litte'rateurs , the fashionable men and women of the time , he would have found society congenial to his tastes , and sufficient employment for his talents . He would have exhibited in his own life and character their vices and their superficial virtues , their extravagance , libertinism , and impiety , their politeness , courage , and wit . He might have borne a distinguished part in the petty statesmanship , the intriguing diplomacy , and the wild speculations of that period . But here , among the stern rebels of the Revolution and the practical statesmen of the early Republic , this trickster and shallow politician , this visionary adventurer and boaster of ladies ' favors , was out of place . He has given to his country nothing except a pernicious example . The full light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated , shows likewise that his talents have surely been overestimated . The contrast which gave fascination to his career is destroyed ; and for a partial vindication of his character he will pay the penalty which he would most have dreaded , that of being forgotten .
