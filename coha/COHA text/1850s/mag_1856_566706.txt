txt ART . VI. - LIEBER ON CIVIL LIBERTY AND SELF-GOV ERNMENT . On Civil Liberty and Se*f-Covernment . By FRANCIS LIEBER . Philadelphia : Lippincott &amp; Co. 1853 . DR . LIEBER has attained to such eminence among our political writers , that nothing , which he is willing to give to the world , can fail to command the respect of the best class of readers . Educated in Germany under the first masters of historical politics , and bringing with him in advance to the country of his adoption , principles , which at the most could only be theories in his native land , he is as thorough an American in his way of thinking , as if he were to the manner born ; while he flavors our somewhat excessive fondness for political abstractions with a large and copious learning , which has explored the history of institutions thronghout all time . Perhaps in ability to draw lessons from the past , no American writer , whether statesman or publicist , equals Dr. iLieber : certain we are , that no English author in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieber 's political system may be characterized by its two poles , a thorough dislike and distrust of the French system , whether speculative or practical , and a hearty love of that , which , in England and the United States is considered to be liberty . He has had , however , too good a training in theoreti // cal politics to fall into the mistake , which Burke , with all his wisdom and almost prophetic discernment committed , the mistake of regarding politics as exclusively practical , as spending itself in endeavors to prop up the existing fabric of society , and to keep the cloud of revolution at a distance . Ife is at once conservative and inclined to bring institutions to the touchstone of justice , at once full of reliance upon a government of the people by itself and persuaded that no good government can exist without safeguards , by which the private citizen and the nilnority shall be secured in the possession of their rights , and the government be maintained in the due exercise of its authority . The faults of Dr. Lieber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious as his merits . He is diffuse and prolix to wearisomeness . His style is lumbering , and occasionally deformed with words or expressions , which seem to be translations of German thought , rather than vehicles for pellucid English thinking . His method is not that of a logical mind , but rather that of a sound thinker who is embarrassed and almost overcome by his subject . In the present work the faults of style are more decided than in some others , whether because it was delivered in the shape of lectures , where great copiousness is pardonable , or was somewhat hastily written . This haste in writing must have been the cause of several mistakes in matters of fact , which we should not have expected in the works of so truly learned a man as Dr. Lieber . One or two of these errors from haste , it may not be inexpedient briefly to point out . In Vol . I , page 1146 , our author , speaking of the right of association , says that " the more despotic a government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iRoman emperors did not even suffer the associations of handicrafts . " The passages on which Dr. Lieber would probably rely will not bear him out . The distinguished German jurist , Dirksen , has corrected the old error of former writers whom our author follows . The emperors were wary in allowing new guilds for fear of political unions ; but the old existed and even neW ones sprung into being . And these corporations to which the IRoman law expressly alludes , existed through all the important provincial towns of the Empire , as inscriptions make evident . On page 1Th we read that " a long time elapsed before this principle , that the command of the sovereign can not screen a minister or subordinate from punishment , came clearly to be established in England . Charles the First reproved the Commons for proffering their royalty to his own person , while they // opposed his ministers and measures which he had personally ordered . " As the principle of the English Constitution here spoken of is one of vital importance , it would have been well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the earl of Danby was impeached in 1678 , when his plea that he obeyed the king 's orders was not admitted , and the king both allowed him in expectation of an adverse sentence to carry a pardon in his pocket and dissolved the house of commons which had voted the impeachment . The responsibility of ministers now began to be the theory of the political system : to prevent it from becorning a dead principle it was ordained in 1701 , by the act of settlement , that no pardon under the great seal is pleadable to an impeachment by the commons in parliament . On page 194 our author says that it was enacted under Charles the Second , that new parliaments should be held at least once in three years , and the commons be elected for that time . Any reader of Mr. ilallam will perceive that Dr. Lieber has strangely mingled up here the Triennial act of 1641 , and the repeal of that act in 1664 . The former act both limited the time during which a parliament could sit , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter act repealed the provision relating to the duration of parliament , but left in force the last mentioned limitation . In matter of fact the long or pension parliament of Charles the Second sat more than seventeen years . Our author seems to find the origin of triennial parliaments in this bill , but there was no law to this effect until 1694 , when , despite the opposition of William , who had vetoed a similar bill in 1692 , it was carried that the existing parliament should sit until 1696 , and every subsequent one should not last longer than three years . He then goes on to say that in 1716 Sir IRobert Walpole , the whig premier , carried the septennial bill , forced to do it by the intrigues of the Tories , who were for bringing back the Stuarts . But Walpole , then not Sir Robert but a plain unlettered gentleman , was not premier , nor did he carry the bill , although he would no doubt have contributed his powerful support to it , if he had not lain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 217 our author speaks of the veto power as follows : " A great deal of confusion in treating this whole subject has arisen from the ill-chosen word veto , after the term used by the Roman tribune . The veto of the Roman tribune and the so-called modern veto have nothing in common . The tribune could veto indeed . When a law was passed he could wholly or partially stop its operation . The dispensatory power claimed by the Stuarts would have been a real veto . // The chief of the state in the United States or England , however , has no such power . " Our author must surely have forgotten his Roman antiquities , when he wrote this , which is inaccurate as saying too little and too much . The tribunitial power , so far as it was auxiliwn , consisted in personal prevention of the action of magistrates , in particular cases where plebeians were concerned . It might thus be compared with that undefined branch of the sovereign prerogative in England called the dispensing power , although James the Second stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their general application . But this auxilium , in which the efficacy of the tribunitial power originally consisted , was by and by quite thrown into the shade by the power of interce88io , or the veto proper , by which the tribune could prevent a decree of the senate from acquiring validity or a rogation before the comitia from becoming a law . This power , it is evident , has a great deal in common with our presidential Veto . The tribune , who sat in the senate , first without membership and in the seventh century of Rome as a member , could stop the passage of bills there , and as a kind of president of the people could stop the passage of laws in the assemblies . His concurrence was thus as neccssary in legislation as that of our president . Passing now from these occasional evidences of haste , let us look at the author 's plan in the development of his work . He begins with presenting to the reader definitions of liberty , some ten or twelve in number , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " liberty applied to political man , practically means protection or checks against undue interference , whether this be from individuals , from masses , or from government . " And advancing a step farther he finds that it consists in guarantees ( and corresponding checks ) of those rights which experience has proved to be most exposed to interference . pp. 53 , 54 . The words undue interference , of course , refer to a standard of justice , to a doctrine of rights-of which , however , nothing is professedly said in this work . Probably the author would refer us to his " Political Ethics " for his exposition of natural or personal rights , where the subject is treated at large . But as the guarantees and checks are of no value in themselves , aside from the liberties which they secure , it might have been well to enumerate the rights which pertain tothe individual , according to a correct view of our nature and destiny as creatures of God . Liberty is the possession of these rights . Slavery the deprivation of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , therefore , may be best known from an enumeration . It is obvious from the citations we have made that a part of our author 's task ,  --  that part which treats of civil liberty-must be mainly a description of the guarantees and checks which have arisen in the course of time within our English race , and chiefly from the experience or apprehension of tyranny on the part of the government . What then is the idea of guarantees and checks ? Can they be classified ? Are they merely the creations of experience ? Guarantees may be defined to be provisions by law or constitution for the secure enjoyment of personal and political rights . But whatever secures such rights must act as a check upon all who meditate or attempt an invasion of them . It is no guarantee against the arbitrary or excessive power of arrest to insert in the law that a person must not be arbitrarily or without cause arrested , nor indeed would a provision against general warrants nor against breaking open a house except for felony be much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be screened from its consequences by pleading that he obeyed his superior . The security to the individual arises from the officers not venturing to do such a thing through fear of its consequences , as well as from a belief that it is illegal and invalid . Here , then , we find that there would be no valuable guarantee without a check on all who may dare to violate a given right . The word check has a curious history : originally the same with chess , and so of eastern origin , it was the term used when the principal piece in the game of chess was impeded in its action , arid unable to remain in a particular spot . Applied to denote the board as well as the ganie , it gave rise to words expressive of alternate squares of different colors : hence checker and the court of ex-checquer , originally named after the flooring or pavement of the chamber where that court was convened . In the former sense , it denotes in general , any operation by which a control is exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is any thing which prevents the government , or a department of government , from going out of its sphere , or which prevents hasty or irregular action within its sphere . Thus the division of the government into three departments , so far as it prevents the accumulation of power in the hands of the executive , is as truly a check and an impediment , as the exercise of the veto is a check on the hasty or unconstitutional action of the legislature . And thus , also , the provision that a person shall not be tried twice for the same crime , or shall be allowed counsel , or may examine witnesses in open court , may be said // to be a check on the power of government minions , who of old could freely wreak their vengeance on persons politically obnoxious . Checks , if we are not deceived , are names applied to provisions of the political system , which , although they may be only negative and preventive , may be more efficient and of wider reach than guarantees . Thus a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two legislative branches , although it spends its force on the action of the legislature , is indirectly of vast importance in its relation to private rights and welfare ; while no guarantee can be of practical value , unless its existence or the fear of its exercise , renders dangerous the violation of the guaranteed right . But can guarantees and checks be classified ? We are unable to discover any principle of classification . They will be found to be of most various kinds , and often a provision not originally intended for such a purpose , may be one of the highest safeguards . Thus the representative system , which grew up without a distinct appreciation of its advantages , is one of the greatest safeguards of liberty , and a most important check upon its irregular action . The judge is a check on the jury , and the jury on the judge , without perhaps any such intention at the outset . And thus in city governments , like that of Athens , fhe council or senate , and the assembly acted as reciprocal checks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two diP ferent classes of the population . If there be , indeed , no logical classification of guarantees and checks , it would seem that they can only be mentioned in connexion with the rights which they secure . This is done substantially by the author , although we are of opinion , that a consideration of the various rights intended to be secured , might lead to some kind of system . It would seem , even from this inability to classify checks and guarantees , that they are , as they exist in our form of liberty , creations of experience . Such is eminently the case ; and when we say that our freedom has grown up as the offspring of bard struggles ; that , having found oppression strong in one place or another , it built its wall , by night or day , stronger and higher for that reason ; that it has been advancing with the progress of intelligence and general improvement ; when we say , in short , that it is the fruit of experience , we give the beet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say that our race has been or ages working out in its history the problem of . free-government , we say that such an accumulation of experience must bring political wisdom along with it ; and we say , also , that in such political training is contained the guarantee , that every // abuse , however inveterate , every obsolete or antiquated institution , must be overthrown at length , in a peaceable way , by the practical sense of an intelligent liberty-loving people . Such a people , while satisfied in the main with the constitution of its government , will not conceive of it , as not to be improved , as having reached absolute perfection ; nor suppose that the same political forms , any more than the same laws , will suit all time ; nor close the eye to defects , which , in the progress of years , the working of a system discloses . They are therefore , more likely to retain what is permanently valuable in institutions , to change by degrees , to anticipate and prevent revolutionary teinpests , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , very great use for a nation like ours in the historical elucidation of constitutional principles and safeguards . Take , for instance , the principle that judges shall hold their office during good behavior , which is still happily the prevailing principle both here and in England , although not likely long to resist the tendency to short terms of office . When we know how the judges of the Stuart kings were made tools of by the court , how ship-money and the dispensing power could never have been forced on England but by their lie*p and under color of law , the reasons for the change in the tenure of this . office made soon after the revolution of 1688 , appear in a stronger light than all the theory in the world could throw upon them . So also if we go back in the history of English government to the infancy of a house of conimons , and to the first rights which that body exercised , those of giving its consent to the imposition of taxes on the people and of presenting petitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially of the first , the attempts to violate it , the dependance upon parliament into which it brought the king , and the consequent legislation in favor of liberty ; we shall learn to prize it far higher than if we met it only in the pages of a written constitution . There have been a multitude of safeguards secured for freedom , there has been a clearer insight *n*o the nature of freedom itself ; all this was transplanted to our country , and found here a congenial soil . We find principles in our constitutions , and comment on them ; and we do well . But we can never give them their due value until they are historically associated in our minds with the struggles and the blood by which they became ours . The practical nature of our political guarantees and checks is forcibly shown in two cases where we are without them . By an addition to the Constitution of the United States , no law can abridge the freedom of speech or of the press , but epistol // ary correspondence is passed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France and in Austria the police had reduced to a system . the practice of opening and resealing letters , and thus had the threads of family as well as state secrets in their hands . Why does no safeguard against this abuse appear in the Constitution ? Was it because we copied from English precedents ? But we , by no means , followed blindly in the old path of our ancestors . It was because a post-office system was of little value at the time of the formation of our government , and because the new method of police government , then spreading on the continent of Europe , had never been thought of as a possibility . Another illustration is to be found in the fact , that the publicity of proceedings in courts and in congress is secured by no constitutional provision . Congress might , to-morrow , exclude every spectator and every reporter from its halls ; nay , it might close the doors of court-houses to every one who feels a sympathy for fugitive slaves . Why now is there no guarantee , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when our Const*tntion was framed , the press had not become that representative of public interests which it is now ; and because no one thought of questioning the not very important right of listening to the deliberations of the legislature . If now there should be any sign of an attempt to restrict these rights , the time would have come to define and protect them . And so , again , our legislatures have vast powers given to them , in the authority to lay taxes , of discrimination and selection , so as to oppress and throw the whole burden of supporting government on one class or interest . If the time should arrive when there was a manifest intention to carry out a system of partial legislation , here , too , limits would be fixed , beyond which legislative tyranny could not pass . Dr. Lieber 's first volume is chiefly employed in enumerating and describing those points of practical freedom , in which the United States and England agree . The tendency of such a method , which brings before us continually the great fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally the same , can only be good , as opposing that spirit of vulgar demagogues which continually decries England . There are those who hate England because she spins cotton cheap , and others who hate her , because she has abolished slavery in her West India islands , or because they have sprung of Irish ancestry , or because such abuse will please the Irish , or because they have been offended by the manner of their reception in England . There are others still , who , with more justice , dislike // the strong but diminishing element of aristocracy in her constitution , or the impulse to rail at our manners and measures , into which her press periodically falls . Ko w the tendency of this prejudice is bad every way . It separates two nations who are nearer together in principle than either is to any other , and whose joint influence is needed for the regeneration of mankind - for the coming of the kingdom of God . It obstructs the power with which our thinking and legislation act upon hers to purify and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most tyrannical and the least improved states of Christendom , - states which would rejoice in any injury sustained by our political machine . It tends even to obscure our notions of liberty , to make the form of it appear to us more valuable than its substauce ,  --  that in which we agree with England less prized than that in which we differ from her . iDr . Lieber 's book runs quite counter to such a tendency , and can not fail to have an excellent influence on those who study it . In the 22d chapter of his work , our author gives the specific character of American liberty . The differences between that and the English are chiefly these : " Republican federalism , strict separation of the state from the church , greater equality and acknowledgment of abstract rights in the citizen , and a more popular or democratic cast of the whole polity . " IJnder the head of greater equality he has the following remarks : " But here it must be observed that , however unqualifiedly the principle of political equality is adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it stops short with the race . Property is not allowed to establish any difference , color is . Socially the colored man is denied equality in all states , and politically he is so , in those states in which the free colored man is denied the right of voting , and where slavery exists . I believe I may state as a fact that the staunchest abolitionist , who insists upon immediate manumission of all slaves , does not likewise insist upon an immediate admission of all the manumitted population to a perfect political equality . In this however I may be mistaken . " - YoL 1 , p 281 . This is the only passage where the blight and blot of slavery is noticed . It is well as far as it goes , and probably the author in his chair in the College of South Corolina could say no more . But a sketch of American liberty to be complete on ght to say that while foreigners are admitted to the right of su rage after a very short residence and even without being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black race has never commanded the sympathies of the democracy and the popular leaders in any degree ; that attempts to open the polls to them have been put down by the people , and attempts to emancipate them have been rejected by the people ; that , in short , the broadest theories of natural rights and a determination // to defend slavery at any hazard flourish together ; *nd that thus American liberty is involved in an inconsistency which must either destroy that liberty itself , or must be destroyed by it . If the principle is to be forced upon us that the rights of the masters of slaves must be recognized anywhere within the limits of the Confederation , under the jurisdiction of the General Government and under that of the separate states , then American liberty will scarcely be worth having. * Under the head of a more popular or democratic cast of the whole polity , our author mentions the following points wherein we differ from England ; voting by ballot , the record of ayes and nays in our legislatures , that the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood nor ex post facto laws are allowed , that foreigners are freely invested with our franchises , that the number of states is not fixed , that we have written constitutions and that by such constitutions the powers of the legislatures are restricted . To these might be added , greater frequeney of elections , a larger control of the people in municipal affairs , a weaker police , greater freedom of entrance into callings and professions , as well as other particulars . Some of the marks of a more popular cast of our liberty here enumerated may be regarded just as well in the light of restrictions on democratic absolutism . It is plain , if our system were otherwise the same , and the president had the power to dissolve congress after one session or iu the middle of a session , that his power as the chief of a party would be considerably increased . It is plain also , that if no fundamental law limited the functions of legislatures , they too would become exponents of democratic or party tyranny . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve a parliament , unless by appealing to the people he hopes to secure a new one more favorable to his views . Now as lie is in * This was written several months ago . Since that time the black principles and designs of the slave power have come out before the light of day more than ever before . It has appeared that this monster in our system of government will eat up , if it can , every right , however sacred , that comes into conflict with it . Free speech , even free thought , free . movement , the rights of property , the ri* hts of person , it invades by force of arms with the countenance of the General Government ; and while we write , the cries of many homeless and plundered freemen " are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sahaoth . " In the midst of the crusade against freedom even our harmless author has not been quite unscathed . For words written a quarter of a century ago , he has been brought to the bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns , and has made some kind of submission . There is no statute of limitations for offenses committed by free thought , there is no place of repentance except one becomes a slave himself . We hope Prof. Lieber will have a chance to speak out his convidi6ns and experiences of slavery in a more congenial part of his adopted country . // a great measure removed from the strife of party , as he is not identified like our president with any current principles or want of principles , it is apparent that this power does not diminish popular control . The presidential veto as now exercised , is very far from being a characteristic of a popular cast of government . Intended originally to check hasty or unconstitutional lawmaking , it has become the function of a party-chief ; by which he carries out the measures to which he is pledged against the mgjority in congress , or even against that in the nation . It is true that the vetoes of our most popular chief magistrates have represented the will of a majority in the nation against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , equally true , that they have created these majorities . The necessity of party coherence , the willingness of subordinate politicians to give up their principles for those of a man personally popular and confided in , will account for such remarkable changes in the tone of party , as that which we saw after President Jackson removed the deposits from the United States Bank . Probably no influence over public opinion of the English sovereign for the last century and a half can be compared to this . In the next chapters our author sets forth more clearly what Anglican liberty is , by contrasting it with that of the French . It is one of the wonders of history that two nations , whose destinies for a while were so intermingled , which had the same social elements , the same feudal system , should have diverged from a common standing place to such widely opposite institutions . What the cause or causes of this divergence have been , we can not stay to enquire ; we only express our opinion that it is idle to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the good in England to an Anglo-Saxon source . It may be shown , on the contrary , we think , that the Norman Conquest was a blessing in its consequences . As to the contrast itself of the two nations , in a political point of view , we see it running through the systems ; on the French side a strong desire of equality ,  --  which can exist in an absolute despotism , where all distinctions are leveled , except that of the subject and the ruler  --  and on the English a desire for political justice , for the protection of individual rights against the government and the majority ; itere no safeguards against absolutism , so that the government , whether of one man , or of the majority , becomes a despotism ; there limitation cemented by the earnest struggles and the blood of centuries ; here unity carried out with logical rigor , swallowing all power in a central power , stretching the arm of the police everywhere , repressing almost all municipal // freedom , admitting of but one legislative chamber ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , two houses controlling one another ; here , in short , a despotism under whatever form , and there freedom even under forms opposed to it in theory . What great reason we have to bless God for our English ancestry , and above all for that Puritan movement which gave birth to one nation , and regenerated another ! But how , our author next enquires , is the state of a free , selfgoverning people to be secured and perpetuated ? Not by decreeing that liberty shall exist , not by education only , but by a system of institutions . Despotism can exist without institutions , but has no self-preserving power ; its vast mass crumbles together under the first blows of a conquering battle-axe . But freedom can neither begin nor continue its existence without institutions ; while with them it can resist foes that seem irresistible , and revive into fresh life after being trampled down . What now is an institution in the political sense ? To say that it is something instituted , something which the spirit of freedom has founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national mind with all that is valuable in its political condition , is too narrow . institutions are not only set up , but also grow ; arise of themselves , as something which the soil and the heavens have fostered without the counsel of man . The English language , our author observes , has but one term for these two sorts of institutions , which he calls crescive and enacted . " The former are not ill-defined or loosely distinguished from one another on that account ; they may be as individualized as a shady tree in a forest ; and enacted or contrived institutions are not confined and narrow on that account . They may be as extensive in action as an Atlantic steam-ship . The speakership is a well defined crescive institution ; the suprem* court of the United States is a vast enacted institution . " Those institutions which grow up , may in time receive a formal sanction , and thus acquire a positive character . In general they must , in the order of time , precede the others , and a na-* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its institutions of freedom for itself , without historical precedent , or free instincts , or training for systematic freedom . Some writers have confined the term institutions to those which have grown lip of themselves . Thus Dr. Arnold applies it to such customs , regulations and the like " as do not owe their existence to any express law or laws , but having originated in various ways , at a period of remote antiquity , are already parts of the national system , at the very beginning of our historical view of it , and are recognized by all actual laws , as being themselves a kind of primary condition , on // which all recorded legislation proceeds . " " I would confine , , * adds he , " the term laws to the enactments of a known legislative power , at a certain known period . " Dr. Lieber justly objects to this distinction , and to so restricted a use of the word institution , for why should inability to trace the origin of a political provision , which must have had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in short , be a ground for distinguishing between political contrivances , which otherwise have precisely the same character . Institutions may *i , row up within the period of historical tradition , or may have been positively devised before that period . Dr. Arnold , too , gives them all a character of generality , when he conceives of them as a primary condition on which all legislation proceeds , , as a sort of ground-law for the state . But local usages of limited application may also come down from remote times . Probably Dr. Arnold himself would not refuse to the tribunitial office at iRome , the name of an institution , although it arose after the beginning of Roman history , and was a provision not for a general but for a particular purpose . One characteristic of an institution , according to Dr. Lieber , is that it contains within itself an organism , by which it acts and continues . If we understand him , we can not entirely accept his view . Juries are without question , an institution ; but how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are indeed sanctioned by the law , although of older origin than most parts of it ; but if the law denied them its protection they would perish . So also the division of states into tribes is found running through all ancient forms of government . It is an institution both in Dr. Arnold 's sense and in truth , but possesses no self-perpetuating pov* er , has no strength whatever , except that derived from being germane to the national mind , and from the veneration with which it is regarded . We may define the institutions of a state , whether they are positive creations *r the growths of time beyond the reach of tradition , to be provisions which express or secure the national conception of a state and of public justice ; which derive their force not from a private individual will , but from the universal sentiment ; which have perpetuity because national character has perpetuity . They are the means adopted by a nation , in its peculiar circumstances , for securing the ends implied in its existence , or the modifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its conditition suggests . They may be that which safeguards are intended to secure , or the safeguards // themselves . They may be local , like town governments , or special , like juries ; may affect the for*m of the state , like written or unwritten constitutions , or its nature , like the presence or absence of orders of society . They are fixed , as expressing fixed conceptions concerning the state , and as being products of the national mind . They are thus those parts of the political system , which bind generations together and appeal to national feeling . Of course , when in the interest of freedom , they are bulwarks against arbitrary will , hated by tyrants and by tyrrannical theorists . But institutions may be bad , may tend to perpetuate bad government by their own vital force , and by the national recollections which may cluster around them . And yet a country despotically governed , but possessed of institutions , is in a far more hopeful condition than a country under like control without them . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man may collapse at his death ; but so long as there is nothing except insurrection through which the reforming power can act , so long as the better impulses of society leave no point of support in and extant usage or part of the national system , so long there is danger that reform will be but a tempest , will destroy without creating a new organism , and will leave the field open tbr another despotism after the same type with the last . Institutions may serve a temporary purpose and then disapper , or may be as permanent as the life of a nation itself . Instances of temporary institutions may be found in Greek history , where in the heroic times kings , nobles , and people were the elements of society , while the first or the first and the second of the three disappeared from many states in their later history . The same is true of cur race . There is no doubt that the En*4ish nobles played a very important part in securing the rights of persons , and in checking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became colonists on another continent , both king and nobles were eliminated , and that of necessity , out of the political framework . Nations differ greatly in their organizing or institutioncreating character . The Slavonic nations , the Turks and Mongolians , as Dr. Lieber observes , are quite destitute of this national power , while the Greeks , but especially the IRomans in ancient times , and in modern the English and our own nation , have been signally gifted with it . The IRomans retained it only so long as they retained a republic government . As soon as the empire became established , it destroyed or enervated institutions in every muncipal town , made many of the old // 343 organic powers of the constitution mere hollow forms , and put a net work of dependent civil officers and an army in the place of the discordant but vigorous magistrates and assemblies of the commonwealth . Even the glory of the empire , its system of laws , drew its life from the republic ; while the taint of despotism in the laws , which has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the empire . And so it will be found that every nation , where the spirit of centralization has crept in , has become less capable of originating or sustaining institutions . Local institutions , and the faculty of self-government go together . Without the townshipsystem , public liberty could not have grown up in this country , nor the people have received a sufficient training to understand or to maintain their liberties ; on the other hand , let all local powers be swallowed up in a central board for municipal government , and it would be as if all the schools were abolished , and a board of professors convened at Washington to dole out knowledge to the country . Or let a nation deliver itself from a despotical yoke , and adopt a form of seemingly free government , with the principle of centralization contained in it , there will be every danger that here absolutism will be kept out of the political system but a short time ; for on the one hand the government must have tremendous strength to reach everywhere and do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to train up the people for self-government , to produce a free , all-pervading public sentiment , or to encourage action in unions and associations . After considering the advantages of " institutional self- government , " Dr. Lieber passes on to consider its dangers and incon veniences . One of these is that a due proportion may not be observed between the general and the local institutions . If for any reason the local power is so strong as to paralyze the general administration , there will be danger of a centralizing reaction , or of easy conquest by a foreign foe . And if such a nation lengthen out its existence , it will be unable to act vigorously , either in its internal or external relations , unless the nation as such has a self-governing power , as well as its districts or parts ; even the parts themselves may prove unable to preserve their institutions . National and local self-government protect each other . Institutions again may impede the progress of a nation when they become effete , but are clung to as memorials of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . They have lost all their power , but not their venerableness ; they are even turned into instruments of despotism ; still the nation hugs the semblance because it was once a reality . // We must omit to notice our author 's chapters on the insecurity of governments , however free , which have no institutions , on imperatorial sovereignty , on centralization , and the influence of capital cities . These are followed in an appendix by important papers on elections , on the abuse of the pardoning power , and on subjects connected with the inquisitorial trial and the law of evidonce . Then succeed some of the principal ground laws of English and American liberty , as the Magna Charta , the Petition of Rights , the Habeas Corpus Act , the Bill of Rights , our Declaration of Independence , the articles of the old Confederation , and the present Constitution of the United States . Some of the more important French Constitutions bring up the rear , as the Charta of Louis XVIII , the Constitution of 1848 , the present Constitution proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same year , on petitions to change the republic into an empire , with the Senate 's decree to the same effect , and finally the letter of the Minister of the Interior to the departmental prefects , instructing them how to control elections for the legislative body . These documents appearing by the side of the Great Charter , still in force after more than 600 years , not only show that France is an infant of yesterday in its political life , but show also the vast contrast which exists between the political instincts and skill of the English and the French races .
