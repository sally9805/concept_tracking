" from Bury me in the morning ( 1855 ) Bury me in the morning , mother ; Oh ! let me have the light Of one bright day on my grave , mother , Ere you leave me alone with night : Alone in the night of the grave , mother , ' T is a thought of terrible fear !  --  And you will be here alone , mother , And stars will be shining here . So bury me in the morn , mother , And let me have the light Of one bright day on my grave , mother , Ere I am alone with night . You tell of the Saviour 's love , mother  --  I feel it in my heart ; But , oh ! from this beautiful world , mother , ' T is hard for the young to part !  --  For ever to part , when here , mother , The soul is fain to stay , For the grave is deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then bury me in the morn , mother , And let me have the light Of one bright day on my grave , mother , Ere I am alone with night . Never unclasp my hand , mother , Till it fall away from thine  --  Let me hold the pledge of thy love , mother , Till I feel the love divine ; The love divine  --  oh ! look , mother , Above , its beams I see ; And there an angel 's face , mother , Is smiling down on me ! So bury me in the morn , mother , When sunbeams flood the sky  --  For Death is the gate of Life , mother , And leads to light on high .
