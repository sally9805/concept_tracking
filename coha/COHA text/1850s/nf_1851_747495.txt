txt The art of drawing furnishes an example which can not be found in any other profession . There is no amusement more deHghtful , no accompHshment more useful , no art more elegant , or no profession more advantageous , than the practice of the Fine Arts . Drawing brings neither regret , anxiety or fatigue of body , however much followed . Almost every other pursuit leaves a weariness when closely applied to ; and to none does there belong that pleasing and enervating effect which is to be found in the practice of the heaven-born art of drawing . This art can be practised in the sick chamber without disturbing the inmate ; it can be practised in the drawing room , whilst others may be reading or studying without interfering with them in the least ; and independent of all this , it is one of the cheapest of the many amusements which abound . If we consider drawing in the light of an acquirement , where shall we find one more elegant or more useful ? It is by a knowledge of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery intelligible ; it is also by this art that the traveller is enabled to render the ac- /z/ count of his wanderings of ten-fold value , by the representation of the various objects which may be interesting ; whilst the slighest sketch will often bring to mind the recollection of circumstances , which have escaped the memory in the lapse of years , and render back each long-forgotten image more vividly , than the best and completest journal . The object of this work is to put persons in a way , by a knowledge of the theory of effect , to make their drawing correct and striking .

The rules are here laid down in so simple and efficient a manner , that if those persons who have been taught to draw , without learning the theory of effect or contrast , will take the trouble of studying them , they will find their powders of composition , or , as it is generally termed " drawing out of their own heads , " greatly increased . Without understanding these rules , a man , however well he may draw , can never be called an artist . Rembrandt , by his consummate knowledge of effect , gave that magic representation of light and shade , that raised him to the highest rank in his profession , which , with his deficient skill as a draughtsman , he could never hope to obtain . /z/ The generally received meaning of the word EFFECT is , that scientific arrangement of form , of light and shade , and of colour , by which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature more striking , attractive and beautiful , than he , who equally clever in the mere imitation of objects , is at the same time totally ignorant of the principles of effect ; for the student must not suppose , that a perfect representation of an object in nature is sufficient . No , he must also learn to know whether that object be in a good state of light and shade , colour , &c.,; before he makes a drawing of it ; and should he never be able to see it in that state , he must supply the deficiency from his own imagination , according to those rules which every artist of merit possesses , it might be said intuitively , as there are many who , at the same time that they are capable of producing a very good effect , are also unnble to say by what rules it is produced . /z/ Effect consists in the proper admixture and skillful union of the two opposite qualities of which it is composed , and which are called Contrast and Harmony ; should either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect will be bad ; for should contrast predominate too powerfully , it will be disturbed , scattered , crude and want repose ; and should too much harmony prevail in the picture , the effect will be tame , spiritless , monotonous and poor . By Contrast is meant opposition or difference of either form , light and shade , or colour ; as for example , in regard to form : a round object forms a contrast to a square object , because the one is different or in opposition to the other , inasmuch as the shape and form of each object are in no way the same . By the same rule , light is the contrast of shade , and red of green , &c.,; as will be shown hereafter . By Harmony is meant the unity , agreement or sameness , of either form , light or shade , or colour ; thus a picture in which a sameness or similarity of shapes and lines , of light or of shade , and of color prevail , the whole will possess a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be out of harmony when the contrasts are too powerful and not properly subdued ; it is sometimes , though very rarely , applied to those pictures /z/ wherein the sentiments do not tend towards the same end . In studying effect , the student must consider every object in nature under the three principal heads , of form , light and shade , and colour , as these constitute all the qualities of objects which can be represented by a drawing . /z/ Whatever form is different to another is a contrast to it . Forms are made by lines , and by light and shade . A horizontal line is contrasted most strongly by a perpendicular line . A line is contrasted by any other line which is not parallel to it , and which , if continued , would intersect it ; thus in Fig. 1. , the line A B is a contrast to C D , because if continued to E , it would intersect the line C D. Fig. 1 . /z/ A straight line is intersected by any irregular or crooked line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , the straight line of the bridge is contrasted by the /z/ irregular line of the mountains , as well as by the curved lines of the arches . Fig. 2. =z=ss : A straight line is also contrasted by an angle , as in Fig. 3 , where the pyramids form a contrast to the straightness of the horizontal line . Fig. 3 . A curved line is contrasted either by a straight line , or a curved line placed in an opposite direction , as in Fig. 4 ; the dome of the building is contrasted both by its straight sides and the line of the clouds , which curve in a different direction . /z/ THE TIIEORi OF EFFECT . Fig. 4 . A serpentine line is best contrasted by any straight line , as in Fig. 5 ; the line of houses forms an opposition to the windings of the river . Fig. .5 . A heavy form is contrasted by a light one , as the heavy form of the post in Fig. 6 is contrasted by the lightness of the weeds which grow near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as water , ice , clear sky , &c.,; rrxiy be contrasted by the opposition of any rough , massive form . Thus in Fig. 6 , the smoothness of the water is contrasted with the rough irregular form of the lumps of stone introduced into the foreground . Forms which are square and hard are best contrasted by those which are soft and round ; as the square tower in Fig. 8 is relieved by the soft rolling clouds which it stands against . Fig. 8. /z/ The ragged forms of rocky mountains may also be contrasted by the softness of large rolling clouds as in Fig. 5 . Large objects are contrasted by smaller objects , as in Fig. 9 ; the larse tree is rendered more conspicuous by the introduction of the smaller ones placed near it , and whose lightness of form gives value and weight . Fig. 9 . Long objects may be contrasted by short ones , as in Fig. 5 , the long line of buildings is opposed by the clumps of trees which come against it , whilst the straight line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irregular line of the mountain behind . /z/ A very low horizontal line increases the height of any upright object , as in Fig. 10 , where the figure is rendered of a most gigantic size , by representing the horizontal line not nnuch higher than the ankle . Fig. 10. /z/ Light and shade , or chiaro-scuro , may be divided into light , which springs immediately from the object which gives the light , as the sun , moon , candle , &c.; reflected light , which is first received on one object , and then thrown back on to another ; shade , which is caused by the part of the object which is in shade being in such a situation that it can not receive the light ; and shadow , which is the absence of light ( on a part which ought otherwise to receive the light ) by the intervention of an opaque object , as in Fig. 6 , where a shadow is thrown on a part of the ground which would be in /z/ light like the rest , were it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from reaching that part of the ground , and thus causes that absence of light which constitutes shadow . Shadows always fall in a direction from the object which gives light , as the sun , moon , &c.; Reflected light is always thrown in a different direction to the real light , and for that reason almost always falls on the shade side of objects , by which they are rendered lighter than their shadows , as in Fig. 6 , where the post is lighter than the shadow cast by it . It is for this reason that the bottom of the shade sides of objects are generally lighter than the top , as receiving the reflected light more powerfully . It is also occasioned by the contrast of the dark shadow which springs from it , as every object is rendered darker by the contrast of any lighter object , every degree of light and shade possessing only a relative value , as the same strength of colour in one part of a picture constitutes a bright light , whilst in another part it forms a deep shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to effect , to divide all the different degrees of light and shade , into the light , the dark , and the middle tint , of which latter there is generally the most in a well painted picture , as the middle tint includes the generality of shade , as well as all the reflected lights . /z/ Light is the contrast of shade , and shade is the contrast of light . A dark shade is a contrast to a hghter shade ; and vice versa . A bright h'ght is a contrast to any other light which is not so bright . Small and agitated lights are best contrasted by large dull flat shades , as in Fig . I J , vhcre the flittering light of the flying spray at the bottom of the rocks is well contrasted bv the sombre stillness of the dark rocks against which it beats . Fig. 11 . A mass of buildings which are in shade may be relieved and contrasted by perforations which admit of light , as in Fig. 12 , where the dark side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows through which is seen the liht of the evening : skv. /z/ Fig. 12 . The strongest contrast to a light is by making that light the only light in the picture , all the rest being in shade . A square flat shade is best contrasted by any small irregular lights , as in Fig. 18 ; the squareness of the tomb is contrasted by the light leaves of the bramble which hang over it . Fig. 13 . Every light or shade may be contrasted by a light or shade of a different form , according to rules given for contrast of form . /z/ There are three primitive colours , with which all colours may be made ; these colours are yellow , blue , and red , each of which , if perfect , is entirely free from any mixture of either of the above colours . Now , as all these colours , if perfect , are entirely free from any mixture of another colour , so each colour forms a contrast to the other two ; as for example , a perfect red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is by this reason a contrast to either of those colours , and so on in regard to the rest . These contrasts are called simple contrasts ; but as each primitive colour has two others to contrast it , so these two contrasting colours , when mixed together form a double contrast . For example , red is contrasted both by blue and yellow ; blue and yellow mixed together form a green , therefore green is the strongest contrast to red . The following is a table of the primitive colours , the simple contrasts , and the compound contrasts . Primitive Colours . Simple Contrasts . Compound Contrasts . Red . el low , ) I T- , , Green . ( Blue . ) &#9632; XT 11 Blue , I -n 1 Yellow . j r , rurple. /z/ Thus the simple contrasts to red , are yellow and blue , which mixed together , form green , the double contrast of red . The simple contrasts of yellow , are blue and red , which mixed togetlier , form purple , the strongest contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and yellow , which mixed together , form orange , the strongest contrast to blue . The following scheme will exemplify the three simple colours , yellow , blue , and red , and the three compounds , green , purple , and orange , which form the contrasts to the simple colours , whilst the union of the three simple colours , producing grey , is seen in the centre . /z/ By drawing three circles , and colouring them as marked on the opposite page , the student will get the correct idea of these contrasts . We will observe , that all mixtures of the three primitive colours we shall call greys ; dividing them into red greys , green greys , yellow greys , purple greys , blue greys , and orange greys , according as they approach nearest to the diflerent simple colours and compounds . /z/ The gentlest contrast of green greys , are yellow greys , and blue greys ; the next , orange greys , and purple greys ; and the strongest contrasts are red greys , and vice versa . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yellow greys ; next , purple greys , and green greys ; and the strongest are blue greys , and vice versa . The gentlest contrasts of purple greys , are blue greys , and red greys ; the next , orange greys , and green greys ; and the strongest , are yellow greys . Every grey is contrasted by a primitive colour , and in a greater or less degree , according as that grey possesses in its mixture a less or greater degree of the colour it is meant to contrast . For example , a red forms a strong contrast to a green grey , whilst it forms a very feeble contrast to a red grey , with which it is said to harmonize . It may be observed here , that it is impossible to /z/ draw the exact line which separates contrast from harmony , as it entirely depends on circumstances ; the value of forms , of light , and shade , and of colours , being entirely relative . Every colour may be contrasted by another colour of a different form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the colour , but in the form . The same may be said of the contrast of a dark and light tint of the same colour , the contrast being then a contrast of light and shade , and not of colour . In considering the tlnee primitive colours , yellow may be considered as light , red as middle tint , and blue as dark ; again , yellow is a warm colour , red neither loarm nor cold , and blue is a cold colour . Of all the colours , simple and compound , orange is the warmest , and blue the coldest ; by which it will be seen , that all warm colours are contrasts to cold colours . By an attentive perusal of the foregoing pages , at the same time carefully studying the examples which have been given , the student will be enabled in a few hours to acquire a perfect knowledge of the different contrasts of form , of light and shade , and of colour . Indeed , the study of contrast requires nothing more than to comprehend thoroughly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shade , and of forms are self-evident , as are also the differences of colours , after the student has learnt that there are only three primitive colours , each of which differs from the other two . /z/ ON HARMOiNY . Harmony consists in a sameness or similarity of forms of light and shade , and of colour . Thus , in regard to forms : Every line is in harmony with another when it runs parallel with it , whether it be a straight or a curved line ; thus , in the annexed figure , there exists a perfect harmony in the lines of the two mountains , which follow one another , and in the straight lines of the two rows of houses and square lumps of stone in the foreground , and the straight lines of the water . Fig. 14. f* r f f r n r r r , f. r r I. n From this example , the student will readily perceive what is meant by harmony of forms ; in the same way , the harmony of light and shade exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of the same degree of strength throughout . With regard to the harmony of colours , the same simplicity exists and consists in a sameness of tints , which pervade the whole of a picture . Thus , when a drawing or painting exhibits a general tone of green , red , yellow , grey , &c.,; it possesses a great deal of harmony , for a colour bears the greatest harmony towards itself , as red to red , after which those colours which have the greatest mixture of red in them , such as orange , red greys , &c.; The above explanations , though short , will be sufficient to show the meaning of harmony ; the proper union of which , with the rules of contrast , constitute what is generally termed effect ; which is more fully treated on , in the comprehensive extracts from Sir Joshua Reynolds , in another portion of the book . /z/ In speaking of the contrast of forms , I have introduced many objects as contrasting others , when the opposition was not perfect , but , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony ; for instance , I have said , that " any h'ne , which if continued , would cross another line , is a contrast to that line ; " so it is : but unless that line cross the other at right angles , the contrast is not perfect , but inclines more or less towards harmony , in proportion as the line approximates towards a parallel situation ; indeed , all the examples of contrast which I have given , are so mingled with a certain proportion of harmony , that they may all of them be introduced without any fear of rendering the picture disturbed . In making a drawing , the most powerful contrast , as well of light and shade and colour , as of form , ought to exist in the principal object , whilst all the other parts are kept subdued , so that the eye may rest undisturbed on what forms the subject of the picture , without being called away by the superior brilliancy or force of some other object of less importance . The student must recollect that two principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same colour , ought never to exist /z/ in a picture , but that one object , whatever it may be , ought to be the principal , and all the rest subservient to it . Much , however , will depend on the nature of the subject of which the drawing is composed ; in portraits , the effect is often thrown on the face , every other part being made as little prominent as possible , whilst , on the contrary , in landscape , many of the objects approach nearer to that of the principal one , not only in colour , but also in force . In considering the effect of colours , particular regard must be had to the kind of weather which is supposed to be represented , if the subject be a landscape ; and in other subjects , what the nature of the object is which gives the light , whether it be the sun , fire , or candle , and whether the light be reflected or direct , and if reflected , whether from a Vv'arm coloured object , or cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light that that general hue which gives harmony to a picture depends . As an example , suppose the subject is a landscape , in which the setting sun , amid red and yellow clouds , is the object which gives the light : - in this case , the light side of every object will possess a warm yellow tint , and should any thing be represented , of which the light side is cold , a want of harmony would be the immediate consequence . Notwithstanding this , many , indeed I might say all of the best artists , who have ever painted moon- /z/ light , have generally introduced a fire into some part of their pictures , the red light of which is so different from the cold beams of the moon , that I always think that that part of the picture which derives its light from the fire , looks like the piece of another painting cut out and stuck against the moonlight . In representing a landscape lighted by the rising sun , every object ought to be represented cooler than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former is generally more clear and cold than that of the latter . With regard to the colouring either of landscapes or other subjects , the greatest contrast ought to be observed in the principal object ; thus , if the subject be some particular building , it may be represented with a bright yellow light upon it , whilst dark clouds of a cold blue grey thrown behind it , will render it more conspicuous than other parts of the picture where the contrasts are less forcible . When the colouring of any part of a drawing looks dirty through want of clearness , some artificial object of vivid colours placed against it will destrov the dinoriness which would otherwise exist ; for instance , should the colouring of a field look dark , dirty , and want transparency , a figure placed against it , dressed in a white jacket , striped with /z/ lake , and yellow or blue coloured trowsers , will render it less opaque . From the above observations , the student will find that effect depends on contrast , more or less subdued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a thorough knowledge of the different contrasts of form , light , and shade , and colour ; all , therefore , that the student will have to attend to in studying the principles of effect , is to obtain a perfect knowledge of contrast , a thing in itself the most easy that can possibly be , as the very word may be said to explain its principles . The arrangement or subduing of contrast will be easily learnt , ( to a certain degree , ) by the rules given in this work . /z/ Water is not involved in the same obscurity with atmosphere and colour , and the laws which regulate its appearances may be soon learnt ; and those appearances are all , or nearly so , with which the painter has to busy himself . Its three principal states are perfect transparency , perfect opacity , and a state between the two - semi-transparency. 1 . In the first , it is capable of receiving perfect , reflections , and incapable of receiving any shadows . " " 2 . In the middle state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but neither of them perfect - that is , but at half their natural force . 3 . In the last it is capable of receiving perfect shadows , and incapable of receiving any reflec- J tions . I feel that to go through a number of other intermediate states would be only to state that which is obvious , and to waste time ; therefore , speaking of /z/ the power to receive reflections and shadows , it can do perfectly but one at one time and in one state . Where it loses the power of receiving the one , it gains the power of receiving the other ; the loss and gain bearing an exact ratio . In this manner water , under a loss of one-fourth of its transparency , loses one-fourth of its power to reflect : receives a shadow of one-fourth , and a reflection of three- fourths , of their natural force ; and so on in perfectly just proportions . Water , to be perfectly clear , must be perfectly colourless ( not that it at all follows that perfectly colourless water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chalk ; ) and , though some waters holding colouring matter in solution may be of an admirable clearness , they are , notwithstanding , deprived of part of their clearness , and work accordingly some serious changes upon the reflections received in them . Semi-opaque water , that is , water holding in sufl'usion - not solution - any light opaque matter , such as chalk or light coloured mud , presents some appearances quite distinct from anything that may occur under any circumstances to water holding transparent colouring matter in solution only . Water under this last state - transparent and coloured - is little , if at all , affected by sunlight ; whether it be under a full blaze of light , or , on the /z/ contrary , under dense shadow , it continues to reflect objects with the same precision in both cases . I am at present speaking of water in a perfectly undisturbed state , for a sharp windripple on its surface would of course at once alter the case , and render it capable of receiving shadows nearly as sharp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with this light colouriug matter up to the point of semi-opacity , comes , when in shadow , under the state marked 3 ; and possesses its power of receiving both reflections and shadows up to fifty per cent , of their actual force . But when under full and intense sunlight - and this circumstance is one which in an eminent degree proves the opaciating influence of light - it is at once thrown into , or very nearly into , the state marked 2 , and necessarily refuses any reflections . If the banks , hills , or other objects forming one side of the river , were to throw their shadows on its surface , half-reflections would be received up to the limits of the line of shadow , and no further ; and should any shadows extend further than any objects which would , under other circumstances , reflect , the shadows themselves would be distinctly marked . A slight diagram will save me some writing , and perhaps explain more fully what I mean . /z/ l Suppose 1 , a piece of water under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of semi-opacity ; and 2 an object rising out of it , with the sun before you to the left . As far as the shadow of this object extends on the water , it will be semi-transparent , and receive modified , or what may be very properly called half reflections of anything falling HINTS FROM AR FISTS UrOlV COLOUR AD EFFECT . 33 within the optical conditions regulating reflections . The dotted line indicates the general form of that reflection which would occur in clear water ; 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 6 , the general form of the shadow left upon the water by the object 2 ; 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , that portion of it only which would be occupied by its reflection ; and 5 , 7 , 8 , 6 , that part of the shadow which , falling beyond the reflecting limits of the object , becomes a flat and even piece of skadow . Suppose the boat to the right to have a thin white sail , which , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant light ; this again would be reflected within the limits of the shadow . Now , having settled the linear part of the subject , it will be easy to explain the other circumstances which govern the appearances of the shadows and reflections of such objects . They are three . The amount of opacity of the water , its colour , and its depth . Charge your mind , firstly , with these generals affecting opaque reflecting mediums , whether water or anything else , liquid or solid . If the object reflecting be darker than the local depth of the water , the reflection must be , and always is , lighter than the object ; and if the object be lighter than the water , the reflection will be darker . If the object be more transparent than the water , /z/ which is frequently the case , the reflection will be more opaque than the object , and , vice versa , when the object is more opaque than the water , the reflection necessarily becomes more transparent than the object . You can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opaque waters yourself , but two minutes ' writing will explain it . When , therefore , the reflecting object happens to be more coloured than the local character of the water , the reflection is less coloured than the object ; and when the water possesses more colour than the object , the reflection becomes charged with the colour of the water itself . And occasionally all three conditions operate on the reflection of an object at the same time . Thus a reflection may be either more transparent , dark , and coloured , or more opaque , light , and colourless , than the object causing it . This is without reference to the many motions and consequent forms incident to an element so liquid and exquisitely mobile as water , and which , without entirely upsetting the foregoing laws of still water , modify them in a great many ways , and to an extent not perhaps to be dreamt of by a person who , for the first time in his life , sits down ' - under the shadow of an old wall - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of broken paling , with a piece of Watman 's paper in a quarter imperial folio on his knees ! But to the point again . /z/ I will carry out foriyou this little diagram somewhat further before quitting the water . We must fix upon its depth - I mean not its " profond , " but its amount of darkness . Let it be for simplicity 's sake , exactly middle tint . Its colour ? Let that be , I was about saying , drab ; that is unpleasant ; stone colour , that is dull ; mud , that is indefinite , as are the other two : let it be the colour of cork ; that is of a pleasant character as regards colour , and its associations are pleasant also - it is not to be forgotten as the others are ; it is the colour of the Severn , the Avon , the Tiber , and many other warm-coloured muddy rivers , which have more beauties in them than are generally allowed by the lovers of clear water , and have been described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mellow , roseate , &c.,; as - one may suppose - the rhyme may require . Let the side of the object marked 9 be a pure white ; so that , notwithstanding its being in shade , its apparent local depth may be still much lighter than the actual local depth of the water . This would be the case in nature , if the sky at your back were white , instead of clear blue or dark clouds . Locally white itself , and lighted by the bright and colourless sky behind , this face of the object would be very light although in shadow , and tolerably free from colour . Its reflection , on the contrary , received in water of the colour of cork , and of the // depth of middle tint , would*be of a light cork colour , or , of what may - be more specifically named , a quarter tint of cork colour . Nothing in shadow can be perfectly opaque ; but the face 9 , itself locally white and strongly reflected on from ' clouds of Its own colour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to present a very wide distinction between the opacity of itself and the semi-transparency of the water . The character , then , of this part of the reflection as regards transparency , would be somewhat more than a quarter transparency , or somewhat less than a three-quarter opacity . The reflection here then is , in broad terms , darker , more coloured , more transparent than its object . The aperture to the right of 9 , let us suppose , for the sake of explicit and easy terms , to be black and perfectly transparent . The reflection under these circumstances - that is , full shade and perfect transparency , received in half shade and semitransparency - would be three-quarter transparent , or a quarter opaque . As regards depth it would be dark middle tint ; and as regards colour it would be , like face 9 , more coloured than its object . The reflection of face 9 diflfered from its object in being darker , more transparent , and more coloured . This last reflection differs from its object in being lighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end 10 be deep vermilion in colour , so that , allowing for reflection from the same sky which lighted the face 9 , its depth should be just middle tint . The reflection of this part as regards depth , will not be distinguishable from its object ; for middle tint of any colour , received in middle tint of any other colour , will experience no other alteration in depth . As regards the colour of this part , the conditions are quite changed from those which regulate the face 9 and its aperture . The object in this case is much more coloured than the water . The reflection in this instance will be much less coloured than the surface reflected , and in just the same proportion as the colour of the water may be of a character less positive and active , than the red of the object reflected . I think I said before , that the remainder of the shadow , which projects itself to the right beyond the limits of reflection , w411 be a perfectly flat piece of shadov/ . A person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - whether transparent or opaque - will be very likely to run away with the impression that the whole of the reflections are tinged to one certain amount by the colour of the water - that is , that they receive a certain per percentage of such colour , let the objects reflected be ever so varied . This , however , is not the case , and it very frequently happens that , not until after some failures /z/ in representing such effects , and going back to nature frequently for fresh authority in close studies , the discovery is made that various colours are variously effected - tinged by - variously coloured waters . A great deal of unnecessary confusion thus disturbs one 's progress to truthful representation , all to be the more lamented when the truth happens to be a beauty as well ; and , as regards water , its truths and constantly changing characteristics have in them a greater proportion of beauties out of any given number of effects or states , than any else I know of in nature , sky not excepted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that will perhaps reconcile you to what I feel myself to be somewhat pe/e and wearisome in this particularizing on so small a scale of incident , and at the same time prove how necessary it is to well know nature before you can go to her , palatte on thumb , with anything like a chance of success in any but a very slight hand-gallop style of art . Early in my painting life , I sat down to a piece of green coloured nearly transparent water , tranquil enough to receive perfect reflections as to form , and coloured enough to at once strike me forcibly with the beauty of its chromatic phenomena , in the great difference between the colour of the objects themselves , and their reflections . With this imperfect impression of the partial or efiicient reflectability of red , I fell across a piece /z/ of I'eddish golden coloured water , in which the reds were reflected perfectly , as where the orange and yellow-coloured objects ; upon which the laws regulating coloured reflections , in both transparent and turbid coloured waters , opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - all waters , of whatsoever colour they may be , reflect those ' colours most perfectly which are first identical , ( and next those which most closely affinitize with the colour of the water itself ; and least perfectly , those colours which are diametrically opposed to the colour of the water . /z/ The quantities of any series of objects seen reflected upon still water , are always precisely the same quantities of the objects themselves , as might be seen from a point removed as far below the surface as the actual point of sight is elevated above such surface . We must first of all bear in mind distinctly , that reflections can not ever be arbitrary . They may , under some instances of extreme complication , become every thing but unaccountable . The front object in a scene , will of course be first reflected ; but it does not follow that another which is much higher must be reflected also , for it will depend upon the distance at which it is situated beyond the one in front . The higher you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant and higher object , and the less of their reflections ; and the lower and farther oflf you place yourself , the less you see of the higher and distant objects , and the more of their reflections . It is often the case with painters , afier having EXTRACTS niOM LETTERS ON LANDSCAPES . 41 sketched or studied a scene from nature at a time when the water was not in a state to receive reflections , that they somewhat aher the treatment when at home , and add the reflections ; and it too frequently happens that the whole scene - if not considered so - is treated as so much surface on one plain . Indeed , it would seem that the occupation of a painter 's life being to create pictures , the whole scene , sky included , is treated as a picture also , and reflected as such from the water-line downwards ; than which it is impossible for anything to be more erroneous . There is , in fact , much danger and mischief in going to nature too unprepared . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are now in communication should be thoroughly understood , if not gone through mathematically , in order that one may not be taken unawares by som.e of the palpable common places of natural appearances . Without a continued discipline of this nature , there are many things constantly turning up in the course of a season 's study for which one is not prepared readily , and on the instant , to account ; and this necessarily occasions much hesitation , pottering about , and undecided and often erroneous painting . Amongst these things nothing is more puzzling , /z/ at first sight , than some of the incidents attending reflections . For instance , some objects which appear on the landscape dark are reflected as light , and others which relieve light on the landscape have a dark reflection . Some colours are most essentially modified , and occasionally quiie altered in reflection ; and some objects , even at the water 's edge , which present a broad face to the view have no reflection ; while others , of which you can only see an edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rule follows thus : - all surfaces which run in a right line with any possible angle of incidence , can not be reflected , although seen . And all surfaces running in a right line with any possible angle of accidence can not be seen , although their whole length may be reflected . " /z/ Colour presents more of debateable ground than any other subject that may be entered on . It has been , of all others , the least satisfactorily handled by the writers upon art . The reason of this is , that as regards the arts , powerful chromatic feeling and organization , as in the case of Titian , have appeared in their maturity , while the science of chromatics until the last few years , has lingered in its infancy ; and in its present state , it still remains /z/ a sealed book as regards the requirements of the painter , and as presenting a site of well-defined powers , productive of certain , definite , and varied chromatic expressions . Pictures , and the diflbrent scales of diflbrent masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of such labour up to the present time , has been attended with no better success , than that of children who have taken to pieces their parents ' watches . Analysis has gone on producing nothing but wreck , and no synthesis has grown out of the confusion . When , indeed , we think of the requisite varied power and qualifications of the mind , capable of throwing all the necessary light on this subject , which is wanted by the painter in search of high intentionality and expression , we may not wonder that it has not yet been done ; and , though I intend exposing to you as plainly as possible the views by which ( though not invariably ) my practice has been guided , I must at the same time warn you against the expectation of that com : ) lete system , I so much regret the want of , and to produce which , would require in one individual the several uniied powers of the greatest colourists , and the greatest natural and moral philosopher ? ; , and all blended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a power of writing that falls to the share of but few . While you are , on the other hand , cautioned against a two implicit reliance , ( not from any /z/ doubts of my own , but from the circumstances merely of my own views being somewhat opposed to those of others , ) 1 must , on the other hand , and to save time , be allowed to advance them without qualification , or a circumlocution that would merely convey but an equivocal im.pression of my possible modesty . Any picture , to convey an idea of , or administer to , any one particular sentiment or expression , should be of some one particular definable tone or colour , which should as it were , and in defiance of the other colours within the work , pervade its whole surface . If you are afraid of two bold a speculation , and would shrink from attempting anything so outre as a blue picture , there are numerous other tones which have already ingratiated themselves in our affections , such as pearly , golden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination the properties of a golden tone . It may be well , that some principal mass or object in this work be orange , which may intensify in yellow , and be surrounded by citrons and russets , before breaking away into any of the contrasts . The yellow may be extended in lesser degrees over the light part of the picture , and be allowed to culminate at some part at the nearest possible approach to white ; but white in its ultima'e purity should be strictly avoided ; it should be /z/ subordinated to yellow or golden . The following colours can not harmonise with golden or yellow , and should never be admitted , at any rate in any quantity : white and black , purple , blue and red . The two first are negative , the next positive oppositions , and the last two perfect strangers to yellow ; under which - circumstances harmony must , I have always felt , be out of the question when it shall be attempted to combine them in a work of the tone in question . A pure blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , as well as any other object , should not be broken down with red , which would produce an opposite , but with yellow or orange , yellow in preference . The greatest amount of opposition admissible in a picture of this tone would be olive , graduating through citron-olive , and russet-olive ; of which colours , varying between their lightest and darkest extremes , and leaning occasionally towards one or the other of their components - there may be found an infinite variety , sufficient for all purposes , provided they be kept pure and distinct at some one point of their occurrence . To a person in the habit of using the more violent and crude oppositions , this may appear to present a very limited range of colours ; but I must impress upon your consideration whether harmony , discarding this liberal limit , can by any possibility be obtained by opposition without subordination . /z/ It can not , at least , be obtained in any other system of things in nature ; and s all nature is in different degrees analogous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all other nature , of which it is itself a component , so as in every particular to have consequences intrinsically , and exclusively iis own . /z/ When the artist is once enabled to express himself with some degree of correctness , he must then endeavour to collect subjects for eypression ; to amass a stock of ideas , to be combined and varied as occasion may require . He is now in the second period of study , in which his business is to learn all that has been known and done before his own time . H iving hitherto received instructions from a particular master , he is now to consider Art as his master . He must extend his capacity to more sublime and general instructions . T.iose perfections which lie scattered among various masters , are now united in one general idea , which is henceforth to regulate his taste , and enlarge his imagination . With a variety of models thus before him , he will avoid that narrowness and poverty of conception which attends a bigoted admiration of a simple master , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excel . A student unacquainted with the attempts of former adventures , is always apt to overrate his own abilities ; to mistake the most trifling excursions for discoveries of moment , and every coast /z/ new to him , for a new-found country . If by chance he passes beyond his usual limits , he congratulates his own arrival at those regions which they who have steered a better course have long left behind them . The productions of such minds are seldom distinguished by an air of originality ; they are anticipated in their happiest efforts ; and if they are found to differ in anything from their predecessors , it is onlv in i.rreojular sallies and triflinsr conceits . The more extensive , therefore , your acquaintance is with the works of those who have excelled , the more extensive will be your powers of invention ; and what may appear still more like a paradox , the more original will be your conceptions . " /z/ I CONSIDER general copying as a delusive kind of industry ; the student satisfies himself with the appearance of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without selecting , and of labouring without any determinate object ; as it requires no effort of the mind , he sleeps over his work ; and those powers of invention and composition which ought particularly to be called out , and put in action , lie torpid , and lose their energy for want of exercise . How incapable those are of producing anything of their own , who have spent much of their /z/ ihnc in making finished copies , is well known to all who are at all conversant with art . The great use in copying , if it be at all useful , should seem to be in learning to colour ; yet even colouring will never be perfectly attained by servilely copying the mode before you . An eye critically nice , can only be formed by observing well-coloured pictures with attention ; and by close inspection , and minute examination , you will discover , at last , the manner of handling the artifices of contrast , glazing , and other expedients , by which good colourists have raised the value of their tints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must inform you , however , that old pictures deservedly celebrated for their colouring , are often so changed by dirt and varnish , that we ought not to wonder if they do not appear equal to their reputation in the eyes of inexperienced painters , or young students . An artist , whose judgment is matured by long observation , considers rather what the picture once was , than what it is at present . He has , by habit , acquired a power of seeing the brilliancy of tints through the cloud by which it is obscured . An exact imitation , therefore , of those pictures , is likely to fill the student 's mind with false opinions , and send him back a colourist of his own formation , with ideas equally remote from nature and from art , from the genuine practice of the masters , and the real appearances of things . /z/ Following these rules , and using these precautions , when you have clearly and distinctly learned in what good colouring consists , you can not do better than have recourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in comparison of whose true splendour the best coloured pictures are but faint and feeble . However , as the practice of copying is not entirely to be excluded , since the mechanical practice of painting is learned in some measure by it , let those choice parts only be selected , which have recommended the work to notice . If its excellence consists in its general effect , it would be proper to make slight sketches of the machinery and general management of the picture . Those sketches should be kept always by you for the regulation of your style . Instead of copying the touches of those great masters , copy only their conceptions . Instead of treading in their footsteps , endeavour only to keep the same road . Labour to invent on their general principles and way of thinking . Possess yourself with their spirit . Consider with yourself how a Michael Angelo , or a Raffaelle would have treated this subject , and work yourself into the belief that your picture is to be seen*and criticised by them when completed . Even an attempt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have experienced how lazily , and consequently how ineffectually instruction is re- /z/ ccived , when forced upon the mind by others . Few have been taught to any purpose , who have not been their own teachers . We prefer those instructions which we have given ourselves , from our affection to the instructor ; and they are more effectual , from being received into the mind at the very time when it is most open and eager to receive ihem. /z/ Style in painting , which is a branch of the art more immediately necessary to the young student , is the same as in writing , a power over materials , whether words or colours , by which conceptions or sentiments are conveyed . In this Luidovico Caracci ( I mean in his best works ) appears to me to approach the nearest to perfection . His unaffected breadth of light and shadow , the simplicity of colouring , which , holding its proper rank , does not draw aside the least part of the attention from the subject , and the solemn effect of that twilight which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspond to grave and dignified subjects , better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine , which enlightens the pictures of Titian ; though TiNTORET thought that Titian 's colouring was the model of perfection , and would correspond even with the sublime of Michael Angelo ; and that if Angelo had coloured like Titian , or Titian de- /z/ signed like Angelo , the world would once have had a perfect painter . In painting , as in other arts , there are many teachers who profess to show the nearest way to excellence ; and many expedients have been invented , by which the toil of study might be saved . &#9632; But let no man be seduced to idleness by specious promises . Excellence is never granted to man , but as the reward of labour . It argues , indeed , no small strength of mind to persevere in habits of industiy , without the pleasure of perceiving those advances ; which , like the hand of a clock , whilst they make hourly approaches to their point , yet proceed so slowly as to escape observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a musical instrument , can not be acquired but by an infinite number of acts . I need not , therefore , enforce by many words the necessity of continual application ; nor tell you that the port-crayon ought to be forever in your hands . Various methods will occur to you by which this power may be acquired . There is one precept , however , in which I shall only be opposed by the vain , the ignorant , and the idle . I am not afraid that I shall repeat it too often . You must have no dependence on your own genius . If you have great talents , industry will improve them ; if you have but moderate abilities , industry will supply their deficiency . /z/ Nothing is denied to well-directed labour ; nothing is to be obtained without it . Not to enter into ' metaphysical discussions on the nature or essence of genius , I will venture to assert , that assiduity , unabated by difficulty and a disposition eagerly directed to the object of its pursuit , will produce effects siniilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though a man can not at all times , and in all places , paint or draw , yet the mind can prepare itself by laying in proper materials , at all times , and in all places . Both Livy and Plutarcli , in describing Philopoemen , one of the ablest generals of antiquity , have given us a striking picture of a mind always intent on its profession , and by assiduity , obtaining those excellencies which some all their lives vainly expect from nature . I can not help imagining , that I see a promising young painter , equally vigilant , whether at home or abroad , in the streets , or in the fields . Every object which presents itself , is to him a lesson . He regards all nature with a view to his profession ; and combines her beauties , or corrects her defects . He examines the countenance of men under the influence of passion ; and often catches the most pleasing hints from subjects of turbulence or deformity . Even bad pictures themselves supply him with useful documents ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the fanciful images that /z/ are sometimes seen in the fire , or are accirfentally sketched upon a discoloured wall . The artist who has his mind thus filled with ideas , and his hand made expert by practice , works with ease and readiness : whilst he would have you believe that he is waiting for the inspirations of genius lie is in reality at a loss how to begin . /z/ The detail of particulars , which does not assist the expression of the main characteristics , is worse than useless , it is mischievous , as it dissipates the attention and draws it from the principal point . It may be remarked , that the impression which is left on our mind , even of things which are familiar to us , is seldom more than their general effect ; beyond which we do not look in recognising such objects . To express this in painting , is to express what is congenial and natural to the mind of man , and what gives him by reflection his own mode of conceiving . The other pre-supposes nicety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious and attentive , and therefore does not speak to the general sense of the whole species ; in which common , and , as I may so call it , mother tongue , every thing grand and comprehensive must be uttered . I do not mean to prescribe what degree of attention ought to be paid to the minute facts ; that , it is hard to settle . We are sure that it is expressing the general effect of the whole , which alone can give to objects their true and touching character ; and wherever this is observed , whatever else may be nec ; lected , we acknowledge the hand of a mas- /z/ ter . We may even go further , and observe , that where the general effect only is presented to us by a skillful hand , it appears to express the object represented in a more lively manner , than the minutest resemblance would do . The properties of all objects , as far as a painter is concerned with them , are , the outline or drawing , the colour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the colour its visible quality , and the light and shade its solidity . Excellence in any one of these parts of art will never be acquired by an artist , unless he has the habit of looking upon objects at large , and observing the effect which they have on the eye when it is dilated . It is by this that we obtain the ruling characteristic , and that we learn to imitate it by short and dextrous methods . I do not mean by dexterity , a trick or mechanical habit , formed by guess , and established by custom ; but that science , which , by a profound knowledge of ends and means , discovers the shortest and surest way to its own purpose . If we examine with a critical view the manner of those painters whom we consider as patterns , we shall find that their great fame does not proceed from their works being more highly finished than those of other artists , or from a more minute attention to details ; but from that enlarged comprehension which sees the whole object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives its characteristic effect by adequate expression . Raffaelle and Titian are two names which stand the highest in our art ; one for drawing , and the other for painting . The most considerable and the most esteemed works of Raffaelle are the Cartoons , and his Fresco works in the Vatican ; those , as we all know , are far from being minutely finished : his principal care and attention seems to have been fixed upon the adjustment of the whole , whether it was the general composition , or the composition of each individual figure ; for every , figure may be said to be a lesser whole , though in reorard to the " " eneral work to which it belono-s. it is but a part ; the same may be said of the head , of the hands and feet . Though he possessed this , art of seeing and comprehending the whole , as far as form is concerned , he did not exert the same faculty in regard to the general effect , which is presented to the eye by colour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his oil pictures , where this excellence is more expected than in fresco , is a sufficient proof . It is to Titian we must turn our eyes to find excellence with regard to colour , and light and shade , in the highest degree . He was both the first and the greatest master of this art . By a few strokes he knew how to mark the general ima2:e and character of whatever object he attempted ; and pro- /z/ duced by this a line , a truer representation than his Giovanni Belling , or any of his predecessors , who finished every hair . His great care was to express the general colour , to preserve the masses of light and shade , and to give by opposition the idea of that solidity which is inseparable from natural objects ; when those are preserved , though the work should possess no other merit , it will have in a proper place its complete effect ; but where any of these are wanting , however minutely laboured the picture may be in the detail , the whole will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , or in whatever light it can be shown . It is vain to attend to the variation of tints , if in that attention the general hue of flesh is lost ; or to finish even so minutely the parts , if the masses are not observed , or the whole not well put together . Raffaelle and Titian seem to have looked at nature for different purposes ; they both had the power of extending their view to the whole ; but one looked only for the general effect as produced by form , the other as produced by colour . We can not entirely refuse to Titian the merit of attending to the general form of his object , as well as colour ; but his deficiency lay , a deficiency at least when he is compared with Raffaelle , in not possessing the power like him , of correcting the form of his model by any general idea of beauty in his own mind . Of this , his St. Sebastian is a par- /z/ ticular instance . This figure appears to be a most exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he then happened to have before him ; it has all the force of nature , and the colouring is flesh itself ; but unluckily , the model was of a bad form , especially the legs . Titian has with as much care preserved these defects , as he has imitated the beauty and brilliancy of the colouring . In his colouring , he was large and general , as in his design he was minute and partial : in the one he was a genius , in the other not much above a copier . I do not , however , speak now of all his pictures ; instances enough may be produced in his works , where those observations on his defects could not , with any propriety be applied ; but it is in the manner or language , as it may be called , in which Titian and others of that school express themselves , that their chief excellence he s . This manner is in reality , in painting , what language is in poetry . We are all sensible how differently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , and how mean or how grand the same object appears when presented to us by different painters , whether it is the human figure , an animal , or even inanimate objects ; there is nothing , however uncompromising in appearance , but may be raised into dignity , convey sentiment , and produce emotion in the hands of a painter of genius . What was said of /z/ Virgil , that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity , may be apphed to Titian : whatever be touched , however naturally mean , and habitually familiar , by a kind of magie he invested with grandeur and importance . I must here observe , that I am not recommending a neglect of the detail ; indeed it would be difficult , if not impossible , to prescribe certain bounds , and tell how far , or when it is to be observed or neglected ; much must , at last , be left to the taste and judgment of the artist . I am well aware that a judicious detail will sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently interest the spectator . I only wish to impress on your minds the true distinction between essential and subordinate powers ; and to show what qualities in the art claim your c/izef attention , and what may , with the least injury to your reputation be neglected . Something , perhaps , always must be neglected ; the lesser ought then to give way to the greater ; and since every work can have but a limited time allotted to it , ( for even supposing a whole life to be employed about one picture , it is still limited , ) it appears more reasonable to employ that time to the best advantage , in contriving various methods of composing the work , - in trying different effect of light and shadow , - and employing the labor of correction in heightening by a judicious adjustment of the parts , the effects of the whole , - than that /z/ the time should be taken up in minutely finishing those parts . But there is another kind of high finishing , which may safely be condemned , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the artist , to avoid that hardness which proceeds from the outline cutting against the ground , softens and blends the colours to excess : this is what the ignorant call high finishing , but which tends to destroy the brilliancy of colour , and the true effect of representation ; which consists very much in preserving the same proportion of sharpness and bluntness that is found in natural objects . This extreme softening , instead of producing the effect of softness , gives the appearance of ivory , or some other hard substance , highly polished . The portraits of Cornelius Jansen appear to have this defect , and consequently want that suppleness which is the characteristic of flesh ; whereas , in the works of Vandyck , we find that true mixture of softness and hardness perfectly observed . The same defect may be found in the manner of VanDERWERF , in opposition to that of Teniers ; and such also , we may add , is the manner of Raffaelle , in his oil pictures , in comparison with that of Titian . The name which Raffaelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may venture to say was not acquired by this laborious attention . /z/ His apology may be made by saying that it was the manner of his country ; but if he had expressed his ideas with the facihty and eloquence , as it may be called , of Titian , his works would certainly not have been less excellent ; and that praise which ages and nations have poured out upon him , for possessing genius in the higher attainments of art , would have been extended to them all . Those who are not conversant in works of art , are often surprised at the high value set by connoisseurs on drawings which appear careless , and in every respect unfinished . But they are truly valuable ; and their value arises from this , that they give the idea of a whole , and this whole is often expressed by a dexterous facility which indicates the the true power of a painter , even though roughly exerted : whether it consists in the general composition , or the general form of each figure , or the turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this we may see fully exemplified in the very skilful drawings of Parmegiano and Corregio . On whatever account we value these drawings , it is certainly not for high finishing , or a minute attention to particulars . Excellence in every part , and in every province of our art , from the highest style of history , down to the resemblance of still life , will depend on this /z/ power of extending the attention at once to the " vvhole , without which the greatest dihgence is vain . I wish you to bear in mind , that when I speak of a whole , I do not naean simply a ichole , as belonging to composition , but a whole with respect to the general style of colouring ; a whole with regard to the light and shade ; a whole of every thing which may separately become the main object of a painter . I remember a landscape painter in Rome , who was known by the name of Studio , from his patience in high finishing , in which he thought the whole excellence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , to represent every individual leaf on a tree . This picture I never saw ; but I am very sure that an artist , who looked only at the general character of the species , the order of the branches , and the masses of the foliage , would , in a few minutes , produce a more true resemblance of trees , than this painter in as many months . A landscape painter certainly ought to study , anatomically , ( if I may use the expression , ) all the objects which he paints ; but when he is to turn his studies to use , his skill , as a man of genius , will be displayed in showing the general effect , preserving the same degree of hardness and softness which the objects have in nature ; for he applies himself to the imagination , not to the curiosity , and works not for the virtuoso , or the naturalist , but for the /z/ common observer of life and nature . Where he knows his subject , he will know not only what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill in leaving out is , in all things , a great part of knowledge and wisdom . The same excellence of manner which Titian displayed in history or portrait painting , is equally conspicuous in his landscapes , whether they are professedly such , or serve only as back grounds . One of the most eminent of this latter kind is to be found in the picture of St. Pietro Martire . The large trees , which are here introduced , are plainly distinguished from each other by the different manner with which the branches shoot from their trunks , as well as by their different foliage ; and the weeds in the foreground are varied in the same manner , just as much as variety requires , and no more . When Algarotti , speaking of this picture , praises it for the minute discrimination of the leaves and plants , even , as he says , to excite the admiration of a botanist , his intention was , undoubtedly , to give praise , even at the expense of truth ; for he must have known that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always find , in pictures , what they think they ought to find : he was not aware that he was giving a description injurious to the reputation of Titian . Such accounts may be very hurtful to young artists , who never have had an opportunity of seeing DETAILS AND MINUTi : FINISH . 65 the work described ; and they may possibly conchade &#9632; that this great artist acquired the name of the divine Titian from his eminent attention to such trifling : circumstances , which , in reality , would not raise him above the level of the most ordinary painter . We may extend these observations even to what seems to have but a single , and that an individual object , the excellence of portrait painting ; and , we may add , even the likeness , the character and countenance , as I have observed in another place , depend more upon the general effect produced by the peculiarities , or minute discrimination of parts . The chief attention of the artist is , therefore , employed in planting the features in their proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and true impression of the whole . The very peculiarities may be reduced to classes and general descriptions ; and there are , therefore , large ideas to be found even in this contracted subject . He may afterwards labour single features to what degree he thinks proper , but let him not forget , continually , to examine , whether in finishing the parts he is not destroying the general efTect . It is certainlv a thinoj to be wished , that all excellence were applied to illustrate subjects that arc interesting and worthy of being commemorated ; whereas , of half the pictures that are in the world , the subject can be valued only as an occasion which set the artist to work ; and yet our high estimation /z/ // of such pictures , without considering , or perhaps without knowing the subject , shows how much our attention is engaged by the art alone . Perhaps nothing that we can say will so clearly show the advantage and excellence of this faculty , as that it confers the character of genius on works that pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , or dignity , and where none are interested in the subject . We can not refuse the character of genius to the marriage of Paoli VepcONESE , without opposing the general sense of mankind , ( great authentics have called it the triumph of painting , ) or to the altar of St. Augustine , at Antwerp , by Rubens , which equally deserves that title ; and for the same reason , neither of those pictures have any interesting story to support them . Paoli Veronese is only a representation of a great concourse of people at a dinner ; and the subject of Rubens , if it may be called a subject where nothing is doing , is an assembly of various saints , that lived in different ages . The whole excellence of those pictures consists in mechanical dexterity , working , however , under the influence of that comprehensive faculty which I have so often mentioned . It is by this , and this alone , that the mechanical power is ennobled , and raised much above its na tural rank . And it appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as an instance of that superiority with which mind predominates over /z/ matter , by contracting into one whole what nature has made multifarious . The great advantage of this idea of a whole is , that a greater quantity of truth may be said to be contained and expressed in a few lines or touches , than in the most laborious furnishing of the parts where this is not regarded . It is upon this foundation that it stands ; and the justness of the observation would be confirmed by the ignorant in art , if it were possible to take their opinions unseduced by some false notion of what they imagine they ought to see in a picture . As it is an art , they think they ought to be pleased in proportion as they see that art ostentatiously displayed ; they will , from this supposition , prefer neatness , high finishing , and gaudy colouring , to the truth , simplicity , and unity of nature . Perhaps , too , the totally ignorant beholder , like the ignorant artist , can not comprehend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false notions do not anticipate their perceptions , they who are capable of observation , and who , pretending to no skill , look only straight forward , will praise and condemn in proportion as the painter has succeeded in the effect of the whole . Here general satisfaction , or general dislike , tiiough perhaps despised by the painter , as proceeding from the ignorance of the principles of art , may yet help to regulate his conduct , and brinoj back his attention to that which ought to be his principal object , and from which he /z/ has deviated for the sake of minuter beauties . An instance of this right judgment I once saw in a child , in going through a gallery where there were many portraits of the last ages , which , though neatly put out of hand , were very ill put together . The child paid no attention to the neat finishing or naturalness of any bit of drapery , but appeared to observe only the ungracefulness of the persons represented , and put herself in the posture of every figure which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censure of nature , uninformed , fastened upon the greatest fault that could be in a picture , because it related to the whole character and management of the whole . I should be sorry , if what has been said should be understood to have any tendency to encourage that carelessness which leaves work in an unfinished state . 1 commend nothing for the want of exactness ; I mean to point out that kind of exactness which is the best , and which is alone truly to be so esteemed . So far is my disquisition from giving countenance to idleness , that there is nothing in our art which enforces such continual exertion and circumspection , as an attention to the general effect of the whole . It requires much study and much practice ; it requires the painter 's entire mind ; whereas the parts may be finishing by nice touches , while his mind is engaged on other matters ; he may even /z/ hear a play or novel read without much disturbance . The artist who flatters his own indolence , will continually find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care and laziness of highly finishing the parts ; producing , at last , what Cowley calls " laborious effects of idleness . " No work can be too much finished , provided the diligence employed be directed to its proper object ; but I have observed that an excessive labour in the detail has , nine times in ten , been pernicious to the general effect , even when it has been the labour of great masters . It indicates a bad choice , which is an ill setting out in any undertaking . To give a right direction to your industry has been my principal purpose . It is this which , I am confident , often makes the difference between two students of equal capacities , and of equal industry . While the one is employing his labour on minute objects of little consequence , the other is acquiring the art , and perfecting the habit , of seeing nature in an extensive view , in its proper proportions , and its due subordination of parts . The same extension of mind which gives the excellence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will direct him likewise in the method of study , and give him the superiority over those who narrowly follow a more confined track of partial imitation . Whoever , in order to finish his education , should /z/ travel in Italy , and spend his whole time there only in copying pictures , and measuring statues or buildings , ( though these things are not to be neglected , ) would return with little improvement . He that imitates the Iliad , says Dr. Young , is not imitating Homer . It is not by laying up in the memory the particular details of any of the great works of art , that a man becomes a great artist ; if he slops without making himself master of the general principles on which these works are conducted . If he even hopes to rival those whom he admires , he must consider their works as the means of teaching him the true art of seeing nature . When this is acquired , he then may be said to have appropriated their powers , or at least the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own industry and application . The great business of study is , to form a mind , adapted and adequate to all times and all occasions ; to which all nature is there laid open , and which may be said to possess the key of her inexhaustible riches . /z/ The observations to which I formerly wished , and now desire to point your attention , relate not to errors which are committed by those who have no claim to merit , but to those inadvertencies into which men of parts only can fall , by the over-rating , or the abuse of some real , though subordinate , excellence . The errors last alluded to are those of backward , timid characters ; what I shall now speak of belong to another class - to those artists who are distinguished for the readiness and facility of their invention . It is undoubtedly a splendid and desirable accomplishment to be able to design , instantaneously , any given subject . It is an excellence that I believe every artist would wish to possess ; but , unluckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind to be contented with first thoughts , without choice or selection . The judgment , after it has been long passive , by degrees loses its power of becoming active , when exertion is necessary . Whoever , therefore , has this talent , must , in some measure , undo what he has had the habit of doing , or , at least , give a new turn to his mind : great works , which are to live and stand the criticism of posterity , are not performed at a heat ; a propor- /z/ tionable time is required for deliberation and circumspection . I remember when I was at Rome , looking at the Fighting Gladiator , in company with an eminent sculptor , and I expressed my . admiration of the skill with which the whole is composed , and the minute attention of the artist to the change of every muscle in that momentary exertion of strength . He was of opinion that a work so perfect required nearly the whole life of man to perform . I believe , if we look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of poetry , what has been soon done has been as soon forgotten . The judgment and practice of a great poet , on this occasion , is worthy attention . Metastasia , who has so much and justly distinguished himself throughout Europe , at his outset was an Improvisatorej or extempore poet , - a description of men not uncommon in Italy . It is not long since he was asked by a friend , if he did not think the custom of inventinsj and recitins ; extempore , which he practised when a boy , in his character of an Impromsatore , might not be considered as a happy beginning of his education ; he thought it , on the contrary , a disadvantage to him . He said that he had acquired by that habit a carelessness and incorrectness , which it cost him much trouble to overcome , and to substitute in the place of it a totally different habit , that of thinking with selec- /z/ lion , and of expressing himself with correctness and precision . However extraordintiry it may appear , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they may be called , have , notwithstanding the common boast of their authors , that all is spun from their own brain , very rarely anything that has in the least the air of originality : their compositions are generally common-place , uninteresting , without character or expression ; like those flowery speeches that we sometimes hear , which impress no new ideas on the mind . I would not be thought , however , by what has been said , to oppose the use , the advantage , the necessity there is , of a painter 's being readily able to express his ideas by sketching . The further he can carry such designs , the better . The evil to be apprehended is his resting there , and not correcting them afterwards from nature , or taking the trouble to look about him for whatever assistance the works of others will afford him . We are not to suppose , that when a painter sits down to deliberate on any work , he has all his knowledge to seek ; he must not only be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every variety of action , but he must be acquainted , likewise , with the general principles of composition , and possess a habit of foreseeing , while he is composing , the effect of the masses of light and shadow that /z/ will attend such a disposition . His mind is entirely occupied by his attention to the whole . It is a subsequent consideration to determine the attitude and expression of individual figures . It is in this period of his work that I would recommend to every artist to look over his port-folio , or pocket-book , in which he has treasured up all the happy inventions , all the extraordinary and expressive attitudes that he has met with in the course of his studies ; not only for the sake of borrowing from those studies whatever may be applicable to his own work , but likewise on account of the great advantage he will receive by bringing the ideas of great artists more distinctly before his mind , which will teach him to invent other figures in a similar style . I know there are many artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of themselves , and who , probably , would think it derogatory to their character to be supposed to borrow from any other painter . But when we recollect , and compare the works of such men with those who took to their assistance the inventions of others , we shall be convinced of the great advantage of this latter practice . The two men most eminent for readiness of invention , that occur to me , are Luca Gurdano and La Fage ; one in painting , and the other in drawing . To such extraordinary powers as were possessed bv both of those artists , we can not refuse the cha- /z/ racter of genius ; at the same time it must be acknowledged , that it was that kind of mechanic genius which operates without much assistance of the head . In all their works , which are ( as might be expected ) very numerous , we may look in vain for anything that can be said to be original and striking ; and yet , according to the ordinary ideas of originality , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little from others , and still less will any artist , that can distinguish between excellence and insipidity , ever borrow from them . To those men , and all such , let us oppose the practice of the first of painters . I suppose we shall all agree that no man ever possessed a greater power of invention , and stood less in need of foreign assistance , than Raffaelle ; and yet , when he was designing one of his greatest , as well as latest works , the Cartoons , it is very apparent that he had the studies which he had made from Masaccio before him . Two noble figures of St. Paul , which he found there , he adopted in his own work ; one of them he took for St. Paul preaching at Athens , and the other for the same saint , when chastising the socerer Elymas . Another figure in the same work , whose head is sunk in his breast , wath his eyes shut , appearing deeply wrapt up in thought , was introduced amongst the listeners to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ is made in those two figures of St. Paul , is the addition of the left hands , which are seen in the original . It is a rule that Raffaelle observed , ( and indeed ought never to be dispensed with , ) in a principal figure , to show both hands ; that it should never be a question what is become of the other hand . For the sacrifice at Lystrn , he took the whole ceremony , much as it stands , in an ancient basso-relievo , and published in the Admiranda . I have given examples from those pictures only of Raffaelle which we have among us , though many other instances might be produced of this great painters not disdaining assistance : indeed , his known wealth was so great , that he might borrow where he pleased without loss of credit . It may be remarked that this work of Masaccio , from which he has borrowed so freely , was a public work , and at no farther distance from Rome than Florence ; so that , if he had considerei it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he was well satisfied that his character for invention would be little afiected by such a discovery ; nor is it , except in the opinion of those who are ignorant of the manner in which great works are built . Those who steal from mere poverty ; who have nothing of their own , can not exist a minute without making such depredations ; who are so poor that they have no place in which they can even deposit what /z/ they have taken ; to men of this description nothing can be said . Raffaelle , as appears from what has been said , had carefully studied the works of Masaccio ; and , indeed , there was no other , if we except Michael Angelo , ( whom he Hkewise imitated , ) so worthy of his attention ; and , though his manner was dry and hard , his compositions formal , and not enough diversified , according to the custom of painters in that early period , yet his works possess that grandeur and simplicity which accompany , and even sometimes proceed from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarous state of the arts before his time , when skill in drawing was so little understood , that the best of the painters could not even foreshorten the foot , but every figure appeared to stand upon his toes ; and what served for drapery , had , from the hardness and smallness of the folds , too much the appearance of cords clinging round the body . He first introduced large drapery , flowing in an easy and natural manner ; indeed , he appears to be the first who discovered the path that leads to every excellence to which the art afterwards arrived , and may , therefore , be justly considered as one of the great fathers of modern art . Thouo'h I have been led on to a lonorer djo-res- sion respecting this great painter , than I intended , yet I can not avoid mentioning another excellence /z/ which he possessed in a very eminent degree ; he was as much distinguished among his contemporaries for dihgence and industry , as he was for the natural faculties of his mind . We are told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , and that he acquired the name of Masaccio , from his total disregard to his dress , his person , and all the common concerns of life . He is indeed a sio-nal instance of what well directed diligcence will do in a short time ; he lived but twenty-seven years , yet , in that short space , carried the art so far beyond what it had before reached , that he appears to stand alone as a model for his successors . Vassari gives a long catalogue of painters and sculptors , who formed their taste , and learned their art , by studying his works ; among those he names Michael Anoelo , Leonardo da Vinci , Pietro Perusrino , Raffaelle , Bartolomeo , Andrea del Sarto , II Rosso , and Piereno del Yaga . The habit of contemplating and brooding over the ideas of great geniuses , till you find yourself Avarmed by the contact , is the true method of forming an artist-like mind ; it is impossible , in the presence of those great men , to think or invent in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives those ideas only which relish of grandeur and simplicity . Besides the general advantage of forming the taste by such an intercourse , there is another of a /z/ particular kind , which was suggested to me by the practice of Raffaelle , when imitating the work of which I have been speaking . The figure of the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , is taken from the Fchx of Masaccio , though one is a front figure , and the other seen in profile ; the action is likewise somewhat changed , but it is plain Raffaelle had that figure in his mind . There is a circumstance , indeed , which I mention by the by , which marks it very particularly - Sergius Paulus wears a crown of laurel ; this is hardly reconcilable to strict propriety , and the costume , of which Raffaelle was in general a good observer ; but he found it so in Masaccio , and he did not bestow so much pains in disguise as to change it . It appears to me to be an excellent practice , thus to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those great painters to be statutes , and to give , as Raffaelle has here given , another view , taking care to preserve all the spirit and grace you find in the original . I should hope , from what has been lately said , that it is not necessary to guard myself against any supposition of recommending an entire dependence upon former masters ; I do not desire that you should get other people to do your business , or to think for you ; I only wish you to consult with , to call in , as counsellors , men the most distinguished for their knowledge and experience , the result of which counsel must ultimately depend on yourself Such /z/ conduct , in the commerce of life , has never been considered as disgraceful , or in any respect to imply intellectual imbecility ; it is a sign , rather , of the true wisdom , which feels individual imperfection , and is conscious to itself how much collective observation is necessary to fill the immense extent , and to comprehend the infinite variety of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise you only to take that assistance which every human being wants , and which , as appears from the examples that have been given , the greatest painters have not disdained to accept . Let me add , that the diligence required in the search , and the exertion subsequent in accommodating those ideas to your own purpose , is a business which idleness will not , and ignorance can not perform . But in order more distinctly to explain what kind of borrowing I mean , when I recommend so anxiously the study of the works of great masters , let us for a minute return again to Raffaelle , consider his method of practice , and endeavour to imitate him , in his manner of imitating others . The two figures of St. Paul , which I lately mentioned , are so nobly conceived by Masaccio , that perhaps it was not in the power of Raflaelle himself to raise and improve them , nor has he attempted it ; but he has had the address to change , in some measure , without diminishing the grandeur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sc- INVENTION AND DESIGN . 8t rene composed dignity , that animated expression which was necessary to the more active employment he has assigned them . In the same manner he has given more animation to the figure of Sergius Paul us , and to that which is introduced in the picture of St. Paul preaching , of which little more than hints are given by Masaccio , which Raffaelle has finished . The closing the eyes of this figure , which in Masaccio might be easily mistaken for sleeping , is not in the least ambiguous *in the cartoon ; his eyes , indeed , are closed , but they are closed with such vehemence , that the agitation of a mind , perplexed in the extreme , is seen at the first glance ; but what is most extraordinary , and I think particularly to be admired , is , that the same idea is continued through the whole figure , even to the drapery , which is so closely muffled about him , that even his hands are not seen : by this happy correspondence between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts , the figure appears to think , from head to foot . Men of superior talents alone are capable of thus using and adapting other men 's minds to their own purposes , or are able to make out and finish what was only in the original a hint or imperfect conception . A readiness in taking such hints , which escape the dull and ignorant , makes , in my opinion , no inconsiderable part of that faculty of the mind which is called genius . /z/ It often happens that hints may be taken and employed in a situation totally different from that in which they were originally employed . There is a figure of a Bacchante leaning backward , her head thrown quite behind her , which seems to be a favourite invention , as it is so frequently repeated in basso-relievos , cameos , and intaglios ; it is intended to express an enthusiastic frantic kind of joy . This figure Ba.ccio Bandenelli , in a drawing that I have of that master , of the Descent from the Cross , has adopted , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for one of the Mary 's to express frantic agony of grief . It is curious to observe , and it is certainly true , that the extremes of contrary passions are , with very little variation , expressed by the same action . If I were to recommend method in any part of the study of a painter , it would be in regard to invention ; that young students should not presume to think themselves qualified to invent , till they are acquainted with those stores of invention the world already possesses , and had by that means accumulated sufficient materials for the mind to work with . It would certainly be no improper method of forming the mind of a young artist , to begin with such exercises as the Italians call a pasticcio composition of the different excellencies which are dispersed in all other works of the same kind . It is not supposed that he is to stop here , but that he is to ac- /z/ quire by this means the art of selecting , first , what is truly excellent in art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a task which , without this previous study , he will be but ill qualified to perform . The doctrine which is here advanced , is acknowledged to be new , and to many may appear strange . But I only demand for it the reception of a stranger ; a favourable and attentive consideration , without that entire confidence which might be claimed under authoritative recommendation . After you have taken a figure , or any idea of a figure , from any of those great painters , there is another operation still remaining , which I hold to be indispensibly necessary ; that is , never to neglect finishing from nature every part of the work . What is taken from a model , though the first idea may have been suggested by another , you have a just right to consider as your own property . And here I can not avoid mentioning a circumstance in placing the model , though to some it may appear trifling . It is better to possess the model , with the attitude you require , than to place him with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model puts himself in an action superior to your own imagination . It is a great matter to be in the way of accident , and to be watchful and ready to take advantage of it ; besides , when you fix the position of a model , there is danger in putting him in an attitude into which no man would naturally fall . This ex- /z/ tends even to drapery . We must be cautious in touching and altering a fold of the stuff which serves as a model , for fear of giving it , inadvertently , a forced form ; and it is , perhaps , better to take the chance of another casual throw , than to alter the position in which it was at first accidentally cast . Rembrandt , in order to take the advantage of accident , appears often to have used the pallet-knife to lay his colours on the canvass , instead of the pencil . Whether it is the knife , or any other instrument , it suffices , if it is something that does not follow exactly the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how to take the advantage of its hints , will often produce bold and capricious beauties of handling and facility , such as he would not have thought of , or ventured , with his pencil , - under the regular restraint of his hand . However , this is fit only in occasions where no correctness of form is required , such as clouds , stumps of trees , rocks , or broken ground . Works produced in an accidental manner will have the same free unrestrained air as the works of nature , whose particular combinations seem to depend upon accident . I again repeat , you are never to lose sight of nature ; the instant you do , you are all abroad , at the mercy of every gust of fashion , without knowing or seeing the point to which you ought to steer . Whatever trips you make , you must still have na- /z/ ture in your eye . Let me recommend to you not to have too great dependence on your practice or memory , however strong those impressions may have been which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will be at last obliterated , unless they are continually refreshed and repaired . It is not uncommon to meet with artists who , from a long neglect of cultivating this necessary intimacy with nature , do not even know her when they see her ; she appearing a stranger to them , from their being so long habituated to their own representation of her . I have heard painters acknowledge , though in that acknowledgment no degradation of themselves was intended , that they could do better without nature than with her ; or , as they expressed it themselves , that it only put them out . A painter , with such ideas and such habits , is indeed , in a most helpless state . The art of seeing nature , or , in other words , the art of using models , is , in reality , the great object , the point to which all our studies are directed . As for the power of being able to do tolerably well , from practice alone , let it be valued according to its worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be sufficient for the production of correct , excellent , and finished pictures . Works deserving this character never were produced , nor ever will arise , from memory alone ; and 1 will venture to say , that an artist who brings /z/ to his work a mind tolerably furnished with the general principles of art , and a taste formed upon the works of good artists , in short who knows in what excellence consists , will , with the assistance of models , which we will likewise suppose he has I learnt the art of using , be an overmatch for the greatest painter that ever lived , who should be debarred such advantages . /z/ Du Piles has , in his note in this passage , given the measures of a human body , as taken by Fresnoy from the statues of the ancients , which are here transcribed : - " The ancients have commonly allowed eight heads to their figures , though some of them have but seven ; but we ordinarily divide the figures into ten faces , that is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot , in the following manner /z/ " From the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of a face . The face begins at the root of the lowest hairs which are upon the forehead , and ends at the bottom of the chin . The face is divided into three proportionable parts ; the first contains the forehead , the second the nose , and the third the mouth and the chin ; from the chin , to the pit betwixt the collar-bones , are two lengths of a nose . " From the pit , betwixt the collar-bones , to the bottom of the breast , one face . From the bottom of the breast to the navel , one face . " From the navel to the genitories , one face . /z/ " From the genitories to the upper part of the knee , two faces . " The knee contains half a face . " From the lower part of the knee to the ankle , two faces . " From the ankle to the sole of the foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms are stretched out , is , from the longest finojer of his rifht hand , to the longest of his left , as broad as he is long . " From one side of the breasts to the other , two faces . " The bone of the arm called humerus , is the length of two faces from the shoulder to the elbow . " From the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger , the bone called cubitus , with part of the hand , contains two faces . " From the bix of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar bones , one face . " If you would be satisfied in the measure of breadth , from the extremity of one finger to the other , so that this breadth should be equal to the length of the body , you must observe , that the bixes of the elbows , with the humerus , and of the humerus with the shoulder-blade , bear the proportion of half a face , when the arms are stretched out . The sole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The hand is the length of a face . rEIiSPECTlVE. 89 " The thumb contains a nose . * ' The inside of the arm , from the place the muscle disappears , which makes the breast , ( called the pectoral muscle , ) to the middle of the arm , four noses . * ' From the middle of the arm to the beginning of the head , five noses . " The longest toe is a nose long . " The two utmost parts of the teats ; and the pit betwixt the collar-bones of a woman , make an sequilateral triangle . * ' For the breadth of the limbs no precise measure can be given , because the measures themselves are changeable , according to the quality of the persons , and according to the movement of the muscles . " /z/ Fresnoy was not aware that he was arguing from the abuse of the art of perspective , the business of which is to represent objects as they appeared to the eye , or as they are delineated on a transparent plane placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , as well as all other rules , may be injudiciously applied ; and it must be acknowledged that a misapplication of them is but too frequently found even in the works of the most considerable artists . /z/ It is not uncommon to see a figure on the foreground represented near twice the size of another which is supposed to be removed but a few feet behind it ; this , though true according to rule , will appear monstrous . This error proceeds from placing the point of distance too near the point of sight , by which means the diminution of objects is so sudden , as to appear unnatural , unless you stand so near the picture as the point of distance requires , which would be too near for the eye to comprehend the whole picture ; whereas , if the point of distance is removed so far as the spectator may be supposed to stand , in order to see commodiously , and take within his view the whole , the figures behind would then sufter under no such violent diminution . /z/ Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as that mode of composition which cuts in the middle the figures in the foreground , though it was frequently the practice of the greatest painters , even of the best age : Michael Angelo has it in the crucifixion of St. Peter ; Rafl ? aelle in the cartoon of the preaching of St. Paul ; and Parmigianino often showed only the head and shoulders above the base of the picture . However , the more modern painters , notwithstanding such authorities , can not be accused of having fallen into this error . /z/ But , suppose we carry the reformation still farther , and that we do not suffer the sides of the picture to cut off any part of the figures , the composition would certainly be more round and compact within itself . All subjects , it is true , will not admit of this ; however , we may safely recommend it , unless the circumstances are very particular , and such as are certain to produce some striking effect by the breach of so just a rule . /z/ Nothing in the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of discrimination which may not improperly be called genius , than the steering between general ideas and individuality ; for though the body of the work must certainly be composed by the first , in order to communicate a character of grandeur to the whole , yet a dash of the latter is sometimes necessary to give an interest . An individual model , copied with scrupulous exactness , makes a mean style , like the Dutch ; and the neglect of an actual model , and the method of proceeding solely from idea , has a tendency to make the painter degenerate into a mannerist . In order to keep the mind in repair , it is necessary to replace and refreshen those impressions of nature which are continually wearing away . A circumstance mentioned in the life of Guido is // well worth the attention of artists . He was asked from whence he borrowed his idea of beauty , which is acknowledged superior to that of any other painter ; he said he would show all the models he used , and ordered a common porter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance . This was undoubtedly an exaggeration of his conduct ; but his intention was to show that he thought it necessary for painters to have some model of nature before them , however they might deviate from it , and correct it from the idea of perfect beauty which they have formed in their minds . In painting it is far better to have a model even to depart from , than to have nothing fixed and certain to determine the idea . When there is a model , there is something to proceed on , something to be corrected ; so that even supposing no part is adopted , the model has still been not without use . Such habits of intercourse with nature , will , at least , create that variety which will prevent any one J , from prognosticating , on being informed of the subject , what manner of work the painter is likely to produce , which is the most disagreeable character an artist can have . /z/ When the picture consists of a single figure only , that fifTure must be contrasted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines ; it should be as much as possible a composition of itself . It may be remarked , that such a complete figure will never unite or make part of a group ; as , on the other hand no figure of a well-conducted group will stand by itself . A composition , where every figure is such as I suppose a single figure ought to be , and those likewise contrasted to each other , which is not uncommon in the works of young artists , produces such an assemblage of artifice and affectation as is in the highest degree unnatural and disgustful . There is another circumstance which , though not improper in single figures , ought never to be practised in historical pictures ; that of representing any figure as looking out of the picture , that is , looking at the person who views the picture . This conduct in history gives an appearance to that figure of having no connection with the rest ; and ought , therefore , never to be practised except in ludicrous subjects . It is not certain that the variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , be extended to colouring . The difficulty will be in diffusing the colours of the drapery of this single figure to other distant parts of the picture , for this is what harmony requires ; this difficulty , however , seems to be evaded in the works of Titian , Vandyck , and /z/ many others , by dressing their single figures in black or white . Vandyck , in the famous portrait of Cardinal Bentivoglio , was confined in his dress to crimson velvet and white linen ; he has , therefore , made the curtain in the background of the same crimson colour , and the white is diffused by a letter which lies on the table ; and a bunch of flowers is likewise introduced for the same purpose . /z/ EvEPcY part which goes to the composition of a picture , even inanimate objects , are capable , to a certain degree , of conveying sentiment , and contribute their share to the general purpose of striking the imagination of the spectator . The disposition of light , or the folding of drapery , wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole work . /z/ A PAINTER , whatever he may feel , will not be able to express it on canvass , without having recourse to a recollection of those principles by which the passion required is expressed . The mind thus occupied , is not likely , at the same time , to be possessed with the passion which he is representing . An image may be ludicrous , and in its first conception make the painter laugh , as well as the spec- /z/ tator ; but the difficulty of his art makes the painter , in the course of his work , equally grave and serious , whether he is employed on the most ludicrous , or the most solemn subject . However , we may , without great violence , suppose this rule to mean no more than that a sensibility is required in the artist , so that he should be capable of conceiving the passion properly before he sets about reprinting it on canvass. /z/ From the various ancient paintings which have come down to us , we may form a judgment with tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst the ancients . There can be no doubt , but that the same correctness of design was required from the painter as from the sculptor ; and if what has happened in regard to their paintings , and we had the good fortune to possess what the ancients themselves esteemeed their masterpieces , I have no doubt but we should find their figures as correctly drawn as the Laocoon , and probably coloured like Titian . What disposes me to think higher of their colouring than any remains of ancient painting will warrant , is the account which Pliny gives of the mode of operation used by Apelles ; that over his finished picture he spread a transparent liquid like ink , of which the effect was to give brilliancy , and at the same time to lower /z/ the two great glare of the colour . This custom , or mode of operation , implies , at least , a true taste of that in which the excellence of colouring consists ; which does not proceed from fine colours , but true colours ; from breaking down these fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep toned brightness . Perhaps the manner in which CorregGio practised the art of glazing was still more like that of Apelles , which was only perceptible to those who looked close to the picture , ad manum intuenti demuna ajjpareret ; whereas , in Titian , and still more in Bassan , and others , his imitators , it was apparent on the slightest inspection . Artists , who may not approve of glazing , must still acknowledge , that this practice is not that of ignorance . Another circumstance , that tends to prejudice me in favour of their colouring , is the account we have of some of their principal painters using but four colours only . I am convinced the fewer the colours , the clearer will be the effect of those colours , and that four are sufficient to make every combination required . Two colours mixed together will not preserve the brightness of either of them single , nor will three be as bright as two ; of this observation , simple as it is , an artist , who wishes to colour bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving peculiar expression , no correct judgment can be formed ; but we can not well sup- /z/ pose that men who were capable of giving that general grandeur of character which so eminently distinguishes their works in sculpture , were incapable of expressing peculiar passions . As to the enthusiastic commendations bestowed on them by their contemporaries , consider them as no weight . The best words are always employed to praise the best works ; admiration often proceeds from ignorance of higher excellence . What they appear to have most failed in is composition , both in regard to the grouping of their figures , and the art of disposing the light and shadow in masses . It is apparent that this , which makes so considerable a part of modern art , was to them totally unknown . If the great painters had possessed this excellence , some portion of it would have infalhblv been diffused , and have been discoverable in the works of the inferior rank of artists , such as those whose works have come down to us , and which may be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our public gardens . Supposing our modern pictures of this rank only were preserved for the inspection of connoisseurs two thousand years hence , the general principles of composition would be still discoverable in those pieces ; however feebly executed , there would be seen an attempt to a union of the figure with its ground , and some idea of disposing both the figures and the lights in groups . /z/ Now as nothing of this appears in what we have of ancient painting , we may conclude that this part of the art was totally neglected , or more probably unknown . They might , however , have produced single figures which approached perfection , both in drawing and colouring ; they might excel in a solo , ( in the language of musicians , ) though they were probably incapable of composing a full piece for a concert of different instruments . /z/ The same right judgment which proscribes two equal lights , forbids any two objects to be introduced of equal magnitude or force , so as to appear to be competitors for the attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it quite so common to extend the rule so far as it ought to be extended . Even in colours , whether of the warm or cold kind , there should be one of each which should be apparently principal and predominant of the rest . It must be observed , even in drapery ; two folds of the same drapery must not be of equal magnitude . /z/ The means by which the painter works , and on which the effect of his picture depends , are light and shade , warm and cold colours . That there is /z/ an art in the management and disposition of those means will be easily granted ; and it is equally certain , that this art is to be acquired by a careful examination of the works of those who have excelled in it . I shall here set down the result of the observations which I have made on the works of those artists , who appear to have best understood the management of light and shade , and who may be considered as examples for imitation in this branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were among the first painters who reduced to a system what was before practised without any fixed principle , and consequently neglected occasionally . From the Venetian painter , Rubens extracted his scheme of composition , which was soon understood and adopted by his countrymen , and extended even to the minor painters of familiar life in the Dutch school . When I was at Venice , the method I took to avail myself of their principles was this . When I observed an extraordinary effect of light and shade in any picture , I took a leaf of my pocket-book , and darkened every part of it in the same gradation of light and shade as the picture , leaving the white paper untouched to represent the light , and this without any attention to the subject or the drawing : of the figures . A few trials of this kind /z/ // will be sufficient to give the method of their conduct in the manaaement of their liojhts . After a few experiments , I found the paper blotted nearly alike . Their general practice appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the light , including in this portion both the principal and secondary lights , another quarter to be as dark as possible , and the remaining half kept in mezzotint or half shadow . Rubens appears to have admitted rather more light than a quarter , and Rembrandt much less , scarce an eighth ; by this conduct Rembrandt 's light is extremely brilliant , but it costs too much - the rest of the picture is sacrificed to this one object . That light will certainly appear the brightest which is surrounded with the greatest quantity of shade , supposing equal skill in the artist . By this means you may likewise remark the various forms and shapes of those lights , as well as the objects in which they are flung - whether a figure , or the sky , a white napkin , animals , or utensils , often introduced for this purpose only . It may be observed , likewise , what portion is strongly relieved , and how much is united with its ground ; for it is necessary that some part , ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cutting against its ground , whether it be light on a dark , or dark on a light ground , in order to give firmness and distinctness to the work . If , on the other /z/ hand , it is relieved on every side , it will appear as if inlaid on its ground . Such a blotted paper , held at a distance from the eye , will strike the spectator as something excellent for the disposition of light and shadow , though he does not distinguish whether it is a history , a portrait , a landscape , dead game , or any thing else ; for the same principles extend to every branch of the art . Whether I have given an exact account , or made a just division of the quantity of light admitted into the works of those painters , is of no very great consequence ; let every person examine and judge for himself ; it will be sufficient if I have suggested a mode of examining pictures this way , and one means at least of acquiring the principles on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to acquire that harmonious efiect of colours , which was recommended for the acquisition of light and shade - the adding colours to the darkened paper ; but as those are not always at hand , it may be sufficient , if the picture which you think worthy of imitating be considered in this light , to ascertain the quantity of warm , and the quantity of cold colours . The predominant colours of the picture ought to be of a warm , mellow kind , red or yellow ; and no more cold colour should be introduced than will be /z/ just enough to serve as a ground or foil , to set off and give value to the mellow colours , and never should itself be a principal . For this purpose a quarter of the picture will be sufficient . Those cold colours , whether blue , grey , or green , are to be dispersed about the ground or surrounding parts of the picture , whether it has the appearance of wanting such a foil , but sparingly employed m the masses of light . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those painters who have excelled in harmony , will , by degrees , give a correctness of eye that will revolt at discordant colours , as a musician 's ear revolts at discordant sounds , /z/ By a story told of Rubens , we have his authority for asserting , that to the effect of the picture the background is of the greatest consequence . Rubens being desired to take under his instructions a young painter , the person who recommended him , in order to induce Rubens the more readily to take him , said , that he was already somewhat advanced in the art , and that he would be of immediate assistance in his backgrounds . Rubens smiled at his simplicity , and told him that if the youth was capable ijf painting his backgrounds , he stood in no need of his instructions ; that the regulation and management of them re- /z/ quired the most comprehensive knowledge of the art . This painters know to be no exaggerated account of a background , being fully apprised how much the effect of the picture depends upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as not to have the appearance of being inlaid , like Holbein 's portraits , which are often on a bright green or blue ground . To prevent this effect , the ground must partake of the colour of the figure ; or , as expressed in a subsequent line , receive all the treasures of the pallette . The background regulates likewise where and in what part the figure is to be relieved . When the form is beautiful , it is to be seen distinctly ; when , on the contrary , it is uncouth or too angular , it may be lost in the ground . Sometimes a light is introduced , in order to join and extend the light on the figure , and the dark side of the figure is lost in a still darker background ; for the fewer the outlines are which cut against the ground , the richer will be the effect , as the contrary produces what is called the dry manner . One of the arts of supplying the defect of a scantiness of dress , by means of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by VanDYCK , which is in the cabinet of the Duke of Montasru . The dress of this fisjure would have had an ungraceful effect ; he has , therefore , by means of a light background opposed to the light of the figure , and by the help of a curtain that catches the light /z/ near the figure , made the effect of the whole together , full and rich to the eye . /z/ All the modes of harmony , or of producing that effect of colours which is required in a picture , may be reduced to three , two of which belong to the grand style , and the other to the ornamental . The first may be called the Roman manner , where the colours are of a full and strong body , such as are found in the Transfiguration ; the next is that harmony which is produced by what the ancients called the corruption of the colours , by mixing and breaking them till there is a general union in the whole , without any thing that shall bring to your remembrance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be called the Bolognian style , and it is this hue and effect of colours which Lodovico Carraci seems to have endeavoured to produce , though he did not carry it to that perfection which we have seen since his time , in the small works of the Dutch school , particularly Jan Steen , where art is completely concealed , and the painter , like a great orator , never draws the attention from the subject on himself . The last manner belongs properly to the ornamental style , which we call the Venetian , being first practised at Venice , but is perhaps better learned from Rubens . Here the brightest colours possible are admitted , W4th the two extremes of THE modj:s of harmony . 105 warm and cold , and those reconciled by being dispersed over the picture , till the whole appears like a bunch of flowers . As I have given instances from the Dutch school , where the art of breaking colour may be learned , we may recommend here an attention to the works of Watteau , for excellence in this florid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some general rules , that must never be neglected . First , that the same colour which makes the largest mass be diffused , and appear to revive in different parts of the picture ; for a single colour will make a spot or blot . Even the dispersed flesh colour , which the faces and hands make , requires a principal mass , which is best produced by a naked figure ; but where the subject will not allow of this , a drapery approaching to flesh colour will answer the purpose , as in the Transfiguration , where a woman is clothed in drapery of this colour , which makes a principal to all the heads and hands of the picture ; and , for the sake of harmony , the colours , however distinguished in their light , should be nearly the same in their shadows , of a " Simple unity of shade , As all were from one single palette spread ; " and to give the utmost force , strength and solidity to the work , some part of the picture should be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ extremes are then to be harmonized and reconciled to each other . Instances where both of them are used may be observed in two pictures of Rubens , which are equally eminent for the force and brilliancy of their effect . One is in the cabinet of the Duke of Rutland , and the other in the chapel of Rubens , at Antwerp , which serves as his monument . In both these pictures he has introduced a female figure dressed in black satin , the shadows of which are as dark as pure black , opposed to the contrary extreme of brightness , can make them . If to these different manners we add one more , that in which a silver-grey or pearly tint is predominant , I believe every kind of harmony that can be produced by colours will be comprehended . One of fhe greatest examples in this mode is the famous Marriage at Cana , in St. George 's Church at Venice , where the sky , which makes a very considerable part of the picture , is of the brightest blue colour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the same key , wrought from this high pitch . We see likewise many pictures of GuiDo in this tint , and indeed those that are so are in his best manner . Female figures , angels and children were the subjects in which GuiDo more particularly succeeded ; and to such the cleanness and neatness of this tint perfectly* corresponds , and contributes not a little to that /z/ exquisite beauty and delicacy which so much distinguishes his works . To see this style in perfection , we must again have recourse to the Dutch school , Vandervelde and the young Teniers , whose pictures are valued by the connoisseurs in proportion as they possess this excellence of a silver tint . Which of these different styles ought to be preferred , so as to meet every man 's idea , would be difficult to determine , from the predilection which every man has to that mode which is practised by the school in which he has been educated ; but if any preeminence is to be given , it must be to that manner which stands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Venitian , or rather the manner of Titian , which , simply considered as producing an effect of colours , will certainly eclipse with its splendour whatever is brought into competition with it . But , as I hinted before , if female delicacy and beauty be the principal object of the painter 's aim , the purity and clearness of the tint of Guido will correspond better , and more contribute to produce it than even the glowing tint of Titian . The rarity of excellence in any of these styles of colouring sufficiently shows the difficulty of succeeding in them . It may be worth the artist 's attention , while he is in this pursuit , particularly to guard against those errors which seem to be annexed to or divided by their partitions from their /z/ neighbouring excellence . Thus when he is endeavouring to acquire the Roman style , if he is not extremely careful , he falls into a hard and dry manner . The flowery colouring is nearly allied to the gaudy effect of fan painting . The simplicity of the Bolognian style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That of Titian , which may be called the golden manner , when unskilfully managed , becomes what the painters call foxy ; and the silver degenerates into the leaden and heavy manner . None of them , to be perfect in their way , will bear any union with each other ; if they are not distinctly separated the effect of the picture will be feeble and insipid , without any mark or distinguished character . /z/ It is indeed a rule adopted by many painters , to admit in no part of the background , or on any object in the picture , shadows of equal strength with those which are employed on the principal figure ; but this produces a false representation . With deference to our author , to have the strong light and shadow there alone is not to produce the best natural effect , nor is it authorized by the practice of those painters who are most distinguished for harmony of colouring ; a conduct , therefore , totally contrary to this , is absolutely necessary , that /z/ the same strength , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . I am no enemy to dark shadows . The general deficiency to be observed in the works of the painters of the last age , as well as indeed of many of the present , is a feebleness of effect ; they seem to be too much afraid of those midnight shadows , which alone give the power of nature , and without which a picture will appear like one wholly wanting solidity and strength . The lightest and gayest style requires this foil to give it force and brilliancy. /z/ Taste will be unavoidably regulated by what is continually before the eyes . It were therefore well if young students could be debarred the sight of any works that were not free from gross faults , till they had well formed , and , as I may say , hardened their judgment . They might then be permitted to look about them , not only without fear of vitiating their taste , but even with advantage ; and would often find great ingenuity and extraordinary invention in works which are under the influence of a bad taste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to give a true representation of whatever object presents itself , just as it appears to the eye , so as to /z/ amount to a deception ; and the geometric rules of perspective are included in this study . This is the language of the art , which appears the more necessary to be taught early , from the natural repugnance which the mind has to such mechanical labour , after it has acquired a relish for its higher departments . The next step is to acquire a knowledge of the beauty of form . For this purpose he is recommended to the study of the Grecian sculpture ; and for composition , colouring and expression , to the great works at Rome , Venice , Parma and Bologna . He begins now to look for those excellencies which address themselves to the imagination , and considers deception as a scaffolding to be now thrown aside , as of no importance to this finished fabric . /z/ The INVENTION of a painter consists not only in inventing the subject , but in a capacity of forming in his imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though wholly borrowed from poets , historians , or popular tradition . For this purpose he has full as much to do , and perhaps more , than if the very story was invented ; for he is bound to follow the ideas which he has received , and to translate them ( if I may use the expression ) into another art . In this translation the painter 's INVENTION . Ill invention lies ; he must in a manner new cast the whole , and model it in his own imagination to make it a painter 's nourishment ; - it must pass through a painter 's mind . Having received an idea of the pathetic and grand in intellect , he has next to consider how to make it correspond with what is touching and awful to the eye , which is a business by itself . But here begins what in the language of painters is called Invention , which includes not only the composition , or the putting the whole together , and the disposition of every individual part , but likewise the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attitude of every figure or animal that is introduced , or makes a part of the work . Composition , which is the principal part of the invention of a painter , is by far the greatest difficulty he has to encounter . Every man that can paint at all , can execute individual parts ; but to keep those parts in due subordination as relative to a whole , requires a comprehensive view of the art , that more strongly implies genius , than perhaps any other quality whatever . /z/ Then let the virgin canvas smooth expand , To claim the sketch and tempt the artist 's hand . I wish to understand the last line as recommending to the artist to paint the sketch previously on canvas , as was the practice with Rubens . /z/ This method of painting the sketch , instead of merely drawing it on paper , will give a facility in the management of colours , and in the handling , which the Italian painters , not having this custom wanted ; by habit , he will acquire equal readiness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one . A painter should paint all his studies , and consider drawing only as a succedaneum , when colours are not at hand . This was the practice of the Venitian painters , and of all those who have excelled in colourinsc . The method of Rubens was to sketch his composition in colours , with all the parts more determined than sketches generally are ; from this sketch , his scholars advanced the picture as far as they were capable ; after which , he retouched the whole himself . The painter 's operation may be divived into three parts ; the planning , which implies the sketch of the general composition ; the transferring that design to the canvass ; and the finishing or retouching the whole . If , for despatch , the artist looks out for assistance , it is in the middle stage only he can receive it ; the first and last operation must be the work of his own hand . /z/ Though the painter borrows his subject , he considers his art as not subservient to any other . His business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanatory figures ; as soon as he takes it into his hands , he adds , retouches , transposes , and moulds it anew , till it is made fit for his own art ; he avails himself of the privileges allowed to poets and painters , and dares every thing to accomplish his ends , by means correspondent to that end , to impress the spectator with the same interest at the sight of his representation , as the poet has contrived to impress on the reader by his description : the end is the same in both cases , though the means are and must be different . Ideas different , to be conveyed to the mind by one sense , can not always , with equal success , be conveyed by another . Even the historian takes great liberties with facts , in order to interest his readers , and makes his narrative more delightful ; much greater right has the painter to do this , who , though his work is called History-Painting , gives in reality a practical representation of events . As it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of different ages , but of different forms and characters , be introduced in a work where many figures are required , care must be taken that those different characters have a certain consonance of parts among themselves , such as is generally found in nature ; a fat face , for instance , is usually accompanied with a proportional degree of corpulency of body ; an aquiline nose for the most part , belongs to a thin countenance , with a /z/ body and limbs corresponding to it ; but these are observations which must occur to every body . Yet there are others that are not so obvious ; and those who have turned their thoughts this way , may form a probable conjecture concerning the form of the rest of the figure from a part , from the fingers , or from a single feature of the face ; for instance , those who are born crook-backed , have commonly a peculiar form of lips and expression in the mouth , that strongly denotes that deformity. /z/ The highest finishing is labour in vain , unless at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shadow ; it is a quality , therefore , that is more frequently recommended to students , and insisted upon , than any other whatever ; and , perhaps , for this reason , because it is most apt to be neglected , the attention of the artist being so often entirely absorbed in the detail . To illustrate this , we may have recourse to Titian 's bunch of grapes , which we will suppose to be placed , so as to receive a broad light and shadow . Here , though each individual grape on the light side has its light and shadow , and reflection , yet altogether they make but one broad mass of light . The slightest sketch , therefore , where this breadth is preserved , will have a better effect , will have more the appearance of coming from a mas- THE oriNION OF OTHERS . 115 ter hand , that is , in other words , will have more the characteristic and generale of nature , than the most laborious finishing , when this breadth is lost or neglected . /z/ There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unlearned , who if they can be induced to speak their real sensations , would not be profitable to the artist . The only opinions of which no use can be made , are those of half learned connoisseurs , who have quitted nature and have not acquired art . That same sagacity which makes a man excel in his profession , must assist him in the proper use to be made of the judgment of the learned , and the opinions of the vulgar . Of many things , the vulgar are as competent judges as the most learned connoisseur ; of the portrait , for instance , of an animal ; or , perhaps , of the truth of the representations of some vulgar passion . It must be expected , that the untaught vulgar will carry with them the same want of right taste in the judgment they make of the effect or character in a picture as they do in life , and prefer a strutting figure and gaudy colours to the grandeur of simplicity ; but if this same vulgar person , or even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a shade , it might be apprehended that the shadow was not the true colour of nature , with /z/ almost as much certainty as if the observation had been made by the most able connoisseur . /z/ However admirable his taste may be , he is but half a painter who can only conceive his subjects , and is without knowledge of the mechanical part of his art ; as on the other hand , his skill may be said to be thrown away , who has employed his colours on subjects that create no interest from their beauty , their character , or expression . One part often absorbs the whole mind to the neglect of the rest : the young student whilst at Rome , studying the works of Michael Angelo and RafFaelle , are apt to lose all relish for any kind of excellence , except what is found in their works . Perhaps going afterwards to Venice , they may be induced to think there are other things required , and that nothing but the most superlative excellence in design , character , and dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamental graces of the art . Excellence must of course be rare ; and one of the causes of its rarity , is the necessity of uniting qualities which in their nature are contrary to each other ; and yet no approaches can be made towards perfection without it . Every art or profession requires this union of contrary qualities , like the harmony of colouring , which is produced by an opposition of hot and cold hues . /z/ The poet and the painter must unite to the warmth that accompanies a poetical imagination , patience and perseverance , the one in counting syllables and toiling for a rhyme , and the other in labouring the minute parts , and finishing the detail of his works , in order to produce the great effect he desires ; they must both possess a comprehensive mind that takes in the whole at one view , and at the same time an accuracy of eye or mind that distinguishes between two things , that to an ordinary spectator appear the same , whether this consists in tints or words , or the nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally used in a bad sense , to imply a predilection , not founded on reason or nature , . in favour of a particular master , or a particular manner , and therefore ought to be opposed with all our force ; but totally to eradicate in advanced age what has so much assisted us in our youth , is a point to which we can not hope to arrive . The difficulty of conquering this prejudice is to be considered in the number of those causes which makes excellence so very rare . Whoever would make a rapid progress in any art or science , must begin by having great confidence in , and even prejudice in favour of his instructions ; but to continue to think him infallible , /z/ would be continuing for ever in a state of infancy . It is impossible to draw a line , where the artist shall begin to dare to examine and criticise the works of his master , or of the greatest master-pieces of art ; we can only say , that his progress to this capacity will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excellence of the naasters , he esteems , in proportion as he comes ex  - -  actly to distinguish in what that excellence consists , and refer it to some precise rule and fixed standard ; in that proportion , he becomes free . When he has once laid hold of their ' principle , he will see when they deviate from it , or fail to come up to it ; so that it is in reality through his extreme admiration of , and blind deference to these masters , ( without which he never would have employed an intense application to discover the rule and scheme of their works , ) that he is enabled , if I may use the expression , to emancipate himself even to get above them , and to become the judge of those of whom he was at first the humble disciple . In heroic subjects it will not , I hope , appear too great a refinement of criticism to say , that the want of naturalness or deception of the act , which gives to an inferior style its whole value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as represented by Julio Romano , giving provender to the horses of the sun , would not strike the imagination more forcibly from their being coloured /z/ with the psncil of Rubens , though he would have represented them more naturally ; but might he not possibly , by that very act , have brought them down from the celestial state to the rank of mere terrestrial animals ? In these things , however , I admit there will always be a degree of uncertainty . Who knows that Julio Romano , if he had possessed the art and practice of colouring like Rubens , would not have given to it some taste of poetical grandeur not yet attained to ? The same familiar naturalness would be equally an imperfection in characters which are to be represented as demi-gods , or something above humanity . Though it would be far from an addition to the merit of those two great painters to have made their works deceptions ; yet there can be no reason why they might not , in some degree , and with a judicious caution and selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Venitian , Flemish , and even Dutch Schools , and which have been inculcated in this poem . There are some of them which are not in absolute contradiction to any style ; the happy disposition , for instance , of light and shade ; the preservation of breadth in the masses of colours ; the union of these with their grounds ; and the harmony arising from a due mixture of hot and cold hues , with many other excellencies , not inseparably connected with /z/ that individuality which produces deception , would surely not counteract the effect of the grand style ; they would only contribute to the case of the spectator , by making the vehicle pleasing by which ideas are conveyed to the nnind , which otherwise might be perplexed and bewildered with a confused assemblage of objects ; they would add a certain degree of grace and sweetness to thought and grandeur . Though the merits of those two great painters are of such transcendency as to make us overlook their deficiency , yet a subdued attention to these inferior excellencies must be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is often recommended by writers on the theory of painting , instead of advancing the art , is in reality carrying it back to its infant state ; the first essays of painting were certainly nothing but mere imitation of individual objects , and when this amounted to a deception , the artist had accomplished his purpose . And here I must observe , that the arts of painting and poetry seem to have no kind of resemblance in their early stages . The first , or at least the second stage of poetry in every nation , is removed as far as possible from common life ; every thing is of the marvellous kind ; it treats only of heroes , wars , ghosts , enchantments , and transformations . The poet could not expect to seize and captivate the attention , if he related only common occur- /z/ rences , such as every day produces . Whereas , the painter exhibited what then appeared a great effort of art , by merely giving the appearance of reUef to a flat superficies , however uninteresting in itself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same entertainment was required from painting , which had been experienced in poetry . The mind and imagination were to be satisfied , and required to be amused and delighted , as well as the eye ; and when the art proceeded to a still higher degree of excellence , it was then found that this deception not only did not assist , but even in a certain degree counteracted the flight of imagination ; hence proceeded the Roman school ; and it is from hence that Raftaelle , Michael Angelo , and Julio Romano stand in that prominence of rank in which Fresnoy has justly placed them . /z/ Nature is in reality the beginning and the end of theory . It is in nature only we can find that beauty which is the great object of our search ; it can be found nowhere else ; we can no more form any idea of beauty superior to nature , than we can form an idea of a sixth sense , or any other excellence out of the limits of the human mind . We are forced to confine our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see in this world ; even the Supreme Being , if he is repre-/z/ sented at all , the painter has no other way of representing , than by reversing the decree of the inspired lawgiver , and making God after his own image . Nothing can be so unphilosophical , as a supposition that we can form any idea of beauty or excellence out of or beyond nature , which is and must be the fountain-head , from whence all our ideas must be derived . This being acknowledged , it must follow , of course , that all the rules which this theory , or any other , teaches , can be no more than teaching the art of seeing nature . The rules of art are formed on the various works of those who have studied nature the most successfully ; by this advantage , of observing the various manners in which various minds have contemplated her works , the artist enlarges his own views , and is taught to look for and see what otherwise would have escaped his observation . It is to be remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which refers for its truth to the sensations of the mind , and the other to the eye . Some schools , such as the Roman and Florentine , appear to have addressed themselves principally to the mind ; others solely to the eye , such as the Venitian in the instances of Paul Veronese and Tintoret ; others again have endeavoured to /z/ unite both , by joining the elegance and grace of ornament with the strength and vigour of design - such are the schools of Bologna and Parma . All those schools are equally to be considered as followers of nature . He who produces a work analogous to the mind or imagination of man , is as natural a painter as he whose works are calculated to delight the eye ; the works of Michael Angelo or Julio Romano , in this sense , may be said to be as natural as those of the Dutch painters . The study , therefore , of the nature or affections of the mind is as necessary to the theory of the higher department of the art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eye is to the lower style . What relates to the mind or imagination , such as invention , character , expression , grace or grandeur , certainly can not be taught by rules ; little more can be done than pointing out where they are to be found . It is a part which belongs to general education , and will operate in proportion to the cultivation of the mind of the artist . The greater part of the rules in this work are , therefore , necessarily confined to what relates to the eye ; and it may be remarked , that none of those rules make any pretensions towards improving nature , or going contrary to her work ; their tendency is merely to show what is truly nature . Thus , for instance , a flowing outline is recom- /z/ mended , because beauty , ( which alone is nature , ) can not be produced without it . Old age or leanness produces strnight lines , corpulency round lines ; but in a state of health , accompanying youth , the outlines are waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told to avoid the chalk , the brick or leaden colour , it is because real flesh never partakes of those hues , though ill-coloured pictures are always inclinable to one or other of those defects . Rules are to be considered likewise as fences , placed only where trespass is expected , and are particularly enforced in proportion as peculiar faults or defects are prevalent at the time or age in which they are delivered ; for what may be proper strongly to recommend or enforce in one age , may not with equal propriety be so much laboured in another , when it may be the fashion for artists to run into the contrary extreme , proceeding from prejudice to a manner adopted by some favourite painter then in vogue . When it is recommended to preserve a breadth of colour or light , it is not intended that the artist is to work broader than nature ; but this lesson is insisted on because we know , from experience , that the contrary is a fault which artists are apt to be guilty of , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forget that breadth /z/ which is observable only when the eye takes in the effect of the whole . Thus again , we recommend to paint soft and tender , to make a harmony and union of colouring ; and for this end , that all the shadows shall be nearly of the same colour . The reason of these precepts being at all enforced , proceeds from the disposition which artists have to paint harder than nature , to make the outline more cutting against the ground , and to have less harmony and union than is found in nature , preserving the same brightness of colour in the shadows as are seen in the lights ; both these false manners of representing nature were the practice of the painters when the art was in its infancy , and would be the practice now of every student who was left to himself , and had never been taught the art of seeing nature . There are other rules which may be said not so much to relate to the objects represented as to the eye ; but the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , and proceed from the necessity there is that the work should be seen with ease dnd satisfaction ; to this end are all the rules that relate to grouping , and the disposition of light and shade . With regard to precepts about moderation and avoiding extremes , little is to be drawn from them . The rule would be too minute that had any exactness at all ; a multiplicity of exceptions would arise , /z/ SO that the teacher would be for ever saying too much , and yet never enough . When a student is instructed to mark with precision every part of his figure , whether it be naked or in drapery , he yjrobably becomes hard ; if , on the contrary , he is told to paint in the most tender manner , possibly he becomes insipid . But among extremes some are more tolerable than others ; of the two extremes I have just mentioned , the hard manner is the most pardonable - carrying with it an air of learning , as if the artist knew with precision the true form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy a hand . In every part of the human figure , when not spoiled by two great corpulency , will be found this distinctness , the parts never appearing uncertain or confused , or , as a musician would say , slurred , and all those smaller parts , which are comprehended in the larger compartment , are still to be there , however tenderly marked . To conclude , in all minute , detailed and practical excellence , general precepts must be either deficient or unnecessary ; for the rule is not known , nor is it indeed to any purpose a rule , if it be necessary to inculcate it on everv occasion . /z/ True Poetry the Painter 's power displays ; True Painting emulates the Poet 's lays ; The rival sisters , fond of equal fame , Alternate change their office and their name ; Bid silent Poetry the canvas warm , The tuneful page with speaking picture charm .

Till this be learn 'd , how all things disagree ! How all one wretched , blind barbarity ! The fool to native ignorance confin 'd . No beauty beaming on his clouded mind ; Untaught to relish , yet too proud to learn . He scorns the grace his dulness ca n't discern . Hence reason to caprice resigns the stage . And hence that maxim of the ancient iSage , " Of all vain fools with coxcomb talents curst , " Bad Painters and bad Poets are the worst . " When first the orient rays of beauty move The conscious soul , they light the lamp of love ; Love wakes those warm desires that prompt our chace . To follow and to fix each flying grace : But earth-born graces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tho ' our casual glance may sometimes meet /z/ With charms that strike the soul , and seem complete , Yet if those charms too closely we define . Content to copy nature line for line , Our end is lost . Not such the Master 's care . Curious he culls the perfect from the fair ; Judge of his art , thro ' beauty 's realm he flies . Selects , combines , improves , diversifies ; With nimble step pursues the fleeting throng , And clasps each Venus as she glides along . Yet some there are who indiscreetly stray , Where purblind practice only points the way ; Who every theoretic truth disdain . And blunder on mechanically vain . Some too there are , within whose languid breasts A lifeless heap of embryo knowledge rests . When nor the pencil feels their drowsy art . Nor the skill 'd hand explains the meaning heart . In chains of sloth such talents droop confin 'd : ' T was not by words Apelles charm 'd mankind . Hear then the Muse ; tho ' perfect beauty towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she strive some leading rules to draw From sovereign Nature 's universal law ; Stretch her wide view o'er ancient Art 's domain , Again establish Reason 's legal reign . Genius again correct with science sage , And curb luxuriant fancy 's headlong rage . " Right ever reigns its stated bounds between , " And taste , like morals , loves the golden mean . " Some lofty theme let judgment first supply , Supremely fraught with grace and majesty ; For fancy copious , free to every charm That lines can circumscribe or colours warm ; Still happier , if that artful theme dispense A poignant moral and instructive sense . Then let the virgin canvas smooth expand . To claim the sketch and tempt the Artist 's hand : Then , bold Invention , all the powers diffuse , Of all thy sisters thou the noblest Muse : Thee every art , thee every grace inspires . Thee PhcBbus fills with all his brightest fires . Choose such judicious force of shade and light As suite the theme , and satisfies the sight ; /z/ Weigh part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all thy tints descry ; And those , those only on the canvas place , Whose hues are social , whose effect is grace . Vivid and faithful to the historic page . Express the customs , manners , forms , and age ; Nor paint conspicuous on the foremost plain Whate'er is false , impertinent , or vain ; But like the Tragic Muse , thy lustre throw , Where the chief action claims its warmest glow . This rare , this arduous task no rules can teach , No skill 'd preceptor point , no practice reach ; ' T is taste , ' t is genius , ' t is the heav'nly ray Prometheus ravish 'd from the car of day . /z/ Learn then from Greece , ye youths , Proportion 's law , Inform 'd by her , each just Position draw ; Skilful to range each large unequal part , With varied motion and contrasted art ; Full in the front the nobler limbs to place , And poise each figure on its central base . But chief from her that flowing outline take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake , Or lambent flame ; which , ample , broad and long , Reliev 'd not swell 'd , at once both light and strong , Glides thro ' the graceful whole . Her art divine Cuts not , in parts minute , the tame design , But by a few bold strokes , distinct and free , Calls forth the charms of perfect symmetry . True to anatomy , more true to grace , She bids each muscle know its native place ; Bids small from great in just gradation rise . And , at one visual point , approach the eyes . Yet deem not , youths , that perspective can give Those charms complete by which your works shall live : What tho ' her rules may to your hand impart A quick mechanic substitute for art , Yet formal , geometric shapes she draws ; Hence the true Genius scorns her rigid laws ; By Nature taught he strikes th ' unerring lines , Consults his eye , and as he sees designs . Man 's changeful race , the sport of chance and time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark well the difference , and let each be seen Of various age , complexion , hair , and mien . Yet to each separate form adapt with care Such limbs , such robes , such attitude and air , As best befit the head , and best combine To make one whole , one uniform design : Learn action from the dumb ; the dumb shall teach How happiest to supply the want of speech . Fair in the front , in all the blaze of light , The Hero of thy piece shall meet the sight , Supreme in beauty ; lavish here thine art . And bid him boldly from the canvas start : While round that sov'reign form th ' inferior train In groups collected fill the pictur 'd plain ; Fill , but not crowd ; for oft some open space Must part their ranks , and leave a vacant place , Lest artlessly dispers 'd the sever 'd crew At random rush on our bewilder 'd view ; Or parts with parts , in thick confusion bound , Spread a tumultuous chaos o'er the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charms of contrariety ; In forms , in attitudes , expects to trace Distinct inflections , and contrasted grace . Where art diversely leads each changeful line , Opposes , breaks , divides the whole design : Thus , when the rest in front their charms display Let one with face averted turn away ; Shoulders oppose to breasts , and left to right , With parts that meet and parts that shun the sight . This rule in practice uniformly true Extends alike to many forms or few . Yet keep thro ' all the piece a perfect poise : If here in frequent troops the figures rise . There let some object tower with equal pride ; And so arrange each correspondent side . That , thro ' the well-connected plan , appear No cold vacuity , no desert drea " . /z/ The joints in each extreme distinctly treat , Nor e'er conceal the outline of the feet : The hands alike demand to be exprest In half-shown figures rang 'd behind the rest ; /z/ Nor can such forms with force or beauty shine , Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air constrain 'd and forc 'd , each gesture rude , Whate'er contracts or cramps the attitude , With scorn discard . When squares or angles join , When flows in tedious parallel the line , Acute , obtuse , whene'er the shapes appear , Or take a formal geometric air . These all displease , and the disgusted eye Nauseates the tame and irksome symmetry . Mark then our former rule ; with contrast strong And mode transverse the leading lines prolong ; For these in each design , if well exprest . Give value , force , and lustre to the rest . Nor yet to Nature such strict homage pay , As not to quit when Genius leads the way ; Nor yet , tho ' Genius all his succour sends . Her mimic powers tho ' ready memory lends , Presume from Nature wholly to depart , For Nature is the arbitress of art . In Error 's grove ten thousand thickets spread , Ten thousand devious paths our steps mislead ; ' Mid curves , that vary in perpetual twine . Truth owns but one direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the piece , Sublime and perfect as they glow 'd in Greece . Those genuine charms to seize , with zeal explore The vases , medals , statues , form 'd of yore . Relievos high that swell the column 's stem . Speak from the marble , sparkle from the gem : Hence all-majestic on th ' expanding soul , In copious tide the bright ideas roll ; Fill it with radiant forms unknown before . Forms such as demigods and heroes wore : Here pause and pity our enervate days , Hopeless to rival their transcendent praise . Peculiar toil on single forms bestow , There let expression lend its finished glow ; There each variety of tint unite With the full harmony of shade and light . Free o'er the limbs the flowing vesture cast . The light broad folds with grace majestic placed ; And as each figure turns a different way , /z/ Give the large plaits their corresponding play ; Yet devious oft and swelling from the part , The flowing robe with ease should seem to start ; Not on the form in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and shade . Where'er a flat vacuity is seen . There let some shadowy bending intervene , Above , below , to lead its varied line . As best may teach the distant folds to join ; And as the limbs by few bold strokes exprest Excel in beauty , so the liberal vest In large , distinct , unwrinkled folds should fly ; Beauty 's best handmaid is Simplicity . To diff ' ' rent ranks adapt their proper robe ; With ample pall let monarchs sweep the globe ; In garb succinct and coarse array the swain ; In light and silken veils the virgin train . Where in black shade the deeper hollow lies . Assisting art some midway fold supplies . That gently meets the light , and gently spreads To break the hardness of opposing shades . Each nobler symbol classic Sages use , To mark a virtue , or adorn a Muse , Ensigns of war , of peace , or rites divine . These in thy work with dignity may shine : But sparingly thy earth-born stores unfold , Nor load with gems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dear in custom 's eye , They lose their value as they multiply . Of absent forms the features to define , Prepare a model to direct thy line ; Each garb , each custom , with precision trace , Unite m strict decorum time with place ; And emulous alone of genuine fame . Be Grace , be Majesty thy constant aim . That Majesty , that Grace so rarely given To mortal man , nor taught by art but Heaven . In all to sage propriety attend . Nor sink the clouds , nor bid the waves ascend ; Lift not the mansions drear of Hell or Night Above the Thunderer 's lofty arch of light ; Nor build the column on an osier base ; But let each object know its native place . THE AllT OF PAINTING . 133 Thy last , thy noblest task remains untold , Passion to paint , and sentiment unfold ; Yet how these motions of the mind display ! Can colours catch them , or can lines portray 7 Who shall our pigmy pencils arm with might To seize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jove alone ; his highly-favour 'd few Alone can call such miracles to view . But this to rhet'ric and the schools I leave , Content from ancient lore one rule to give : " By tedious toil no passions are exprest , * ' His hand who feels them strongest paints them best . " /z/ Return fair Colouring ! all thy lures prepare , Each safe deception , every honest snare , Which brings new lovers to thy sister 's train , Skilful at once to charm , and to retain ; Come , faithful Siren ! chaste seducer ! say , What laws control thee , and what powers obey ' ? Know first , that light displays and shade destroys Refulgent Nature 's variegated dyes . Thus bodies near the light distinctly shine With rays direct , and as it fades decline . Thus to the eye oppos 'd with stronger light They meet its orb , for distance dims the sight . Learn hence to paint the parts that meet the view In spheric forms , of bright and equal hue ; While , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fainter dye . Lost and confus 'd progressively they fade , Not fall precipitate from light to shade . This Nature dictates , and this Taste pursues , Studious in gradual gloom her lights to lose ; The various whole with soft'ning tints to fill , As if one single head employ 'd her skill . Thus if bold fancy plan some proud design . Where many various groups divide or join , ( Tho ' sure from more than there confusion springs , ) One globe of light and shade o'er all she flings ; Yet skill 'd the separate masses to dispose . Where'er , in front , the fuller radiance glows . Behind , a calm reposing gloom she spreads . Relieving shades with light , and light with shades . /z/ And as the centre of some convex glass , Draws to a point the congregated mass Of dazzlmg rays , that , more than nature bright , Reflect each image in an orb of light , While from that point the scatter 'd beams retire , Sink to the verge , and there in shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On all thy rounded groups the circling glow . As is the Sculptor 's , such the Painter 's aim . Their labour different , but their end the same ; What from the marble the rude chisel breaks , The softer pencil from the canvas takes : And , skill 'd remoter distances to keep , Surrounds the outline pale in shadows deep ; While on the front the spai kling lustre plays , And meets the eye in full meridian blaze . True Colouring thus in plastic power excels , Fair to the visual point her forms she swells , And lifts them from their flat aerial ground Warm as the life , and as the statue round . In silver clouds in ether 's blue domain . Or the clear mirror of the watry plain , If chance some solid substance claim a place , Firm and opaque amid the lucid space , Rough let it swell and boldly meet the sight , Mark 'd with peculiar strength of shade and light ; There blend each earthly tint of heaviest sort , At once to give consistence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or azure sky . Light and pellucid from that substance fly . Permit not two conspicuous lights to shine With rival radiance in the same design ; But yield to one alone the power to blaze And spread th ' extensive vigour of its rays , There where the noblest figures are display 'd ; Thence gild the distant parts , and lessening fade : As fade the beams which Phoebus from the East Flings vivid forth to light the distant West , Gradual those vivid beams forget to shine , So gradual let thy pictur 'd lights decline . The sculptor 'd forms which some proud Circus grace , In Parian marble or Corinthian brass , Illumin 'd thus , give to the gazing eye /z/ Th ' expressive head in radiant Majesty , While to each lower limb the fainter ray Lends only light to mark , but not display : So let thy pencil fling- its beams around , Nor e'er with darker shades their force confound . For shades too dark dissever 'd shapes will give , And sink the parts their softness would relieve ; Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full lights the wand'ring shadows steal ; Then only justly spread , when to the sight A breadth of shade pursues a breadth of light . This charm to give , great Titian wisely made The cluster 'd grapes his rule of light and shade . White , when it shines with unstain 'd lustre clear , May bear an object back , or bring it near ; Aided by black it to the front aspires , That aid withdrawn it distantly retires ; But black unmix 'd , of darkest midnight hue , Still calls each object nearer to the view . Whate'er we spy thro ' colour 'd light or air , A stain congenial on their surface bear . While neighb'ring forms by joint reflection give And mutual take the dyes that they receive . But where on both alike one equal light Diffiisive spreads , the blending tints unite . For breaking colours thus ( the ancient phrase By Artists used ) fair Venice claims our praise : She , cautious to transgress so sage a rule , Confin 'd to soberest tints her learned school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join Tumultuous crowds in one immense design , Yet there we ne'er condemn such hostile hues As cut the parts or glaringly confuse ; In tinsel trim no foppish form is dresl . Still flows in graceful unity the vest ; And o'er that vest a kindred mantle spreads , Unvaried but by power of lights and shades , Which mildly mixing , every social dye Unites the whole in loveliest harmony . When small the space , or pure the ambient air Each form is seen in bright precision clear ; But if thick clouds that purity deface , If far extend that intp.rvening space , /z/ There all confus 'd the objects faintly rise , As if prepar 'd to vanish from our eyes , Give them each foremost part a touch so bright , i That , o'er the rest , its domineering light ' May much prevail ; yet , relative in all , j Let greater parts advance before the small . ' Minuter forms , when distantly we trace , ' Are mingled all in one compacted mass ; ; Such the light leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wide-extended floods . Let each contiguous part be firm allied , ' Nor labour less the separate to divide ; Yet so divide that to th ' approving eye They both at small and pleasing distance lie . Forbid too hostile colours close to meet , i And win with middle tints their union sweet ; I Yet varying all thy tones , let some aspire j Fiercely in front , some tenderly retire . j Vain is the hope by colouring to display ! The bright effulgence of the noon-tide ray , : Or paint the full-orb 'd Ruler of the skies With pencils dipp 'd in dull terrestrial dyes : j But when mild Evening sheds her golden light ; .1 When Morn appears array 'd in modest white ; j When soft suffusion of the vernal shower i Dims the pale sun ; or , at the thund'ring hour , &#9632; When , wrapt in crimson clouds , he hides his head , Then catch the glow and on the canvas spread . j Bodies of polish 'd or transparent tone , ; Of metal , crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all whose rough unequal parts are rear 'd The shaggy fleece , thick fur , or bristly beard ; ; The liquid too ; the sadly melting eye , j The well-comb 'd locks that wave with glossy dye ; !

Restore to every form its outline true . i By mellowing skill thy ground at distance cast , I /z/ Free as the air , and transient as its blast ; There all thy liquid colours sweetly blend , j There all the treasures of thy palette spend , j And every form retiring to that ground 1 Of hue congenial to itself compound . The hand that colours well , must colour bright ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But amply heap in front each splendid dye , Then thin and light withdraw them from the eye , , Mix 'd with that simple unity of shade , j As all were from one single palette spread .

And this to give , the ready hand and eye i With playful skill the kindred features ply ; From part to part alternately convey The harmonizing gloom , the darting ray , i With tones so just , in such gradation thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the piece thy hand prepares to trace Ordain 'd for nearer sight , or narrow space 1 Paint it of soft and amicable hue : But , if predestin 'd to remoter view , ! Thy strong unequal varied colours blend ; And ample space to ample figures lend , I Where to broad lights tiie circumambient shade In liquid play by labour just is laid ; Alike with liveliest touch the forms portray . Where the dim window half excludes the day ; But , when expos 'd in fuller light or air , A brown and sober cast the group may bear . Fly every foe to elegance and grace , Each yawning hollow , each divided space ; /z/ Whate'er is trite , minute , abrupt , or dry , Where light meets shade in flat equality ; Each theme fantastic , filthy , vile , or vain , That gives the soul disgust , or senses pain ; Monsters of barbarous birth , Chimeras drear , That pall with ugliness , or awe with fear . And all that chaos of sharp broken parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me , youths ! while zealous ye forsake Detected faults , this friendly caution take , - Shun all excess ; and with true wisdom deem , That vice alike resides in each extreme . Know , if supreme perfection be your aim , If classic praise your pencil hope to claim . Your noble outlines must be chaste , yet free , Connected all with studied harmony ; Few in their parts , yet those distinct and great ; Your Colouring boldly strong , yet softly sweet . Know , he that well begins has half achiev 'd His destin 'd work . Yet late shall be retriev 'd That time mispent , that labour worse than lost , The young disciple , to his dearest cost . Gives to a dull preceptor 's tame designs ; His tawdry colours , his erroneous lines , Will to the soul that poison rank convey , Which life 's best length shall fail to purge away . Yet let not your untutor 'd childhood strive Of Nature 's living charms the sketch to give , Till , skill 'd her separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how they join . These while beneath some master 's eye you trace , Vers 'd in the law of symmetry and grace . Boldly proceed : his precepts shall impart Each sweet deception of the pleasing art : Still more than precept shall his practice teach , And add what self-reflection ne'er can reach . Oft , when alone , the studious hour employ On what may aid your art , and what destroy : Diversity of parts is sure to please . If all the various parts unite with ease ; As surely charms that voluntary style . Which careless plays , and seems to mock at toil : For labour 'd lines with cold exactness tir@ , /z/ ' T is freedom only gives the force and fire Ethereal ; she , with alchymy divine , Brightens each touch , ennobles every line ; Yet pains and practice only can bestow This facile power of hand , whose liberal flow With grateful fraud its own exertions veils : He best employs his art who best conceals . This to obtain , let taste with judgment join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there each line in truth ideal drawn , Or ere a colour on the canvas dawn ; Then as the work proceeds , that work submit To sight instinctive , not to doubting wit ; The eye each obvious error swift descries , Hold then the compass only in the eyes . Give to the dictates of the learn 'd respect . Nor proudly untaught sentiments reject , Severe to self alone : for self is blind , And deems each merit in its off*spring join 'd : Such fond delusion time can best remove , Concealing for a while the child we love ; By absence then the eye impartial grown . Will , tho ' no friend assist , each error own ; But these subdued , let thy determin 'd mind Veer not with every critic 's veering wind , Or e'er submit thy genius to the rules Of prating fops , or self-important fools ; Enough if from the learn 'd applause be won : Who doat on random praises , merit none . By Nature 's sympathetic power , we see , As is the parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their instinctive law , In all their works their own resemblance draw : Learn then " to know thyself ; " that precept sage Shall best allay luxuriant Fancy 's rage ; Shall point how far indulgent Genius deigns To aid her flight , and to what point restrains . But as the blushing fruits , the breathing flowers , Adorning Flora 's and Pomona 's bowers . When forcing fires command their buds to swell , Refuse their dulcet taste , their balmy smell ; So labour 's vain extortion ne'er achieves That grace supreme which willing Genius gives . /z/ Thus tho ' to pains and practice much we owe , Tho ' thence each line obtains its easy flow , Yet let those pains , that practice , ne'er be join 'd , To blunt the native vigor of the mind . When shines the morn , when in recruited course The spirits flow , devote their active force To every nicer part of thy design , But pass no idle day without a line : And wandering oft the crowded streets along , The native gestures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , Th ' expressive lines of each impassion 'd face That bears its joys or sorrows undisguis 'd , May by observant taste be there surpris 'd . Thus , true to art , and zealous to excel . Ponder on Nature 's powers , and weigh them well ; Explore thro ' earth and heaven , thro ' sea and skies , The accidental graces as they rise ; And while each present form the Fancy warms , Swift on thy tablets fix its fleeting charms . /z/ For paltry gold let pining Misers sigh , His soul invokes a nobler Deity ; Smit with the glorious avarice of fame . He claims no less than an immortal name ; Hence on his fancy just conception shines , True judgment guides his hand , true taste refines ; Hence ceaseless toil , devotion to his art , A docile temper , and a generous heart ; Docile , his sage preceptor to obey , Generous , his aid with gratitude to pay ; Blest with the bloom of youth , the nerves of health , And competence , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not these empower His tints to charm at every labouring hour : All have their brilliant moments , when alone They paint as if some star propitious shone . Yet then , e'en then , the hand but ill conveys The bolder grace that in the fancy plays : Hence , candid Critics , this sad truth confest . Accept what least is bad , and deem it best ; Lament the soul in error 's thraldom held . Compare life 's span with art 's extensive field ; /z/ Know that , ere perfect taste matures the mind , Or perfect practice to that taste be join 'd , Comes age , comes sickness , comes contracting pain , And chills the warmth of youth in every vein . Rise then , ye youths , while yet that warmth inspires , While yet nor years impair , nor labour tires . While health , while strength are yours , while that mild ray Which shone auspicious on your natal day .

And Memory on her soft , yet lasting page . Stamps the fresh image which shall charm thro ' age . /z/ Yet more than these to Meditation 's eyes Great Nature 's self redundantly supplies : Her presence , best of Models ! is the source Whence Genius draws augmented power and force ; Her precepts , best of teachers ! give the powers . Whence art , by practice to perfection soars .
