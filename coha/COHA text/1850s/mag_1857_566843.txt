ART . IV. - NORWICII FREE ACADEMY . An Addre88 at the Dedication of the Free Academy in Norwich , ( *onn . By JOhN P. GIJLLIVER , Pastor of the Main Street Congregational Church . Together with the Remarks of Gentlemen present by invitation . WITHIN the past few years the subject of popular education has awakened an unwonted interest . Many minds , some of a superior order , have devoted their energies to it ; and the consequence is that great changes have been effected in the niodes and appliances of education . Some of these changes have not perhaps been for the better ; but most of them are such that the general condition of our public schools is vastly better than it was when there was an almost universal apathy in the community on the subject , and our private schools have at the same time been benefited by the awakening of the public mind to the importance of this great interest . Much progress has manifestly been made in the development of a proper system of education . There is , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the general features , and the minutitu of such a system ,  --  especially its minuti . Though the grand result is plainly working out , there remains yet a great deal to be done , and every movement that bears upon this result should be thoroughly scrutinized , lest some error be committed , causing the movement to retard , rather than advance our progress . The beautiful town of Norwich has recently been the scene of a movement in education which is of more than usual im portance . Indeed its influence , in our opinion , is to be so great upon the whole character of the system of popular education , that it may be said to inaugurate a new era in the history of education in this country . It demands of us , therefore , as public journalists , desiring the advance of all interests that may be considered peculiarly as of New England origin , something more than a passing notice . And we propose in this Article to give chiefly the history of this project , and to deduce from it // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational interest . The grand consummation which has been reached in Norwich , placing the town in advance of almost all , perhaps we may say all other places , in educational privileges , is not the result simply of the thoughts and efforts which immediately produced it . It is the upshot of a long series of efforts , continued through many years . Most of these efforts were in themselves for the most part , ineffectual ,  --  somne of them wholly so . But their influence was preparatory to what was to come after . Even the effort which immediately preceded the final successful effort , was attended with a most thorough defeat of the friends of education . And this defeat was really an indispensable step in gaining the ultimate glorious result . Without it , the Norwich Free Academy , so far as we can see , would not now have been in existence . For not only did this defeat awaken a large portion of the community to a sense of the sad condition of their educational interests , l ) ut it prevented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been madquate to meet these wants , would have been considered for manifest bearing upon the result which has been reached , although the history would be an interesting one . For these details , we refer our readers to Mr. Gulliver 's address . We will merely notice very briefly the unsuccessful effort which may be said to have given birth to the magnificent enterprise that we are to consider . The effort to which we allude occurred in 1850 . After some discussion a committee was appointed to take into consideration the state of the schools , and recommuend such changes as they thought proper . This committee , as stated in Mr. Gulliver ' s address , " reported that the schools and the school-houses were in a very low state , that the interest of parents and children in education was so slight that of 1,800 children within the limits of the society , between the ages of four and sixteen , more than 600 were unconnected with any school , public or private ; that an organized and graded system would b&amp;far less expensive than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // same quality as at present ; that after suitable houses should be built and paid for , we could even have far better schools at a less cost ; concluding with the recommendation of a plan in accordance with their views. ** The presentation of this report was followed by a succession of meetings of the most exciting character . An active and unscrupulous opposition was aroused to the change proposed by the committee . Certain demagogues raised the cry , that the poor were to be greatly taxed , apd that too for the benefit of the rich . They knew that these appeals to popular prejudice were false ; but what do demagogues care about the truth , provided they can get a little brief authority with the multitude ? The rabble applauded them , and they grew bold in their vulgar abuse of those who advocated the proposed change . Their abuse , however , was disregarded , and the discussions went on . Much light was shed on the subject . Those who were in favor of the change became strengthened in their opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were convinced that they were wrong . Especially was this so on one evening , which we never shall forget , when Mr. Gulliver made a most masterly effort . Although the Town Hall was crowded so full that large numbers were obliged to stand , he held the audience spellbound for over two hours , and if the vote had been taken at that time on the question , there would have been a large majority in favor of the proposal of the committee . But it was not thought best by the majority to press a vote at that time . They wished to have discussion go on as long as any desired it , so that the people might be fully enlightened .. The meeting was therefore adjourned for another discussion . Circumstances occurred to prevent a full attendance of the friends of education at the adjourned meeting . That this was to be so was known before hand , and although it was the understanding that nothing definite would be done at that time , the demagogues , caring no more for honor than they did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for the indefinite postponement of the whole subject . This ended the effort for the time . The friends of reform thought it best to leave the leaders of the opposition to take the // responsibility of the state of things which they had induced , and to let the seed which had been sown by free discussion , produce its fruit in the minds of the people . The opposition took the schools into their charge , and turned out of office the offending visitors who began the effort , and this , as they thought , triumphantly signalized its defeat . Bat the schools under the new administration of these friends of the poor man , sunk lower than ever . The better portion of the community saw this with sorrow , and longed for a change . The demagogues even , were ashamed of their work . There was a preparation evidently going on in the popular mind fo : a great change , but no defluite result was arrived at for some time . After a while , however , there were evolved pan passa two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the committee of 1850 proposed , except that it was much more thorough and expensive , and the noble *Jmoject which forms the subject of this article . The project of a Free Academy was suggested to the mind of the 11ev . Mr. Gulliver by a playful remark dropped by a gentleman during the struggle of 1850 . " Those men , " said this gentleman , " talk about a High School ! I would not take one for a gift , if it is to be managed by such assemblages as we have lately had at the Town hail . I am in favor of an endowed School , and would give $5,000 towards one . " Little did he think that by this remark he started a train of thought and effort which was to end in such a grand result . But so it was . This accidental hint was seed that fell into go odgronnd , and brought forth abundant fruit . Says Mr. Gulliver in his address , it " led to a series of inquiries and investigatious , which were continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public high schools , supported by taxation , in all respects successful ? The second , Would endowed free schools remedy their defects ? The third , On what plan should endowed schools be conducted in order to insure success ? On these points , either by correspondence or by personal interview , a large number of the leading educators of the country were consulted . It was ascertained that in all quarters apprehension was beginning to be felt in regard to the working of our higher public schools . The lower schools up to the grade of the grammar school , were well sus // tamed . Men were to be found in all our communities who had been themselves educated up to that point , and understood practically the importance of such schools , in sufficient numbers to control public sentiment , and secure for them ample appropriations and a steady support . iI3ut the studies of the High School ,  --  AI gebra , Geometry , Chemistry , Natural Philosophy , Ancient History , Latin , Greek , Frencb and German , were a perfect terra incognita ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High School was a new thing , and while a few enlightened citizens had the control of it , in numerous instances it was carried to a high state of perfection . But after a time the burden of taxation would begin to be felt . Men would discuss the high salaries paid to the accomplished teachers which such schools demand , and would ask , To what purpose is this waste U iDemnagogues , keen-scented as wolves , would snuff the prey . What do we want of a High School to teach rich men 's children * they would shout . It is a shame to tax the poor to pay a man $1,800 a year for teaching children to make x 's and pothooks and gabble parlez-vous . ' The work would go bravely on ; and on election day , amid great excitement , a new school committee would be chosen in favor of retrenchment and popular rights . In a single day the fruit of years of labor would be destroyed . Such occurrences it was ascertained , had already become sufficiently numerous to excite serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in communities where the High School had been uniformly prosperous , it appeared that the same influences were at work , and awakened constant apprehension . " Having satisfied himself that an endowed High School would secure the objects desired , better than one depending upon the popular will , Mr. Gulliver next inquired what were the principles which should regulate the management of such an institution . The plan was finally all matured , and now the important question arose , how the money should be obtained . There would be wanted $75,000 , of which , $50,000 must be a permanent fund for the support of teachers , while $25,000 were to be devoted to the purchase of a lot , and the erection of the building . // No wonder that an effort to raise such a sum , in a city of about 13,000 inhabitants , was considered to be perfectly visionary . But this did not daunt the projector . He was determined at least to make the effort , and he found some noble men ready to join him in it at the very outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , as we find it in his address . " Our honored President* advisel that ten persons should be invited to give $7,500 a piece , intimating that he would be one of the ten . Accordingly , in the spring of 1853 , a letter was addressed to a few of the wealthiest and noblest men of the city , detailing the facts in relation to our schools , giving some testimony in regard to the usefulness of high schools in other places , setting forth the superiority of an endowed school to one maintained by taxation , and unfolding the main features of the proposed plan for this school . This letter was first put irkto the hands of our President , who at once assumed one-tenth of the amount . It was next presented to another member of the present board of trustees , to whose persevering efforts we are mainly indebted for the final completion of the subscription , and after due consideration another tenth was added . Next a note was dispatched to another member of the board of trustees , who with the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in half an hour the answer was returned that he would give one-tenth of $75,000 , or onetenth of any other sum which might be raised for the purpose . ' Next the owners of this beautiful enclosure were applied to . Providence had there also prepared the way , for they were found considering with deep interest an independent plan for devoting their grounds to a similar pnrpos&amp; , and after careful examination , they gave cheerfully these five ample acres for the use of the academy . Thus four-tenths of the amount were secured . Subscriptions of twentieths followed in a like liberal * Russel Hubbard , Esq. , who has recently died , much lamented by the corn . community in which he lived , and by all who knew him . The Free Academy was a favorite object of his benevolence , and he spent much thought and effort upon ft. while we mourn his loss , we would be grateful for his being permitted to live to see the institution in full and successful operation . // spirit . The case of one noble man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially mentioned , who did not even wait for an invitation to aid in the enterprise , but of his own accord gave his subscriptiou of $3,750 , with some good natured reproaches that he had been passed by . But this fair wind and these bright skies continued but for a time . Darkness soon came upon us , and storms threatened our enterprise more than once with shipwreck . We were disappointed in the hope of obtaining the entire sum from a few individuals . The whole number of subscribers were thirty-five , the snbscriptions varying from $500 to $7,500 . By the blessing of Heaven , the whole amount was however finally pledged . And we desire here joyfully to recognize and devoutly to acknowled*e the good hand of our God in all this enterprise . His providence prepared the place fitted for this undertaking in the succession of events . Au influence from Himself could alone have inclined the hearts of the poopIe to this unexampled liberality . And sure we are , that from Him only could be emanated the courage , and hope and strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , toiled through many a period of darkness and doubt , to a consummation which we can not err in regarding as fraught with blessings for the future generations of our children , the value of which no human mind , though aided by the most ardent enthusiasm , can frilly estimate . Not unto us , not unto us , but unto thy name , 0 , God , give glory ? ' " After the sum originally proposed was raised , it was found that more would be needed to erect such a building as was required . Some of the donors therefore increased their subscriptions , and some new subscribers were added , increasing the number of donors to forty . And then , " as a ci'owning glory to the whole enterprise , the donors of the land occupied by the academy , have made an additional gift of $5,000 for the en- * Joseph Otis , Esq . In addition to his benefaction to this enterprise , he endowed very liberally another institution , which aims in another way , at the same great object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , like the Free Academy , is a noble gift to the citizens , which we hope will be imitated by men of wealth in other communities , and most of it was presented during the life of the donor . // dowment of a library , the income of which is to be appropriated annually to the purchase of books , preparing a room at the same time for its reception , and furnishing a large number of valuable books for immediate use . This is to be called the PECK LIBRARY . ' " The whole amount raised for the institution at the present time is , we understand , over $100,000 . In the extract which we have made from the address of Mr. Gulliver , he barely alludes to discourageinents and difficulties which were encountered . There were some of them really of a formidable character , such as would dissuade any common man from going on with the enterprise . A narrow sectarianisin raised its head in opposition at one period of the effort . Some who were so situated that they could give , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in some cases , ridiculed the project . Even when all but a few thousand dollars was pledged , the effort lagged heavily for some time . Put the courage and perseverance of the projector , and of those who had a like spirit , finally overcame every obstacle , and what was at first regarded by most as a wild dream , became at length a glorious reality . The agency of Providence in originating this enterprise , and in directing it to a successful teri*ination , is very appropriately acknowledged in the address at the dedication , as seen in o*ie of our extracts . And we would remark , that we know of no circumstance in which it is more evident than in providing the projector of the plan . lie was manifestly an instrument raised up by Providence for this special purpose . It is seldom that a man could be found daring enough to conceive such a project , and skillful and persevering enough to carry it through to so successful a consummation . Rare , very rare , must be both the intellectual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , in so small a city , to unite in bestowing upon it so munificent a benefaction . For the benefit of others who may wish to engage in similar efforts we will notice one peculiarity in the tactics of the author of this enterprise . Instead of beginning by a general appeal to the community , or by calling together a number of gentlemen who he thought would be interested in the object , he began with*cting alone upon individual minds , lie did indeed // write a circular explaining very fully the whole subject ; but he gave this to but few at first , having with them a free conversation , and their action was definitely obtained before others were applied to . Silently he thus induced one after another to take a share in the enterprise , enlarging gradually the sphere of his labors . This involved a large amount of personal effort which challenges our admiration ; but at the same time influences were avoided which probably would otherwise have defeated the whole plan . If objections were raised , these were met in individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in passing from mind to mind . With this negative advantage there was also the positive one of the impetus given to the project by every fresh accession thus silently gained . After quite a large part of the amount needed was pledged , then the action was more general , but there was no relaxation of individual effort till the last dollar was raised . Indeed there was more of this effort required to obtain the last few thousand dollars than to obtain some of the large sums that were pledged at the outset . We have noticed this feature in Mr. Gulliver 's plan of operations , because we are persuaded that many a good enterprise has failed to be accomplished from a lack of individual action , and from both an undue preponderance , and a preference in the order of time , of general action upon the community at large . The benefaction which we are considering has such decided peculiarities that it stands alone by itself . On this point Professor Noah Porter , one of the speakers at the dedication of the academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day has omitted to mention from a commendable modesty . Though it was noticed by the speaker who preceded me , I will venture to refer to it , and if possible , to give it the prominence which it merits . It is that the endowment of the Norwich Free Academy is unique and singular and unlike any other . I believe that when all its peculiarities are taken in view , it will be proud to stand by itself in the history of endowments for education . If the amount contributed , the number of persons who have been concerned in the enterprise , and the object to which it is devoid are all // taken into consideration , it will be found to be unmatched by any similar enterprise . Were I called on to defend my country abroad , I should refer to an act like this , as a noble product of American Institutions . Were I desirous to explain to a circle of intelligent ladies and gentlemen on the continent of Europe what are some of the beneficent results of institutions as free as ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say of it , it is one of the tbin*s of which our country has no need to be ashamed . It is true in any schools of a higher order have been munificently furnished in this country . Wealthy inerchants and bankers have given large sums to found public schools in their native towns , and have in this displayed a wise liberality . But here we have a large endowment , furnished in large sums , by a large number of intelligent citizens for the good of the entire community in which they live . " And of those contributors , though some of them gave over $10,000 each , not one of them has his name connected with the institution , except as being on the list of corporators , the smallest contributor being in this respect equal to the largest , and deservedly so , for he gave in proportion to his ability . There are names , it is true , incidentally connected with the institution-one is attached to the library , being the name of the deceased father of the lady who presented it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society among the pupils , being the name of the first donor and of the first President , who has recently deceased . Let us not be understood to mean that we think it wrong for any one to connect his name with his benefaction . In some cases it is not only proper , but it is desirable . All that we mean to say is , that in this case there can be no suspicion that any of the donors were governed by a desire to make their names famous as benefactors . And we can not but express the hope that we may have more of such generous benefactors in all parts of our land , after the Norwich plan , for the plan may be said to have originated there . There is one feature in this benefaction which is particularly to be commended to the imitation of others . It is that noticed in the remarks of President Goodrich , of Trinity College . " Mr. Chairman , as I have sat here in the midst of this scene , // I have been tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowment of this institution , which to-day they see thus launched forth on its mission of blessing to their neighbors and to the world , to the children of the present and of all future generations . As I think of their mingled emotions of satisfaction and hope , of devout thankfulness and humble self-approbation , I feel that they are sharing in the purest happiness that belongs to our earthly experience . When the rich man provides by his will that a portion of his wealth , after he has done with it all , shall be appropriated to some benevolent institution , or to some work of public utility , it is a good act , to be accepted with all thankfulness . B**t surely it is a better deed when a man denies himself , instead of his heirs , when he gives from what is still his own to use and enjoy ; aye , and a happier deed it is too , for he can see with his own eyes the blessed fruits of his liberality . There is indeed a luxury in thus going good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand alone in regard to this benefaction . We see not why the example thus so nobly set , should not be followed in many places in New England , and ultimately throughout the country . The liberality shown in fiis enterprise , is indeed unusual , but we should be sorry to believe that it is inimitable . May we not hope that in the course of a few years , the same liberality may be exhibited by the wealthy men in most of our populous towns . Perhaps it will be said that there are few places in which can be found the man that can carry such an enterprise through , as Mr. Gulliver did in Norwich . But it must be remembered , that efforts of the same kind hereafter , will not be attended with the difficulties which attended the original effort . The skill , the energy , and the perseverance with which that was so strikingly marked , will be needed in a far less degree in future efforts . Such an enterprise will no longer be regarded as a fiction of the heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and it can be done again , will now be the short and conclusive argument by which the liberality of the wealthy will be called forth to action in similar enterprises . We have already alluded to another result of the struggle // of 1850  --  the waking up of the community to the removal of the glaring defects of their common schools . So thorough was the change in the views and feelings of the people on this subject , that nearly $f30,000 were in a little time expended upon school-houses by the two central districts , which became consolidated for the purpose of having together a system of graded scho5ls . A few complain , as is always the case , about the amount of taxation which this expenditure reqnired ; but the citizens generally bear the burden very cheerfully , and take pride in the beautiful and well ordered school-houses , which are really among the best architectural ornaments of the place . Even the demagogues who in 1850 raised* such a cry about taxation , have fallen in with the general current , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this is , that in the course of six years an entire change has taken place in the condition of the educational interests of that city . No one fact shows this improvement more decidedly than the increased attendance upon the schools . While in 1850 more than one-third of the children between the ages of four and sixteen , were not connected with any school , now it was found that only a little more than one-tenth were absent . And sickness , or tender age , or early entrance upon business , Mr. Gulliver thinks , will probably account for this small amount of absence . The two efforts , as we have before said , have gone on together . The general effort on the part of the citizens undoubtedly was much stimulated by the effort of Mr. Gulliver and his coadjntors in their enterprise . And they have together provided a very complete system of education-better , we think , than can be found in any other place in the whole country . The Free Academy is of course the highest school in this system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the proper age for undergoing an examination for this purpose shall be arrived at , is an incentive to every scholar in his studies , even down to the primary school . This Free Academy will form a connecting link between the common schools and the college , for it will be a part of the system of the Academy to prepare students for admission into our colleges . And we would suggest , that if there are any citizens // of Norwich who have not yet given anything to this Institution , but are desirous of doing so , they can do it in a way which will make the connection just spoken of very serviceable . They can endow scholarships as rewards of merit . A thousand dollars would answer for a single scholarship , as the proceeds of this would pay the tuition fees of a student in college . It is obvious that the annual examination for the attainment of the scholar*hips would be looked forward to by many of the pupils for a long time previous , and would b e a constant incitement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowment of the Norwi cli Free Acadei*ny , which need to be carefully considered by the friends of popular education . Upon these we will offer a few remarks . There are some endowed schools that do harm rather than good . This is the case whenever the endowment is such as to liberate the community to any great extent from the necessity of taxation and effort in education . The Norwich endowment has the opposite effect , calling even for more taxation and effort than would otherwise be thought necessary . It does not come in competition with the common public schools , or in any way take their place ; but it stands above them , and by its own high standards calls for the adoption of similar standards in them , and therefore for ample means and abundant exertion on the part of the community . The Free Academy and the graded common schools form together a grand system , the benefits of which are so manifest that the people are quite ready to support their part of it . Even those who look at everything in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous policy for the community to neglect to provide well for its graded schools , as they are the avenue to the great advantages so freely opened to all in the Free Academy . But besides all this , the Free Academy itself is not wholly separated from the community , but has a direct relation to it . It differs greatly in this respect from those Institutions which are endowed by single individuals . It is a benefaction coming from the combined wealth of the community , bearing the name of no one individual , and relying therefore upon the future wealth ot th' same community to supply any deficiencies that may arise , // or to furnish the means for any extension of its benefits that may be called for . As death may remove one after another of the corporators , their places are to be filled from among the people , so that a living connection , as we may express it , is perpetuated between the Institution and the community . This forbids its ever being crippled by any failure of its investments , a liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual . It will always be an object of the benefactions of the citizens so far as will be necessary , and new corporators will be chosen from among new benefactors . Indeed , at the very outset we see indications of the tendency that we have pointed out . For it being obvious , after the sum originally fixed upon was obtained , that more was needed , over * 25,000 *vvas readily furnished , and in fact by new subscribers . And we believe that this is an earnest of what may be expected hereafter whenever the interests of the Institution shall call for any additional funds . This peculiarity in the Norwich endowment we deem to be of great importance . When one man endows an Institution , giving to it his name , it is considered as his alone , and others are not disposed to build upon his foundation . If there are deficiencies or failures they are regretted , but they are not apt to be remedied . There is no effectual hold , as exists in the case of the Norwich Free Academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The wisdom of the plan marked out for the control and management of the Norwich Free Academy , has been called in question . The controlling body is composed of the thirty-five original donors , who were incorporated by the legislature in 1854 . It is made a self-perpetuating body in this way : Whenever the number of its members shall be reduced by removal or by death below the number of twenty-five , the remaining members have the right to fill the vacancies by the election of others from among the citizens , so that the number shall be maintained at twenty-five . For the immediate government of the Institution the corporation choose annually three trustees to hold office for three years , so that there is always a board of nine trustees . Now it has been claimed by some that it would // have been a better plan to commit the Institution to the care of trustees or governors to be appointed by the people . The great reason for adopting the other plan instead of this , was , that the control of a self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The experience which was had in the struggle of 1850 in regard to the ease with which demagogues could inflame the people , and make them frustrate a most reasonable and moderate plan of improvement , led the projectors of this enterprise to fear that there would not be steadiness enough in popular sentiment to secure the proper management of the Institution , if it were committed to the charge of the people . There is certainly much ground for such a fear . Every one must see that this is true , who has had the opportunity of witnessing any of those occasional popular commotions , in which changes have been effected all at once in plans that have been quietly and prosperously going on for a long time , or men have been turned out of office for trivial reasons , without regard to the good service which they have done to the public . One of the most crowded meetings that we ever attended was thus crowded , because , for personal and political reasons together , it was decreed by certain leaders of the people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors . The assemblage was in strange contrast with the ordinary character of school meetings , both in its numbers and in its motley appearance . A very large portion of it had no manner of interest in education , and knew not for what purpose they had come together , except to obey those whom they commonly acknowledged as their leaders . And in the confusion of so large a meeting , as one motion after another was offered , they would not have known what to do , were there not the usual gnide , the ruling demagogue of the occasion , ( for every such occasion has its one ruling demagogue , ) posted conspicuously so that he might be seen by the masses whom his beck was to govern . It was in view of such sudden and capricious popular movements , that the benefactors of Norwich thonght it best to hold the control of their benefaction in their own hands and the hands of their successors . They the more readily adopted this plan from the fact , that the usefulness of some Institutions // somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes indicated . Another reason for adopting the plan of a self-perpetuating corporation is , that the great majority of the people are not competent to judge of the wants of such an institution . Their views can not reach so high . They can judge very well in regard to the wants of common schools , but a Free Academy is so much above the range of their knowledge , that they would be exceedingly liable to error if they undertook to judge in relation to its management ; and for the same reason they would be easily influenced by the false representations of men of narrow views , alid demagogues who might wish to effect changes in the Institution . But it will be asked , Is there not danger of disastrous changes and a perversion of the benefaction from the corporators themselves ? There is indeed some danger , but by no means as great as there would be if the managers of the Institution were elected by the people . And the danger , it is to be remarked , is much lessened from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools . Thd public eye will be continually upon it , and its management will be thoioughly scanned , while at the same time it is removed from the liability of influence from sudden changes in popular sentiment . Its security is vastly greater than it would be if it were entirely secluded from*the popular interest , instead of being , as itis now , an appendage of a system which is entirely under the control of the people . There is one point , however , in relation to the control of a corporation , which shows the importance of great vigilance . It is the fact that if any perversion of the benefaction should be accomplished , it would be much more difficult to remove the evil than it would if the evil came from popular action . So that , if the danger of perversion on the part of the corporation were not very small , we should say decidedly that the endowment had better be under the control of managers elected by the people . While we should greatly fear , in the present state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we trust that the time is not far distant , when in our most enlightened New // England communities , such fears will be groundless . There is to be , we believe , a thorough change in the popular views of education in all places where there shall be such a system of schools as there is now in Norwich . Let a generation grow up under the training of such schools ; and when the men of that generation come to act in relation to popular education , they will do so with feelings very different from those which govern the masses at the present time . Benefits which they have had themselves they will appreciate , and will desire to secure these with additions to them to their children , and the demagogue 's cry of taxes , taxes , will have no influence upon them . We go farther than this . We believe that the change that we have indicated will be so great after a time , that Free A cademies will not need to be endowed by private benefaction . For when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a large portion of the families in any community , the value of it will be appreciated by the community generally ; and , as the example of Norwich will undoubtedly be imitated here and there , a strong public sentiment in favor of Free Academies will be extensively established , so that most large towns will come to consider one of these Institutions as an essential part of their system of education . It private benefaction will not furnish it to them , they will tax themselves for it , just as they do for any other public necessity . It may take a generation or two to arrive at such a consummation ; though it need not take so long if there be a goodly number of towns whose wealthy men shall determine at once that they will not be outdone in liberality and public spirit by the wealthy men of Norwich . In this connection we remark , that it is one of the cheering signs of the times in regard to the cause of popular education , that the educational interest is coming to be appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosperity . This may be said to be taking a low view of the subject , for vastly higher objects than mere prosperity , in the ordinary sense of the word , should be had in view in our efforts to promote education . But after all , this view is important , not only because it has something palpable in it , and so takes ready hold // upon the public sentiment , but also because it contemplates a result which is in some measure an exponent of the higher results of education . We care not , then , how much this point is pressed as a motive to liberal expenditures for schools , and we are glad to see a generous rivalry between different communities in providing educational privileges for their children . We are glad to see the old plan of making school-houses as unattractive as possible given up , and we honor the pride which citizens feel in pointing strangers to their school houses as among the architectural ornaments of their town . In the first part of this Article we alluded to the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through before they succeeded in establishing their present excellent system of schools . Each one of these efforts did something towards producing the final grand result . They all together constituted a necessary work of preparation , though this could be seen only when the result had been reached . Even the defeats were as essential as the successes , for they corrected errors , and gave rise to more enlarged views , so that the foundations of the final consummation were laid both broader and deeper than they otherwise would have been . The same is true everywhere . No effort is wholly lost . Where apparently there is an entire loss , there may be the greatest gain . Let , then , the friends of education labor on , even amidst the most discoura*ing circumstances , and if they are not permitted to see any manifest results of their labors , they may be cheered with the thought , tI mt they are sowing seed which will surely sooner or later spring up and bring forth a rich harvest of good . The encouragement to effort now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound apathy prevalent on the subject of education . No one can have an adequate idea of the change which has been effected , unless he compares in all its detail the condition of the schools at the present time , with their condition some twenty-five or thirty years ago . Then there was almost no system in education , scholars of all grades being often mingled together in one room , and taught by the same teacher ; school-houses were as disagreeable as they were inconvenient and uncomfortable ; modes of instruction and text // books were generally exceedingly defective ; and teachers were for the most part only temporarily engaged in the business , and therefore had none of that fitness for it which can come only from being trained for it as a permanent profession . Everything was done in the cheapest manner possible , and the schools were left very much to take care of themselves . The consequence of such negligent and penurious management was , that education was not in as good condition as even the most insignificant interests of the community . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the hill of science was left to become as rugged and uninviting as possible . But now all this is changed . In place of apathy a lively interest pervades most of the community . The school-houses , especially in our cities and large towns , are convenient and attractive , though we are sorry to see so many of them in the villages still presenting the neglected and mean appearance that characterized all of them in former days . Teaching is now one of the professions , and a special training for it is coming to be regarded as essential . Text books and modes of instruction are much improved . Teachers ' meetings and conventions are now held , and Educational Journals are published in all parts of the country . And above all , education is becoming more and more systematized to meet the wants of pupils in the different grades of advancement . But great as the improvement has been in popular education , very iuuch still remains to be done . The advance has been greater in externals than in internals and essentials , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a suitable and attractive school-house , than it is to bring together in it the requisites for proper instruction . Skillful teachers and well constructed text books are difficult to be obtained , though there is no deficiency of either teachers or text books in point of uumbers ; but money can always command a good schoolhouse . A very high degree of excellence has been reached in the arrangements and conveniences of schoolhouses , and we can not see that any great improvements are called for in them . But there are numerous and glaring defects yet in our modes of education , which must // be remedied . Some changes even of a radical character are required . With these changes great improvements will be made also in text books , especially in those which are designed for younger scholars . And here a promising field opens for the efforts of minds of the highest order , and we hope that such minds will enter it more freely than has yet been done . Besides all this , much remains to be done in the perfecting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades in our system of education . We have written this article chiefly for the purpose of doing our part in bringing the noble example set in Norwich fully before the community , in order that it may be followed in other towns similarly situated ; and we hope that other periodicals will notice this enterprise , so that the facts may be widely dissemninated . We have also had in view the promotion of the cause of popular education generally , and should be glad to enter upon the consideration of some other topics briefly alluded to in the last few paragraphs , with others that they suggest , but it would make this Article too long .
