txt ART . IX . - PLUTARCH 'S Lives . The Translation called DRYDEN 'S , corrected and revised by A. H. CLOUGH sometime Fellow and Tutor of Oriel College , Oxford , and late Professor of the English Language and Literature at University College , London . In five vols . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1859 . As there are many more persons capable of appreciating portraits than there are who can understand or enjoy landscape-painting , so are the pupils of biography much more numerous than those of history . And as for the writers and readers of professed history , are not the most popular works from their pens or in their hands virtually biographies ? Lands and ages are described mainly by the memoirs of their representative men ; and it is not events or institutions , but personages , that sustain interest in the narrative . Dramatic power is no less essential to the historian who shall win the suifrages of the multitude , than to the play-writer whose productions shall obtain an enduring fame in the theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the student only . Niebuhr and Hallam , the most philosophical historians of any age , are dull simply because their narratives are to so great a degree impersonal ; while Macaulay 's pages fascinate young and old , the illiterate and the cultured alike , because he makes each individual actor play his part and tell his story in the public eye and ear . There is reason and right in this . Because it is so profoundly true , it is almost too trite to be repeated , that " the proper study of mankind is man . " Consciousness is the recipient and interpreter of history ; and consciousness identi-44* // fies or contrasts itself , not with external facts , nor with combined movements , nor with the phases of national life , but with the emotions and experiences of individuals . Every momentous incident , however multitudinous in its actors or its subjects , impersonates itself to our thought . It is Alexander that conquers the world . It is Napoleon Bonaparte that revolutionizes Europe , and Wellington that overthrows his empire . The subordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem of little more significance than the prompters or scene-shifters on the stage . We never feel that we comprehend a passage in history , till we have individualized it , so as to stand face to face with its one master-mind . As the nucleus to crystallization , so is the central figure to the orderly arrangement of dates , achievements , and events in the imagination and the memory . Our clear knowledge of particular epochs is designated , when we give them the names of the men who chiefly illustrated , adorned , or controlled them ; as when we speak of the age of Pericles , or Augustus , or Luther , or Elizabeth . The epochs which lack such personal names lie partly in shadow . Our chief difficulty in conceiving vividly of the history of our own times consists in the unfinished lives and the rival pretensions of its actors , - in the indeterminateness of the relative influence of minds constantly interacting upon one another in the development of passing events . Posterity alone can pronounce the names around which our annals will group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most profitable study in history . The man who gives character to his age is shaped by it and by antecedent ages . His mental and moral pedigree reaches back farther than the books of heraldry which we consult for his parentage . He has taken up into his life-circulation currents that have been flowing for countless centuries . He is the exponent , in great part , the resultant , the product , of more generations than have elapsed since his native language began to be spoken . He represents , in his peculiar sphere , what collective humanity has been , done , and attained in that sphere . In knowledge he stands on an eminence formed by the accumulated deposits of buried nations . In his // moral culture he is enriched by the experiences of the whole past . His resources have been brought together from the experiments , discoveries , and inventions of all preceding time . A profoundly learned jurist undertook , some fifty years ago , to write the history of the United States , and in dying left several huge manuscript parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced in the garden of Eden , and was arrested by his last illness in a narrative of the discovery of America . The life of an individual , to be truly written , must , in like manner , begin with Adam , and epitomize all the intervening ages ; not , indeed , in weary introductory volumes , or chapters , or even paragraphs , but in the biographer 's clear conception at once of human nature itself , and of the elements brought together by centuries to modify human nature in his particular subject . As to contemporary history , there is hardly need of the fashionable title , " Life and Times " ; for the " Life " can not be truly written without of necessity including the " Times . " Government , religious creed or faction , internatioiial relations , art , literature , the collective standard of society , the current tone of thought and speech , - all leave their record in personal experience , - all are reflected from the mental states , the doings and endurings , the opinions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth writing . The most strictly personal memoir presents a large section of local , national , and general history . No chronicles of contemporary or subsequent authorship will give remote posterity a view of society at the present epoch , which can be compared , in point of vividness and truth , with that which may be derived from a few assorted biographies of the men and women of our day . The recent memoir of Stephenson will transmit a knowledge of the wonderful revolutions wrought by the locomotive agency of steam , with its ramifications extending to every department of life , more accurate and thorough than will he conveyed in all the annals of our times that will be written . The life of Chalmers contains and suggests an amount of ecclesiastical history which , in a more general form , will not and can not be compiled . Irving 's Life of Washington embodies materials for a more comprehensive knowledge of the efficient causes , the // progress , the anirnus of the conflict in which our nation had birth , than can be drawn from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eventful period . In ethics also biography is the only effective teacher . The working power of an ethical system is its sole test , and the sole means of commending it to confidence and adoption . Xenophon did much more than Plato toward perpetuating the influence of Socrates on life and manners . The Socratic Dialogues are for the speculative student ; the Memorabilia for the mass of mankind . The Sacred Scriptures are conformed in their whole structure to this same law . The historical books of the Old Testament are , for the most part , a series of biographical sketches ; and their efficacy in the moral education of the ages is due almost wholly to their sharply drawn and vividly colored portraits of patriarchs , kings , and prophets , devout men and holy women , apostates , sinners , and miscreants . The New Testament closes the canon , and consummates the work of revelation , not by didactic essays , not by dogmatic exhibitions , but by incarnating all truth and all duty in a life Divine in its source , its powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its experiences . The highest ethical value can attach itself to biography only under the Christian revelation , and with reference to its perfect and immutable standard of excellence . If astronomical observations of permanent and universal utility are sought , the position of the observatory must first be ascertained ; and that position is determined , not alone by its bngitude , measured on varying parallels and from an arbitrary meridian , but by its latitude , reckoned on great and equal circles from the unchanging equator . Extra-Christian biography can give us only the longitude of a character as computed by a standard which has no validity of its own . Christian biography , when true to its calling , gives us latitude also , - distance from the eternally fixed equator , measured on arcs of those great circles which pass through both poles of the spiritual universe , and intersect all departments and conditions of human life . From characters thus determined , observations may be safely taken for guidance in duty and for defence against evil . Thus written , // biography becomes availing for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** Plutarch 's Lives , on all the grounds we have specified , - even , paradoxical as the assertion may seem , on the last ,  - -  claim still , as they have held for ages , a place second to no formal series of biographies that has ever seen the light . Monographs , indeed , there have been , in which the author has thrown all his power and skill into the portraiture of one individual , and which stand out as equally worthy memorials of the genius of the limner , and the strong or beautiful traits reproduced under his touch ; but no instance is there in which , with grace and felicity equal to Plutarch 's , the same hand has depicted so large a diversity of character , of unlike races , and of widely distant ages . In their historical character , these " Lives " certainly , at first sight , seem defective , and often untrustworthy . There is an occasional neglect of the order of time , and a grouping of events according to laws of association in the author 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or deeds which traditionally belong to another . He read Latin but imperfectly , and in his Roman biographies there can be no doubt that he in some instances misinterpreted his authorities . He had spent hut little time in Rome , and lacked minute conversance with the details of public affairs and of social life in the imperial city . But his few and rare mistakes are with relation to utterly unessential and insignificant particulars . He never misconceives a trait of character , or violates intrinsic probability , or departs from the analogy of admitted facts . This keen insight and just apprehension as to the inner life of his subjects imply and result from a clear historical vision , a distinct and adequate conception of the age and community to which his hero belongs . Hence his biography is history , inasmuch as no leading personage or strongly marked character can exist without embodying , or be portrayed without presenting , large , entire , and momentous chapters of history . The following paragraph , by George Long , one of Plutarch 's translators and commentators , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer . // " There must be some merit in a work which has entertained and instructed so many generations , which is read in so many languages , and by people of all conditions ; a work which delighted Montaigne and Rousseau , for it was one of the few books which Rousseau had never read without profit ; a work which amuses both young and old , the soldier and the statesman , the philosopher and the man who is busied about the ordinary affairs of life . The reason is , that Plutarch has rightly conceived the business of a biographer , - his biography is true portraiture . Other biography is often a dull , tedious enumeration of facts , in the order of time , with perhaps a summing up of character at the end . Such biography is portraiture also , but it is false portraiture ; the dress and the accessories put the face out of countenance . The reflections of Plutarch are neither impertinent nor trifling : his sound good sense is always there ; his honest purpose is transparent ; his love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will remain , in spite of all the fault that can be found with it by plodding collectors of facts and small critics , the book of those who can nobly think , and dare and do . It is the book of all ages , for the same reason that good portraiture is the painting of all time ; for the human face and the human character are ever the same . It is a mirror in which all men may look at themselves . " Admirable as Plutarch 's Lives are in their historical bearing , this is by no means their highest praise . It is perfectly evident that his primary purpose was the exhibition of conduct and character in their moral aspects , as worthy of approval and imitation , or amenable to censure . His discrimination is exquisitely keen . Fulsome praise and utter condemnation are equally alien from his genius and his plan . The foibles of his favorite heroes are portrayed with judicial impartiality . Crimes are related with their aggravating or palliating circumstances , while noble traits and generous acts are described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies , and the elevation of his own principles and motives . Especially are his comparative views of his Greek and Roman subjects rich in ethical wisdom . Witness the following passage from his comparison of Theseus and Romulus - " Both Theseus and Romulus were by nature meant for governors ; yet neither lived up to the true character of a king , but fell off and ran , the one into popularity , the other into tyranny , falling both into the same fault out of different passions . For a ruler 's first end is to maintam // his office , which is done no less by avoiding what is unfit than by observing what is suitable . Whoever is either too remiss or too strict , is no more a king or a governor , but either a demagogue or despot , and so he becomes either odious or contemptible to his subjects . Though certainly the one seems to be the fault of easiness and good-nature , the other of pride and severity . " If men 's calamities , again , are not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character , who will acquit either Theseus of rash and unreasonable anger against his son , or Romulus against his brother ? Looking at motives , we more easily excuse the anger which a stronger cause , like a severer blow , provoked . Romulus , having disagreed with his brother advisedly and deliberately on public matters , one would think could not on a sudden have been put into so great a passion ; but love and jealousy , and the complaints of his wife , which few men can avoid being moved by , seduced Theseus to commit that outrage upon his son . And what is more , Romulus , in his anger , committed an action of unfortunate consequence ; but that of Theseus ended only in words , some evil speaking , and an old man 's curse ; the rest of the youth 's disasters seem to have proceeded from fortune ; so that , so far , one would give his vote on Theseus 's part . " - Vol . I. pp. 79 , 80 . This passage is certainly worthy of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Plutarch 's Lives a single moral judgment which might not remain unchallenged if brought under review before the high tribunal of Christian ethics . Theodoret enumerates Plutarch among those heathen writers who had heard the Gospel , and transcribed many things from it into their books . His testimony is , indeed , too late to be received as proof of an authentic historical fact , and the Christian fathers were wont to make similar assertions of all philosophers and moralists whose dicta seemed to accord with the teachings of the New Testament . But the statement with regard to Plutarch is at least probable . Born at Cha*ronea in Bocotia , and residing there for the larger part of his lifetime , he was separated by no great distance from several communities of Christian converts in Greece . He studied at Athens at a period when St. Paul 's preaching on the Areopagus must have been fresh in the memory of many . He visited Egypt for the sole purpose of study , and can hardly have failed to resort to the famous school of Alexandria , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modified Platonism . In his essay on Superstition he evinces a thorough and minute acquaintance with the ceremonial part of Judaism , and it is incredible that he should have remained ignorant of that offshoot from Judaism which was spreading its vigorous branches in every part of the Roman empire . His Dialogue on the Delay of the Divine Justice is so eminently Christian in its whole course of reasoning , and in its intense solemnity of thought and style , that there is not one of the Fathers of the Church whose reputation would not have been enhanced by its authorship ; and even De Maistre , who has reconstructed it , expresses grave doubts whether his interpolations have rendered it more purely evangelical , - doubts which we are sure , with his judicious reader , will be decided in favor of the Pagan author , as more closely in accordance with the universal Christian belief and consciousness than his Roman Catholic editor . We can easily conceive , that , without the full presentation of the external evidences of Christianity which would lead to a conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the Gospels or other Christian writings , may have imbibed the spirit of their ethical teachings from the affinity of his own nature , and may have unconsciously adopted their standard for his judicial estimate of characters and deeds . However this may be , no Pagan writer before Christ gives evidence of a moral judgment so pure and true , of so profound a sense of the immutable right , and of so uniform a reference to it in the description of character and the narration of events and transactions . The known facts of Plutarch 's life are few . His family was of long standing and high reputation in his native city . He was probably born about the middle of the first century of the Christian era . His teacher at Athens was the philosopher Ammonius . At some period before A. D. 90 he was at Rome on public business , probably engaged in the prosecution of some claim or the advocacy of some petition in behalf of the municipality of which he was a citizen . He delivered , while at Rome , lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively in Italy . Suidas says that he was the tutor of the Emperor Trajan , and was invested by him with the // consular dignity ; but there is no other evidence of the fact , which is doubted or denied by all competent critics . The only collateral proof cited in behalf of this statement is a Latin epistle from Plutarch to Trajan , which is undoubtedly a forgery , for there is reason to believe that Plutarch was not sufficiently skilled in the Latin tongue to have written it . Moreover , Plutarch , in dedicating his Apophthegms to Trajan , says nothing of any special relation that had subsisted between the Emperor and himself . Plutarch was for a considerable time Archon of Cherona , a , and for many years a priest of Apollo , most probably officiating in that capacity at Delphi . He lived to a good old age . The date of his death is unknown , but it can not have been far from A. D. 120 . Plutarch was married , and had at least five children , of whom two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter addressed to his wife on the occasion of the death of a daughter , - it would seem an only daughter , - while he was absent from his family , presents him in the most amiable aspect as a husband and a father . We quote a portion of this letter , as given in the " Life of Plutarch , " in the first of the volumes now under review - " Plutarch to his wife , greeting : The messengers you sent to announce our child 's death apparently missed the road to Athens . I was told about my daughter on reaching Tanagra . Everything relating to the funeral I suppose to have been already performed ; my desire is that all these arrangements may have been so made as will now , and in the future , be most consoling to yourself . If there is anything which you have wished to do , and have omitted , awaiting my opinion , and think would be a relief to you , it shall be attended to , apart from all excess and superstition , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , let me hope that you will maintain both me and yourself within the reasonable limits of grief : What our loss really amounts to , I know and estimate for myself . But should I find your distress excessive , my trouble on your account will be greater than on that of our loss . I am not a stock or stone , ' as you , my partner in the care of our numerous children , every one of whom we have ourselves brought up at home , can testify . And this child , a daughter , born to your wishes after four sons , and affording me the opportunity of recording your name , I am well aware was a special object of affection. ** - Vol. 1 . pp. xi , xii . // This epistle closes with expressions of confident belief in immortality , - not in re-absorption into the soul of the universe , but in the continuance after death of individual , self-conscious life . If the writer had , either by books or through the living voice , become conversant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this intelligent faith , in the simple form in which he enunciates it , as contradistinguished from those modes of statement , so prevalent in extra-Christian philosophy both ancient and modern , in which immortality is a mere euphemism for annihilation . In harmony with the spirit of this extract are all Plutarch 's references to his kindred , He speaks with veneration of his father , makes his grandfather take an honored part in his Dialogues , and in his essay on " Affection between Brothers " he says : " For myself , that among the many favors for which I have to thank the kindness of fortune , my brother Timon 's affection to me is one , past and present , that may be put in the balance against all the rest , is what every one that has so much as met with us must be aware of , and our friends of course know well . " He seems also , as a neighbor , citizen , and office-bearer , to have been signally mindful of those lesser duties and services which make up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surest index of character . It is thus perfectly evident that the moral standard which he applied to remote and historical personages was none other than that habitually present to his consciousness , and supreme over his whole life . We can not but think of him as an eminently virtuous man , not only for his times , but for any land or age . As regards his intellectual adaptations , he seems to have been pre-eminently fitted for the description of literary labor which has given him his chief fame . Speculative philosophy was not within his province . He saw truth , not in its abstract formula , but as incarnated and verified in actual life . The best of his ethical works present principles in the concrete , and abound in supposed cases or illustrative examples , which he sometimes selects and arranges with exquisite skill , so as to make them consecutive links of a close chain of reasoning . The power of the " Delay of the Divine Justice " consists mainly in the appositeness and impressiveness with which the question is first opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of conspicuous instances in which retribution , because delayed , had been none the less sure , and only the more fearful and weighty . Where he departs from this method , his writings possess a much diminished value . A mind thus constituted , and a taste thus formed , could not but have found their most congenial work and won their highest fame in the department of pure biography . We must confess a very restricted acquaintance with Plutarch 's Greek style , one of his ethical treatises and a few excerpts from his " Lives " being all that we have read in the original . We are able , from this limited reading , to express our entire concurrence with the statement of one of his most erndite critics , that " his style is somewhat difficult to those who are not accustomed to it . " His sentences lack simplicity , symmetry , and directness . He is prone to redundency of verbiage , and this seemingly on two grounds , - from a natural proclivity to rhetorical ornament , and from his exceeding earnestness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also , no doubt , injuriously affected by the current Greek literature of his day , which lacked both the chasteness and the vigor of earlier times . The great work which is specially designated as Plutarch 's Lives consists of forty-six memoirs arranged in pairs , a Greek and a Roman together . The lives of each pair are generally followed by a comparison of their characters . In five instances this comparison is wanting ; and , as there is no apparent reason for the omission , it seems much more probable that these lacunw mark lost portions of the original work , than that they were left unfilled by the author . The Lives of Aratus , Artaxerxes , Mnemon , Galba , and Otho are ordinarily printed with the forty-six , but seem to have been independent compositions . Several memoirs , known to have been written by Plutarch , - some of them perhaps included in the compilation under review , - are lost beyond recovery . There is extant a Life of Homer bearing Plutarch 's name ; but its genuineness as his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Plutarch 's ; but the very quotations that he makes would seem to designate the hand of a hair-splitting grammarian and logician , rather than of a liberal and high minded biographer . // The " Lives " have been often translated . Amyot 's French version , which appeared in 1559 , was the basis of Sir Thomas North 's English translation , which was published in 1612 , and which , though by no means to be commended for its accuracy , and of course the more liable to error from its double transfusion , has been justly admired for its beauty of style . The English version of John and William Langhorne has been often reprinted , and is to be found in many libraries in this country . The " Translation called Dryden 's " - the basis of the edition now before us - is Dryden 's only in its title . It is the work of many hands , the great poet having only lent it the sanction of his name , and written the Dedication to the Duke of Ormond , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in commending the edition just issued by the Boston firm , to whose liberal taste and munificent enterprise the American public are so largely indebted . Mr. Clough is well known as a thorough classical scholar , and a painstaking editor . Of the extent of his labors in revision we have not the means of forming an estimate , as we have at hand only the version of the Langhornes with which to make the comparison . But this comparison is very strongly in favor of Clough 's Dryden , both on the score of fluency and idiomatic freshness of style , and of manifest fidelity to the turns of expression and the minute shades of thought in the original Greek . This new edition is characterized in its mechanical execution by substantial elegance . Each volume has an appendix , containing the names of the translators of the several lives contained in it , with supplementary notes , in addition to the foot-notes found in connection with the text . To the fifth volume are appended a copious alphabetical index , and a key to the pronunciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition will revive an interest - perhaps on the wane with the present generation - in a series of memoirs by far the most noteworthy in the literature of either ancient or modern times . No youth should deem himself liberally educated who is not familiar with Plutarch . As an adept in the concrete philosophy of ' human nature , he can never be dethroned from his eminence among the great moral teachers of our race . His " Lives " have also // an independent value , as making his readers incidentally acquainted with a very large amount of ancient literature . He quotes not far from two hundred and fifty writers , about one third of whom are known only or chiefly by citations in the works of other authors . His labors , extending from the mythical age of Greece and the more than semi-mythical era of the foundation of Rome down to his own generation , furnish collectively a large and almost a connected compend of Greek and Roman history , every leading epoch being brought into the clearest light in the person of its prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only as a teacher in history and in morals , but as an example for modern biographers . He had the just seiise of proportion , and the regard for the limited receptivity of readers , which are almost wholly wanting in the biographical literature of our own day . His " Lives " are all of a commendable brevity , and confine themselves to the salient traits , the characteristic acts , and the public relations of his heroes . His reticence was indeed necessary with regard to his earlier subjects ; but as to the later , he had access to materials that might have quadrupled or increased tenfold the bulk of his labors upon them . He might , by crowding his pages with the paltry gossip of times near his own , have gratified the prurient curiosity of his contemporaries ; but this would have so loaded down his work with matter of ephemeral interest , that it would have passed into early neglect , and might have been submerged beneath the rickety arches of the frail bridge on which but a small portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival of learning . The great men of our own generation are , many of them , sure to be thrust into oblivioii by the very means employed to perpetuate their memory . These memoirs of several massive volumes ; these prolix chapters , devoted to the details of pedigree , the pranks and follies and whippings of childhood , the minutke of courtship and of housekeeping ; these masses of trivial correspondence ; these sweepings of desks and commonplace-books , - owe their brief importance , not to any healthy or permanent interest , but to a kind of curiosity which is rife only while a distinguished name is fresh on the lips and memory of the public . In the 45 * // climax of regret and reverence which ensues upon the death of a distinguished personage , everything that appertained to him is eagerly read by his friends and admirers , - by those who shared his opinions , seconded his measures , or were proud of his fame . But the next generation will have its own cluster of favorites , its own budget of honored memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthened memoirs of those whom it never knew in life , and whose places are already more than filled by new claimants for their regard . We are in intense need of Plutarchs for our own dead , if we would have their names held in enduring reverence among those who shall succeed us . It would be a matter of not unworthy inquiry , how large a proportion of biographical volumes remain uncut on the shelves of private and public libraries . Our own observation assures us that the purchasers of such books far outnumber the readers . A definition logically consists of the generic character and the specific difference . In biography the former may for the most part be left to inference ; it is with the latter only that readers are concerned , - it is the latter only that posterity will wish to know . That which constitutes the e-miuence of the person whose life is written , - that wherein he towered toto capite above his contemporaries , - that which constituted the specific grounds for his success or his reputation , - is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction holds an official place with reference to his own and succeeding generations ; and the public are concerned to know what that place was , and how he filled it . Every good man is , in certain aspects , an example for those around him and for those who come after him ; and the interests of virtue demand that those aspects shall be clearly represented by his biographer , and not obscured by a mass of utterly irrelevant and perplexing detail . Every prominent actor in the important affairs of church , state , or society subtends in his life a certain arc of an historical cycle , - constitutes in part , in chief , or in whole a portion of the history of his times ; and posterity need access to the history which he created , which he was , and are wronged and defrauded if that history be made illegible by interpolations which never had the slightest sig // nificance beyond a restricted clique of kindred and intimates . These prolix biographies , it is often said , are accumulating materials for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mythical personage impossible , unless he shall be a Hercules in his working force , and a Methuselah in the years allotted for his life-task . There are also considerations of delicacy to which a biographer should not be insensible . There are portions of every man 's life which he would shrink from laying open to public inspection . Why should death remove the seal with which in life the most obtrusive inquisitiveness would not dare to tamper ? There are almost always kindred and friends whose sensibilities are lacerated by such exposure . No man would willingly live in a house of glass . Why should the walls of a great man 's dwelling be made transparent as soon as he is translated from it ? The portions of the life that are by the common instinct kept from day to day sacred from the public gaze , should remain inviolate . Confidential interviews , communications designed for no third person , should be promulgated only under the demand of some great public necessity . Foibles that were veiled from open view should be doubly veiled when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence , often carelessly worded , interspersed with familiar badinage , betraying transient states of feeling which would not have been committed to writing except for the most friendly eye , is the property of the writer , and is stolen and thrown out to the world only by a dishonesty like that which would rifle a dead man 's purse or wardrobe . Papers for personal use , memoranda , unfinished writings , - such materials as , in their owner 's keeping , would never have seen the light , or not without extensive revision and modification ,  - -  are in no just sense public property after the owner 's death ; and it is sacrilege to his fair fame to commit them to the press . Sins of this class deface the greater portion of recent biographical literature , and play a traitor 's part with the well-earned reputation of their subjects . It is high time for our critical journals to take severe cognizance of such outrages , and to vindicate for the dead the rights which are no less theirs because they can no longer guard their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
