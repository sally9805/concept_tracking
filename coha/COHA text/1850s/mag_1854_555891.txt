txt ART . X. - Memoirs , Speeches , and , Writings of ROBERT RANTOUL* JR . Edited by LUTHER HAMILTON . Boston : John P. Jewett &amp; Co. 1834. 8vo. pp. 864 . THE materials of this bulky volume are put together in an unusual and somewhat unskilful manner . We expected to find in it a memoir of the person to whom it relates , followed by a collection of his speeches and writings , arranged either chronologically or in the order of their topics . But the editor has preferred to give us a long and rather cumbrous and dull // essay on the character and political services of Mr. Rantoul , in which are inserted , here and there , his speeches , essays , and other literary productions , without the slightest regard to their dates , and yet not altogether at random , as they serve to illustrate the diffuse commentary in which they are irnbedded . This seems to us an inversion of the natural order of things . The commentary is usually written and arranged to illustrate the text ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of Mr. Rantoul 's legal arguments , delivered in April , 1852 , on a point of constitutional law , is inserted in the second chapter of the book , because the editor happens there to be considering him as a lawyer ; while several other speeches on precisely the same topic , and delivered within the same year , are postponed to the ninth and tenth chapters , because there the editor is regarding him as he appeared in Congress and before public meetings of his constituents . An occurxence in the earlier part of his political life is quite as likely to be treated of at the end of the book as at its beginning . Of course , this odd arrangement , or want of arrangement , subjects every one who reads or consults the book to considerable inconvenience . If he is in search of the record of some event in Mr. Rantoul 's career , as the work has no index except a very imperfect one of the speeches and essays , he may be obliged to wander an hour in this wilderness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he has unearthed one passage about it , he can not be sure , till he has turned over every other page in the volume , that it does not come up for a second and more elaborate consideration else*There . Inconvenient as this arrangement is , however , we have less cause to complain of it , as applied to Mr. Rantoul 's writings , than we should have in almost any other case that has come within our knowledge . Our interest in him arises rather from what he was , than from what he accomplished ; we look rather to the history of his mind and the character of his opinions , than to the history of his outward acts . And the arrangement of the contents of this book is not ill calculated to satisfy a curiosity of this sort . It gives us a record of his life , by considering in succession the great enterprises to which he de // voted himself , following each with great earnestness and pertinacity , and finding satisfaction for his ardent temperament more in the eagerness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united two characters , which are not often found together , at least in this country ; he was at the same time an ardent politician and an independent thinker . He was devoted to his party , and labored zealously for its advancement ; but he often sacrificed his own interests with that party , by laboring with equal zeal for other objects , which his political associates either disapproved of , or held in light esteem . We borrow a faithful portraiture of him in this respect from a letter , inserted in this volume , written by one who knew and esteemed him , without sharing many of his political opinions . " He was one of those politicians , rare in any land , hardly to be spoken of in the plural number in America , who sacrifice their ambition to their ideas . Conscious , as he must have been , of great powers , and evidently ambitious of high position , he became a Democrat in ililiassacli usetts , where his party was in a hopeless minority , and when to favor free trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having thus cut himself off from all but strict party support , he alienated his political friends by a frank advocacy of the temperance cause , which , it is not unjust to say , has never been a favorite with the Democratic party here . Plainly told , by its leaders in 1888 , that , if he supported the fifteen-gallon ' law , he did it at his peril , he neither relented nor kept silent , but by his zeal provoked an opposition so malignant and undying , that , in every emergency afterward , to the very last year of his life , it made a point of thwarting him , and was often able , by the command of a few hundred votes , to defeat his election . " There was one element of Massachusetts favor left which a prudent politician would have been careful to secure , - the good opinion of the orthodox sects . These , again , Mr. Rantoul alienated , by his untiring advocacy of the abolition of capital punishment . They had looked coldly and with some suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Education ; and any common politician , however desirous to ameliorate penal legislation , would have contented himself with one frank expression of his feelings , and then have dropped the unwelcome subject . But Mr. Rantoul incurred the hostility of the strongest and most unforgiving of sects , by his unwavering , enthusiastic , outspoken opposition to the gallows ; whether in the legislature or out of it ; before // legislative committees ; through the press and in conventions , - often making opportunities where he did not find them " He never made hollow pledges to gain votes , and when he had once uttered a sentiment or made a pledge , no one thought it necessary to watch him , certain that he would more than fulfil his promise , and that , in the position he had taken , or in advance of it , you would be sure to find him , no matter how long your absence . In our political arena these are rare merits . " - pp. 855 , 856 . The first chapter of this volume , not written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rantoul , is to us the most interesting portion of the book . It carries the sketch of his life and character only up to the period of his graduation at college ; but it is written with much taste and discrimination , and brings out very clearly the early manifestations of his peculiar character . His life was not a long one , and the few incidents in it may be very quickly told . Robert Rantoul , Jr . was born in Beverly , in this State , on the 5th of August , 1805 . He seems to have inherited from his mother an ingenuous disposition , a warm and open heart , a sincere reverence for the truth , and great frankness in the expression of his opinions . These traits were conspicuously displayed in the course of his education , and were characteristic of him throughout his subsequent career . He was trained at school by a teacher who encouraged him to think for himself ; and heunconsciously formed the habit , which all his later experience tended to strengthen , of acting upon his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those around him , however qualified they might seem , by age , station , or relationship , to guide his conduct . He was an amiable , but could not have been a docile pupil . After finishing his preparatory studies at Phillips Academy , Andover , he entered the Freshman class at Harvard College in 1822 , and was graduated in due course , though without distinction as a scholar , four years afterwards . Both at school and college , though an indefatigable student , he took little rank in his class , because he persisted in studying by himself the subjects in which he was interested , and paying little attention to the regular exercises of the place . Thus his training was irregular , but his acquisitions were large and varied . His // temperament was ardent , and his thirst for knowledge so great that he accumulated stores of information upon subjects which , to young men , have usually little interest . He paid considerable attention to the languages of Continental Europe , and studied the medkeval history of France , and the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earnest in his convictions , *his political creed was already fully formed , and , as might have been expected , it differed widely from that of his nearest friends and associates . Because his opinions did not coincide with those of the majority , he clung to them with the stronger attachment , and defended them with an earnestness that came near to vehemence . Thus , to persons who did not know him intimately , he might have appeared wilful and wrong-headed ; but this impression was removed from those who were admitted to his privacy , and who recognized in him great sweetness of disposition , an unselfish heart , and peculiar delicacy as well as strength of feeling . The character which might seem too vehement and overbearing in public business took on an aspect of almost feminine gentleness at his own fireside . Perhaps this union of affectionateness in private life with very decided opinions and great warmth as well as pertinacity of purpose , is more frequent than people usually imagine ; strength of feeling and ardor of temperament lie at the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are manifested quietly , because they have their appropriate food and meet with no impediment ; in the other , they are fretted by opposition , and concentrated by obstacles till they gather strength to burst through them . After leaving college , Mr. Rantoul adopted the profession of the law , which he studied in Salem , and practised for some years in Gloucester , and afterwards in Boston . He was a successful , though not an eminent lawyer , for his heart was devoted to politics , and a case in court did not call forth all his powers unless it turned upon some political principle . He was , also , too independent in forming his opinions , and too frank in the expression of them , to obtain rapid success even in his chosen career . In our democratic country , he who as-* pire* to lead the people must begin by manifesting a dis // position to follow them very implicitly . But the native vigor of Mr. Rantoul 's understanding and the strength of his character forced their way through all obstacles . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate of the United States , and was regularly elected , in 1851 , a representative of his native district in Congress . Few men have qualified themselves for the v*cation of a legislator more carefnlly than he did , by minute and extensive study of public affairs . There may have been traces of one serious defect in his method of investigation , - that of stndying less as an inquirer after new truth , than as a searcher for new arguments and facts wherewith to sustain his previously formed opinions . This is an error which quick and earnest minds are peculiarly liable to commit ; they first choose their side from impulse , and afterwards resort to argument to strengthen their position . The politician who attaches himself firmly to a party can hardly avoid falling into this blnnder , and thus sacrificing his mental integrity to his political consistency . It was not , however , as an earnest partisan , but as a quick and independent thinker , that Mr. Rantoul was sometimes led to erroneous conclusions . As we have seen , the ties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his convictions , but he sometimes formed them too rashly , and then adhered to them with the chivalrous feeling that induces the sailor to nail his colors to the mast . Mr. Rantoul 's career in Congress was a short one . He had had opportunity to show his talents as a ready and formidable debater , but not to produce his store of carefully acquired information upon subjects in which he was specially interested , when he was struck by the disease that carried him off , at the age of forty-seven . The volume before us , therefore , is only the record of what he had done before his faculties had reached their highest stage of development . If he had edited it himself , he would doubtless have omitted a good deal which has been inserted in it by the partiality of the compiler and the affection of friends , anxious to preserve even the slightest memorials of one who was so much beloved . Still , it is the honorable monument of a fine understanding , great industry , and lofty aims . Mr. Rantoul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took comprehensive views of the great interests of mankind , and devoted himself with singular ardor and perseverance to furthering the enterprises upon which the amelioration of society depends . Foremost among these is the great cause of popular education , in promoting which Mr. Rantoul was an early and efficient laborer . Soon after he left college , he projected what is believed to have been the first Lyceum that was established in New England . He was a member for six years of the first Board of Education in Massachusetts , created by law in 1836 ; and he contributed largely , by his advice and his pen , to the extraordinary success of its earliest measures . An elaborate article contributed by him to this journal , in 1838 , shows how long he had meditated upon this subject , how much information he had collected respecting it , and how judicious were his views as to the machinery of public instruction and the means of keeping it in action . His cooperation in this work was very important , as he was a virtual representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the project depended in a great degree on all parties and sects being enlisted in its support . He wrote an introductory essay for " The School Library , " a series of works published under the sanction of the Board ; and his opening discourse , delivered before the American Institute of Instruction in 1839 , and republished in this volume , is an able and eloquent exposition of the advantages to be expected from a well-regulated system of common schools . On the whole , his services in this cause will be remembered and held in honor , long after most of the causes of dispute which gave the tone to his political labors have passed into oblivion . Another national concern in which he was deeply interested , was the establishment of an extensive system of internal improvements . On this subject , he abandoned the traditional policy of his political associates , and therefore thought it necessary to defend his opinions with the largest possible array of facts and arguments . The most elaborate speech that he delivered in Congress was " on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In this ar // gument , as well as in two or three speeches upon the banking system , delivered in the Legislature of Massachusetts , we find an imposing and pertinent array of well-digested statistics , and a clear , though not very comprehensive , grasp of the leading principles of what may be called the English theory of Political Economy . That this theory needs to be materially modified before it can be applied to the circumstances and the institutions of the people of this country , is a truth which Mr. Rantoul may have recognized , but he did not , to any great *xtent , act upon it . His argument upon the subject of internal improvements is able and eloquent ; that upon banks is ingenious and plausible , but it fails to command our assent , and has been in a certain degree refuted by larger experience . Neither as a speaker nor as a writer did Mr. Rantoul pay any special attention to the garb of his thoughts ; he was too earnest in the pursuit of his object , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to edit his own works , he might have retrenched many superfluities , and corrected some inaccuracies , of expression . But he was always perspicuous , forcible , and thoroughly in earnest . These qualities , united with a fine person , an expressive countenance , and a not ungraceful delivery , always commanded the attention and respect of his audience . The early death of such a man is a loss , not only to his immediate friends and the political circle to which he belonged , but to his native State and the Union at large . In his principles and aims , he belonged to the higher and better class of our leading politicians , - to those who aspire to become the leaders , rather than the slavish followers , of the people . What he believed he earnestly inculcated , whatever might be its effects upon the interests of his party or upon his own advancement . If his life had been prolonged , he would probably have attained high distinction in the national councils ; cut off prematurely , as he was , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and merit the gratitude of his countrymen . We ought not to close without taking a brief extract from the volume before us , which may serve to illustrate Mr. Rantoul 's style of thought and expression . The following is an // admirable address , which he wrote , to the " Workingmen " of the United States , and which was published in the " Workingmen 's Library . " He has been speaking of the various claims which the persons whom he addresses may rightfully set up , and he now comes to consider their right to respect . " The kinds of respect we may claim , the effects we may expect to result from it , are either of a public or a private nature . I. Private . The respect which is shown in social intercourse is grateful to him that receives it , and the denial of it. , where it is expected , is sometimes exceedingly galling . We have a rinht to associate with those whose company is agreeable to us . Others have also the same right to associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the principle of equal rights , there fore , no association should take place which is not perfectly agreeable to both parties : and this rule being admitted and acted on , this difficult and sometimes embarrassing subject will easily regulate itselfi I may be as good and as wise and as polite withal , as another man , yet if my company is unpleasant to him , it does not become me to thrust myself upon him . His time and presence are his own , not to be intruded on by any man , just as my time and presence are my own , and sacred from all intrusion . It is not the amount of intelligence or the degree of worth that leads particular sets of persons into each other 's society : it is identity of pursuits or similarity of tastes , feelings , and manners , that naturally draws them together . If an artist seeks the company of a brother artist , he does not intend thereby any thing derogatory to the parson of the parish . If a broker falls into conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for the opinions of the lawyer , but because two persons of the same calling can find topics at once in which they feel a common interest . If students resort to each other 's company , it is not that they mean to reflect upon the merchant , but because so many of his interests are unintelligible to them , and so many of their notions are Greek to him . Forced association is any thing rather than pleasant or profitable . These extreme instances sufficiently illustrate the general principle , that it is congeniality of tastes and feelings by which association must be regulated : they show also , that this principle exists in human nature , and is not an artificial arrangement of society , as some have supposed : that it is therefore unalterable , and need not be a subject of regret or complaint any more than the law of gravitation . Mistakes no doubt will occur in the application of this principle , but of all weak and puerile repinings , the weakest and most childish for a man to indulge would seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited into this or that set . If our tastes , feelings , and manners are congenial to theirs , so soon as that fact is discovered , no doubt we shall be ; if they are not thus congenial , it is more for our comfort , as well as theirs , that we should not be . Whether we are or are not , should be of little moment . There are more sets than one in the world , in which intelligent and honest people are to be met with , and we shall feel much more at our ease where our presence is esteemed as a favor , than where the propriety of our company is looked upon as in the least degree equivocal . It is no great hardship , I say , and every sensible man will admit it , not to be invited into a new set quite so soon as we think our accomplishments deserve ; but if by the power of public opinion , the force of ridicule , or by any other means , a new set attempt to thrust themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates is impudently invaded , and then indeed we have serious ground of complaint . But though we have a right to choose our own associates , and are therefore bound in duty not to intrude on others , yet whenever business or accident brings us into intercourse with others , we have a right to be treated with all the deference which it becomes equals to show each other . Not only our interests but our feelings should be respected , and the best way to secure the respect we deserve is invariably to show to others all the respect which they deserve . We bave a right , also , to all the influence which our virtues and talents will enable us to exercise . This our just share of influence we should be careful to preserve by making a wise use of it , the neglect of this precaution being the fault by which our brethren in other countries have lost it , as often as fortunate circumstances have put them in possession of it . We should jealously guard this right , and suffer neither wealth nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of influence . An aristocracy of wealth is impossible in a country where the property of an intestate father is divided equally among his children . An aristocracy of poverty is quite as impossible , and equally undesirable . In Catholic countries , voluntary poverty has sometimes been held in honor , and its professors have arrived at great influence in the state . A workingmen 's party regard poverty as an evil to be avoided , and though , when involuntary , it implies no disgrace , for no man can be blamed for what he can not help , yet when voluntary it is always disgraceful . This being the case , if wealth alone is no recommendation , so neither is poverty ; and if poverty alone should not diminish the respect paid to honor , virtue , and talents , so neither should wealth . The envy , therefore , which makes a mean spirit hate another 's success , even though allied to shining merit , is as unbecoming as the servile self-abasement which worships at the altar of Mammon . Let us banish from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect wherever we recognize merit . Let us pay most deference where we meet most desert , and allow most influence to those who use it best .
