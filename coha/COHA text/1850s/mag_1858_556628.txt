txt ART . XI . -1 . The Story of the Telegraph , and a History of the Great Atlantic Cable . By CHARLES F. BRIGG5 and AUGUSTUS MAVERICK . New York : Rudd and Carleton. 1858. 2 . The Atlantic Teleo.raph : a Discourse delivered in the First Church , August 8 , 1858 . By EZRA S. GANNETT . Boston : Crosby , Nichols , &amp; Co. 1858 . WE were among those who had no faith in the speedy success of the great enterprise of which these titles are the memorials . We knew that very many conditions must be essential to the completion of the work ; and supposed that of those conditions there must needs be not a few which could be revealed only by a series of failures , each fruitless attempt suggesting some provision or precaution before unthought of . We therefore neglected the preparation , which we would else have made , for the scientific historiography of the telegraph . The details of the several experiments , and the daily operations of the last , are already familiar to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named at the head of this article . Of Dr. Gannett 's eloquent sermon we shall speak before we close . Our present design is to present certain general views of human art , suggested by this its last , most stupendous triumph , and to determine so far as we may its probable results as regards business and the intercourse of nations . // 533 1858 . It is a sfrongly marked feature of the various public recognitions of the event under discussion , that the Divine agency has held the foremost place in men 's thoughts . Never has it been more profoundly felt that there is but one Creator . This is , indeed , the truth that underlies all discoveries and inventions . Man creates nothing ; he only finds and uses what God has made . He confers no properties ; he only ascertains and applies inherent properties . We talk familiarly of raw material . There is none . If there were , it would for ever remain unchanged . What we call by that name has in it all that is ever developed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarry in parallel strata , with crys* tals so grouped and separated as to invite the very cleavage they receive , and the blocks in which they are laid are bounded by natural divisions of the mother rock . The veins and fibres of our trees guide , rather than yield to , the axe , the lathe , and the plane ; and they might have been of essentially the same substance , and yet so gnarled and knotted that the accumulated science of centuries could not have learned to shape them . The city is as truly an outcropping from the soil as the wheat-harvest . Its embryo as truly lay in quarries , forests , and clay-pits , as did the embryo of the corn-crop just gathered lie last winter in the cultivator 's granary . Our silk we could not wind for use , had it not been first reeled on the cocoon with a delicacy far surpassing our finest handwork . We make no dye s , but dip our raiment in brilliant and enduring hues beautiful as the rainbow or the sunset clouds , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The down of the cotton-plant gives to the superficial eye no better promise for the spinner than that of the common Aselepias , and of many other plants that subserve no human purpose ; but it is capable of being spun and woven by virtue of its length of staple , its curliness , which enables it to bear the strong pulling of the machinery without breaking , and the minute teeth with which its fibres are fringed , and without which no force would suffice to keep it twisted . The steam-engine , that most versatile of mechanical agents , - now bearing on its fire-wings costly freights and migrating multitudes across the waste of waters , now // twisting a gossamer thread or mending a web , - is but an intensifying , yet in miniature , an imprisoning , and harnessing to the industrial yoke , of the very process of alternate evaporation and condensation , by which the waters circulate through air , earth , and ocean in an unceasing and omnipresent life-tide . In close analogy with these instances , the telegraph is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor an invention of this century . The agent which it employs has always been used for the very service in which it has now been installed . It has been the medium of all communication between mind and matter , brain and muscle , brain and brain ; and in the phenomena of mesmerism and of pseudo-spiritualism , there is at least some reason to believe that , along air-lines and for indefinite distances , thoughts and words are sent with as unerring fidelity as marks their transmission on the artificial lightning-path . By the connection now established between distant cities and opposite hemispheres , we have but arrested , for a special subdivision of one among its many departments of service , a force which throbs from zone to zone , leaps from sky to earth , darts from earth to ocean , courses in the sap of the growing tree , runs along the nervous tissue of the living man , and can be commanded for the speaking wires simply because it is and works everywhere . In estimating the Creator 's part in the achievements of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adaptation of man 's physical structure to the purposes of art . There are , in one of our devotional hymns , two lines , peculiarly childish in sound , which yet contain the whole theory of civilization , and expound the earthly position and destiny of man , - " Why was my body formed erect , Whilst brutes bow down to earth " Were it not for this difference , man might be possessed of all the native intellectual capacity he now has , and yet could gain scarce any accurate knowledge of the universe , could embody his ideas only in the rudest forms , could transmit very little of experience and wisdom , or their resu ts , from generation to generation , and could bequeath to his imme // diate posterity hardly anything more precious than some rude booth or burrowing-place . Man is , we suppose , the feeblest animal on earth in proportion to his size , yet easily walks as sovereign , chains the behemoth to his march , tows the leviathan by his warp , makes the everlasting hills bow before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant forces of universal nature . And it is chiefly by means of the hand , - by the eleva ion , ex ansion , and more complex organization of the very digits , which we trace in less perfect development in the anterior limbs of every quadruped . The hand , - so slender and flexible that it might seem fitted neither for doing nor enduring , but whose closely knit webwork of nerves and sinews concentrates the entire strength of the body , and wields a greater force compared with its magnitude than is found in the whole world beside ,  --  combining all mechanical powers in one , the fingers jointed levers , the sinews pulleys , the wrist-joint a perpetual screw , without whose ball and socket movement no screw of steel could find its way into its bed , - one moment lifting heavy weights or striking ponderous blows , and the next subserving the most delicate uses , dissecting the microscopic proportions of a flower-cup or an insect 's wing , marking with the graver air-lines subtile as sunbeams , copying the vanishing hues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forms so ethereal that they might seem traced by the breath of viewless spirits , - this is the machine which renders all other machines possible , this the prehensile and shaping agency by which Nature is put to the torture for her secrets and to the test for her resources , this the means and pledge of man 's viceroyalty upon the earth . There is no mechanical operation , whether of ruder handcraft or of the highest art , the capacity of which is not inherent in the hand , the direction of which is not one of the complex movements of which the hand is susceptible , the efficacy of which does not depend in the last resort on the guidance or restraint of the hand . Thus , when we make water or steam take the place nominally of the hand , it really supplies not manual skill , but simply a substitute for muscular power . With the living hand we construct the engine or machine ; we copy in it some portion // Oct. of the divinely shaped pair , or rather , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruments comprehended within our two wrist-joints and palms and our ten digits ; and then with our own hands we start , accelerate , or check the working of these artificial hands , - barely supplying to these last from the impetus of falling water or expanding steam the force which accrues to human muscles from the economy of the vital organism . But this is not all . The intellectual development which issues in art is not spontaneous ; but its seeds are connate with the human mind . There might be mental capacity , which would seldom issue in material skill . There might be a curiosity as to outward nature , which could ask questions without finding answers to them . There might in the realm ' of intellect be a perpetual flowering without ripened fruit . We owe our scientific knowledge , and the art resulting from it , not to mere power of mind , but to those innate ideas , those shaping matrices of thought , those inevitable categories , which in each department are a Divine directory for our inquiries and researches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius would be equally bewildered and unguided with the infant or the idiot . Without this element which the mind supplies , not from its culture , but from its essence , we might reason inductively from observed facts ; but should have no sense of intrinsic probability to suggest our experiments , and thus the acquisition of an item of knowledge would be merely a happy accident . Thus alike by the nature of matter , the capacities of the body , and the laws of mind , are the achievements of art prepared for by the Infinite Creator , and Philosophy must shape her literal formula in close accordance with the ascription of every devout heart ,  --  " Of Him , and through Him , and to Him are all things . " While man 's part in what are termed his inventions and discoveries is shown to be thus small , even this diminished glory is divided , and can seldom with justice attach itself to any one great name . It is less an historical fact than the exponent of an essential law , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been dis // puted , - that every niche in the temple of art has rival claimants , often from different lands , each with an equally plausible title to the undetermined place . It is the age , not the individual man , that discovers or invents . The preceding age has lifted the veil from the unknown just so far , that the next fold to be upturned covers what will startle nations , introduce new modes of activity , offer new commodities or benefits to the race . It is a question of paltry moment , whether Professor Morse conceived the first idea of the electric telegraph , or whether he barely embodied a pregnant suggestion of Dr. Jackson . Electro-magnetism had revealed phenomena which pointed to this agency . Its facts ascertained by experiment had no corollary but this . A hundred minds in Europe and America were charged with thoughts , which must have had this issue . Had neither Morse nor Jackson been in the field of science , the discovery could not have been held back a year later . Ten years earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One or the other of them but uttered the word , which had been shaping itself for articulation from Franklin 's first experiment , and which , already spelled out by the joint agency of more philosophers than we can name , would at all events not have remained unspoken . And , the wire once stretched from city to city , the question of the ocean telegraph was hardly a question of time . The probability was obvious . The attempt was inevitable . Brave and skilful men have made it , and they merit our profoundest gratitude . But any or all of them might have kept aloof , and yet science would have indicated , commerce would have dictated , philanthropy would have demanded , and competent ability would have conducted the trial . It was the necessary next step in material development . We say not this to detract from the praise due to those whose names are so intimately connected with this miracle of science and art . But it is their highest praise that they receive their laurels in devout humility , and are foremost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inception , and has crowned the consummation , of their enterprise . And the Providential men of each stage of human progress deserve to stand forth before their contemporaries , and to send their 46 * // names down to posterity , as the representative men of their times , as the types of the mind of the age , as the called and anointed co-workers with Him who leads on the race in the conquest and use of the world 's resources . We fear not to write of the oceanic telegraph as an achieved and certain success , though , while we write , no pulse has for several days been transmitted across the waters . The connection may have been broken , - we trust not ; - the capital expended may be irrevocably sunk , - we believe and hope not ; - but , if it be so , the fact has been established that the words of man can emulate the speed of light , and anticipate the flight of the hours . The communication , if not permanently effected now , can command for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilized world . Ere long , the earth will be girdled . The longer , but shallower ocean-route , with its intermediate station on one of the Western Isles , is already projected , and , in case equally of the success or the failure of the present line , will be speedily attempted . No sooner will the wires have crossed our continent than the cable will be sunk with assured confidence in the quiet waters of the Pacific , led to some island in the intervening archipelago , and thence landed on the Asiatic shore . These vast distances overpassed , we may anticipate the establishment of shorter lines between every pair of great capitals and commercial emporiums . Meanwhile , it can hardly be that there will not be devised means of more rapid articulation , by which intelligence may send its simultaneous flash around the globe , so that the age is not far remote , when events transpiring in every portion of the civilized world shall have their daily chronicle , their hourly bulletin , in each . What are to be the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be assured , that , however magnificent may be our horoscope , experience will transcend it . This has been the case with all great inventions , - with the printing-press , the telescope , the steam-engine , the cotton-gin , the power-loom . And , not infrequently , some incidental or unanticipated use or consequence of a new or improved process of art has thrown into the background or superseded the specific purpose to which it was dedicated at the outset . // Undoubtedly , a very few years will develop from the electromagnetic intercourse between the continents altered relations , customs of trade , maxims of international law , forms of concurrent action , modes of manifesting to the sense and representing to the imagination the virtual ubiquity realized , yet passing thought , and substantial benefits of a moral and spiritual character , of which we have as yet no intimation . In addition to these vague anticipations of the graver sort , we can conceive of festive aspects of the future , in which the magnetic wires will play a principal part . " Simultaneous celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some world-honored anniversary the London bells should be rung by an operator in Boston , or a salute be fired on the New York Battery by a spark sent from the coast of Ireland . Less improbable than the event which has given occasion to this paper would be the interchange of these jubilant international courtesies at the same moment among all the leading nations on both sides of both oceans , day no longer " uttering speech unto day " alone , but noon to midnight , with half the globe 's circumference between . As for commerce , opinions that ought to be sound are divided as to the consequences of the oceanic telegraph , - whether it will issue in the monopoly or the diffusion of intelligence , in a more eager and hazardous , or a more measured and sober competition ; in more wary and discreet habits of business , or in more rash and reckless speculation . On this question we lelong to both parties , adopt both opinions , anticipate both results , - the less favorable at the outset , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit , afterwards the general good . So long as there is but one electro-magnetic cable crossing the ocean , and that - apart from the reserved rights of governments - under the control of a close corporation , and working at a comparatively low rate of speed , it is hardly possible that its services should not be monopolized by individuals or cliques , and employed to transmit intelligence to certain privileged parties in advance of the tardier means of knowledge on which the many must still rely . But with rival lines , and enhanced rapidity of transmission , exclusive privilege must cease , and // all whose transactions are large enough to afford the outlay xviii have their telegraph c correspondents ; or , what is more probable , price-currents and commercial bulletins will be transmitted , under competent authority , for the public eye and for the benefit of all whom they will concern . When this stage is reached , the tendency will be - as it already is , through increased facilities of communication , in distant parts of the same country - to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world over , and thus to the restoration of commerce from a game of hazard to the certain and moderate profits earned by placing goods where they are needed and wanted . Great benefit in many ways will accrue from the accuracy with which the first in elligence of important facts and events will be transmitted . Hitherto , unauthentic rumor has generally preceded and misrepresented fact , and has thus led to ill-grounded movements in business , misunderstandings between governments , baseless fear and equally baseless indignation . In the near future , fact will anticipate and supersede rumor . The telegraph , if wholly subject to irresponsible , careless , and deceptive management , will not be supported , or even tolerated . However free it may be to individual use there can hardly fail to become connected with it - either through public patronage or the collective agency of those whom such an arrangement vitally concerns - official and responsible news-gatherers and reporters , whose place and revenue will depend on their veracity and faithfulness . Among the important results of the oceanic telegraph , we must name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added dililculty and hazard thus placed in the way of crime . The tendency of all modern science has been in this direction . Chemistry , by its unerring tests , may detect vestiges of the murder in the decomposed body of its victim , and proofs of the murderer 's guilt in the slightest discoloration of a garment or a blade . Photography may furnish transcripts of the features of a thief or a swindler for the picture-gallery of every police-office in Europe and America . And now he who would shun exposure and infamy may " take the wings of the morning , " yet shall hardly have lost sight of his native // shore before Transatlantic ministers of the law are preparing for him an ungenial welcome . The impossibility of fleeing from one 's character and from merited retribution can not but have , in frequent instances , a salutary influence in the first access of great temptation , and to many this fearful ubiquity of human justice must suggest , as it typifies , the inevitableness of the Divine penalty . Moreover , while the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - yet not therefore useless , as it may be precedent and ancillary to motives of a higher order , - the leaguing of the powers of nature against crime and guilt identifies the law of right with the attributes of the Almighty , illustrates the sacred reverence in which he holds all moral distinctions , and ministers to that blending of virtue and piety in the human character , which can take place only where there is an equally vivid conception of God 's justice and his love . Intercourse , to which space opposes no barrier , must tend to establish and consolidate peace among the nations . This office has been hopefully inaugurated by enhanced commercial activity , by oceanic steam-navigation , and by the multiplied relations and interests growing out of the facility of foreign travel . A most striking and instructive change has already taken place in the course of human history since the general peace ensuing upon the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte . Previously to that date , wars had occurred , with brief intervals , between nations occupying the same plane as to civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most needless and unjustifiable wars on record , butthey have all been between nations of high culture and those holding an inferior position as regards the arts and refinements of life . Such have been the wars of Great Britain in India and China , of the United States with Mexico , of England and France with Russia , which , when we include in our estimate the whole of its territory , must be ranked as a semibarbarous state . Meanwhile , causes of dissension between the more civilized nations , which half a century ago could have been brought only to the arbitrament of the battle-field , have in repeated instances been settled by diplomatic negotiation or by the intervention of neutral powers . So often has // this taken place in our relations with the European states , that the rumors of war , which seem to be a part of the machinery of every quadrennial campaign for the choice of President , are flOW as little heeded as the cry of " Wolf " in the fable , and the braggart speeches in Congress which used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceloving , are now regarded merely as illustrations of the lack of sense or principle , or of both , in the speech-makers . The reason of this is , that relations of business and friendship between the citizens of any two among the great commercial states are so numerous and close , as to invest any anticipated rupture between them with all the horror and atrocity of a civil war . War has always been in a great degree impersonal ; or where there has been personal enmity , it has been against some sovereign or minister , whose real or imputed usurpations and public wrongs have made him seem a criminal worthy of condign retribution . There is profound truth in the identification in the classic tongues of the terms stranger and enemy ; for only a nation of strangers can be regarded as enemies . War has been waged against a nation , not as composed of well-known individual men , but as an aggregate of brute force to be contended with as remorselessly as the attack is urged against physical obstacles to worthy and desired ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lurking barbarism which could prepare fire and sword against a people , large numbers of whom were in intimate relations of traffic , friendship , and frequent intercourse with its own citizens . It is obvious that this " bond of peace " must be to an incalculable degree tightened and strengthened by the lightningwinged words which will daily cross and recross the oceanpath now opened to them . In addition to this , the ease with which accurate information can be obtained , the precedence of which we have spoken of fact before magnified rumor , the ease with which explanations may be made between governments , the facility for the settlement of incipient feuds before they have engendered anger , retaliatory speech , and vindictive purposes , must have a most momentous and blessed agency in hastening the time when men shall not " learn war any more . " // Other topics we might urge , but time fails us . We must , however , recur , before we drop the subject , to the sermon , so level with its great theme , the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The preacher , always fervent and profoundly impressive , has never done more ample justice to his fine powers of glowing thought and emphatic utterance . We quote , in conclusion , as in part coincident with , in part transcending , the views to which we have given expression , the following paragraphs - " The connection of Great Britain with our own shores is not a fact that can stand alone . By this channel we shall hold communication with Continental Europe , Asia , Africa , and Australia . The line of electric transmission will soon girdle the globe . Civilization must receive an impulse greater than it has felt at any time within the last half-century , memorable as this period has been for the appearance of agencies suited to awaken intellectual activity . How can we bring before our minds , with sufficient distinctness , the consequence of a universal interchange of thought by the speediest method ? The world , it has been said , will be made a great whispering-gallery ; I would rather say , a great assembly , where every one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last fifty years been the chief agent in educating society . It must now share that privilege with another instrument . The telegraph will anticipate the journal . Facts and opinions , the materials with which successive generations construct the road along which society advances with unequal , but never retrograde steps , will now be furnished to every one on the moment . What an excitement will be given to the brain and heart of the world ! Too much , you may say . Perhaps so . Excess , however , will not be fatal . Society will accommodate itself to the new conditions of its existence ; and then improvement will go on steadily , as well as rapidly . " The most remarkable effect , if I may judge from my own narrow thought , will be the approach to a practical unity of the human race ; of which we have never yet had a foreshadowing , f xcept in the gospel of Christ . Actually , the race has been divided into as distinct portions as if they lived on separate planets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have exchanged no sympathies , united in no common labors , recognized no obligations of kindred blood . What has China been to the rest of mankind for hundreds of years ? Even on the maps of the geographer , what has the interior of Africa been , though now known to contain populous cities , but an arid desert ? Can such ignorance and isolation continue after the lightnings shall // have been taken into the service of an , to go hither and thither at his command , saying , Here we are ? The death-blow has been struck to barbarism . An exclusive policy must yield to the universal solvent . The telegraph is cosmopolitan . Not more British than American , it can neither be monopolized by government , nor stopped in its work of civilization by neglect . It is an institution for the people . Its office is , to diffuse intelligence ; its effect , to allay differences . Men who talk together daily can not hate or disown one another . " - pp. 12- 14.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
