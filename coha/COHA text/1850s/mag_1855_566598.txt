txt ART . YJJ. - REVJEW OF l ) R. LORD 'S LETTER OF INQUIRY . " A Letter of h2qzdry to ilinister8 *f tbe Cos*pel of all . Denom**atjon* , on Slavery . By a NORTHERN PRESBYTER . " A LETTER bearing the above title has been published in Boston , and sent , more or less extensively , to those to whom it purports to be addressed . It is from a minister of New England , of learning , ability and elevated standing , who writes seriously , earnestly , under a deep impression of duty , and who is eminently worthy to be treated with respect and candid consideration. * This letter appears in a pamphlet of some thirty-two octavo pages , and consists , almost entirely , of questions . These questions , nearly one hundred in all , remind one of a luxuriant , creeping vine , which , though springing from one root frequently strikes into the fruitful soil new roots , and sends out in every direction , so many far-reaching branches , all interlaced with each other , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminate . The author has , however , arranged his qfiestions in eleven classes , designed to present as many distinct phases of his subject . Although nothing is affirmed , yet the design of the writer manifestly is to maintain that Slavery is a divine institution , of great benefit to the world , which ought , particularly in this country , to be strongly sulYported and widely extended . To treat each of these numerous questions in detail , would be a needlessly laborious work . We have aimed to ascertain the intention of the writer in each of his divisions , and shall state the same , as fairly as possible , in a corresponding number of distinct propositions , with the proofs adduced ; which will still more numerous pulpits , which shamelessly boast of their Calvinism , or their New England theology ; it may cut the sinews of strength , and extinguish the very life of a multitude of churches ; it may inflate the self-sufficiency of all who go about to establish their own righteousness ; it may grieve the hearts of many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when they are weak , then are they strong . " ( pp. 15 , 16 , 28 ) And yet Mr. Case intimates , that if Dr. Tyler only means , that " sinners are able , but disinclined to obey the Divine commauds , "  --  the very thing , certainly , that Dr. T. does mean ,  --  he could accept the statement . We need say no more of this strange letter . If Mr. Case is to do much good in the world , he must reform not only his doctrine , but his manners , He must learn to treat his betters , with more of courtesy and humility . * Rev. Nathan Lord , D. D. , President of Dartmouth College . // Aug. be carefully considered . To these propositions we will now attend in their order . I. It ought to be seriously considered whether Slavery may not lie of divine origin ; and of course right in principle , notwithstanding any wrong use which has been made of it . . The distinction between a principle , or ordinance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sh3uld always be carefully observed . The fact that the marriage relation , parental authority , and civil government , in the hands of wicked or mi*jndging men , are often sadly perverted , and attended with deplorable consequences , is no proof that they are not of divine origin and essential to the best state of the world . The Sabbath is by many made a day of sinful dissipation ; but is still in itself a sacred and most precious institution . In like manner , the mere fact that many evil consequences result from Slavery , as generally practiced , does not prove that the system is fundamentally wrong ; neither do any occasional good results prove that it is essentially right . But as its effects , morally considered , have generally been evil , it is but reasonable , in the absence of any positive proof to the contrary , to think that the thing in itself , can not be right , arid never was sanctioned by a God of infinite wisdom and goodness . That marriage , parental and civil government , the Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notwithstanding their abuses , is a matter of positive proof ; and whoever maintains that Slavery is a diviiie ordinance , is bound to substantiate his position by evidences equally direct and convincing . It is a great question , on which the liberty and happiness of millions of our fellow men is suspended , and ought not to be decided hastily . If God has expressly authorized one part of the human family to enslave another part , they have an absolute right to do so , but without such authority the a*t must be utterly unjustifiable , and eminently criminal . Of this our author is aware ; and accordingly addresses himself earnstly to the difficult work of proving that Slavery is indeed a divine institntion-that God has established and approved of it . With what success we shall presently see . It must , however , in this place be observed , that one point of vital importance in discussing this subject , namely , in what sense the term Slavery is used , is strangely left undefined by this advocate of the system . But as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , we may learn from the laws which have established it , and which reo'ulate its administration , what it is . Judge Stroud , in T1*5 " Sketch of the laws relating to Slavery , " remarks , " The cardinal // principle of Slavery , that the siax*e is not to be ranked among sentient beings , but among things , obtains as law in all these slaveholding States . " The law of South Carolina thus lays down the principle , " Slaves should be deemed , held , taken , reputed and adjudged in law to be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and possessors , and thei*r executois , administrators , and assigns , to all intents , constructions , and purposes whatsoever . " In Louisiana , " A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs ; the master may sell him , dispose of his person , his industry and his labor ; he can do nothing , possess nothing nor acquire anything , but what must belong to his mas*er . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is " the state of entire subjection of one person to the will of another . " It is to this state of absolute subjection then , in which the person of one , with all his capacities , powers , and possessions , is seized and held by another as his property , that the argument of the Northern Presbyter must be referred , for this is American Slavery . And he asserts , II . That Slavery is an institution of God , according to natural religion . Natural religion properly denotes that knowledge of the true God , and of our duty to him , which is , or may be , derived from a study of the works of nature , attended with conscientious endeavors to fulfill our obligations thus ascertained . That it is possible to obtain some true knowledge of God and of our duty to him from a contemplation of his works is evident from the Apostle 's declaration , that " The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they , " the heathen who have not the light of divine revelation , " are without excuse . " The infinite power , wisdom , and goodness of God , and his universal providence in supplying the wants of his creatures , of every order , may be learned by the light of nature , and consequently the duty of supreme love and reverence towards him and of kindness towards his creatures , because they are his , and in mutation of his own example . But how it can from the same premises be inferred that it is the will of God that one part of mankind should enslave another part-that they are religiously bound to do so  --  to an unsophisticated mind may well seem impossible . But our Presbyter , with characteristic honesty , states the train of thought which has led him to this conclusion . He has observed that in God 's providential government of this disordered system , frosts , mildews , earthquakes , and volca // noes , sickness , pain and death , are permitted and made subse*rvient to important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , and given to them for their sustenance ; and that nil irrational animals are made subject to the dominion of man , to be used for his benefit without regard to their own convenience ; he has furthermore seen that among men , while some are ignorant , weak , imprudent , vicious , savage , and in all respects degraded , others are cultivated , powerful , and in most respects decidedly their superiors ; that ignorance and vice , left to their own tendency , go down to still deeper degradation and wretchedness ; and hence has been induced to think that it might he for the benefit of these degraded classes to be enslaved by the more powerful , and thus reduced to the necessity of practicing industry , of abandoning their barbarism , and of becoming more cultivated and conformed to the mannem 's and customs of their superiors ; that Slavery to them would be a reformatory institution ; and hence concludes that it is the will of God , as gathered front the light of nature , that those who judged themselves competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view to their elevation and the general good of mankind-that it is their religious duty to do so ! That the justice and mercy and all the perfoctions of God require that it should be done ! But what is all this but vague conjecture , without one particle of proof ? How does it follow that because there are convulsions and calamities in the natural world there should be corresponding ones in the moral ? that because stronger beasts devour the weaker , the strong*r portion of mankind should act like beasts of prey towards their inferiors ? or that the best mode of elevating and reforming the ignorant , imbecile , arid vicious of our race is to enslave them ? How does it appear from the light of nature that this course of severe o* ) pression is better adapted to reform themn* than one of manifest comjassion and kindness , which should interfere with none of ' t ieir rights , but leave them in the full enjoyment of rational liberty , with all its proper pm'ivileges ? The Saviour surely made 110 reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform them . If that had been his method , it would have been appropriate to send forth strong companies of slave-catchers arid traders , instead of a few peaceful disciples , among the benighted and degraded inhabitants of the earth , to evangelize arid elevate them . The essential difficulties and absurdities involved in the working of such a system are sufficient p roof of its irrationality . Fom ' , by the mere light of nature , how is it possible to // determine just how ignorant and degraded men must be to make it lit that they should be seized and subjected to slavery ; or how elevated iu the scale of intelligence , civilization , and moral worth others must be , in order to render it their religions duty to become slaveholders ; or to what degree of refbirnation slaves must attain to render it the duty of their masters to give them liberty ? Plainly there is no practical rule but for every one who thinks himself qualified to be a slaveholder , to get possession as he can of any other whom he judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold , work , use and discipline him or her , as he in his selfishness may judge proper . The abominable sentiment that might gives right , quickened into vigorous exercise by selfishness , must ever be the mainspring of the whole system ; and the results , only as God shall control them as he does the wrath and wickedness of man in other cases , must be evil , and only evil , continually . The doctrine that natural religion teaches that God requires the more powerful races to enslave the weaker and more degraded , is not only utterly erroneous , but terribly demoralizing and dangerous in its tendency . It is a sentiment exactly adapted to the feelings and wants of tyrants and hard-hearted oppressors , and suited to spread violence , confusion , and misery through the world . l3ut our author goes further , and maintains , Ill . That Slavery is a positive institution of revealed religion . Under the Jewish dispensation , we may instance the passover , the observance of the Sabbath , and the offering of sacrifices ; and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as positive institutions . Our belief that they were of divine origin is not the result of collating many passages and circumstances , and thence inferring that they inu*t have had such an origin , but is founded on express revelations ; and the duty of observing these ordinances is not a matter of inf*rence , but of positive commands or laws , requiring of us such services . And whoever maintains that Slavery is a positive institution of revealed*relig*on , is bound to show , not merely that its existence is recognized in the scriptures , and that various commarids are given to both masters and servants to regulate their feelings and conduct towards each other , but that God has established the institution , and required one part of mankind to enslave another part  --  and that not in some special case , as a punishment for their sins , but as a general timing in all ages ; in short , that those who hoLd slaves in the different countries , now have the same authoi*ity for doing so , as the Hebrews // had , when by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawers of water , instead of destroying them . What then are his proofs * The first proof given hy our author that Slavery is an institution of revealed religion , is the curse which Noah pronounced on 11am , or rather on Canaan his son , as recorded in the ninth chapter of Genesis . Ham is represented as having grievously sinned by marrying a daughter " of the wicked and accursed race of Cain , " of which , however , we have no evidence , and charged with treating his father with scandalous disrespect ; for which reasons , it is said his posterity , by iving them up the God cursed him in g to practice of the most degrading and shameful vices , and by dooming them to perpetual subjection and slavery , to the posterity of Shem and Japhet . This curse , according to those who take this view of the matter , is designed to be an enduring monument before all nations and ages of God 's terrible displeasure against those who refuse duly to honor their parents . Those who concur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noah , have endeavored to persuade themselves and others that the descendants of 11am have indeed been a servile race , and from age to age held in bondage by the posterity of Shem and Japhet . They maintain that on the ground of this curse it is right to seize , especially , on the negro race , and subject them to Slavery . But these assumptions we can not admit , without better proof than has ever yet been furnished . In the first place , since Canaan was no way implicated in the conduct of his father , all enlightened criticism must regard the act of Ham as the occasion , rather than the cause , of the prediction respecting Canaan . In the second place , this prophetic announcement of an impending curse , was made with exclusive reference to Canaan , including , of course , his posterity to some limited extent , as there is no intimation whatever that the evil indicated was to be perpetual on his descendants . In the third place , the prediction bad its fulfillment partly when the Canaanites were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remnants of the tribes in Canaan fell under the dominion of the Romans . By no just principles of interpretation , nor by any method of logic , applied to the passages of scripture in question , can the negro race be included in the curse uttered concerning the then apparently unoffending Canaan . In further proof that Slavery is a sacred institution , Presbyter argues that Melchisedec , Abraham , and other patriarchs of the race of Shem , who were God 's representatives in those evil // 403 times , bought and held and alienated slaves , in evident subserviency to the Divine will , as the constituted guardians of society ! With what propriety iMleichisedec is styled a patriarch , or whence the proof is derived that he was of the race of Sliem , we know not . As he appears to have been a native of the Land of Canaan , it has generally beeli snpposed that he was a descendant of Ham , in the line of Canaan , and if so , according to our author 's view , belonged to an accursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of peace , a priest of the Most High , and an eminent prototyj ) e of Christ , on gut to have been seized by Abraham or some other Shemite or son of JaJ ) het , and reduced to slavery ! The statement that Melchisedec bought and held and alienated slaves is a remarkable one indeed , and the intelligence , if true , must have been brought out of the silence and darkness of bygone ages by the aid of the necromancers of the present day , or some special revelation , as no ilitimation of the sort can be found in history , either sacred or profane . That Abraham , in some instances , with money , procured persons to serve him , we are warranted to believe , but that be held them as property in the same sense as he did his flocl*s and herds , or ever sold one of them , we have no reason to believe . They married and were with their children incorporated into his great family , and all the males were in the same way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . Unprotected by any government , he with his wife and immense herds and flocks , was safe under the guardianship of these faithful men , though surrounded by heathen tribes , and often removing from place to place . In arms they followed him and rescued Lot out of the hands of the hostile kings who were carrying him away captive . One of them was entrusted with the delicate task of procuring from abroad a wife for Isaac , at his own discretion , and it ' Abraham bad died childless , was to have been his heir . They were Abraham 's people , and looked up to him , not as their bppressor , but common friend . With what propriety then can Abraham be cited as a proof of the justice of Slaveholding , in its ordinary sense ? Even if it could be shown that Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob were slaveholders and traders of the same type with our American patriarchs , it would give no more sanction to Slavery than their example gives to polygamy , concubinage , or deceptiomi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to do whatever they did would be the height of absurdity . While they were essentially good men , they occasionally did things which were exceedingly // wrong , and which have been recorded , not for the imitation of others , but as evidences of the deplorable frailty of human nature , and examples of warning . Presbyter maintains further , that the buying and selling of slaves were not inc rely tolerated under the Mosaic economy , but required and regulated as necessary parts of the theocratic institution , without which God 's wonderful designs in separating the Jewish nation , and blessino the ra have been accomplished . 6 ce of Shem , could not We can not now go into a full discussion of this long ' controverted subject , but are prepared to say , without fear ot contradiction , that there are no sufficient facts to warrant belief that the Hebrew laws ever authorized , or in any way recognized , Slavery in the American sense of that term . TIme assertion that they did is gratuitous , and altogether incapable of estabhishinent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws to hold slaves , have no right to violate their charter by neglecting anything which it requires , or doing anything which it prohibits . in regard to a point so plain , common sense speaks out . Suppose you are elected trustees of a literary institution , duly chartered and of long ' standing , ire you at liberty , without regard to the ori*ina1*rct of incorporation , to remodel everything , and convert the funds to purposes never authorized by the donors * is it enough that the mere name of the institution is preserved , while the original design of its founders and of the government in its incorporation are wholly defeated ? Surely , upright men would feel under a necessity either to keep strictly within their chartered limits or resign their offices . Arid so consistency requires all who claim a rio'ht to hold slaves , under the sanction of the Levitical laws , 6to manage the whole business in strict conformity to them . Let the slavehiolclers in this country universally pursue this course , and their cruel institution would soon become a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seizing and imprisoning slaves who come among them from abroad , they must give them liberty to dwell in whatever part of the country they should prefer . Instead of marking refractory slaves by knocking omit teeth , chopping off fingers , branding them with hot irons , or oilierwise maiming them , and then by these maiks describing them whemi they mini away , they must admit that all such marks of ' violence are to the sufferers irrefragable evidences of their i'ight to freedom . Nor may they , under any pretence , hold in involuntary servitude over six years any whose complexiomi proves them to be // of white fraternity , especially when they have reason to believe them to be closely related to themselves . Moreover , all their slaves must be consecrated to God , be required to remember the Sabbath and keep it holy , and be allowed to rest entirely from their secular labors during the whole of every seventh year , and to share fully in all religious services enjoyed by others . Let those who claim the right of holding slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their slaveholding is of a kind which Moses never either sanctioned or tolerated . But if the laws of Moses did regulate and sanction the modified form of servitude which has been described , it is no proof that other men or nations in different circumstances have a right to practice it . These laws respecting servitude belonged entirely to the civil code of the Hebrew Commonwealth , and not to the IDecalogue , which was designed equally for all nations . Both of these systems emanated indeed from the same Divine Author , but were given for different purposes . The State laws had respect to the particular circumstances of that nation , in distinction from all others , and were evidently designed to be superseded , as they have been , by the Christian dispensation , to which many of them were preparatory , and at whose introduction the walt of separation between Jews and Gentiles was entirely broken down . Whereas the Moral law is founded on principles of immutable rectitude , equally applicable to all men , in all circumstances and ages , and was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensation , but to be interpreted and confirmed by its Divine Author . To maintain that whatever was tolerated or sanctioned by the civil laws of the Jews is a divine ordinance of universal obligation , is a manifest absurdity ; and their laws respecting servitude , comparatively mild and humane as they were , are no exception . Whoever maintains the contrary opinion must , to be consistent , allow that it is still a divine ordinance that the rebellious son and the daughter , accused of unchastity before marriage , should be stoned to death , and that no mercy should be shown to men who bravely resist hostile invaders . Kay , to be consistent , he must become a Jew , and practice the ablusions , and off ' ? r the sacrifices , and observe the festivals required by the Jewish ritual , abstain from the use of swines ' flesh , and not fail to receive circumcision ! for why should he select this and that provision of that ancient code which suits his convenience , and represent it as still in full force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slavery a divine ordinance , to be observed by // the Gentile nations , you must surely bring better evidence than can be derived from the civil laws of the Hebrews . Their laws do not and can not afford the least sanction to the practice of Slavery by other nations . The moral law contained in the Decalogue was not peculiar to the Hebrews , but is universally and perpetually obligatory . This law , which in substance requires that we should love God with all our hearts , and our neighbor as ourselves , gives no countenance to Slavery , but its whole spirit and force are opposed to it . Slavery , as practiced in this country , directly conflicts with every commandment of the iDecalogue , and strongly tends to make the whole of no effect . But the Northern Presbyter maintains that Slavery was sanctioned by Christ and His Apostles , who never , he says , abrogated , annulled , or questioned the original institution , but taught with what spirit and temper it should be carried on . Let us see . That Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extensively practiced in the Roman Empire in the days of Christ and his Apostles , is undeniable . Nor was the condition of the enslaved any better then than it now is in this country . A Southern vindicator of Slavery , who has evidently paid much attention to the subject , says , that " they were absolutely the property of their masters " - that they " were used like dogs " - that they " were forbidden to learn any liberal art or perform any act worthy of their masters " - that " once a day they received a certain number of stripes for fear they should forget they were slaves " - that " the slaves were commonly exposed for sale naked " - that " at one time sixty thousand of them in Sicily and Italy were chained and confined to work in dungeons " - that " when the slaves grew old they were liable to be turned away to be starved to death , " a thing which was done by a master " distincruished &amp;r his superior virtues " - that " they were thrown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Roman Empire , there were sixty millions of slaves to twenty millions of freemen , many of the Romans having five thousand , and some even twenty thousand of them . " It may , on good authority , be added , that " when the slaves were beaten they were hung up , " as they not uncommonly are in modern times , " with a weight between their feet that they might not move them . " The life of time slave was absolutely in the power of his master . If a master was slain in his own house , all the slaves were liable to be put to death . Tacitus records a case in which four hundred were , under this law , executed together . From Juvenal it appears that slaves were at times ordered to be crucified for the most trivial offences . Their // labor was , to a great extent , unprofitable , and their lives were held cheap . Such was Slavery in the Roman Empire in the days of the Apostles . And these slaves , let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the African race , but had been gathered from the various nations , polished as well as rude , which the iRomans had subdued by the power of their arms . The old curse of Noah upon Canaan was not by these mighty slaveholders in the least regarded , but Gauls , Germans , Britons , and Jews , as well as Africans , were put under the yoke . Many of them , doubtless , had been persons distinguished for beauty and elegant accomplishments ; for information , wealth , bravery , and honorable standing among their countrymen . They had been enslaved for no crime , but captured and dragged away by this grasping and warlike people , because they dared to contend for their national rights and the protection of their habitations and families . The case was then as it would be now if the mighty powers contending in the North of Europe should sell their captives into the most degrading , cruel , and hopeless bondage , without the least regard to their feelings , characters , standing in society , or moral worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the Gospel sanctioned , if it sanctioned any ! This is the horrible system which we are told Christ and his Apostles opposed not , but taught men in what spirit and temper it should be carried on ! From this astonishing representation we turn directly to the Divine oracles , and may see for ourselves how groundless it is . Our blessed Lord expounded and forcibly inculcated the moral law contained in the Decalogu e , with every precept of which the slavery which then existed directly conflicted . He inculcated meekness , and mercy , and universal righteousness . He condemed all acts of covetousness , dishonesty , and oppression , and required every man to love his neighbor as himself , and do to others as he would have them do to him . If these fundamental principles of that kingdom which consists in righteousness , peace and joy in the Holy Ghost , were universally obeyed , the whole business of enslaving our fellow men and holding them as property , like the beasts of the field , to be used for the interest or pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apostles went forth among the nations , they found slaveholding even in its worst forms incorporated with the whole framework of civil society apd firmly supported not only by long established usage and all the worse appetites and passions of the human heart , but by all the authority amid powers of a government before which the natioiis trembled . In // this state of things they seem to have judged it wiser to seek the destruction of this giant enormity by dealing death blows to its essential parts , abstractly considered , than by attacking it directly as a system . Now we know that many of the vices and crimes forbidden in the New Testament are inherent in the Slave system , or are as naturally produced by it as any effects are by their appropriate causes . Where there is no covetousness , no extortion , no fraud , no theft , no withholding from servants a due compensation for their services , no threatening , and of course no stripes to secure obedience , how is it possible for Slavery , in the ordinary sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living man without a head or heart . Especially if masters would render to their servants that which is just and equal , how could they at the same time despoil them of their liberty , of their wives and children , and everything on earth which men deem sacred ; and all this when they have committed no crime to merit such a doom ? Let those who profess to hold their slaves by apostolical authority obey the Apostles ' commands regarding the duty of masters to their servants , or relinquish all pretensions to any such right to hold them . Surely it is no more than right that those who profess to act under the authority of the New Testament should obey it . Let them do so , and Slavery must immediately and peacefully give place to universal freedom , with all its attendant blessings . The fact that the Apostles exhorted servants to be obedient to their masters , and to endure grief , suffering wrongfully , gives not the least sanction to the system . It was better that they should thus patiently obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a fruitless attempt to break their yoke of oppression ; but , said the Apostle , " If thou mayest be free , choose it rather . " We can not go into a further examination of this subject now , but trust that enough has been said to show that neither Christ nor his Apostles ever gave the least countenance to holdin g and treating human beings as mere articles of property . The great princil ) les of religion which they inculcated , and the precepts which they enforced , were directly suited to destroy the abominable system of Slavery , both root and branch . The representation , then , that Slavery is an ordinance of revealed religion , that the word of God autliorizes* one part of the human family to seize and enslave another , who have personally done nothing to merit such treatment , is utterly groundless , of eminently injurious tendency , both as it regards the honor of God and the happiness of His creatures ; and one // which ought to be regarded with intense and universal abhorrence . Another position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV . That the holding of slaves , or the carrying on of a system of Slavery , by civil regulations , in accordance with a divine plan , as understood by natural and revealed religion , is not inconsistent with any ideas or principles otherwise suggested or enjoined by the providence or word of God . The argument here is , that , since natural and revealed religion prove that Slavery is a divine institution , there can be no reason in the providence or word of God why it should not be carried on . And it is readily admitted that the infinitely wise and unchangeable God has not acted , and never will act , inconsistently with Himself . If He has established Slavery as a permanent institution for the benefit of the world , and m*iide it the duty of one part of mankind to enslave another part , then it would be unreasonable to suppose that He would , either in the course of his providence or by His word , cast dishonor on His own ordinance . But here everything depends on the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanctioned by the Almighty . The argument is as if one should say , " Since the earth invariably stands still , all attempts to prove that the succession of day and night and of the seasons is owing to its diurnal and annual revolutions are , and must for ever be , absurd and fruitless . " But the earth does not stand still , and so all reasoning from the presumption that it does , is without foundation . Just so in the case before us . Slavery is not a divine institution . The attempt to prove from nature and revelation that the Most High has sanctioned it , has completely failed , and of course left us free to receive in their most obvious sense those teachings of nature and Scripture which seem to conflict with the justice of slaveholdin* . The author doubtless imagines that he has well established his fundamental positions , and may safely take them as granted through the sequel of his discussion ; but in the view of others his foundation is not rock , but sand , and any edifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be worthless . It is virtually admitted that there are ideas or principles sngj* gested or enjoined by the providence or word of God whic seem to be inconsistent , and which we maintain are wholly inconsistent , with the doctrine that Slavery is a good institution and divinely sanctioned . As it regards the course of Divine Providence , it is manifest that slaveholding has universally been carried on from selfish motives , and been attended with // great injustice and cruelty , suited to stir up and give strength to the worst passions of the human heart , both on the part of the enslavers and the enslaved ; that from the very nature of the institution it must be so , and that for these reasons it ought not to be supposed that a God of infinite benevolence and wisdorn ever established it for the benefit of his creatures . Dr. Lord in this connection argues that the buying and selling of men as property , and compelling them to work without wages , are mere physical facts , and therefore actions without any moral character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed . If one prosecutes the business of a slave trader , or breeder , or worker , with good intentions , his conduct is good ; and if he does these things from wrong motives , it is bad ; all depends on the state of his heart , or the motives by which he is actuated . Now it is true that external or mere bodily actions derive their moral character wholly from their source . In many supposable cases one may deserve praise for doing an action with good intention , which if done with a bad one would have been highly criminal . But there are many external actions which never are or can be done with good motives , and which of course must invariably involve the doer in guilt . The utterance of known slander , persecuting men for righteousness sake , highway robbery and piracy , deeds of cruelty and hardhearted oppression , false swearing , and of blasphemy against God , are all physical facts , but always wicked , because they invariably proceed from a wicked heart . Nearly all the commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man has a right to plead that his motives are good in doing anything which God forbids , or in neglecting anything which He requires . Disobedience proves the heart to be bad . " By their fruit , " said the Great Teacher , " shall ye know them . " If the man who deprives his fellow of his liberty , holds him as a merchantable commodity , and compels him to work for him without wages , when his victim has done nothing to merit such treatment , mn*y justify himself on the plea that his motives are good ; the swindler , the thief , the robber , the pirate , the false swearer , the adulterer , the cruel persecutor , may all do the same . Some of the most horrible persecutions ever known were carried on with zeal for what the persecutors considered the cause of truth and righteousness . With the Jesuits it is a settled principle that the end justifies the means . That a distin guished Protestant divine , in his zeal to justify Slavery , should vindicate essentially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that there are some things in the Scriptures which seetii to conflict with the slave system , but strongly maintains that they may and should be construed in harmony with it . His train of thought is , that the institution being divine , there can be nothing in the divine oracles opposed to it . A false premise must always lead to an erroneous conclusion . The work of molding obviously adverse passages into conformity to some favorite system , though suited to give full scope to learning and ingenuity , is always a bad and dangerous business . The end here surely will not justit* the means . That the moral law of God , the great principles of universal love and justice inculcated by our Saviour , and the condemnation by the Apostles of the various sins ordinarily involved in Slavery , are directly and strongly opposed to that abominable system , has already been shown , and no attempt to explain them away will avail . To multiply proofs going to establish this point would not be difficult . In his zeal for Slavery , iDr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spe*citic law of love , which requires us to do to others as we would they should do to us , has no bearing whatever on the institution , except in regard to the spirit and intention with which it should be carried on , and that any such interpretation of this law , as would tend practically to the premature subversion of Slavery , would be a profanation , tending equally to the subversion of every other constituted relation of inequality among men , and the destruction of society . He maintains that Slavery , rightly conducted , is one of the methods by which good men become co-workers with God , and benetactors of the world , and that to reproach such good men or the institution which they represent , in distinction from its abuses , is dishonorable to God , and tends to destructive issues , both to the Church and State . Love would incline us , and the authority of Christ requires us to do unto others , even untu slaves , as we , in exchanged circumstances , could reasonably wish them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly addressed to the enlightened reason and consciences of men . You might , when pressed with debts , wish your creditors with one consent to grant you an entire and gratuitous discharge from all obligations to them , or when justly arraigned before a civil tribunal , wish that the witnesses would not testify the truth against you . But in such cases your wish would not be consistent with reason , or a due regard to the rights of others . But whatever you could reasonably wish another to do to you , were you placed in his circumstances and he in your 's , that you ought now to do for him . // This rule is of universal application ; it teaches us how to trdat every human being with whom we have anything to do , and in many cases of difficulty will enable us to decide , without doubt , what course we are bound to pursue . This law , if duly and universally obeyed , would speedily bring Slavery , with all its abominations , to an everlasting end . The representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture opposed to Slavery , is so contrary to manifest truth , so absurd and unreasonable , that it seems astonishing that any man of an enlightened mind should ever make it . If there ever was any practice on earth which should be loathed and abhorred , which both reason and revelation condemn , and which may justly be denominated " the sum of all villanies , " it is this . V. Those interpretations of the law of love which set it in opposition to Slavery , independently of its abuses , are fallacious , wherever their fallacy lies . This by our author is taken for granted , on the ground that both nature and revelation prove Slavery to be a divine institution , and that it has been so considered by good men in general in past ages . But as he has wholly fail*d to sustain his position that Slavery ic a divine institution , his inference drawn from that assumption is of no force . If God , iad established Slavery as a permanent institution , for the benefit of the world , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be interpreted accordingly ; but as the case is , there is no reason why the law should not be understood in its obvious sense ; and how men could perform the various acts necessarily involved in the baseness of seizing , enslaving , working , and selling others , while loving them as they do themselves , is a thing impossible to be conceived . The representation that wise and good men in general , in past ages , have not considered the law of love incompatible with the practice of Slavery , is made without proof , and can not be admitted . Rev. Albert Barnes , iii his able treatise on Slavery , says , " Freedom , under the influence of Christianity , was regarded as a great blessing , and the desire to promote it led to great sacrifices on the part of the early Christians . Paulinus , the Bishop of Nola , expended his whole estate , and then sold himself , " to obtain liberty for those in bondage . " After the IRomans had taken seven thousand captives , Acacius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his church , with which he redeemed the captives . Ambrose , of Milan , did the game , in respect to the furniture of his church . It was the ' only case in which the imperial constitutions allowed plate to // be sold . Emancipation became a very common thing in the early Christian Church , and was attended with such ceremonies as to show that it was regarded as a matter of great importance , and that an invaluable privilege was thus conferred on the slave . So strong was the tendency to emancipation , so decisive was the influence of Christianity , that if Slavery was never entirely brought to an end in the Roman Empire , it was nearly so ; and if the progress of things had not been interrupted by the invasion of the Northern hordes , there is every reason to think that it would have wholly ceased within the limits of the Roman power . Thus , Gibbon expressly says , that it had almost ceased under the peaceful reii*n of the iRomnan Emperors . " Professor B. B. Edwards says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious triumph in almost every part of the imperial dominions . There was no instantaneous abandonment of the system of servitude , but its contrarie1* to the precepts of the New Testament was gradually seen . Clergymen vindicated the rights of the oppressed . The codes of slave laws were gradually ameliorated , till finally the rescripts of Justinian nearly accomplished the salutary reform . " If* then , the early Christians exerted an influence against Slavery so strong and enduring as to produce so wonderful a change in favor of liberty throughout the Roman Empire , where that cruel system was , perhaps , more firmly rooted and established than anywhere else on earth , and if , as might easily be shown , the great body of the Christian Church are to this day opposed to Slavery , and view it as one of the greatest obstacles in the way of the progress of that kingdom which consists in righteous , and peace , and joy , in the Holy Ghost , with what propriety or justice can it be pretended that good men , in general , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and good men have thought Slavery consistent with the divine law , so have they strenuously maintained other errors now generally considered both unscriptural and absurd . We see for ourselves what Slavery is , and know what the law of love requires* and are as capable of judging whether they are consistent wmth each other as we shoul dl have been if we had lived in some past age . The Northern Presbyter , taking it for granted that there must be a fallacy somewhere , in giving to the divine law an interpretation inconsistent with Slavery , suggests that it originated far back in the subtle heresies of an early period of Christianity , injuriously affecting the ethics and theology of succeeding periods , and more fully developed at this time in a humnanitarian philosophy , which has almost imperceptibly insinuated itself // into the Church of God , and consists mainly in a conceit an 'd fiction of man 's virtuousness and capacity to enjoy life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , without regeneration ; as if under the influence of some inherent principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of rising to a state of perfection without any severe and compulsory discipline or help from above . He thinks these interpreters overlook the actual state of depravity , ignorance , barbarism , madness , crime , and disorder , which do and must exist till men are personally and individually converted through the Gospel , and vainly imagine that a state of universal liberty , equality , and fraternity , if at once set up , would be productive of universal order and happiness . And so he goes on , from one supposition to another , in search of the origin or ground of the supposed fallacy . But all this is labor lost , as the main body of commentators , who have understood the divine law to be opposed to Slavery , have never entertained the unscriptural notions here ascribed to them . That the law which requires us to love our neighbor as ourselves , and to do as we would be done by , is wholly incompatible with Slavery , is so obvious that it seems strange indeed that any believer in Divine Revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the law will remain in all its force , and will not cease to utter condemnation on all who pervert its meaning or disregard its authority . Another topic on which the Doctor strongly insists , is , VI . That there is no more force in objections against the institution of Slavery , independently of its abuses , or reason for confining it within geographical limits , than there would be in objections to domestic , civil , or ecclesiastical government , and in attempts to restrain or destroy such government , because sometimes abused . Here again we meet the old error of taking it for granted that Slavery is a divine institution . On this sandy foundation the whole edifice which our author , with so much painstaking , has erected , mainly depends for its support . That good government in families , states , and churches , is divinely authorized , is readily admitted . When such government is badly administered and is productive of evil , the fault lies in the bad administration , and not in government itself , conducted according to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overthrown , but government itself is agreeable to the will of God , and essential to the good order and happiness of mankind . But Slavery , as we have seen , is not an ordinance of God , nor adapted to promote the best good of man . It is evil both in its nature and effects . According to // our author himself , it originated in a curse , and was desio'ned to be a curse to the innumerable subjects of it . It is a*so a curse to those who practice it , being well suited to cherish and strengthen the worst appetites and passions of the human heart-almost of necessity involving those who enslave others in vice , moral degradation , and deep criminality . Such is the nature of the system that a great part of what are esteemed its abuses is essential to its perpetuity and profitableness . Would it be an abuse for some men under commission from , we will say , a slaveholding government , to go to Africa , and by violence seize some unoffending individual , or buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tear him away from his home and country , with a view to make gain by selling him into perpetual bondage in a strange land ? Would it be an abuse of Slavery for some planter or other person to purchase such slave without his consent , and subject him for life to involuntary and unrequited toil for the benefit of his legal owner ? Would it be an abuse of the system , for the master to give this slave a woman , to be to him , during the master 's convenience or pleasure , in the place of a wife , that he might become more profitable than he otherwise would be , by raising up a family of children to serve the master in the way of toil , or to increase his wealth by being sold like other commodities in the market ? If necessity or interest should require the master to sell the woman away from the man , or the man away from the woman , or some of the children away from the rest , or from their parents , would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge is found , or is believed to be dangerous , when possessed by slaves , is it wronq to deprive them of the privilege of learning to read and write , and become acquainted with the state of public affairs , or with those great truths and duties of revelation , which might make them uneasy in their situation ? To keep them in Slavery it seems absolutely necessary to keep them in a state of mental darkness and degradation . If severe laws and discipline be necessary to crush out their native desire for liberty and hope to obtain it , to keep them quietly down in a state of profitable servitude , is it wrong that such laws and discipline should be so rigidly enforced as to accomplish their end ? In these things lie what are generally esteemed the principal abuses of Slavery ; and yet they are all essential to its perpetuity . Without them it can not exist . The thing , then , is // Aug. rotten to the very core ; it is in its spirit and exercise evil , only evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zealous advocate of slaveholding insists , is , VII . That the Nebraska Bill , passed by the Congress of 1854 , was a politic measure , and suited , by extending the area of Slavery , to promote the best interests of our country . Dr. Lord allows that , on the part of those who passed this Bill , it was a violation of existing compromises , a breach of faith , an act full of fearful portents , and likely to disturb the balance of power between the free and slaveholding States ; but still maintains that the exclusion of Slavery from that great portion of our country was wrong and unwise ; that Slavery could not without injury to the South , be restrained within its old limits , and that being an institution fraught with many blessings , the inhabitan* , s of that extensive region ought not to be debarred from participating in its advantages , lie insists that , however base might have been the motives of those who passed that Bill , the good of the country and even of the colored people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel do wrong to utter any remonstrance against a measure which so directly tends to diffuse widely the manifold benefits of this divine institution ! Such are , in substance , his views . But if that compromise had been kept inviolate for even half a centuary longer , it is perfectly obvious that the results must have been most happy . That whole region would have rivaled Ne*v England or any of the most favored of the free States in its population , free common schools , and high seminaries of learning ; in its churches and manifold means of intellectual and i'eligious training ; in the universal freedom , intelligence , thrift , and domestic quietude and comforts of its p eople . It would have been eminently the home of the free , and an asylum for the oppressed ; one of the most beautiful and desirable portions of our extensive and highly favored country . On the other hand , let Slavery prevail there as it does at the South , and there must be a perpetual struggle between the oppressors and the oppressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the population must be doomed to hopeless ingorance and degradation , both moral and physical . It is melancholy , indeed , that a man born and educated in New England , who has always been conversant with the manifold advantages and blessings which have here resulted from the full enjoyment of civil and religious liberty , should give a // decided preference to a land of Slavery . This is not a matter of theory , of speculation , merely . Both methods have been fully tried , and the results stand before us in bold relief . Compare Virginia with New York , South Carolina with Massachusetts , or even Kentucky with Ohio , and believe if you can that it would be better for Kansas and Nebraska , for Utah and Minesota , to be slave States , rather than free . VIII . Our author maintains that it is unwise and hazardous for Christian men to denounce or oppose the institution of Slavery itself , in distinction from its abuses , or to give encourageinent directly or indirectly to romantic and excited persons , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is does not appear . Occasional allusions have been made to this sentiment before , but it seems to have been thought sufficiently important to be represented as a distinct and prominent topic . No opposition , especially by good men , should be made to the institution of Slavery-no countenance given to the abolitionists . This he argues on his old and false ground that Slavery is a divine institution , designed both injustice and mercy for the best , if not the only possible regulation of the world in its present fallen and probationary state-that the wisest and best men of all ages have practiced it with the approbation of God-that Christ and his Apostles treated it precisely as they did all other varieties of human government , by inculcating the duties p roper to the respective parties concerned-that American Slavery , notwithstanding its inherent and accidental evils , has proved better to the successive millions of Africans than any condition they could otherwise have enjoyed , as the state of things has been in the world at large , and its reflex influence upon Africa itself , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that degraded part of the world -- moreover. that by opposing Slavery , Christian men do really , though unintentionally , counteract the benevolent intentions of Divine Providence , and pursue a course suited to involve the nation , including the slaves themselves , in still greater evils and miseries . One reason for ceasing to oppose Slavery here presented , deserves a distinct consideration , as it has not been anticipated , which is , that Slavery has proved to be the best thing , both for the enslaved and for their unhappy country , which could have been done for them ! That some , probably many , of those who have been carried away into slavery , or amono ' their posterity , in Christian lands , have , in the providence of &amp;d , come to a saving knowledge of // the truth , and been raised from a state of deep moral degrad4-tion to a state of peace with God , and of preparation for his heavenly kingdom , there can be no doubt . The evils which they have suffered have been overruled for their good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianized colored people , returned from the lands of their cruel bondage , important civil , literary , and religious institutions have been planted in their father-land , which have had a salutary influence on the surrounding , and indeed remote tribes , who have become acquainted with them . And this influence , we may trust , will grow more and more extensive and happy . One of the most remarkable good results of these Christian colonies in Africa , consisting chiefly of men and women who have been so much benefitted by being enslaved , is that they are strongly opposed to the accursed traffic in the bodies and souls of their countrymen , and have done much to bring it to an end , wherever they have authority or influence . If the whole coast were studded with such colonists , the entire trade with foreign nations in slaves would be absolutely suppressed . How do the advocates of the system , on the ground of its divine origin and happy results , reconcile the beginning and end of their argument ? Will a good , a divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their argument adherent and conclusive , they should show that the pious colonists , having had experience of the benefits of the slave system , prove to be first rate slave-catchers , and are doing a great and good work in favor of the conversion of their native brethren , by seizing as many of them as they can , and sending them into bondage in Christian lands ! But those who carry on that nefarious business they justly esteem the most base and abominable of all the workers of iniquity . As for slavery being the best thing for the Africans which could have been domie for them , we by no means admit it . There has always been a far more excellent way  --  the way which Christ directed his disciples to pursue in their efforts to propagate his gospel and bring the world into obedience to him as the King in Zion . Suppose that the vast treasures which have been expended in prosecuting the foreign slave trade , had been employed in sending out and supporting truly pious and excellent missionaries , for establishing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations the full light of revelation , and that as great efforts had been continued through successive generations to enlighten , elevate , and save them , as have been used to drag them away into bondage , there can not be a doubt but the whole continent , before this , might // have been ifiled with the light , liberty , comforts , and all the manifold blessings of a pure Christianity . iX . Ministers of the gospel and all other Christian men should take the doctrines and practices of the abolitionists into serious consideration , and use the most effectual means in their power to withstand them , and to save the nation from their pernicious influence . This proposition is manifestly intended to be a step in advance of the last ; that was negative , insisting that good men should do nothing in opposition to slavery , nothing to encourage its opponents ; this is positive , urging the duty of strenuously resisting all who are seeking the subversion of the institution . The whole paragraph is so full of caricature , figures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this or that ; but if it means anything , it must be what has been stated . He talks of a class of men who play upon the public sympathies , who make a trade of philanthropy and live by it , whose benevolence is according to their mere instincts and sensibilities , and without regard to God 's comprehensive government is always exclusively on one side , and that the side of crime , lawlessness , and violence-who are spreading abroad a new visionary philosophy and literature which subject scripture to the interpretation of the intuitional reason , and corresponding impulses of a romantic sensibility , and plead for the boasted dignity and perfectibility of man , and set up his imaginary rights above his duties , and his happiness above his virtue ; who are encouraged by selfish and time-serving politicians , and are doing much mis- chief iu the land . Now , though this description will not be owned by any class of our citizens as appropriate to themselves , and is eminently a caricature in its application to the great body of Christian men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the connection in which the passage stands , and from the phraseology which Dr. Lord is accustomed to use in speaking of the opponents of this institution , there can be no doubt but he means them . They are the men who should be treated , not with minute portions of their own poison , but scientifically , according to the methods of Scripture and experience , in a way which is suited to work a thorough cure . And in this thorough medical practice he exhorts all good men to earnestly engage ; and thins save their unhappy patients , if possible , and the nation , at any rate , from a miserable dissolution . But what are the remedies to be applied ? Hard words and abusive epithets ? Abolitionists have so long been accustomed to those that they have lost all their power , and pass by them like the idle winds which they regard not . Shall they be as // sailed with irresistible arguments , exposing their errors ? That is fair ; but it will require arguments far stronger than our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer the purpose . Shall gag-laws be passed by Congress , forbidding the people their accustomed liberty of speech and of the press ? As well might they legislate against the freedom of the winds and tides , or seat themselves on a heaving volcano to keep down its threatened eruption . Shall the efficacy of blood-letting be employed ? That was long since found to be an ineffectual means of restraining the power and progress of truth . We see not but the physicians who are called to apply their most energetic remedies must give up the case as desperate , for their patients are too numerous and too far gone to leave any ground of hope . The disease of anti-slavery , if it is one , now so affects the body of the nation that it must be left to produce its legitimate results . But what is thus wrongly called disorder , is vital energy , striving to expel disorder , and save the nation from untimely dissolution . X. Slavery in this nation has been so wickedly abused by injurious laws and customs , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding from the slaves that which is just and equal and properly due to them in their allotted sphere , that the institution has been dishonored , and the displeasure of God against the nation itself has been provoked . That the divine wrath has been incurred by slaveholders , and by the nation in general for the countenance and support which it has given them , there can be no doubt . It is no wonder that a great statesman who had always been conversant with Slavery should say , " I tremble for my country when I remember that God is just . " But what are the aliu8es of which our author complains , the grievous laws and customs which are so offensive to God ? Is it wrong to deprive the colored people of their liberty and hold them as articles of property , which may be sold and bought as the interest of their owners shall dictate . Is it wrong to require them to labor without compensation , and to keep them so far in a state of ignorance and of fear that they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to carry on any well concerted measures to obtain it ? Is it wrong to refuse them the right of testifying in courts of justice against white men who injure them , to take from them all prospect and hope of rising to a more elevated condition , and , in short , so to work , discipline , and dispose of them , as to make them profitable to their owners ? Are not all these things essential to the support of the institution ; and the various laws *ud customs which are complained of , all deemed by those most // 421 intimately acquainted with the subject things of absolute necessity in carrying on the system ? All attempts to correct them , while you justit* and uphold the system , are futile . The system itself is abominable , and must bring down the divine displeasure on those who practice it . To justify the thing and yet complain of its necessary results is idle . " Either rna*e the tree good and his fruit good , or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Was not slavery according to our author designed from the beginning to be a carse and not a blessing to the enslaved ? And has it not been so conducted in all ages and countries , especially in our own country , so as to secure its legitimate end , by proving emphatically a curse to its victims ? Why should the slaveholders be blamed for not making the institution a blessing to its subjects ? Why should they be criminated for not acting in opposition to divine providence by making what was meant to be a curse , no curse at all ? Surely there is but slight ground for those who hold that Slavery was designed to be the executi*n of a terrible curse , to complain of the evils which make it so , but those who view the whole system as unjust and cruel , may with propriety lift up their voices against it , for what . it is both in principle and in fact . The concluding section of the remarkable publication which we have been considering propounds , in substance , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become convinced that Slavery is a divine institution , and who could without conscientious scruples or misgivings , and with gratitude to God for such an opportunity of benefitting his degraded and suffering creatures , become himself a slaveholder , may not still hope fbi ' the forgiveness and charity of his brethren , though he differs from them in the honest profession of his views ? Here we have proof of the author 's perfect sincerity , and readiness to carry out his principles . He would not hesitate , should convenience and personal advantage favor it , to become an active agent in supporting and using the slave system , but would think he did God and his enslaved fellow-men a good service by so doing . He would , doubtless , intend to be a good and exemplary slaveholder , but would in fact give his sanction to the whole system , as defined and supported by the laws of the laud . His views , if carried out , would not only give a firm establishment to Slavery where it exists , but extend it indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and countries in which it has been abolished , restore the Slave // trade between Africa and other nations , and fill that great continent not with harbingers of peace and good will to men , but with armed desperadoes in pursuit of their human prey ; and all this in virtue of the curse which Noah pronounced on Canaan , not one of whose posterity is known to exist among all the tribes of that vast and populous , but cruelly oppressed quarter of the globe ! That these views and the course of conduct naturally growing out of them are clearly and flagrantly wrong , nnj u*tifiable , and pernicious , we can not doubt . But whether a really good man may not fall into such dreadful errors , and yet have some good thing in him , which will , after all , work out repentance and salvation , we leave for the Great Searcher of hearts and Judge of all to decide . But those who hold such errors , and practice such sins , especially if they occupy stations of honor and extensive influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , be reclaimed ; and that , at all events , their dangerous influence may be counteracted and restrained . If their good characters and Christian conduct in times past , and the generally good spirit which they now exhibit , constrain us to feel that they rnu8t be good men , after all , then , though our hearts are burdened with grief and our countenances filled with blushing , let us , in imitation of the reverent sons of Noah , with averted faces , step softly backwards , cast a broad mantle of charity over them , and leave them to repose quietly under it , until they awake to a due sense of their present humiliating condition , and come to themselves again . " Charity suffereth long and is kind . "
