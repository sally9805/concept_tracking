ATLANTIC MONTHLY . A MAGAZINE OF LITERATURE , ART , AND POLITICS . VOL. 1. - APRIL , 1858. - NO . VI . THE HUNDRED DAYS . PERSONAL REMINISCENCES . THAT period of history between the 20th of March and the 28th of June , 1815 , being the interregnum in the reign of Louis the Eightcenth , caused by the arrival of Napoleon from Elba and his assumption of the government of France , is known as " The Hundred Days. ** It is as interesting as it was eventful , and has been duly chronicled wherever facts have been gathered to gratify a curiosity that is not yet weary of dwelling on the point of time which saw the Star of Destiny once more in the ascendant before it sank forever . Whatever is connected with this remarkable epoch is worthy of remembrance , and whoever can add the interest of a personal experience , though it be limited and unimportant , should be satisfied , in the recital , to adopt that familiar form which may give to his recollections the strongest impress of reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The institution to which I was attached was connected with one of the National Lyceums , which were colleges where students resided in large numbers , and where classes from private schools also regularly attended , each studying in its respective place and going to the Lyceum at hours of lecture or recitation . All these establishments were , under Napoleon , to a certain degree military . The roll of the drum roused the scholar to his daily work ; a uniform with the imperial button was the only dress allowed to be worn ; and the physical as well as the intellectual training was such , that very little additional preparation was required to qualify the inmate of the Lyceum for the duties and privations of the soldier 's life . The transition was not unnatural ; and the boy who breakfasted in the open air , in midwinter , on a piece of dry bread and as much water as he chose to pump for himself ,  --  who was turned adrift , without cap or overcoat , from the study-room into the storm or sunshine of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he best might ,  --  whose continual talk with his comrades was of the bivouac or the battle-field , - and who considered the great object of life to be the development of faculties best fitted to excel in the art of destruction , would not be astonished to find himself sleeping on the bare ground with a levy of raw conscripts . // I was in daily intercourse with several hundred young men , and it may not he uninteresting to dwell a moment on the character of my companions , especially as they may be considered a fair type of the youth of France generally at that time . It is , moreover , a topic with which few are familiar . There were not many Americans in that country at that period . I knew of only one at school in Paris beside myself . If the brilliant glories of the Empire dazzled the mature mind of age , they wrought into delirium the impulsive brain of youth , whose impressions do not wait for any aid from the judgment , but burn into the soul , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom I was associated had been one of continual excitement . Hardly had the hasty but eloquent bulletin told the Parisians that the name of another bloody field was to be inscribed among the vietories of France , and the cannon of the Invalides thundered out their notes of triumph , when again the mutilated veterans were on duty at their scarcely cooled pieces and the newswomen in the streets were shrilly proclaiming some new tri umph of the imperial arms . Then came the details , thrilling a warlike people , and The trophies which symbolized success ,  - -  banners torn and stained in desperate conflict , destined to hang over Christian altars until the turning current of for tune should drift them back ,  --  parks of artillery rumbling through the streets , to be melted into statue or triumphal column ,  --  and , amid the spoils of war , everything most glorious in Art to fill that wondrous gallery , the like of which the eye of man will never look upon again . At last , in some short respite of lhose fighting days , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rest and fame ere they should stiffen on Russian snows , or swell the streams which bathe the walls of Leipsic , or blacken , with countless dead , the plains stretching between the Rhine and their own proud capital . By no portion of the people were The Hundred D*ys . April , these things gathered with such avidity and regarded with such all-absorbing interest as by the schoolboys of Paris . Every step of the " Grand Army " was watched with deep solicitude and commeiited upon with no doubtful criticism . They made themselves acquainted with the relative merit of each division , and could tell which arm of the service most contributed to the result of any particular battle . They collected information from all sourccs ,  --  from accounts in newspal ) ers , from army letters , from casual convcrsation with some maimed stinggler frcsh from the scene of war . Each boy , a he made his periodical visit to his family , brought back something to the general fund of anecdote . The fire that burned in their young bosoms was fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round decds of blood which effectually concealed the woe and misery they caused . There was but one side of the medal visible , and the figures on that were so bold and beautiful that no one cared for or thought of the ugly death'shead on the reverse . The fearful consumption of human life which ( Irained the land , sweeping off almost one entire generation of able-bodied men , and leaving the tillage of the fields to the decrepitude of age , feebly aided by female hands , gave ample opportunity to gratify the ardent minds panting to exchange the tame drudgery of school and college for the limited , but to them world-wide , authority of the subaltern 's sword and epaulet . There seemed to them but one road to advancement . The profession of arms was the sole pursuit which opened a career bounded only by the wildest *dreams of ambition . What had been could be ; and the fortunate soldier might find no check in the progressive honors of his course , until his brows should be encircled by the insignia of royalty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intimate a preference for some more peaceful occupation . A learned profession might be sneeringly tolerated ; but woe , to him who spoke of agriculture , or commerce , or the mechanic // arts ! There was little comfort for the luckless wight who , in some unguarded moment , gave utterance to such ignoble aspirations . Henceforth he was , like the Pariah of India , cut off from human sympathy , and the young gentlemen whose tastes and tendencies led them to prefer the more aristocratic trade of butchery felt that there was a line of demarcation which completely and conclusively separated them from him . This predilection for military life received no small encouragement from the occasional visit of some young C*sar , whose uniform had been tarnished in the experiences of one campaign , and who returned to his former associates to indulge in an hour of unalloyed glorification . Napoleon , when he entered the Tuileries after prostrating some hostile kingdom , never felt more importance than did the young lieutenant in his service when he passed the ponderous doors which fishered him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admirers crowded around him ! What an honor and privilege to be standing in the presence , and even pressin* the hand or rushing into the embrace , of an officer who had really seen bayonetcharges and heard the whistling of grapeshot ! How the older ones monopolized the distinguished visitor , and how the little boys crowded the outer circle to catch a word from the military oracle , proudly happy if they could get a ( listant nod of recognition ! And then the questions which were showered upon him , too numerous and varied to be answered And how he described the forced marches , and the mamruvrsug , and the great battle - how the cannonade seemed the breaking up of heaven and earth , and the solid ground shook under the charges of cavalry ; how , yet louder than all , rang the imperial battle-cry , maddening those who uttered it ; how death was everywhere , and yet he escaped unharnied , or with some slight wound which trebled his importance to his admiring auditors . He would then tell how , after hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive moment had arrived , ordered up the Imperial Guard ; how the veterans , whose hairs had bleached in the smoke of a hundred battles , advanced to fulfil their mission ; how with firm tread and lofty bearing , proud in the recollections of the past and strong in the consciousness of strength , they entered the well-fought field ; and how from rank to rank of their exhausted countrymen pealed the shout of exultation , for they knew that the hour of their deliverance had come ; and then , with overwhelming might , all branches of the service , comprised in that magnificent reserve , swept like a whirlwind , driving before them horse and foot , artillery , equipage , and standards , all mingled in irremediable confusion . With what freedom did our young hero comment on the campaign , speaking such names as Lannes and Ney , Mura.t and Massena , like household words ! lie did not , perhaps , state that the favorable result of things was entirely owing to his presence , but it might be inferred that it was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire trembled in the balance . Under such influences , and with the excitement produced by the marvellous success of the French armies , it is not singular that young men looked eagerly forward to a participation in the prodigies and splendors of their time ,  --  that they should turn disdainfully from the paths of honest industry , and that everything which constitutes the true wealth and greatness of a state should have been despised or forgotten in the lurid and blood-stained glare of military glory , which cowered like an incubus on the breast of Europe . The battle-fields were beyond the frontiers of their own country ; the calamities of war were too far distant to obtrude their disheartening features ; and no lamentations mingled with the public rejolcings . Many a broken-hearted mother mourned in se // cret for her son lying in his bloody grave ; but individual grief was disregarded in the madness which pervaded all classes , vain-glorious from repeated and uninterrupted success . But the time had come when the storm was to pour in desolation over the fields of France , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender back to her the bitter cup of humiliation . The unaccustomed sound of hostile cannon broke in on the dreams of invincibility which had entranced the people , and deeds of violence and blood , which had been complacently regarded when the theatre of action was on foreign territory , seemed quite another thing when the scene was shifted to their own vineyards and villages . The genius of Napoleon never exhibited such vast fertility of resources as when he battled for life and empire in his own dominions . Every foot of ground was wrested from him at an expense of life which thinned the innumerable hosts pressing onward to his destruction . He stood at bay against all Europe in arms ; and so desperately did he contend against the vast odds opposed to him , and so rapidly did he move from one invading column to another , successively beating back division upon division , that his astonished foes , awed by his superhuman exertions , had wellnigh turned their faces to the Rhine in panic-stricken retreat . But the line of invasion was so widely extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful power of concentration was of little avail to him when the mere skeletons of regiments answered to his call , and , along his weakened line , the neglected gleanings left by the conscription , now hastily garnered in this last extremity , greeted him in the treble notes of childhood . The voices of the bearded men , which once hailed his presence , were hushed in death . They had shouted his name in triumph over Europe , and it had quivered on their lips when parched with the mortal agony . Their bones were whitening the sands of Egypt , the harvests of Italy had long waved over them , their unnumbered graves lay thick in the German 's Fatherland , and the floods of the Berezina were yet giving up their unburied dead . The remnant of that once invincible army did all that could be done ; but there were limits to endurance , and exhaustion anticipated the hour of combat . Men fell dead in their ranks , untouched by shot or steel ; and yet the survivors pressed on to take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof against either fatigue or despair . His last bold move , on which he staked his empire , was a splendid effort , but it failed him . It was the daring play of a desperate gamester , and nearly checkmated his opponents . But when , instead of pursuing him , they marched on Paris , he left his army to follow as it could , and hastened to anticipate his enemies . When about fifteen miles from Paris , he received news of the battle of Montmartre and the capitulation of the city . The post-house where he encountered this intelligence was within sight of the place where I passed my vacations . I often looked at it with interest , for it was there that the vision first flashed before him of his broken empire and the utter ruin which bade farewell to hope . He had become familiar with reverses . His veteran legions had perished in unequal strife with the elements , or melted away in the hot flame of conflict ; his most devoted adherents had fallen around him vet his iron soul bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of storm and battle there returned " the conqueror 's broken car , The conqueror 's yet unbroken heart . " But the spirit which had never quailed before his enemies was crushed by the desertion of his friends . He had now to feel that treason and ingratitude are attendants on adversity , and that the worshippers of power , like the Gheber devotee , turn their faces reverently towards the rising sun . - There are few things in history so // touching as the position of Napoleon at Fontaineblean , during the few days which preceded his abdication and departure for the Island of Elba . Nearly all his superior officers forsook him , not even finding time to bid him adieu . Men whom he had covered with wealth and honors , who had most obsequiously courted his smiles , and been most vehement in their protestations of fidelity , were the first to leave him in his misfortune , forgetting , in their anxiety to conciliate his successor , to make the slightest stipulation for the protection of their benefactor . He was left in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps of a domestic servant to break its monastic stillness ; and , for the first time in his eventful life , he sat , hour after hour , without movement , brooding over his despair . At last , when all was ready for his departure , he called up something of his old energy , and again stood in the presence of what remained of the Imperial Guard , which was faithful to the end . These brave men had often encircled him , like a wall of granite , in the hour of utmost peril , and they were now before him , to look upon him , as they thought , for the last time . He struggled to retain his firmness , but the effort was beyond human resolution ; his pride gave way before his bursting heart , and the stern vanquisher of nations wept with his old comrades . Napoleon was gone . His empire was in the dust . The streets of his capital were filled with strangers , and the volatile Parisians were almost compensated for the degradation , in their wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Cossacks of the Don had made their threatened " hurra , " and bivouacked on the banks of the Seine . Prussian and Austrian cannon pointed down all the great thoroughfares , and by their side , day and night , the burning match suggested the penalty of any popular commotion . The Bourbons were at the Tuileries , and France appeared to have moved back to the place whence she had started on her course of redemption . At length , slowly and prudently , the allied armies commenced their homeward march , and the reigning family were left to their own resources , to reconcile as they could the heterogeneous materials stranded by the receding tide of revolution . But concession formed no part of their character , and reconciliation was an unknown element in their plan of government . They took possession of the throne ns though they had only been absent on a pleasure excursion , and , ignoring twenty years of parvenu glory , affected to be merely continuing an uninterrupted sovereignty . The pithy remark of Talleyrand , that " they had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wake , came hordes of emigrants famished by long exile and clamorous for the restitution of ancient privileges . There was nothing in common between them and the men of the Republic , or of the Empire . They assumed an air of superiority , which the latter answered with the most undisguised contempt . Ridicule , that fearful political engine , which , especially in France , is sufficient to batter down the hopes of any aspirant who lays himself open to it , and which Napoleon himself , in his greatest power , feared more than foreign armies or intestine conspiracies , was most unsparingly directed against them . The print-shops exposed them in every possible form of caricature , the theatres burlesqued their pretensions , songs and epigrams contributed to their discomfiture , and all the ingenuity of a witty and laughter-loving people was unmercifully poured out upon this resurrection of antediluvian remains . Their royal patrons came in for a full share of the general derision , but they seemed entirely unmindful that there was such a thing as popular opinion , or any other will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them which might have preached to them of the uncertainty of human grandeur and the vanity of kingly pride , reminding them that there is // but a step from the palace to the scaffold , which step had been taken by more than one of their family . The walls of their abode were yet marked by musket-balls , mementos of a day of appalling violence , and from the windows they could see the public square where the guillotine had permanently stood and the pavement had been crimsoned with the blood of their race . They had awakened from a long sleep , among a new order of men , who were strangers to them , and who looked upon them as beings long since buried , but now , unnaturally and indecorously , protruded upon living society . They commenced by placing themselves in antagonism to the nation , and erected a barrier which effectually divided them from the people . The history of the Republic and the Empire was to be blotted out ; it was a forbidden theme in their presence , and whatever reminded them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The remains of the Old Guard were removed to the provinces or drafted into new regiments ; leaders , whose very names stirred France like the blast of a trumpet , were almost Unkilown in the royal circle ; and the great Exile was never to be mentioned without the liability to a charge of treason . During all this time of change , the youth of France , shut up in schools and colleges , kept pace with the outer world in information , and outstripped it in manifestations of feeling . I can judge of public sentiment only by inferences drawn from occasional observation , or the recorded opinions of others . I believe that many did not regret the fall of Napoleon , being weary of perpetual war , and hoping that the accession of the Bourbons would establish permanent peace . I believe that those who had attained the summit of military rank were not unwilling to pass some portion of their lives in the luxury of their own homes . I believe that there were mothers who rejoiced that the dreaded conscription had ended , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , because I understood it so to be . But April , whatever may have been the hopes of the lovers of tranquillity , or the wishes of warriors worn out in service , or the maternal instincts which would avert the iron hand clutching at new victims for the shrine of Moloch , I can answer that the boys remained staunch Bonapartists , for I was in the midst of them , and I have the fullest faith that those about me were exponents of the whole generation just entering on the stage of action . During the decline of the Empire , when defeat might be supposed to have quenched the fire of their enthusiasni , they remained unchanged , firmly trusting that glory would retrace her steps and once more follow the imperial eagles . And now , when their idol was overthrown , their veneration had not diminished nor wavered . Napoleon , with his four hundred grenadiers , at Elba , was still the Emperor ; and those who , as they conceived , had usurped his government , received no small share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some deserted and others reviled him , the boys w5e true as steel . It was not solely because the career which was open to them closed with his abdication , but a nobler feeling of devotion animated them in his hour of trial , and survived his downfall . Many of our instructors were well satisfied with the new state of things . Some of the older ones had been educated as priests , and were officiating in their calling , when the Revolution broke in upon them , trampling alike on sacred shrine and holy vestment . The shaven crown was a warrant for execution , and it rolled beneath the guillotine , or fell by cold-blooded murder at the altar where it ministered . Infuriated mobs hunted them like bloodhounds ; and the cloisters of convent and monastery , which had hitherto been disturbed only by footsteps gliding quietly from cell to chapel , or the hum of voices mingling in devotion , now echoed the tread of armed ruffians and resounded with ribaldry and imprecations . An old man , who was for a time // my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had narrowly escaped , once , by concealing himself under the floor of his room . He said that he felt the pressure , as his pursuers repeatedly passed over him , and could hear their avowed intention to hang him at the next lamppost ,  --  a mode of execution not uncommon , when hot violence could not wait the slow processes of law . These men saw in the Restoration a hope that the good old times would come back ,  --  that the crucifix would again be an emblem of temporal power , mightier than the sword ,  --  that the cowled monk would become the counsellor of kings , and once more take his share in the administration of empires . But if they expected to commence operations by subjecting their pupils to their own legitimate standard , and to bring about a tame acquiescence in the existing order of things , they were wofully mistaken . Conservatism never struggled with a more determined set of radicals . Their life and action were treason . They talked it , and wrote it , and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express it that they left untouched . They covered the walls with grotesque reprcsentations of the royal family ; they shouted out parodies of Bourbon songs ; and there was not a hero of the old re'girne , from Hugh Capet down , whose virtues were not celebrated under the name of Napoleon . It was in vain that orders were issued not to mention him . They might as well have told the young rebels not to breathe . " iNot mention him ! They would like to see who could stop them ! " And they yelled out his name in utter defiance of regulation and discipline . Wonder was occasionally expressed , whether the time would come which would restore him to France . And now " the time had come , and the man . " While the assembled sovereigns were parcelling out the farm of Europe , in lots to suit purchasers , its late master decided to claim a few acres for his own use , and , as he set foot on his old domain , he is said to have exclaimed ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a beautiful afternoon of early spring , when a class returned from the Lyceum with news almost too great for utterance . One had in his hand a coarse , dingy piece of paper , which he waved above his head , and the others followed bim with looks portending tidings of no ordinary character . That paper was the address of Napoleon to the army , on landing from Elba . It was rudely done , the materials were of the most common description , the print was scarcely legible ,  --  but it was headed with the imperial eagle , and it contained words which none of his old soldiers could withstandHow it reached Paris , simultaneously with the intelligence of his landing , is beyond my comprehension ; but copies of it were rapidly circulated , and all the inhabitants of Paris knew its contents before they slept that night . I know of no writer who has so thoroughly understood the wonderful eloquence of Napoleon as Lord Brougham . He has pronounced the address to the Old Guard , at Fontainebleau , " a masterpiece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Champ de Mars , he says , " is to be placed amongst the most perfect pieces of simple and majestic eloquence . " Napoleon certainly knew well the people with whom he had to deal , and his concise , nervous , comprehensive sentences told upon French feeling like shocks of a galvanic battery . What would have been absurd , if addressed to the soldiers of any other nation , was exactly the thing to fire his own with irresistible energy . At the battle of the Pyramids he said to them , " Forty centuries look upon your deeds , " and they understood him . He pointed to " the sun of Austerlitz , " at the dawn of many a decisive day , and they felt that it rose to look on their eagles victorious . If the criterion of eloquence be its power over the passions , that of Napoleon Bonaparte has been rarely equalled . It was always the right thing at the right time , and produced precisely the effect // April , it aimed at . It was never more apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thrilled the martial spirit of the land , and quickened into life the old associations connected with days of glory . Marshal iNey said , at his trial , that there was one sentence * in it which no French soldier could resist , and which drew the whole of his army over to the Emperor . Such was the paper , which was read amidst the mad demonstrations of my schoolfellows . Their extravagance knew no limits ; studies were neglected ; and the recitations , next morning , demonstrated to our discomforted teachers that the minds of their pupils had passed the night on the march from Cannes to Paris . The court journals spoke lightly of the whole matter , pronounced the " usurper " crazy , and predicted that he would be brought to the capital in chains . There were sometimes rumors that he was defeated and slain , and again that he was a prisoner at the mercy of the king . The telegraphic despatches were not made public , and the utmost care was practised by the government to conceal the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no alteration in the usual routine of the royal family , and there was no outward sign of the mortal consternation that was shaking them to the centre of their souls . Th* day before the entrance of the Emperor , I happened to he passing through the court-yard of the Tuileries , when an array of carriages indicated that the inmates of the palace were about to take their daily drive . As my position was favorable , I stopped to look at the display of fine equipages , and soon saw part of the family come down and go out , as I supposed , for their morning recreation . It was , however , no party of pleasure , and they did not stop to take breath until they had passed the frontiers of France . They had information which was unknown to the public , * " La victoire marchera an pas de charge . " and they thought it advisable to quit the premises before the new lessee took possession . The next afternoon , my father , who was at that time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change was evidently about to take place , and wished me to accompany him . As we passed through the streets , the noise of our carriage was the only sound heard . Most of the shops were closed ; few persons were abroad , and we scarcely met or passed a single vehicle . As we drew near the Tuileries the evidences of life increased , and when we drove into the Place du Carrousel , the quadrangle formed by the palace and the Louvre , the whole immense area was filled with people ; yet the stillness was awful . Men talked in an undertone , as they stood grouped together , apparently unwilling to communicate their thoughts beyond their particular circle . The sound of wheels and the appearance of the carriage caused many to rush towards us ; but , seeing strangers , they let us pursue our way until we drew up near the Arch of Triumph . It was a strange sight , that sea of heads all around us heaving in portentous silence at the slightest incident . They felt that something , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were ignorant of the exact state of things ; and as the royal standard was still on the palace , they supposed the king might be there . INow and then , a few officers , having an air of authority , would walk firmly and quickly through the crowd , as though they knew their errand and were intent on executing it . Again , a band of Polytechnic scholars , always popular with the mob , would be cheered as they hurried onward . Occasionally , small bodies of soldiers passed , going to relieve guard ; and as they bore the Bourbon badge , they were sometimes noticed by a feeble cry of allegiance . At last , a drum was heard at one of the passages , and a larger number of troops entered the square . They were veteranlooking warriors , and bore upon them the marks of dust-stained travel . Their // bronzed faces were turned towards the flag that floated over the building , and , as they marched directly towards the entrance , the multitude crowded around them , and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding officer cast a proud look about him , took off his cap , raised it on the point of his sword , showing the tricolored cockade , and shouted , " Vive l'Empereur ! " The charm was broken ; and such a scene as passed before me no man sees twice in this world . All around those armed men there burst a cry which , diverging from that centre , spread to the outer border , till every voice of that huge mass was shrieking in perfect frenzy . Those nearest to the soldiers rushed upon them , bugging them like long lost friends ; some danced , or embraced the man next to them ; some laughed like maniacs , and some cried outright . The place , where a few minutes before there arose only a confused hum of suppressed whisperings , now roared like a rock-bound sea-coast in a tempest . As if by magic , men appeared decorated with tricolored ribbons , and all joined with the soldiers in moving directly toward the place where the white flag was flapping its misplaced triumph over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivered to rend it piecemeal . Their wishes were anticipated ; for the foremost rank had scarcely reached the threshold of the palace , when down went the ensign of the Bourbons , and the muchloved tricolor streamed out amidst thunder shouts which seemed to shake the earth . A revolution was accomplished . One dynasty had supplanted another ; and an epoch , over which the statesman ponders and the bistorian philosophizes , appeared to be as much a matter-of-course sort of thing as the removal of one family from a mansion to make room for another . In this case , however , the good old custom of leaving the tenement in decent condition was neglected ; the last occupants having been too precipitate in their departure to conform to the usages of good housekeeping by consulting the comfort and convenience of their successor . On the contrary , to solace themselves for the mortification of ejection , the retiring household pocketed some of the loose articles , denominated crown jewels , which were afterwards recovered , however , by a swap for one of the family , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was worth exchanging . We alighted from our carriage and passed through the basement-passage of the palace into the garden . We walked to the further en ( l , encountering people who had heard the shouting and were hurrying to ascertain its meaning . At a bend of the path we met Mr. Crawford , our Minister at Paris , with Mr. Erving , U. S. Minister to Spain , and they eagerly inquired , " What news ? " My father turned , and , walking back with them a few steps to where the building was visible , pointed to the standard at its summit . Nothing more was necessary . It told the whole story . I left them and hurried back to the institution to which I belonged . I was anxious to relate the events of the day , and , as I was the only one of the pupils who had witnessed them , I had a welcome which might well have excited the jealousy of the Emperor . As far as the school was concerned , I certainly divided honors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited copartnership , and expired at bedtime . Napoleon entered the city about eight o'clock that night . We were nearly two miles from his line of progress , but we could distinctly trace it by the roar of voices , which sounded like a continuous roll of distant thunder . I saw him , two days after , at a window of the Tuileries . I stopped directly under the building , where twenty or thirty persons had assembled , who were crying out for him with what seemed to me most presumptuous familiarity . They called him " Lktle Corporal , " - " Corporal of the Violet , " - said they wanted to see him , and that he must come to the window , lie lookea out twice dur // ing the half-hour I staid there , had on the little cocked hat which has become historical , smiled and nodded good-naturedly , and seemed to consider that something was due from him to the " many-headed " at that particular time . Such condescension was not expected or given in his palmy days , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought nearer to them by misfortune . It was said , at the time , that he was much elated on his arrival , but that he grew reserved , if not depressed , as his awful responsibility became more and more apparent . He had hoped for a division in the Allied Councils , but they were firm and united , and governed only by the unalterable determination to overwhelm and destroy him . He saw that his sole reliance was on the chances of war ; that he had to encounter enemies whose numbers were inexhaustible , and who , having once dethroned him , would no longer he impeded by the terror of his name . There was , besides , no time to recruit his diminished battalions , or to gather the munitions of war . The notes of preparation sounded over Europe , and already the legions of his foes were hastening to encircle France with a cordon of steeL The scattered relics of the " Grand Army " which had erected and sustained his empire were hastily collected , and , as they in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent forward to concentre on the battle-ground that was to decide his fate . No branch of art was idle that could contribute to the approaching conflict . Cannon were cast with unprecedented rapidity , and the material of war was turned out to the extent of human ability . But he was deficient in everything that constitutes an army . Men , horses , arms , equipage , all were wanting . The long succession of dreadful wars which had decimated the country had also destroyed , beyond the possibility of immediate repair , that formidable arm which had decided so many battles , and which is peculiarly adapted to the impetuosity of the French character . The cavalry was feeble , and it was evident , even to an unpractised eye , as the columns marched through the streets , that the horses were unequal to their riders . The campaign of Moscow had been irretrievably disastrous to this branch of the service . Thirty thousand horses had perished in a single night , and the events which succeeded had almost entirely exhausted this indispensable auxiliary in the tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced were evident in the processions of unwashed citizens , which paraded the streets as a demonstration of the popular determination to " do or die . " Whatever could he raked from the remote quarters of Paris was marshalled before the Emperor . Faubourgs , which in the worst days of the Revolution had produced its worst actors , now poured out their squalid and motley inhabitants , and astonished the more refined portions of the metropolis with this eruption of semi-civilization.
