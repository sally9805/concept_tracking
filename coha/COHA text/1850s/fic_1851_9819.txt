Preface On commencing his former work , illustrative of the revolutionary history of Vermont ,  --  The Green Mountain Boys ,  --  it was the design of the author to have embraced the battle of Bennington , and other events of historic interest which occurred in the older and more southerly parts of the state ; but finding , as he proceeded , that the unity and interest of his effort would be endangered by embracing so much ground , a part of the original design was relinquished , or rather its execution was deferred for a new and separate work , wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials of which his researches had put him in possession . That work , after an interval of ten years , and the writing and publishing of several intermediate ones , is now presented to the public , and with the single remark , that if it is made to possess less interest , as a mere tale , than its predecessor , the excuse must be found in the author 's greater anxiety to give a true historic version of the interesting and important events he has undertaken to illustrate . - January , 1851 . Main text CHAPTER I. " Sing on ! sing on ! my mountain home , The paths where erst I used to roam , The thundering torrent lost in foam , The snow-hill side all bathed in light ,  --  All , all are bursting on my sight ! " Towards night , on the twelfth of March , 1775 , a richly-equipped double sleigh , filled with a goodly company of well-dressed persons of the different sexes , was seen descending from the eastern side of the Green Mountains , along what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigable portions of the Hudson to those of the Connecticut River . The progress of the travellers was not only slow , but extremely toilsome , as was plainly evinced by the appearance of the reeking and jaded horses , as they labored and floundered along the sloppy and slumping snow paths of the winter road , which was obviously now fast resolving itself into the element of which it was composed . Up to the previous evening , the dreary reign of winter had continued wholly uninterrupted by the advent of his more gentle successor in the changing rounds of the seasons ; and the snowy waste which enveloped the earth would , that morning , have apparently withstood the rains and suns of months before yielding entirely to their influences . But during the night there had occurred one of those great and sudden transitions from cold to heat , which can only be experienced in northern climes , and which can be accounted for only on the supposition , that the earth , at stated intervals , rapidly gives out large quantities of its internal heats , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or modification in the state of the electric fluid . The morning had been cloudless ; and the rising sun , with rays no longer dimly struggling through the dense , obstructing medium of the dark months gone by , but , with the restored beams of his natural brightness , fell upon the smoking earth with the genial warmth of summer . A new atmosphere , indeed , seemed to have been suddenly created , so warm and bland was the whole air ; while , occasionally , a breeze came over the face of the traveller , which seemed like the breath of a heated oven . As the day advanced , the sky gradually became overcast  --  a strong south wind sprung up , before whose warm puffs the drifted snow-banks seemed literally to be cut down , like grass before the scythe of the mower ; and , at length , from the thickening mass of cloud above , the rain began to descend in torrents to the mutely recipient earth . All this , for a while , however , produced no very visible effects on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was many hours in becoming saturated with its own and water from above . Nor had our travellers , for the greater part of the day , been much incommoded by the rain , or the thaw , that was in silent , but rapid progress around and beneath them ; as their vehicle was a covered one , and as the hard-trodden paths of the road were the last to be affected . But , during the last hour , a great change in the face of the landscape had become apparent ; and the evidence of what had been going on unseen , through the day , was now growing every moment more and more palpable . The snow along the bottom of every valley was marked by a long , dark streak , indicating the presence of the fast-collecting waters beneath . The stifled sounds of rushing streams were heard issuing from the hidden beds of every natural rill ; while the larger brooks were beginning to burst through their wintry coverings , and throw up and push on before them the rending ice and snow that obstructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hurrying with increasing speed , and with seemingly growing impatience at every obstacle they met in their way . The road had also become so soft , that the horses sunk nearly to the flank at almost every step , and the plunging sleigh drove heavily along the plashy path . The whole mass of the now saturated and dissolving snow , indeed , though lying , that morning , more than three feet deep on a level , seemed to quiver and move , as if on the point of flowing away in a body to the nearest channels . The company we have introduced consisted of four gentlemen and two ladies , all belonging , very evidently , to the most wealthy , and , up to that time , the most honored and influential class of society . But though all seemed to be of the same caste , yet their natural characters , as any physiognomist , at a glance , would have discovered , were , for so small a party , unusually diversified . Of the two men occupying the front seat , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and acting as driver was tall , showily dressed , and of a haughty , aristocratic air ; while his sharp features , which set out in the shape of a half-moon , the convex outline being preserved by a retreating forehead , an aquiline nose , and a chin sloping inward , combined to give him a cold , repulsive countenance , fraught with expressions denoting selfishness and insincerity . The other occupant of the same seat was , on the contrary , a young man of an unassuming demeanor , shapely features , and a mild , pleasing countenance . The remaining two gentlemen of the party were much older , but scarcely less dissimilar in their appearance than the two just described . One of them was a gaunt , harsh-featured man , of the middle age , with an air of corresponding arrogance and assumption . The other , who was still more elderly , was a thick-set and rather portly personage , of that quiet , reserved , and somewhat haughty demeanor , which usually belongs to men of much self-esteem , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , and in the full bloom of maidenly beauty . But their native characters , like those of their male companions , seemed to be very strongly contrasted . The one seated on the left was fair , extremely fair , indeed ; and her golden locks , clustering in rich profusion around her snowy neck and temples , gave peculiar effect to the picture-like beauty of her face . But her beauty consisted of pretty features , and her countenance spoke rather of the affections than of the mind , being of that tender , pleading cast , which is better calculated to call forth sympathy than command respect , and which showed her to be one of those confiding , dependent persons , whose destinies are in the hands of those whom they consider their friends , rather than in their own keeping . The other maiden , with an equally fine form and no less beautiful features , was still of an entirely different appearance . She , indeed , was , to the one first described , what the rose , with its hardy stem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its support ; and though less delicately fair in mere complexion , she was yet more commandingly beautiful ; for there was an expression in the bright , discriminating glances of her deep hazel eyes , and in the commingling smile that played over the whole of her serene and benignant countenance , that told of intellects that could act independently , as well as of a heart that glowed with the kindly affections . " Father , " said the last described female , addressing the eldest gentleman , for the purpose , apparently , of giving a new turn to the conversation , which had now , for some time , been lagging ,  --  " father , I think you promised us , on starting from Bennington this morning , not only a fair day , but a safe arrival at Westminster Court-House , by sunset , did you not ? " " Why , yes , perhaps I did , " replied the person addressed ; " for I know I calculated that we should get through by daylight . " " Well , my weatherwise father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promised sunshine , does the progress , made and now making , augur very brightly for the other part of the result ? " " I fear me not , Sabrey , " answered the old gentleman , " though , with the road as good as when we started , we should have easily accomplished it . But who would have dreamed of a thaw so sudden and powerful as this ? Why , the very road before us looks like a running river ! Indeed , I think we shall do well to reach Westminster at all to-night . What say you , Mr. Peters ,  --  will the horses hold out to do it ? " he added , addressing the young man of the repulsive look , who had charge of the team , as before mentioned . " They must do it , at all events , Squire Haviland , " replied Peters . " Sheriff Patterson , here , " he continued , glancing at the hard-featured man before described , " has particular reasons for being on the ground to-night . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can persuade him to forego his intended stop at Brattleborough ; for , being of a military turn , we will give him the command of the forces , if he will go on immediately with us . " " Thank you , Mr. Peters , " replied Jones , smiling . " I do not covet the honor of a command , though I should be ready to go on and assist , if I really believed that military forces would be needed . " " Military forces needed for what ? " asked Haviland , in some surprise . " Why , have you not heard , Squire Haviland , " said the sheriff , " that threats have been thrown out , that our coming court would not be suffered to sit ? " " Yes , something of the kind , perhaps , " replied Haviland , contemptuously ; " but I looked upon them only as the silly vaporings of a few disaffected creatures , who , having heard of the rebellious movements in the Bay State , have thrown out these idle threats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holding of a court , which they fear might bring too many of them to justice . " " So I viewed the case for a while , " rejoined Patterson ; " but a few days ago , I received secret information , on which I could rely , that these disorganizing rascals were actually combining , in considerable numbers , with the intention of attempting to drive us from the Court-House . " " Impossible ! impossible ! Patterson , " said the squire ; " they will never be so audacious as to attempt to assail the king 's court . " " They are making a movement for that purpose , nevertheless , " returned the former ; " for , in addition to the information I have named , I received a letter from Judge Chandler , just as I was leaving my house in Brattleborough , yesterday morning , in which the judge stated , that about forty men , from Rockingham , came to him in a body , at his house in Chester , and warned him against holding the court ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be shed , if it was attempted , especially if the sheriff appeared with an armed posse . " " Indeed ! why , I am astonished at their insolence ! " exclaimed the squire . " But what did the judge tell them ? " " Why the judge , you know , has an oily way of getting along with ugly customers , " replied the sheriff , with a significant wink ; " so he thanked them all kindly for calling on him , and gravely told them he agreed with them , that no court should be holden at this time . But , as there was one case of murder to be tried , he supposed the court must come together to dispose of that ; after which they would immediately adjourn . And promising them that he would give the sheriff directions not to appear with any armed assistants , he dismissed them , and sat down and wrote me an account of the affair , winding off with giving me the directions he had promised , but adding in a postscript , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I should obey his directions ; and he should not be surprised to see me there with a hundred men , each with a gun or pistol under his great-coat ! Ha ! ha ! The judge is a sly one . " " One word about that case of murder , to which you have alluded , Mr. Patterson , " interposed Jones , after the jeering laugh , with which the sheriff 's account was received by Haviland and Peters , had subsided . " I have heard several mysterious hints thrown out by our opponents about it , which seemed to imply that the prosecution of the prisoner was got up for private purposes ; and I think I have heard the name of Secretary Brush coupled with the affair . Now , who is the alleged murderer ? and where and when was the crime committed ? " " The fellow passes by the name of Herriot , though it is suspected that this is not his true name , " responded the sheriff . " The crime was committed at Albany , several years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate friend of Mr. Brush . " " Under what circumstances ? " " Why , from what I have gathered , I should think the story might be something like this : that , some time previous to the murder , this Herriot had come to Albany , got into company above his true place , dashed away a while in high life , gambled deeply , and , losing all his own money , and running up a large debt to this , and other friends of Brush , gave them his obligations and absconded . But coming there again , for some purpose , a year or two after , with a large sum of money , it was thought , which had been left or given him by a rich Spaniard , whose life he had saved , or something of the kind , those whom he owed beset him to pay them , or play again . But he refused to play , pretending to have become pious , and also held back about paying up his old debts . Their debts , however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose ; when an affray arose , and one of them was killed by Herriot , who escaped , and fled , it seems , to this section of the country , where he kept himself secluded in some hut in the mountains , occasionally appearing abroad to preach religion and rebellion to the people , by which means he was discovered , arrested , and imprisoned in Westminster jail , where he awaits his trial at the coming term of the court . And I presume he will be convicted and hung , unless he makes friends with Brush to intercede for a pardon , which he probably might do , if the fellow would disgorge enough of his hidden treasures to pay his debts , and cease disaffecting the people , which is treason and a hanging matter of itself , for which he , and fifty others in this quarter , ought , in justice , to be dealt with without benefit of the clergy .  --  What say you , Squire Haviland ? " " I agree with you fully , " replied the squire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps have you taken , if any , in order to sustain the court in the threatened emergency ? " " Why , just the steps that Chandler knew I should take  --  sent off one messenger to Brush , there on the ground at Westminster ; another to Rogers , of Kent ; and yet another to a trusty friend in Guilford , requesting each to be on , with a small band of resolute fellows ; while I whipped over to Newfane myself , fixed matters there , and came round to Bennington to enlist David Redding , and a friend or two more ; as I did , after I arrived , last night , though I was compelled to leave them my sleigh and horses to bring them over , which accounts for my begging a passage with you . So , you see , that if this beggarly rabble offer to make any disturbance , I shall be prepared to teach them the cost of attempting to put down the king 's court . " " Things are getting to a strange pass among these deluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , yet believe them so infatuated as to take this step . But if they should , decided measures should be taken  --  such , indeed , as shall silence this alarming spirit at once and forever . " " I hope , " observed Miss Haviland , who had been a silent but attentive listener to the dialogue , " I hope no violence is really intended , either on the part of the authorities or their opponents . But what do these people complain of ? There must be some cause , by which they , at least , think themselves justified in the movement , surely . Do they consider themselves aggrieved by any past decisions of the court ? " " O , there are grumblers enough , doubtless , in that respect , " answered the sheriff . " And among other things , they complain that their property is taken and sold to pay their honest debts , when money is so scarce , they say , that they can not pay their creditors in currency  --  just as if the court could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretence . They have other motives , and those , too , of a more dangerous character to the public peace . " " And what may those motives be , if it be proper for me to inquire , sir ? " resumed the fair questioner . " Why , in the first place , " replied the sheriff , " they have an old and inveterate grudge against New York , whose jurisdiction they are much predisposed to resist . But to this they might have continued to demur and submit , as they have done this side of the mountain , had New York adopted the resolves of the Continental Congress of last December , and come into the American Association , as it is called , which has no less for its object , in reality , than the entire overthrow of all royal authority in this country . But as our colony has nobly refused to do this , they are now intent on committing a double treason  --  that of making war on New York and the king too . " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the people of this section , who have shown themselves commendably conservative , for the most part , had any intention of yielding to the mob-laws of Ethan Allen , Warner , and others , who place the laws of New York at defiance on the other side of the mountains ; and much less that they would heed the resolves of that self-constituted body of knaves , ignoramuses , and rebels , calling themselves the Continental Congress . " " Are you not too severe on that body of men , father ? " said Miss Haviland , lifting her expressive eye reprovingly to the face of the speaker . " I have recently read over a list of the members of the Congress ; when I noticed among them the names of men , who , but a short time since , stood very high , both for learning and worth , as I have often heard you say yourself . Now , what has changed the characters of these men so suddenly ? " " Why is it , Sabrey , " said the old gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct answer to the troublesome question ,  --  " why is it that you can not take the opinion of your friends , who know so much more than you do about these matters , instead of raising , as I have noticed you have lately seemed inclined to do , questions which seem to imply doubts of the correctness of the measures of our gracious sovereign and his wise ministers ? " " Why , father , " replied the other , with an ingenuous , but somewhat abashed look , " if I have raised such questions , in relation to the quarrel between the colonies and the mother country , I have gone on the ground that the party which has the most right on its side would , of course , have the best reasons for its measures ; and as I have not always been able to perceive good reasons for all the king 's measures , I had supposed you would be proud to give them . " The old gentleman , though evidently disturbed and angry at this reply , did not seem inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other gentlemen , also , looked rather glum ; and for many moments not a word was spoken ; when the other young lady , who had not yet spoken , after glancing round on the gentlemen in seeming expectation that those better reasons would be given , at length ventured to remark ,  --  " Well , for my part , it is enough for me that my friends all belong to the loyal party ; and whatever might be said , I know I should always feel that they were in the right , and their opposers in the wrong . " " And in that , Jane , I think you are wise , " responded Jones , with an approving smile . " The complaints of these disaffected people are based on mistaken notions . They are too ill informed , I fear , to appreciate the justice and necessity of the measures of our ministers , or to understand very clearly what they are quarrelling about . " " Ah , that is it , " warmly responded Haviland . " That is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own rights , or what is for their own good , and should be treated accordingly . And I think some of our leading men miss it in trying to reason with them . Reason with them ! Ridiculous ! As if the common people could understand an argument ! " " You are perfectly right , squire , " responded Peters , with eager promptness . " My own experience among the lower classes fully confirms your opinion . My business , for several years past , has brought me often in contact with them , in a certain quarter ; and I have found them not only ignorant of what properly belongs to their own rights and privileges , but jealous and obstinate to a degree that is excessively annoying . " " Friend Peters probably alludes to his experience in the great republic of Guilford , " said Jones , archly . " There and elsewhere , " rejoined the former ; " though I have seen quite enough of republicanism there , for my purpose . One year , the party outvoting their opponents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors . The next year the upsetters themselves get upset ; and all the measures they had established are reversed for others no better ; and so they go on from year to year , forever quarrelling and forever changing . " " And yet , Peters , " resumed Jones , banteringly , " I doubt whether you have been much the loser by their quarrels . " " How so , Mr. Jones ? " asked Haviland , who noticed that Peters had answered only by a significant smile . " Why , you know , Squire Haviland , " replied Jones , " that I have been on to attend several of the last sessions of your court , as the agent of Secretary Fanning , * to see to his landed interests in this quarter . Well , friend Peters , here , who has gone considerably into land speculations east of the mountains , you know , had brought , it seems , several suits for the possession of lands , mostly in this same Guilford ; and among the rest , one for a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they called Harry Woodburn , who appeared in court in his striped woollen frock , and insisted on defending his own case , as he proceeded to do with a great deal of confidence . But when he came to produce his deed for the land he contended was his own , it was found , to his utter astonishment , to bear a later date than the one produced by Peters . This seemed to settle the case against him . But he appeared to have no notion of giving up so ; and , by favor of court , the further hearing of the case was deferred a day or two , to enable him to procure the town records , which , he contended , would show the priority of his deed . So he posted back to Guilford for the purpose ; but , on arriving there , found , to his dismay , that the records were nowhere to be found . One of the belligerent parties of that town , it seems , had broken into the clerk 's office , stolen the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , therefore , had to return , and submit to a judgment against him . Still , however , he clung to his case , and obtained a review of it , in expectation that the records would be found before the next court . But the poor fellow seemed doomed to disappointment . At the next court , no records were forthcoming ; and though he defended his case with great zeal , he was thrown in his suit again ; when he concluded , I suppose , to yield to his fate without further ado . " " Not by any means , " said Peters , in a tone of raillery . " He has petitioned for a new trial ; and the question is to come on at this court . " " Indeed ! " exclaimed Jones , laughing . " Well , I must confess I have never seen so much dogged determination exhibited in so hopeless a case . And I really could not help admiring the fellow 's spirit and uncultured force of mind , as much misapplied as , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stevens , really appeared , once or twice , to be quite annoyed at his home thrusts ; while lawyer Knights , or Rough-hewn Sam , as they call him , who , either from a sly wish to see his friend Stevens bothered , or from a real wish to help Harry , volunteered to whisper a few suggestions in his ear occasionally , sat by , and laughed out of his eyes , till they ran over with tears , to see a court lawyer so hard pushed by a country bumpkin . " " Pooh ! you make too much of the fellow , " said Peters , with assumed contempt . " Why , he is a mere obstinate boor , whose self-will and vanity led him to set up and persevere in a defence in which he knows there is neither law nor justice . " " And yet , Mr. Peters , " observed Miss Haviland , inquiringly , " the young man must have known that he was making great expense for himself , in obtaining delays and new trials , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not very confident those records would have established his right , why should he have done this ? " " O , that was a mere pretence about the records altering the case , doubtless , " replied Peters , with the air of one wishing to hear no more on the subject . " It may have been so , " rejoined the former , doubtfully ; " but I should have hardly inferred it from Mr. Jones 's description of the man and his conduct . " " Nor I , " interposed the other lady , playfully , but with considerable spirit . " Mr. Jones has really excited my curiosity by his account of this young plough-jogger . I should like to get a sight of him  --  should n't you , Sabrey ? " But the latter , though evidently musing on the subject , and mentally discussing some unpleasant doubts and inferences which it seemed to present to her active mind , yet evaded the question , and turned the conversation , by directing the attention of her companion and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which here opened to their view . This was the tall , rugged mountain , which , rising from the eastern shore of the Connecticut , was here , through an opening in the trees , seen looming and lifting its snowy crest to the clouds , and greeting the gladdened eyes of the way-worn travellers with the silent but welcome announcement that they were now within a few miles of the great river , and in the still more immediate vicinity of their intended halting-place  --  the thriving little village which was then just starting into life , under the auspices of the man from whom its name was derived  --  the enterprising Colonel Brattle , of Massachusetts . Having now the advantage of a road , which , as it received the many concentrating paths of a thicker settlement , here began to be comparatively firm , the travellers passed rapidly over the descending grounds , and , in a short time , entered the village . As they were dashing along towards the village inn , at a full trot , a man , with a vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the south , struck into the same street a short distance before them . His whole equipment was very obviously of the most simple character ,  --  a rough board box , resting on four upright wooden pins inserted into a couple of saplings , which were bent up in front for runners  --  the whole making what , in New England phrase , is termed a jumper , constituted his sleigh . And this vehicle was drawn by a long switchtailed young pony , whose unsteady gait , as he briskly ambled along the street , pricking up his ears and veering about at every new object by the way-side , showed him to be but imperfectly broken . The owner of this rude contrivance for locomotion was evidently some young farmer from the neighboring country . But although his dress and mode of travelling seemed thus to characterize him , yet there was that in his personal appearance , as plain as was his homespun garb , which was calculated to command at once both attention and respect . And as he now rose and stood firmly planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions of the team behind him , with his long , togalike woollen frock drawn snugly over his finely-sloping shoulders and well-expanded bust , and closely girt about at the waist by a neatly-knotted Indian belt , while the flowing folds below streamed gracefully aside in the wind , he displayed one of those compact , shapely figures , which the old Grecian sculptors so delighted to delineate . And in addition to these advantages of figure , he possessed an extremely fine set of features , which were shown off effectively by the profusion of short , jetty locks , that curled naturally around his white temples and his bold , high forehead . " Miss McRea  --  Jane , " said Jones , turning round to the amiable girl , and tapping her on the shoulder , with the confiding smile and tender playfulness of the accepted lover , as he was ,  --  " Jane , you said , I think , that you should like to get a sight of that spunky opponent of Mr. Peters , whom we were talking of a little while since  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , to be sure I did , " replied the other briskly ; " but why that question , just at this time ? " " Because , if I do not greatly mistake , that man who is pushing on before us , in yon crazy-looking establishment , is the self-same young fellow . Is it not so , Peters ? " " I have not noticed him particularly , nor do I care whether it is he or not , " answered Peters , with an affected indifference , with which his uneasy and frowning glances , as he kept his eye keenly fixed on the person in question , but illy comported . " Well , that is the fellow  --  that is Harry Woodburn , you may rely on it , ladies , " rejoined Jones , gayly , as he faced about in his seat . Both young ladies now threw intent and curious glances forward on the man thus pointed out to them , till they caught , as they did the next moment , a full and fair view of his personal appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions of surprise , which plainly indicated that the object of their thoughts was quite a different person from what they had been led to expect . " His dress , to be sure , is rather coarse , " observed Miss Haviland to her companion , in a low tone ; " but he is no boor ; nor can every one boast of  --  " Here she threw a furtive glance at Peters , when she appeared to read something in his countenance which caused her to suspend the involuntary comparison which was evidently passing in her mind , and to keep her eye fixed on his motions . The arrogant personage last named , wholly unconscious of this scrutiny , now began to incite his horses afresh , frequently applying the lash with unwonted severity , and then suddenly curbing them in , till the spirited animals became so frantic that they could scarcely be restrained from dashing off at a run . The young farmer , in the mean while , finding himself closely pressed by those behind him , without any apparent disposition on their part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly out of the road , to give the others , with the same change in their course to the opposite side , an opportunity , if they chose , of going by , as might easily have been done with safety to all concerned . " Mr. Peters ! " suddenly exclaimed Miss Haviland , in a tone of energetic remonstrance , at the same time catching at his arm , as if to restrain him from some intended movement , which her watchful eye had detected . This appeal , however , which was rather acted than spoken , was unheeded , or came too late ; for , at that instant , the chafing and maddened horses dashed furiously forward , directly over the exposed corner of the young man 's vehicle , which , under the iron-bound feet of the fiercely-treading animals , and the heavy sleigh runners that followed , came down with a crash to the ground , leaving him barely time to clear himself from the wreck , by leaping forward into the snow . Startled by the noise behind him , the frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the still connected remains of the jumper , which were , at the instant , confined down by the passing runners of the large sleigh ; when , snorting and wild with desperation , he reared himself upright on his hinder legs , and fell over backwards , striking , with nearly the whole weight of his body , upon his doubled neck , which all saw at a glance was broken by the fall . With eyes flashing with indignation , young Woodburn bounded forward to the head of the aggressing team , boldly seized the nearest horse by his nostrils and bridle curb , and , in spite of his desperate rearing and plunging , under the rapidly applied whip of the enraged driver , soon succeeded , by daring and powerful efforts , in bringing him and his mate to a stand . " Let go there , fellow , on your peril ! " shouted Peters , choking with rage at his defeat in attempting to ride over and escape his bold antagonist . " Not till I know what all this means , sir ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us if you dare , you young ruffian ! " exclaimed the sheriff , protruding his harsh visage from one side of the sleigh . " Begone ! or I will arrest you in the king 's name , sir ! " " You will show your warrant for it first , Mr. Sheriff , " replied the former , turning to Patterson with cool disdain . " I have nothing to do with you , sir ; but I hold this horse till the outrage I have just received is atoned for , or at least explained . " " My good friend , " interposed Jones , in a respectful manner , " you must not suppose we have designedly caused your disaster . Our horses , which are high-mettled , as you see , took a sudden start , and the mischief was done before they could be turned or checked . " " Now , let go that horse , will you , scoundrel ? " again exclaimed Peters , still chafing with anger , but evidently disturbed and uneasy under the cold , searching looks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " replied Woodburn , with the same determined manner as before . " I care not for your abusive epithets , and have only to say of them , that they are worthy of the source from which they proceed . But you have knowingly and wickedly defrauded me of my farm ; unless I obtain redress , as I little expect , from a court which seems so easily to see merits in a rich man 's claim . Yes , you have defrauded me , sir , out of my hard-earned farm ; and there , " he continued , pointing to his gasping horse ,  --  " there lies nearly half of all my remaining property  --  dead and gone ! ay , and by your act , which , from signs I had previously noticed , and from the tones of that young lady 's exclamation at the instant , ( and God bless her for a heart which could be kind in such company , ) I shall always believe was wilfully committed . And if I can make good my suspicions , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have it elsewhere ! There , sir , go , " he added , relinquishing his hold on the horse , and stepping aside ,  --  " go ! but remember I claim a future reckoning at your hands ! " The sleigh now passed on to the yard of the inn , where the company alighted , and soon disappeared within its doors , leaving the young man standing alone in the road , gazing after them with that moody and disquieted kind of countenance which usually settles on the face on the subsidence of a strong gust of passion . " Poor pony ! " he at length muttered , sadly , as , rousing himself , he now turned towards his petted beast , that lay dead in his rude harness ,  --  " poor pony ! But there is no help for you now , nor for me either , I fear , as illy as I can afford to lose you . But it is not so much the loss , as the manner  --  the manner ! " he repeated , bitterly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the view of removing the carcass and the broken sleigh from the road . While he was thus engaged , a number of men , most of them his townsmen , who being , like himself , on their way to court , had stopped at the inn , or store , near by , where the noise of the fray had aroused them , now came hastening to the spot . " What is all this , Harry ? " exclaimed the foremost , as he came up and threw a glance of surprise and concern on the ruins before him . " You can see for yourselves , " was his moody reply , as others now arrived , and , with inquiring looks , gathered around him . " Yes , yes ; but how was it done ? " " John Peters , who just drove up to the tavern , yonder , with a load of court gentry , run over me  --  that 's all , " he answered , with an air that showed his feelings to be still too much irritated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be a favorite , were not to be repulsed by a humor for which they appeared to understand how to make allowance , but continued to press him with inquiries and soothing words , till their manifestations of sympathy and offers of assistance had gradually won him into a more cheerful mood ; when , throwing off his reserve , he thanked them kindly , and frankly related what he knew of the affair , the particulars of which obviously produced a deep sensation among the listeners . All present , after hearing the recital of the facts , and on coupling them with the well-known disposition of Peters , and his previous injuries to Woodburn , at once declared their belief that the aggression was intentional , and warmly espoused the cause of their outraged friend and townsman . A sort of council of war was then holden ; the affair was discussed and set down as another item in the catalogue of injuries and oppressions of which the court party had been guilty . Individuals were despatched into all the nearest houses , and elsewhere , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining a prosecution . It was soon ascertained , however , that no one had seen the fracas , except the parties in interest ,  --  all Peters 's company being so accounted ,  --  and that , consequently , no hope remained of any legal redress . On this , some proposed measures of club-law retaliation , some recommended reprisals on the same principle , and others to force Peters , as soon as he should appear in the street , to make restitution for the loss he had occasioned . And so great was the excitement , that had the latter then made his appearance ,  --  which , it seemed , he was careful not to do ,  --  it is difficult to say what might have been his reception . But contrary to the expectations of all , Woodburn , who had been thoughtfully pacing up and down the road , a little aloof from the rest , during the discussion , now came forward , and , in a firm and manly manner , opposed all the propositions which had been made in his behalf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " such measures will not bear thinking of . I threatened him myself with something of the kind you have proposed . But a little reflection has convinced me I was wrong ; for should I take this method of obtaining redress , however richly he might deserve it at my hands , I should but be doing just what I condemn in him , and thus place myself on a level with him in his despicable conduct . No , we will let him alone , and give him all the rope he will take ; and if he do n't hang for his misdeeds , he will doubtless , by his conduct , aid in hastening on the time , which , from signs not to be mistaken , can not , I think , be far distant , when a general outbreak will place him , and all like him , who have been riding over us here rough-shod for years , in a spot where he and they will need as much of our pity as they now have of our hatred and fear . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods and looks ; " that time will come , and sooner than they dream of . " " And then , " said one , " it will not be with us as it was with me last fall ; when , just as winter was coming on , and milk was half our dependence for the children , our only cow was knocked off by a winking sheriff , for eleven and threepence , to this same Peters . " " Nor as it was with me , " said another poorly-clad man of the crowd , " when for a debt , which , before it was sued , was only the price of a bushel of wheat I bought to keep wife and little ones from starving , my pair of two-year-olds and seven sheep were all seized and sold under the hammer , for just enough to pay the debt and costs , to Squire Gale , the clerk of the court , who is another of those conniving big bugs , who are seen going round with the sheriff , at such times , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's property for a song , though never a dollar will they lend him to redeem it with . " " No , my friends , " said a tall , stout , broad-chested man , with a clear , frank , and fearless countenance , who , having arrived at the spot as Woodburn began to speak , had been standing outside of the crowd , silently listening to the remarks of the different speakers ,  --  " no , my friends ; when the time just predicted arrives , it will no longer be as it has been with any of us . We shall then , I trust , all be allowed to exercise the right which , according to my notions , we have from God  --  that of choosing our own rulers , who , then , would be men from among ourselves , knowing something about the wants and wishes of the people , and willing to provide for their distresses in times like these . I have little to say about individual men , or their acts of oppression ; for such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as this accursed system of foreign rule is suffered to remain . We had better , therefore , not waste much of our ammunition on this or that tool of royalty , but save it for higher purposes . And , for this reason , I highly approve of the course that my young neighbor , Woodburn , has just taken , in his case ; although , from what I have heard , I suspect it was an outrageous one . " " Thank you , thank you , Colonel Carpenter , " said Woodburn , coming forward and cordially offering the other his hand ; " the approbation of a man like you more than reconciles me to the course which , I confess , cost me a hard struggle to adopt . " " Ay , you were right , Harry , " rejoined the former , " though a hard matter to bear ; and though I am willing this , and all such outrages , should go in to swell the cup of our grievances , that it may the sooner overflow , yet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man . But let me suggest , whether you , and all present , had not better now disperse . The powers that be will soon have their eyes upon us , and I would rather not excite their jealousy , at this time , on account of certain measures we have in contemplation , which I will explain to you hereafter . " " Your advice is good , " returned Woodburn , " and I will see that it is followed , as soon as I can find some one to dispose of the body of my luckless pony ; for then I propose to throw the harness into some sleigh , and join such of the company here as are on foot on their way to court . " " Put your harness aboard my double sleigh standing in the tavern yard yonder , Harry . And I am sorry I have too much of a load to ask you to ride yourself . But where shall I leave the harness ? " " At Greenleaf 's store , at the river , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the rest of us . " " I am , and shall soon be along after you , as I wish to go through to-night , if possible , being suspicious of a flood , that may prevent me from getting there with a team , by to-morrow . Neither the rain nor thaw is over yet , if I can read prognostics . How strong and hot this south wind blows ! And just cast your eye over on to West River mountain , yonder  --  how rapidly those long , ragged masses of fog are creeping up its sides towards the summit ! That sign is never failing . " Woodburn 's brief arrangements were soon completed ; when he and his newly-encountered foot companions , each provided with a pair of rackets , or snow-shoes ,  --  articles with which foottravellers , when the snow was deep , often , in those times , went furnished ,  --  took up their line of march down the road leading to the Connecticut , leaving Peters and his company , as well as all others who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn . But , before we close this chapter , in order that the reader not versed in the antiquarian lore of those times may more clearly understand some of the allusions of the preceding pages , and also that he may not question the probability that such a company as we have introduced should be thus brought together , and be thus on their way to a court so far into the interior of a new settlement , it may not be amiss here to observe , that the sale and purchase of lands in Vermont at this period constituted one of the principal matters of speculation among men of property , not only those residing here , but those residing in the neighboring colonies , and especially in that of New York ; and that the frequent controversies , arising out of disputed titles , made up the chief business of the court , which , on the erection of a new county by the legislature of New York , embracing all the south-eastern part of the Grants , and known by the name of Cumberland , had here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was business of this kind , and the personal , in addition to the political , interest they had in sustaining a court , the judges of which were themselves said to be engaged in these speculations , and therefore expected to favor , as far as might be decent , their brother speculators , that led to the journey of the present company of loyalists , consisting , as before seen , of Haviland , a large landholder of Bennington ; Peters , an unconscientious speculator in the same kind of property , belonging to a noted family of tories of that name , residing in Pownal , and an adjoining town in New York ; and Jones , the agent of Fanning , from the vicinity of Fort Edward ; the fated Miss McRea , of sad historical memory , from the same place , having been induced to come on with her lover , at the previous solicitation of her friend , Miss Haviland , to join her , her father , and Peters , to whom she was affianced , in their proposed excursion over the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tryon , New York , before the revolution , obtained , by an act of favoritism from his master , a grant of the township of Stratton , which , in 1780 , Fanning having been appointed a colonel of a regiment of tories , was confiscated , and re-granted , by the legislature of Vermont , to William Williams and others . Kent , afterwards Londonderry , which had been granted to James Rogers , who has been introduced , and who became a tory officer , was also , in like manner , confiscated and re-granted . CHAPTER II . " Now forced aloft , bright bounding through the air , Moves the blear ice , and sheds a dazzling glare ; The torn foundations on the surface ride , And wrecks of winter load the downward tide . " After travelling a short distance in the road , Woodburn and his companions halted , put on their snow-shoes , and , turning out to the left into the woods , commenced , with the long , loping step peculiar to the racket-shod woodsman , their march over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which formed the usual route from the village they had quitted to their place of destination , led first directly to the Connecticut , in an easterly direction , and then , turning to the north , passed up the river near its western banks , thus describing in its course a right angle , at the point of which , resting on the river , stood the store of Stephen Greenleaf , the first , and , for a while , the only merchant in Vermont ; whose buildings , with those perhaps of one or two dependants , constituted the then unpromising nucleus around which has since grown up the wealthy and populous village of East Brattleborough . Such being the course of the travelled route , it will readily be seen , that the main object of our foot company , in leaving it , was the saving of distance , to be effected by striking across this angle to some eligible point on the northern road . And they accordingly pitched their course so as to enter the road near its intersection with the Wantastiquet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Connecticut ,  --  which here comes rolling down from the eastern side of the Green Mountains , and pours its rock-lashed and rapid waters into the comparatively quiet bosom of the ingulfing stream below . After a walk of about half an hour , through alternating fields and forest , they arrived , as they had calculated , at the banks of the tributary above named , where it was crossed on the ice by the winter road , which , owing to the failure of the rude bridge near the mouth of the stream , and the difficulty of descending the bank in its immediate vicinity , had been broken out through the adjoining meadow and over the river at this point , which was consequently a considerable distance above the ordinary place of crossing . On reaching this spot , it was found that the flood , which , on the high grounds , where we have last been taking the reader , was but little observable , had made , and was evidently still making , a most rapid progress . The rising waters had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strong , imprisoning barriers , and were beginning to hurry along , in two dark , turbid streams , over the surface of the ice , beneath the opposite banks , where it was still too strongly confined to the roots and frozen earth to permit of its rising ; while the uplifting mass , in the middle of the river , had nearly attained the level of the surrounding meadows . And , although the main body still remained unbroken , yet the deep , dull reports that rose in quick succession to the ear from the cracking mass in every direction around , and the sharp , hissing , gurgling sounds of the water , which was gushing violently upwards through the fast multiplying fissures , together with the visible , tremor-like agitation that pervaded the whole , plainly evinced that it could not long withstand the tremendous pressure of the laboring column of waters beneath . The travellers , who were not to be turned back by a foot or two of water in their path over the ice , so long as the foundation remained firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , and , shooting it forward through the first stream of water , passed over upon it to the uncovered ice ; and then , drawing their spar-bridge to the water next the other bank , went through the same process , till they had all reached the opposite shore unwet and in safety . Here they again paused to note the appearance of the disturbed elements ; for , in addition to the threatening aspect which the river was here fast assuming , a slight trembling of the ground began occasionally to be perceptible ; while unusual sounds seemed to come mingling from a distance , with the roaring of the wind and the noise of rushing waters , as if earth , air , and water were all joining their disturbed forces for some general commotion . " The water and ice are strangely agitated , it appears to me , " observed Woodburn to his companions , as they stood looking on the scene before them . " See how like a pot the water boils up through that crevice yonder ! Then hear that swift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , seems fairly to groan , like some huge animal confined down by an insupportable burden , from which it is laboring to free itself . I have noticed such appearances , I think , when the ice was on the point of breaking up ; but that can hardly be the case here , at present , can it ? " " On the point of breaking up , now ? " said one of the company , in reply . " No , indeed ! Why , the ice is more than three feet thick , and as sound and solid as a rock . Should it rain from this time till to-morrow noon , it wo n't start . " " Well , now , I do n't know about that , " remarked an observant old settler , who had been silently regarding the different portents to which we have alluded . " I do n't know about the ice staying here twenty hours , or even one . This has been no common thaw , that we have had for the last six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still , " observed Woodburn , " I should not think the water high enough as yet to cause a breaking up , should you ? " " With a slow rise , and in a still time , perhaps not , Harry . But when the water is rising rapidly , as now , and especially if there is a strong wind , like this , to increase the motion , as it does either by outward pressure , or by forcing the air through the chinks in under the ice , I have always noticed that the stream acts on the ice at a much less height , and much more powerfully , than when the rise is slow and the weather calm . " " Then you look upon the appearances I named as indications that such an event is soon to take place here , do you ? " " I do , Harry , much sooner than you are expecting ; for the signs you name are not the only ones which tell that story , as I will soon convince you all , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This remark caused the company to pause and place themselves in a listening attitude . " There , " resumed the speaker , pointing up to the bold , shaggy steeps of the mountain , which we have before alluded to , and which , from the opposite side of the Connecticut , and within a few furlongs from the spot where they now stood , rose , half con cealed in its " misty shroud , " like some huge battlement , to the heavens  --  " there ! do you hear that dull roar , with occasionally a crashing sound , away up there among those clouds of fog near the top peaks of the mountain ? " " Ay , ay , quite distinctly . " " Well , that is an echo , which , strangely enough , we can hear when we ca n't the original sound , and which is made by the striking up there of the roar of the river above us ; that of course must be open , having already broken up and got the ice in motion somewhere . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbling noise ? Ca n't you , now , both hear and feel those quick , irregular , deep , jarring sounds ? " " Yes , plainly  --  very plainly , now  --  you are right . Sure enough , the ice in the river above us is on the move ! " responded all , with excited looks . " To be sure it is ; and from the noise it makes , it must be coming down upon us with the speed of a race-horse ! Let us all to the hills , boys , where we can get a fair view of the spectacle . " The company , accordingly , now all ran to gain the top of a neighboring swell , which commanded a view of West River for a long distance up the stream , as well as one of a considerable reach of the more distant Connecticut , both of which views were obstructed , at the spot they had just left , by a point of woods and turn in the river in the former instance , and by intervening hills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , peculiar to the mountainous regions of our northern clime , there is no one , perhaps , of more fearful magnificence , than that which is sometimes presented in the breaking up of one of our large rivers by a winter flood ; when the ice , in its full strength , enormous thickness , and rock-like solidity , is rent asunder , with loud , crashing explosions , and hurled up into ragged mountains , and borne onward before the raging torrent with inconceivable force and frightful velocity , spreading devastation along the banks in its course , and sweeping away the strongest fabrics of human power which stand opposed to its progress , like the feeble weeds that disappear from the path of a tornado . Such a spectacle , as they reached their proposed stand , now burst on the view of the astonished travellers . As far as the eye could reach upwards along the windings of the stream , the whole channel was filled with the mighty mass of ice , driving down towards them with fearful rapidity , and tumbling , crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , with collisions that shook the surrounding forest , and with the din and tumult of an army of chariots rushing together in battle . Here , tall trees on the bank were beaten down and overwhelmed , or , wrenched off at the roots and thrown upwards , were whirled along on the top of the rushing volume , like feathers on the tossing wave . There , the changing mass was seen swelling up into mountain-like elevations , to roll onward a while , and , then gradually sinking away , be succeeded by another in another form ; while , with resistless front , the whole immense moving body drove steadily on , ploughing and rending its way into the unbroken sheet of ice before it , which burst , divided , and was borne down beneath the boiling flood , or hurled upwards into the air , with a noise sometimes resembling the sounds of exploding muskets , and sometimes the crash of falling towers . But the noise of another and similar commotion , in an opposite direction , now attracted their attention . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , though less startling from its distance , yet even surpassed , in picturesque grandeur , the one they had just been witnessing . Through the whole visible reach of the Connecticut , a long , white , glittering column of ice , with its ridgy and bristling top towering high above the adjacent banks , was sweeping by and onward , like the serried lines of an army advancing to the charge ; while the broad valley around , even back to the summits of the far-off hills , was resounding with the deafening din that rose from the extended line of the booming avalanche , with the deep rumblings of an earthquake mingled with the tumultuous roar of an approaching tempest . The attention of the company , however , was now drawn from this magnificent display of the power of the elements , by an object of more immediate interest to their feelings . This was an open double sleigh , approaching , on the opposite side of the river , towards the place at which they had just crossed over , in the manner we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still forcing its way down the river before them , with increasing impetus , was now within three hundred yards of the pass , to which those in the sleigh were hastening , with the evident design of crossing . And though the latter , owing to a point of woods that intervened at a bend in the stream a short distance above , could not see the coming ice , yet they seemed aware of its dangerous proximity ; for , as they now drove down to the edge of the water , they paused , and a large man , who appeared to have control of the team , rose to his feet , and with words that could not be distinguished in the roaring of the wind and the noise from the scene above , made an appealing gesture , which was readily understood by our foot travellers as an inquiry whether the team would have time to cross before the ice reached the spot . " It is Colonel Carpenter and his company , " said Woodburn . " He will have no time to spare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to get safely over . He has smart horses , and is anxious to be on this side of the river . Let him come . " Accordingly , they returned him encouraging gestures , which being seen and understood by him , he instantly whipped up his horses , and , forcing them on to the ice , soon effected his passage in safety , and drove rapidly down the road , leading along the northern bank of the stream to the Connecticut , the object of his speed being obviously to keep forward of the icy flood , by which his progress might otherwise be soon obstructed . " There , " resumed Woodburn , breaking the silence with which he and his companions had been witnessing the rather hazardous passage of their friends ,  --  " there , the colonel is well over ; but his is the last sleigh to cross this year , unless it be drawn by winged horses . " " Well , winged , or not winged , there is another , it seems , about to make the attempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , where a covered double sleigh , with showy equipage , was dashing at full speed down the road towards the stream . " It is a hostile craft ! " " Peters and his gang ! " " We owe them no favors ! " " Let the enemy take care of themselves ! " were the exclamations which burst from the recently-incensed group , as all eyes were now turned to the spot . " O , no ! no ! " exclaimed Woodburn , with looks of the most lively concern . " Be they foes or friends , they must not be suffered to enter upon that river . Why , the breaking ice has already nearly reached the bend , and unless it stops there , that path across the stream , within five minutes , will be as traceless as the ocean ! Run down to the bank , and hail them ! " he continued , turning to those around him . " I fear they would not listen to me . Will no one go to warn them against an attempt which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing around him . " Shall we interfere unasked ? " said one , who was smarting under a sense of former injuries ; " ay , and interfere , too , to save such a man as Peters , that he may go on robbing us of our farms ? " " And save such a man as Sheriff Patterson , also , that he may hang the innocent and pious Herriot ? " said another , bitterly . " And save them all , that they may keep up the court which will soon hang or rob the whole of us ? " added a third , in the same spirit . " O , wrong  --  wickedly wrong ! and , if no one will go , I must , " cried Woodburn , turning hastily from the spot , and making his way down the hill towards the river with all the speed he was master of . A few seconds sufficed to bring him to the edge of the stream ; when , in a voice that rose above the roar of the wind and waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging his reluctant and snorting horses down the opposite bank into the water , warned him of the situation of the ice , and begged him , as he valued the lives of his friends , to desist from his perilous attempt . " Do you think to frighten me ? " shouted Peters , who , perceiving the speaker to be his despised opponent , became suspicious , as the latter had feared , that the warning was but a ruse to prevent him from going on that night ,  --  " do you think to frighten me back , liar , when a heavy team has just passed safely over before my eyes ? " And , in defiance of the timely caution he had received , and the warning sounds , of which his senses might have apprised him , had he paused a moment to listen , he furiously applied the whip , and plunged madly through the water towards the middle ice . But as rapidly as he drove , the team had not passed over more than one third of the distance across , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful peril they had so recklessly incurred ; for , at this critical moment , with awful brunt , the mountain wave of icy ruins came rolling round the screening point into full view , and not fifty yards above them . A cry of alarm at once burst from every occupant of the menaced vehicle ; and Peters , no less frightened than the rest , suddenly checked the horses , with the half-formed design of turning and attempting to regain the shore he had just left . But on glancing round , he beheld , to his dismay , the ice burst upward from its winter moorings along the shore , leaving between them and the bank a dark chasm of whirling waters , over which it were madness to think of repassing . At that instant , with a deep and startling report , the broad sheet of ice confining the agitated river burst asunder , parted , and was afloat in a hundred pieces around them . Another piercing cry of terror and distress issued from the devoted sleigh ; and Miss Haviland , with an involuntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large cake of ice on which the sleigh and horses were resting . She seemed instantly to perceive her error ; but before she could regain the sleigh , or even be caught by the extended hands of her friends , the frightened horses made a sudden and desperate lunge forward , and , with a speed that could neither be checked nor controlled , dashed onward over the dissevering mass , leaping from piece to piece of their sinking support , and each in turn falling in , to be drawn out by his mate , till they reached the shore , and rushed furiously up the bank , beyond the sweep of the dreadful torrent from which they had so miraculously escaped . " O God of heaven , have mercy on my daughter ! " exclaimed Haviland , in a piteous burst of anguish , as he sprang out of the sleigh among the company , who , with horror-stricken looks , stood on the bank mutely gazing on the fast receding form of the luckless maiden , thus left behind , to be borne away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment no one stirred or spoke , all standing amazed , and seemingly paralyzed at the thought of her awful situation , having no hope of her rescue , and expecting every instant to see her crushed , or ingulfed among the ice that was wildly heaving and tumbling on every side around her . But fortunately for her , the broad , solid block , on which she had alighted , and on which she continued still to retain her stand , was , by the submerged and rising masses beneath , gradually and evenly forced upwards to the top of the column , with which it was moving swiftly down the current . And there she stood , like a marble statue on its pedestal , sculptured for some image of woe , her bonnet thrown back from her blanched features , and her loosened hair streaming wildly in the wind ; while one hand was extended doubtfully towards the shore , and the other lifted imploringly to heaven , as if in supplication for that aid from above , which she now scarcely hoped to receive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must you indeed perish ? " at length burst convulsively from Miss McRea , in the most touching accents of distress . " Is there no help ? Can no one save her ? " added the agonized father . " Yes , save her  --  save her ! " exclaimed Peters , now eagerly addressing the men he affected so to despise . " Ca n't some of you get on to the ice there , and bring her off ? Five guineas to the man who will do it ; yes , ten ! Quick ! run , run , or you 'll be too late , " he added , turning , from one to another , without offering to start himself . Throwing a look of silent scorn on his contemptible foe , Woodburn , having been anxiously casting about him in thought for some means of rescuing the ill-fated girl from her impending doom , now , with the air of one acting only on his own responsibility , hastily called on his companions to follow him , and led the way , with rapid strides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the main channel as the water and ice , already bursting over the banks into the road , would permit . But although he could easily keep abreast of the fair object of his anxiety , of whom he occasionally obtained such glimpses through the brushwood here lining the banks as to show him that she still retained her footing on the same block of ice , which still continued to be borne on with the surrounding mass , yet he could perceive no way of reaching her  --  no earthly means by which she could be snatched from the terrible doom that seemed so certainly to await her ; for along the whole extent of the moving ice , and even many rods in advance of it , the water , dammed up , and forced from the choked channel , was gushing over the banks , and sweeping down by their sides in a stream that nothing could withstand . And , to add to the almost utter hopelessness with which he was compelled to view her situation , he now soon began to be admonished that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far been so providentially preserved  --  that of being crushed or swallowed up at once in the broken ice . He could perceive , from the increasing commotion of the ice around her , that her hitherto level and unbroken support was growing every moment more insecure and uncertain . And as it rose and fell , or was pitched forward and thrown up aslant , in the changing volume , he could plainly hear her piteous shrieks , and see her flying from side to side of the plunging body , to avoid being hurled into the frightful chasms which were continually yawning to receive her . " Lost ! lost ! " he uttered with a sigh ; " no earthly aid can now avail her . But stay ! stay ! " he continued , as his eye fell on the two or three remaining beams or string-pieces of the old bridge still extended across the river a short distance below . " If she reaches that place alive , and I can but gain the spot in time , I may yet save her . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rescuing her from this dreadful death ! " And calling loudly to his companions , whom he had already outstripped , to come on , he now set forward , with all possible speed , for the place which afforded the last chance for the poor girl 's rescue . The banks of the river , at the point which it was now his object to gain , were so much more elevated than those above , that he had little fear of finding the path leading on to the bridge obstructed by the water . And it had glanced through his mind , as he descried this forgotten spot , and saw the remains of the bridge still standing , that the maiden might here be assisted to escape on to the bank , or be drawn up by a cord , or some other implement , to the top of the bridge , which , being high above the ordinary level of the water , would not probably be swept away by the ice , at least not till that part of it on which she was situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log-house standing but a short distance from the place , and the owner , as Woodburn drew near , was , luckily , just making his appearance at the door . " A rope , a rope ! be ready with a rope , " shouted Woodburn , pointing to the scene of trouble , as soon as he could make himself understood by the wondering settler . The man , after a hurried glance from the speaker to the indicated scene , and thence to the bridge below , during which he seemed to comprehend the nature of the emergency , instantly disappeared within the door . In another moment Woodburn came up , and burst into the house , where he found the settler and his wife eagerly running out the rope of their bedstead , which had been hastily stripped of the bed and clothing , and the fastenings cut , for the purpose . The instant the rope was disengaged , it was seized by the young man , who , bidding the other to follow , rushed out of the house , and bounded forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken ice was here beginning to quake and move from the impulse of the vast body above , which , now scarcely fifty paces distant , was driving down , with deafening crash , towards them . " Thank Heaven , she yet lives , and is nearing us ! " exclaimed Woodburn , as he ran out on to the partially covered beams of the bridge , where he could obtain a clear view of the channel above . " She is there , hedged in , though as yet riding securely in the midst of that hideous jam , but , if not drawn up here , will be the next moment lost among the spreading mass , as it is disgorged into the Connecticut here below . " " Shall we throw down an end of the rope for her to catch ? " said the settler , hastening to Woodburn 's side . " I dare not risk her strength to hold on to it ; I must go down myself , " said Woodburn , hurriedly knotting the two ends of the cord round his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brace yourself back firmly on this string-piece ; let me down , and the instant I have secured her in my arms , draw us both up together . " " I can let you down ; but to draw you both up  --  " replied the other , hesitating at the thought of the hazardous attempt . " You must try it , " eagerly interrupted the intrepid young man . " My friends will be here in a moment to aid you . There she comes ! be ready ! Now ! " Accordingly , sliding over the edge of the bridge , Woodburn was gradually let down by the strong and steady hands of the settler , till he was swinging in the air , on a level with that part of the approaching mass on which stood the half-senseless object of his perilous adventure . The foremost of the broken ice was now sweeping swiftly by , just beneath his feet . Another moment , and she will be there ! She evidently sees the preparation for her deliverance ; a faint cry of joy escapes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid . And now , riding high on the billowy column , she is borne on nearer and nearer towards those who wait , in breathless silence , for her approach . And now she comes  --  she is there ! She is caught in the eager grasp of the brave youth ; and , the next instant , by the giant effort of the strong man above them , they are together drawn up within a few feet of the bending and tottering bridge . But with all his desperate exertions , he can raise them no higher ; and there they hang suspended over the dark abyss of whirling waters that had opened in the disrupturing mass beneath , at the instant , as if to receive them ; while a mountain billow of ice , that must overwhelm them with certain destruction , is rolling down , with angry roar , within a few rods of the spot . A groan of despair burst from the exhausted man at the rope ; and his grasp was about to give way . " Hold on there , an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right , where a tall , muscular form was seen bounding forward to the spot . " Quick , Colonel Carpenter ! quick ! O , for God 's sake , quick ! " exclaimed the settler , throwing an anguished and beseeching glance over his shoulder towards the other . The next instant , the powerful frame of the new-comer was bending over the grasped rope ; and , in another , both preservers and preserved were on the bridge , from which they had barely time to escape , before it was swept away , with a loud crash , and borne off on the top of the mighty torrent . They were met on the bank by the companions of Woodburn , and the friends of the rescued maiden , who came promiscuously running to the spot ; when loud and long were the gushing acclamations of joy and gratitude that rang wildly up to heaven at the unexpected deliverance . CHAPTER III . " The king can make a belted knight , Confer proud names , and a ' that ; But pith of sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " The village of Westminster yields , perhaps , in the tranquil and picturesque beauty of its location , to few others in New England . In addition to the advantage of a situation along the banks of that magnificent river , of which our earliest epic poet , Barlow , in his liquid numbers , has sung , " No watery glades through richer valleys shine , Nor drinks the sea a lovelier wave than thine , " it stands upon an elevated plain , that could scarcely have been made more level had it been smoothed and evened , by the instruments of art , to fit it for the arena of some vast amphitheatre , which the place , with the aid of a little fancy , may be very easily thought to resemble ; for , from the principal street , which is nearly a mile in extent , broad and beautiful fields sweep away in every direction , till they meet , in the distance , that crescent-like chain of hills , by which , with the river , the place is enclosed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with its proximity to the old fort at Walpole , at which a military establishment was once maintained by the government of New Hampshire for the protection of its frontier , that led to the early settlement and rapid growth of this charming spot , which , having been entered by the pioneers as far back as 1741 , continued so to increase and prosper , though on the edge of a wilderness unbroken , for many years , for hundreds of miles on the north , that , at the opening of the American revolution , it was the most populous and best built village in Vermont . This place , at the period chosen for the beginning of our tale , had been , for several years , the seat of justice for all the southern part of this disputed territory , under the assumed jurisdiction of New York , in which a majority of the inhabitants seemed to have tacitly acquiesced . And the most prominent of its public buildings , as might be expected , was the Court House , embracing the jail under the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located , and of very respectable architecture for the times . The village , also , contained a meeting-house , school-house , and the usual proportion of stores and taverns . The whole place , indeed , had now nearly passed into the second stage of existence , in American villages , when the pioneer log-houses have given place to the more airy and elegant framed buildings ; and , compared with other towns , which , in this new settlement , were then just emerging from the wilderness , it wore quite an ancient appearance . Among the most commodious and handsome of the many respectable dwellings which had here been erected , was that of Crean Brush , Esquire , colonial deputy secretary of New York , and also an active member of the legislature of that colony for this part of her claimed territory . This house , at the sessions of the courts , especially , was the fashionable place of resort for what was termed the court party gentry , and other distinguished persons from abroad . To the interior of this well-furnished and affectedly aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume the thread of our narrative . In an upper chamber of the house , at a late hour of the same evening on which occurred the exciting scenes described in the preceding pages , sat the two young ladies , to whom the reader has already been introduced , silently indulging in their different reveries before an open fire . They had safely arrived in town , about an hour before , with all their company , except Jones , who had been left at Brattleborough ; and having been consigned to the family of this mansion , with whom they had formed a previous acquaintance at Albany , where Brush , the greater part of the year , resided , and where both of the young ladies were educated , they had taken some refreshment , and retired to the apartment prepared for their reception . The demeanor of these fair companions , always widely different , was particularly so at the present moment . Miss Haviland , with her chin gracefully resting on one folded hand , and her calm and beautiful , but now deeply-clouded brow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was abstractedly gazing into the glowing coals on the hearth before her ; while the gentle , but less reflective McRea , with a countenance disturbed only by the passing emotions of sympathy that occasionally flitted over it , as she glanced at the downcast face of her friend , sat quietly preparing for bed , by removing her ornaments , and adjusting those long , golden tresses , with which , in after times , her memory was destined to become associated , in the minds of tearful thousands , while reading the melancholy history of her tragic fate . " Come , Sabrey , " at length said the latter , soothingly , " come , cheer up . I can not bear to see you so dejected . I would not brood over that frightful scene any longer , but , feeling grateful and happy at my escape , would dismiss it as soon as possible from my mind . " " I am , Jane , " responded the other , partially rousing herself from her reverie ; " I am both grateful and happy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that scene which disquiets me to-night . " " Indeed ! " replied the former , with a look of mingled surprise and curiosity . " Why , I have been attributing your dejection and absence of mind , this evening , to that cause alone . What else can have occurred to disturb your thoughts to-night , let me ask ? " " Jane , in confidence , I will tell you , " replied Miss Haviland , looking the other in the face , and speaking in a low , serious tone . " It is the discovery which I have made , or at least think I have , this day , made , respecting the true character of one who should command , in the relation I stand with him , my entire esteem . " " Mr. Peters ? Though of course it is he to whom you allude . But what new trait have you discovered in him , to-day , that leads you to distrust his character ? " " What I wish I had not ; what I still hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces itself upon my mind , in spite of all my endeavors to resist it . You recollect Mr. Jones 's account of the lawsuit , in which Mr. Peters succeeded in obtaining the farm of this Mr. Woodburn , whose gallant conduct we have all this afternoon witnessed ? " " Yes , certainly . " " Well , did you think that story , when rightly viewed , was very creditable to Mr. Peters ? " " I am not sure I understood the case sufficiently to judge ; did you ? " " Well enough , Jane , with the significant winks that passed between Peters and the sheriff , to convince me that an unjust advantage had been taken . But perhaps I could have been brought to believe myself mistaken in this conclusion , had I seen nothing else to confirm it , and lower him still more in my esteem . " " What else did you see ? " An exhibition of malice , Jane , which astonished as much as it pained me . That pretended accident , in running over Woodburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , Sabrey Haviland ! how can you talk , how can you believe , so about one whose betrothing ring is now on your finger ? " " It is indeed painful to do so ; but truth compels me . " " Might you not have been mistaken ? " " No ; I saw the whole movement . I had been watching him some time , and I noticed how he prepared those fiery horses of his for a sudden spring , and saw the look of malicious exultation accompanying the final act . And even now , I shudder to think what guilt he might have incurred ! Even as it resulted , only in the destruction of property , how can I help being shocked at the discovery of a secret disposition which could have prompted such a deed ? O , how different has been the conduct of him who has thus been made the victim of his misusage ! " " Different ! Why , what has he done ? I was not aware  --  " " True , I am reminded that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stopped to dine , told me , as we were coming away , that there had been a great excitement among the people in the street , about the outrage ; and that Peters would certainly have been mobbed , if Woodburn had not interfered and prevented it . " " Indeed ! I should have hardly expected so much magnanimity in one of his class . It was truly a noble return for the injuries he had received from Peters . " " Ay , and by this last act of saving my life , he has still more nobly revenged himself upon Peters , and upon us all . " " Assisted to save you , I conclude you mean ; for I heard Peters tell your father , that it was the settler who lived in the house near by , and Colonel Carpenter , who finally rescued you . " " Did he tell my father that story , without mentioning Woodburn ? " asked Miss Haviland , with a look of mingled surprise and displeasure . " Yes , as he came back to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sleigh to the spot . " " Well , my father shall know the truth of the case ; and Mr. Woodburn , though he did not boast of his services , nor even stay to give me an opportunity to thank him for what he had done , shall also know that we are not insensible to his gallant conduct ; for , whatever they may say , Jane , I am indebted to him for my life . As dreadful as was my situation among that crashing mass of ice , with which I was borne onward down the stream , I saw all that was done . He led the way from the first , contrived the plan , and with the assistance of the hesitating settler , carried it into execution , with a promptitude that alone could have saved me . It is true , that we both must have perished but for the timely arrival of Colonel Carpenter ; but that detracts nothing from the merits of Mr. Woodburn , who , as we hung suspended over that frightful abyss , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save mine . O , why could it not have been , as I have often said to myself during our cheerless ride this evening ,  --  why could it not have been Peters , to perform all that I have this day seen in that poor , despised , and persecuted young man ? " " Why , Mr. Peters certainly appeared much alarmed , and anxious that something should be done to save you , " replied Miss McRea , after a thoughtful pause , produced by the words and fervid manner of her companion . " Then why did he leave it to another to save me ? " responded the former , severely . " That I do not know , certainly , " replied the other ; " but he at once bestirred himself , and I heard him offer five guineas , and I think he doubled the price the next moment , to any one who would go on to the ice and bring you off . " " Five guineas ! " exclaimed Miss Haviland , starting to her feet , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guineas , and at a pinch , ten ! What a singular fountain must that be , from which such a thought , at such a time , could have flowed ! Had it been one of those favorite horses , it would have sounded well enough , perhaps , though I think he would have offered more . It is well , however , that I now know the price at which I am estimated , " she added , bitterly . " It does sound rather strangely , now you have named it , " responded Miss McRea , abashed at the unexpected construction put on what she had communicated , and mortified and half vexed , that every attempt she had made to remove her friend 's difficulties only made the matter worse : " it sounds oddly , to be sure ; but I presume he did not mean any thing . " " O , no , I dare say ; nor did he do any thing , as I can learn , through the whole affair , except attempt to deprive Woodburn of the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with softened tone , " what would you have thought , had you been in my situation , and your lover had acted such a part ? " " I should have thought  --  I do n't know what I should have thought , " replied the other , with a feeling which showed how quickly the appeal had taken effect . " But I should have had no occasion to have any thought about it ; for I know he would have been the one to save me , or die with me . O , I wish Mr. Jones had come on with us , for had he been there , so good and so brave as he is , I am sure even you need not have become so deeply indebted to this low young fellow . " " Low , Jane , low ? " said the former , reprovingly . " Was it low to overlook so easily the injury and affront he had received from Peters , and then return good for evil ? And was it low to rescue me from the raging flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done credit to the first hero in the land ? " " O , no , not that ; I did not mean that ; for his conduct has been generous and noble indeed ; and from the first , when I heard Mr. Jones 's account of him , I was disposed to think highly of the man , for one in his situation of life . I only meant that he did not belong to our party , but was one of the lower classes of society . " " It is true he may not belong to our party , Jane ; but how much should that weigh in the argument ? Perhaps at this very hour , two thirds of the American people would count it as weight in the other part of the balance . And even I , trained as I have been by and among the highest toned loyalists , wish I could help doubting that our party is the only one that has right and reason on its side . And as to the claim of belonging to what is called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , who are allowed that claim among us , were as worthy of the place as I think Woodburn is . I have always loved Justice for her beautiful self , and hated her opposite ; and I never could see how those who are guided by her and the kindred virtues , could be accounted low , or how , or why , those who lack these qualities could claim to be called high . Is it any wonder then , Jane , that I should feel troubled and distressed at discoveries which , in my mind , reverse the situation that my friends assign to the two individuals of whom we have been speaking ? " " O , you are too much of a philosopher for me in all that , " replied Jane . " Come , be a woman now , Sabrey , and I will discuss the matter with you , claiming , perhaps , a little , a very little of the right of the confessor . I can easily understand how painful it would be to have doubts of the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she continued , looking a little archly , " how one , who did not love a suitor very hard , could feel grateful  --  yes , very grateful  --  to a good-looking young man who had behaved gallantly . And I have a good mind to half suspect  --  " " Hark ! " interrupted the other , hurriedly , while a slight tinge became visible on her cheek  --  " hark ! did you hear the striking of the house clock below ? It is telling the hour of midnight . Let us dismiss these embarrassing thoughts , and retire to our repose . Your prospects , Jane , " she continued , rising and speaking in a sad and gently expostulatory tone  --  " your prospects are bright with love and happiness ; and it will be ungenerous and cruel in you to say aught which will deepen the shade that I fear is coming over mine . " " O , I will not , Sabrey , " warmly returned the kind-hearted Jane . " I did not intend it . Forgive me , do ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us pleasanter dreams , and then , as you say , go to rest and enjoy them . " Leaving these fair friends to their slumbers , disquieted or sweetened by the various visions which the incidents of the day had been calculated to excite in the bosom of each , we will now repair to a lower apartment of the house , to note the doings of a select band of court dignitaries there assembled , for a purpose concerning which a spectator , at the first glance , might , from the appearances , be at a loss to decide whether it was one of revelry or secret consultation , so much did it partake of the character of both . Around a long table , well furnished with wine and glasses , sat a select company of gentlemen , whose dress and deportment denoted them to be persons of the first consequence . And such , indeed , may be said to have been the fact , till the present time ; for the party embraced the judges and officers of the court , and such of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convened for a special consultation , which , it was considered , the portents of the times demanded . Here was the aristocratic and haughty Brush , the host , and leading spirit of the party , with his florid face , cracking his jokes and ridiculing " the boorish settlers , " in which he was sure to find a ready response in the boisterous laugh of Peters and other young supporters of the court and loyal party . Here , too , sat the fiery and profane Gale , the clerk of the court , with his thin , angular features , and forbidding brow , occasionally exploding with his short , bitter , barking laugh , as , with many an oath , he dealt out anticipated vengeance on all those who should dare cross the path of the established authorities . And here also was Chandler , the chief judge of the court , with his plausible manners , affectedly sincere look , and deferential smile , as he exchanged the whisper and meaning glance with his colleague , Judge Sabin , a stern , reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the remarks , whatever they might be , of those around him . These , with Stearns , a tory lawyer of some note , Rogers , a tory landholder , Haviland , and a few others , all leading and trusty supporters of the court party , constituted the company , or rather the cabinet council , here convened , all of whom , as appeared by the entire freedom of their remarks , were fully in each other 's confidence . There was one person in the room , however , who had no thought or feeling in common with the rest of those present , but who did not appear to be deemed by them of sufficient consequence to be interrogated in relation to his opinions , or of sufficient capacity to comprehend what was said in his presence , at least not to any degree which might render it unsafe that he should hear the discussion so unreservedly going forward . This person , who was acting in the capacity of waiter to the company , being under a temporary engagement to the master of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wanted about the house and stables , was a youth , of perhaps eighteen , of quite an ordinary , and even singular appearance . His figure was low and slight , and he was made to appear the more diminutive , perhaps , by his dress , which consisted of short trousers , a long , coarse jacket , and a flat woollen cap , drawn down to the eyebrows . His hair , hanging , in lank locks , to his shoulders , was light and sandy , and his face was deeply freckled ; while a pair of long , falling eyelashes contributed to add still further to the peculiarity of his looks , and to give his countenance , with those who did not note the keen , bright orbs that occasionally peeped from their usually impenetrable coverts , a sleepy and listless appearance . He now sat on the top of a high wood-box , placed near one corner of the chimney , with his legs dangling over one end of the box , and his head drooping sluggishly towards the fire , apparently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the little black dog that lay sleeping on the floor beneath his feet . " Here , Bart , " exclaimed Brush , as the company , having dropped the discussion of all weighty matters , were now briskly circulating the bottle , and beginning to give way to noisy merriment  --  " here , Bart , you sleepy devil , come and snuff these candles . Our chap here , " he continued , winking archly to those around him  --  " our chap Bart , or Barty Burt , to give the whole of his euphonious name , gentlemen , may be considered an excellent specimen of the rebel party , who talk so wisely about self-government , sitting under one 's own vine and fig-tree , and all that sort of thing ; for , in the first place , he has a great deal of wisdom , handy to be got at , it all lying in his face . And then he is so much for self-government that no one can govern him in any thing . Then again , as to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that Bart would most naturally entertain ; for had he a tree to sit under , be it fig or bass-wood , and enough to eat , he would sit there till he was gray , before he would think of moving . " " Not badly drawn , that similitude , " said Stearns , after the burst of laughter , by which these remarks were greeted , had a little subsided ; " but methinks I see a flaw therein , friend Brush : you said our young republican 's wisdom , alias ideas , all lay in his face ; and then , in the matter of the fig-tree , you go on to intimate he has one distinct idea in his head , thereby lessening the force and exactness of the comparison , as I think you will allow . " " I crave pardon , gentlemen , " cried the secretary ; " I should have qualified ; for , really , I have several times seriously suspected Bart to have ideas , or , at least , one whole idea of his own ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individuals of the party generally , with whom I have compared him , why , then I must knock under , that 's all . " " You are down ! you are down , then , Brush ! " shouted several , with another uproarious burst of laughter . Bart , the chief butt of this ridicule , in the mean while , was moving quietly about the room in performance of his bidden tasks , without appearing to notice a word that was uttered ; and but for a certain rapid twinkling that might have been seen in his eyes , which , as he deliberately returned to his seat in the corner , were opened to an unusual extent , one would have supposed him utterly insensible to all the taunts and jeering laughter of which he had thus publicly been made the victim . " Ah ! Patterson , here you are then , at last , " exclaimed Gale , as the former , with a disturbed and angry countenance , now came pushing his way into the midst of the company . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , scarcely ; at all events , we have concluded on nothing , except to wait and learn the result of your discoveries : so now for your report . " " Ay , ay , Mr. Sheriff , " responded Brush . " But stay , take breath , and a glass of this glorious old Madeira , first . There ! now tell us how the land lies abroad to-night . " " It lies but little to my liking , " growled the sheriff , with an oath . " The rascally dogs have altogether stolen the march of us . They have been swarming into town all the evening , as thick as bees ; while not more than a dozen of our flint-and-steel men have yet got on to the ground . It beats Belzebub !  --  " " Our witnesses , " quickly interposed Judge Chandler , bowing with a significant smile and cautionary wink , while he threw a sidelong glance towards Bart , whom the wary eye of the judge had detected in slightly changing his position , so as to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses and quarrelling suitors in court you mean , of course ? " " Why , yes  --  yes , your honor  --  if you think that necessary , " replied Patterson , following the direction of the other 's glance , and then looking inquiringly at Brush , as if to ask whether there was any danger to be apprehended from talking before the servant . " Pooh !  --  nonsense ! " said Brush , readily understanding the mute appeal . " Nonsense ! You could not make him comprehend what we are talking about in six weeks , if you should do your prettiest . Why , the fellow has not two ideas above a jackass !  --  so talk out . " " Well , then , " resumed the sheriff , in a lower tone , " I have satisfied myself that the rebels are plotting like so many Satans , and are in earnest about carrying their threat into execution . Now , the question is , what shall be done  --  yield the point and submit to be turned out of the Court House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , or what ? " " Yield ! " fiercely exclaimed Gale  --  " not till my pistol bullets have drank the heart 's blood of the d  --  d rascals , first . " " Ay , Gale , " responded Brush , " that would be well enough , but for one small difficulty , which is , that these demi-savages understand quite as much of that kind of play as we do ; and so long as they outnumber us so greatly , the fun of doing what you would propose might be less than talking about it . Let us have Chandler 's opinion . What course is it best to take , judge ? " " Temporize ! " replied the latter , in a low , emphatic tone , and with a look of peculiar significance  --  " temporize till  --  " " Till we can help ourselves , " said Patterson , taking up the sentence where the other left it , or rather finishing in words what had been expressed by looks . " That 's just my notion , " remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are for peace , and want nothing but what is right ; all of which may be said truly . And in this manner , if the thing is well managed , their suspicions can be allayed ; and we can get possession of the Court House as soon as our friends get on , which will be by to-morrow noon  --  will it not , Patterson ? " " Yes , unless this cussed flood has carried away all the roads , as well as bridges , " gruffly replied the sheriff . " Yes , and if these mobbing knaves can be kept quiet till then , we shall be in a situation to ask no favors . " " And grant none , " said Sabin , with cool bitterness . " You do n't learn , " asked Chandler , with feigned indifference  --  " you do n't learn that the people have brought any offensive implements with them , do you , Patterson ? It might be done covertly , you know . Has this been seen to , by proper measures ,  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the like ? " " Yes , thoroughly , " returned the former ; " they have brought no arms with them , at any rate . We are undoubtedly indebted to your honor 's skilful management with them at Chester for that . " " Ay , ay , " interposed Stearns , " nobody but the judge could have executed that piece of diplomacy with the fellows . And no one but he can carry out the business successfully now . His honor must be the one to undertake it . " " Certainly . " " The very man . " " He must do it . " " They would listen to none of us . " " The thing is settled , and he must go , " unanimously responded the company . " I really feel flattered , gentlemen , " replied Chandler , bowing and waving his hand towards the company  --  " highly flattered by your opinion of my capacity to negotiate in this delicate affair . But you will understand , in case I accede to your wishes , gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning  --  " you will understand that I am to be considered , on all hands , as utterly opposed to coercive measures  --  to all  --  I am understood , I suppose , gentlemen ? " " Yes , yes , judge , " returned the others , with knowing winks and laughter , " we will all understand that you are opposed to the whole move . " Having thus arranged business for the morrow to their satisfaction , these astute personages , who , like their party generally in America , at that period , seemed to have acted on an entirely false estimate of the intelligence and spirit of the common people , now rose and retired to their respective lodgings , inwardly chuckling at their sagacity , in being able to concoct what they believed would prove a successful scheme of overreaching and putting down their opponents , and , at the same time , of establishing their own tottering authority on a basis which might bid defiance to all future attempts to overturn it . CHAPTER IV . " But here , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As soon as the company , described in the preceding chapter , had all retired from the room , Brush , bidding Bart to rake up the fire and go to bed , proceeded to lock all the outer doors of the house , muttering to himself as he did so , " It ca n't be as Chandler fears , I think , about this fellow 's going out to blab to-night ; but as this will put an end to the possibillity of his doing it , I may as well make all fast , and then there will be no chance for blame for suffering him to remain in the room . " So saying , and putting the different keys in his pocket , he at once disappeared , on his way to his own apartment . When the sound of his retiring footsteps had ceased to be heard , Bart , who had lingered in the room , suddenly changed his sleepy , abject appearance for a prompt , decisive look and an erect attitude . " Two ideas above a jackass !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and slowly repeated , as with flashing eyes he nodded significantly in the direction his master had taken . " You may yet find out , Squire Brush , that my ears ai nt sich a disput sight longer than yourn , after all . " With this he blew out the last remaining light , and groped his way to his own humble sleeping-room , in the low attic story of the back kitchen . Here , however , he manifested no disposition to go to bed , but sitting down upon the side of his miserable pallet , he remained motionless and silent for fifteen or twenty minutes , when he began to soliloquize : " Jackass !  --  sleepy devil !  --  not wit enough to see what they are at in six weeks , eh ? Barty Burt , you are one of small fishes , it is true ; but , for all that , you need n't be walloped about at this rate , and bamboozled , and swallowed entirely up by the big ones of this court-and-king party . You know enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , you can be doing something towards paying these gentry for the beautiful compliments you have had from them to-night , and at other times . The fact is , Bart , you are a rebel now  --  honestly one of them  --  you feel it in you , and you may as well let it out . So here goes for their meeting , if it is to be found , if I am hanged for it . " Having , in this whimsical manner , made a sort of manifesto of his principles and intentions , as if to give them , with himself , a more fixed and definite character , he now rose , buttoned up his jacket , carefully raised the window of his room , let himself down to the roof of a shed beneath it , and from that descended to the ground , with the easy and rapid motions of a squirrel engaged in nut-gathering . Here he cast a furtive glance around him , and paused some moments , in apparent hesitation , respecting the course to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon , however , appearing to come to a determination , he struck out into the main street , and , with a quick step , proceeded on , perhaps a furlong , when he suddenly stopped short , and exclaimed , " Hold up , Bart . What did that sly judge say about searching in folks ' sleighs , for  --  what was that word now ?  --  But never mind , it meant guns . And what did the sheriff say about a dozen flint-and-steel men having come ? Put that and that together now , Bart , and see if it do n't mean that the only guns brought into town to-night are packed away in the straw , in the bottom of the sleighs of the court party understrappers ? Let 's go and mouse round their stopping-place a little , Bart . Perhaps you 'll get more news to carry to the rebels , " he added , turning round and making towards the tavern at which those in the interests of the loyalists were known generally to put up . On reaching the tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded directly to the barn shed , and commenced a search , which was soon rewarded by finding , in the different sleighs about the place , twelve muskets , carefully concealed in hay or blankets . With a low chuckle of delight at his discovery , Bart took as many as he could conveniently carry at one load , and , going with them into the barn , thrust them one by one into the hay mow , under the girts and beams , so as effectually to conceal them . He then returned for others , and continued his employment till the whole were thus disposed of ; when he left the place , and resumed his walk to the northerly end of the village . After pursuing his way through the street , and some distance down the road beyond the village , he paused against a low , long log-house , standing endwise to the road . This house was occupied by a middle-aged , single man , known by the name of Tom Dunning , though often called Ditter Dunning , and sometimes Der Ditter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefixes to his words and sentences , arising from a natural impediment of speech . He was a hunter by profession , and passed most of his time in the woods , or round the Connecticut in catching salmon , which , at that period , were found in the river in considerable numbers , as far up as Bellows Falls . Though he mingled but little in society , yet he was known to be well informed respecting all the public movements of the times ; and it was also believed that he had enrolled himself among the far-famed band of Green Mountain Boys , and often joined them in their operations against the Yorkers , on the other side of the mountains . Very little , however , was known about the man , except that he was a shrewd , resolute fellow , extremely eccentric , and perfectly impenetrable to all but the few in whom he confided . Bart , from some remark he had overheard in the street , in the early part of the evening , had been led to conclude that the company he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was personally unacquainted with the owner , and knew nothing of his principles , yet he was resolved to enter and trust to luck to make his introduction , if the company were present , and , if not , to rely on his own wit to discover whether it were safe to unfold his errand . As he was approaching the house , Dunning hastily emerged from the door , and , advancing with a quick step , confronted him in the path with an air which seemed to imply an expectation that his business would be at once announced . Bart , who was not to be discomposed by any thing of this kind , manifested no hurry to name his errand , and seemed to prefer that the other should be the first to break the silence . " Ditter  --  seems to me I have seen you somewhere ? " at length said Dunning , inquiringly . " Very likely . I have often been there , " replied Bart , with the utmost gravity . " Ditter  --  devil you have ! And what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foxy young friend ? " " Nothing that I was looking for . " " Der  --  what was that ? " " The meeting . " " Der  --  what meeting ? " " The one I 'd like to go to , may be . " " You are a bright pup ; but  --  der  --  do n't spit this way ; it might be der  --  ditter  --  dangerous business to me ; for you must have been eating razors to-night . " " No , I have n't ; do n't love ' em . But you have n't yet told me where the meeting is ? " " Ditter  --  look here , my little chap , " said Dunning , getting impatient and vexed that he could not decide whether the other was a knave , simpleton , or neither  --  " ditter  --  look here ;  --  der  --  do n't your folks want you ? Had n't you better run along now ? " " Reckon I shall , when you tell me where to go and not run against snags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come , about ditter as far again as half way ; der then , ditter turn to the ditter right , then to the ditter left , then der  --  ditter  --  ditter  --  ditter  --  go along ! you 'll get there before I can tell you . " " In no sort of hurry ; will wait till you get your mouth off ; may be it will shoot near the mark , after all . " " Ditter , dog , my cat , if I  --  der  --  do n't begin to believe you are considerable of a critter ; and I 've half a mind to risk you a piece ; so come into the house , and , der  --  let me take a squint at your phiz in the light . " Taking no exceptions to the character of the invitation , Bart now followed the other into the house , and , sitting down on a bench by the fire , began very unconcernedly to whistle , on a low key , the tune of Yankee Doodle , which was then just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mean time , taking a seat in the opposite corner , commenced his proposed scrutiny , which he continued , with one eye partly closed , and with a certain dubious expression of countenance , for some moments , when he observed , " You are a ditter queer chicken , that 's a fact . But I der find , now that I know you , as the ditter divil did his pigs , by sight ; I know also the sort of folks you have been living amongst lately ; and der knowing all that , it 's reasonable that I should be a snuffing a little for the ditter smell of brimstone . So now , if you are a court party tory , and come here for mischief , you 've got into a place that will ditter prove too hot for you ; but if , as I rather think , you are , or der want to be , something better , and can let us into the shape and fix of matters and things over there at ditter head-quarters , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak out therefore , like a man , and no more of your ditter squizzling . " After a few more evasive remarks , in which he succeeded in drawing out the other more fully , and causing him the more completely to commit himself , Bart threw aside all bantering , and proceeded to relate all his discoveries relative to the contemplated movement of the court party . " Ditter devils and dumplings ! " exclaimed the hunter , as , with eyes sparkling with excitement , he sprang to his feet , as the other finished his recital . " This must be made known directly . Come  --  der follow me , and I 'll take you to the company you ditter said you wished to see . " So saying , he immediately led the way through a dark entry to a room in the rear of the house , which the two now entered ; when Bart found himself in a company of nearly twenty grave and stern-looking men , deliberating in a regularly organized meeting . " Ditter here , Captain Wright , " eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a prompt , fine-looking man , and the leading whig of the village ; " here is one , " he continued , pointing to Bart , " one who brings ditter news that  --  " " Esquire Knowlton , of Townsend , has the floor now , " said the chairman , interrupting the speaker , and directing his attention to a middle-aged man of a gentlemanly , intelligent appearance , who was standing on one side of the room , having suspended the remarks he was making at the entrance of Dunning and his companion . " As I was remarking , Mr. Chairman , " now resumed the gentleman who had been thus interrupted in his speech , " the tory party , acting under various disguises , have been , for several months past , secretly using every means within their reach to strengthen their unrighteous rule in this already sadly oppressed section of the country . They aim to bring the people into a state of bondage and slavery . When no cash is stirring , with which debts can be paid , they purposely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be redeemed , and take it into their hands , that they may make the people dependent on them , and subservient to their party purposes . And just so far as they find themselves strengthened by these and other disguised movements , so far they betray their intention to curtail all freedom of opinion , and to overawe us by open acts of oppression . Here , one man has been thrown into prison on the charge of high treason ; when all they proved against him was the remark , that if the king had signed the Quebec bill , he had broken his coronation oath . There , another , a poor harmless recluse , as I have ever supposed him , is dragged from his hut in the mountains , and imprisoned to await his trial for an alleged murder , committed long ago , and in another jurisdiction ; when his only crime , with his prosecutors , probably , is his bold denunciations of their tyranny , unless , as some suspect , even a baser motive actuates them . They even proclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tax us without our consent , are guilty of high treason , and worthy of death ! For myself , I seek not , the suspension of this court at this time , on account of the questionable jurisdiction of New York merely , but because the court , itself bitterly tory in all its branches , is sustained by a colony which refuses to adopt the resolves of the Continental Congress , and thereby continues to force upon us the royal authority , which our brethren of the other colonies have almost every where put down , and which in our case , Heaven knows , is not the least deserving the fate it has met elsewhere . And the question , then , now comes home to us , Shall we tolerate it any longer ? The hearts of the people , though their tongues may often be awed into silence  --  the hearts of the people are ready to respond their indignant no ! And I , for one , am ready to join in the cry , and stepping into the first rank of the opposers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to my country . " " Amen ! " was the deep and general response of the company . " Mr. Dunning will now be heard , " said the chairman , motioning to the former to come forward . " Ditter well , Captain  --  der  --  ditter Mr. Moderator , I mean . I , being on the watch against ditter interlopers , you know , have just picked up an odd coon , here , who ditter seems to have ears in one place and tongue in another ; and his story is a ditter loud one . But let him tell it in his own way . So now , Barty Burt , " he continued , going up to the other , who stood by the fire , kicking the fore-stick with his usual air of indifference ; " come forward , and tell the meeting all you have der seen and heard , in the ditter camp of the Philistines . " Bart , then , mostly in the way of answers to a series of rapid questions , put by the chairman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of drawing him out ,  --  Bart then related his discoveries to his astonished and indignant auditors , giving such imitations of the manner of each of the company , whose words he was repeating , as not only showed their meaning in its full force , but at once convinced all present of the truth of his story . No sooner had Bart closed , than a half dozen of the company sprang to their feet , in their eagerness to express their indignation and abhorrence of the bloody plot , which their opponents , under the garb of peace and fair promises , had , it was now evident , been hatching against them . " Order , gentlemen ! " cried the chairman : " I do n't wonder you all want to denounce the detestable and cowardly conduct of the tyrants . But one only can be heard at a time , and Mr. French , I rather think , was fairly up first , and he will therefore proceed . " While all others , on hearing this remark of the chairman , resumed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak first , remained standing . He was a young man , of about twenty-two , of a ready , animated appearance , while every look and motion of his ardent countenance and restless muscles proclaimed him to be of the most sanguine temperament and enthusiastic feelings . An almost unnatural excitement was sparkling in his kindling eyes , and a sort of wild , fitful , sad , and prophetic air characterized his whole appearance as he began . " It has come at last , then ! I knew it was coming . I have felt it for months ; waking and sleeping , I have felt it . In my dreams I have seen blood in the skies , and heard sounds of battle in the air and earth . Dreams of themselves , I know , are generally without sign or significance ; but when the spirit of a dream remains on the mind through the waking hours , as it has on mine , I know it has a meaning . Something has been hurrying me to be ready for the great event . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being here to-morrow . The event and the time are at hand ! I see it now  --  resistance , and battle , and blood ! Let it come ! the victims are ready ; and their blood , poured out on the wood on the altar of liberty , will bring down fire from heaven to consume the oppressors ! " There was a short silence among the company , who seemed to pause , in surprise and awe , at the strange words and manner of the young man , which evidently made an impression on his hearers at the time , and which were afterwards remembered , and often repeated , at the fireside , in recounting his untimely fate . " " Mr. Fletcher , " at length observed the chairman , breaking the silence  --  " Mr. Fletcher , of Newfane , is next entitled to speak , I believe . " " I rose , Mr. Chairman , " said the latter , a fine specimen of the hardy , resolute , and intelligent yeoman of the times  --  " I rose but to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " can it be , that Judge Chandler , after his pledge to us at Chester , would be guilty of conduct reflecting so deeply on his character as a man ? " " I am not wholly unprepared to believe the story myself , " replied the chairman ; " our young friend here may have his peculiarities ; but I consider him a thousand times more honest and honorable , than some of those whose sly hints and treacherous conduct he has so well described . " " Ditter , look here , Mr. Moderator , " interposed Dunning . " I was once , ditter travelling , in the Bay State , with a friend , when we came across a meeting-house with eight sides , and my friend asked me what order of architecture I called it . Ditter well , I was fairly treed , and could n't tell . But I should be able to tell now . I should ditter call it the Chandler order . " A desultory but animated debate now arose . Various methods of accomplishing what appeared to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court  --  were suggested . Some proposed to dismantle or tear down the Court House ; others were for arming the people , seizing the building , and bidding open defiance to their opponents . At this stage of the deliberations , Colonel Carpenter , whose character had secured him great influence , rose , and requested to be heard . " From the gathering signs of the times , " said he , " we have good reason to believe that the smouldering fires of liberty will soon burst forth into open revolution throughout these oppressed and insulted colonies . Our movements here may lead to the opening scene of the great drama ; and we must give our foes no advantages by our imprudence . If we are the first to appear in arms , it may weaken our cause , while it strengthens theirs . Let them be the first to do this  --  let us place them in the wrong , and then , if they have recourse to violence and bloodshed , we will act ; and no fear but the people will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the Court House to-morrow , in a body , but without a single offensive implement , and resist peacefully , but firmly ; and then , if they dare make a martyr , his blood will do more for our cause than would now a regiment of rifles . " Although this prudent and far-sighted proposal was for a while opposed , by the more ardent and unthinking part of the company , yet it was at length adopted by the whole ; and having made arrangements to carry it into effect , the meeting broke up , and all retired to their respective lodgings . CHAPTER V. " Thou ever strong upon the strongest side . " Although many were the anxious consultations , and deep plottings , among the belligerent parties within doors , during the fore part of the memorable 13th of March , yet it was not till the afternoon of that day had considerably advanced , that any indications of the events which followed became observable in the streets of Westminster . About this time , one of the doors of Crean Brush 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cringing form of our humble friend Barty Burt , hotly pursued by his recent employer with uplifted cane , was seen coming down the steps of the entrance , in flying leaps , to the ground . " There , you infernal booby ! please consider this caning and kicking as a farewell to my house and employ forever ! " exclaimed the enraged master , standing in the door-way , and looking down with ineffable scorn upon the prostrate person of the ejected Bart , as he lay sprawled out upon the spot where he landed , without manifesting any disposition to rise . " I should like to know what I 've done criminal , squire ? " responded the latter , looking back over his shoulder at the other , with a doleful grimace . " What have you done ? " sharply retorted Brush . " Why , you impertinent puppy , you have done every thing wrong , and nothing right , ever since you got your lubberly carcass out of bed , at the fine time of eight o'clock this morning ! and now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must go , with your load of meats and half-filled gravy dishes , through the parlor , where you had no business to go , and there , like a blundering jackass , as you are , you must fall down and ruin the best carpet in the house ! I 've had quite enough of you , sir : so up with you there , and clear out , you vagabond ! " " Well , I ' spose I know what you want , " muttered Bart , by way of reply to this tirade  --  " you want to accuse , and drive me away , so you wo n't have to pay me the two crowns you owe me for work , and other things . " " I do n't owe you half that sum , you lying lout , " returned Brush , fiercely . " But to get rid of such a pest , and prevent your going round town with that lie in your mouth , I 'll give you all you ask ; and there they are ! " he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other 's feet . " Your dirty rags , if you have any in the house , shall be thrown out to you ; and then , if you ai nt off , I 'll set the dogs on ye . " With this , and an expressive slam of the door behind him , the secretary returned into the house ; and in a few moments , the sash of a garret window was thrown up , and a pair of shoes , a pair of old summer pantaloons , a spare coarse shirt , and pair of stockings , were successively flung down into the yard , near where the owner was still lying , by the hand of a grinning and blushing servant maid , while her dainty-fingered master stood by , directing the operation . " Well , Bart , " now soon began to mutter this singular being , in his usual manner of addressing himself as a second person , when alone  --  " well , Bart , your plan of getting driv away has worked to a shaving . You 've got your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fetch it ; yes , all your honest pay , and one crown more ; but you charged that , you know , when you told him two crowns , as damage for the kick and cane lick you got . So that 's settled . And as to the other accounts against him , and the rest of ' em there , you 'll be in a way to square all , fore long , guess ; for you will be your own rebel , now , Bart , you know . " While thus communing with himself , he had slowly , and with many winces of affected pain , gathered up his limbs , risen on to his feet , pocketed his two crowns , and collected and tied up his clothes . And he was now , with a grieved look , as if sorrowing for the loss of his home , looking back to the house , where several curious , half-laughing , half-pitying countenances were seen peering through the windows to witness his departure . He then looked hesitatingly abroad , one way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one who feels there is no place in the wide world where he can find a friendly shelter . After this , with a wince and groan at every step , he slowly hobbled off up the street , losing his lameness , and converting his groans into snickers of low , exulting laughter , as soon as he was out of eyeshot of the company he had left behind him . " Kinder ' pears to me , Bart , " he at length said , resuming his soliloquy , as he glanced keenly at the tavern , which was the scene of his last night 's exploit , and which he was now passing  --  " ' pears to me , there 's a good many heads rather close together , in spots , round that tory nest over yonder . They act as if they were in a sort of stew about something . I wonder if they lost their guns last night , or any thing , that puts them in such a pucker , " he continued , with a chuckle . " But suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sham , suppose we now haul up here , and edge over there among ' em a little , to learn what they are up to , before you go to join the company at the Court House . " On reaching the yard of the tavern , Bart found that the company , numbering perhaps twenty in all , had broken from the separate groups in which they had been conversing , and had now gathered round one man , who , having just come out of the tavern , appeared to be communicating to the crowd something that obviously produced considerable sensation . This person was a man of the ordinary size , of fair complexion , light eyes , and an unsettled and vacillating countenance , rendered the more strikingly so , perhaps , by the quick , eager , and restless motions and manner by which his whole appearance was characterized . Bart soon contrived to work his way into this circle , till he gained a position from which he could hear what was said . " You may rely on what I have told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing ; " for I have just had it from the sheriff and lawyer Stearns . The rebels have been in possession of the Court House about an hour , posted sentinels at all the doors , and openly declare , that the judges and officers shall never enter to hold another court . Nobody dreamed of their daring on such a bold step , or we should have been before them in taking possession of the house , even with the force we had on the ground . But , thinking it best to go strong-handed , the judges concluded they would not go in to open the court till enough of friends should arrive to put down all opposition at a blow . The rebels think now , doubtless , that they have got an advantage which they will be able to maintain . But they will find themselves a little mistaken , I fancy ; for Patterson says he has now got them in just the spot he wanted . This act both he and Stearns decide to be overt treason , which will justify him in taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the first summons . But as they wo n't do that , and our forces will shortly be here , you can all guess what we shall now soon see follow , " he added , with a significant wink . " Then why not be getting out our guns at once ? " asked one of the company . " No , " resumed the speaker ; " the plan is to leave that till the last thing before we march upon them , lest the rebels should take alarm , and go and arm themselves , and we thus thwart our own intention of taking them by surprise . You , however , can be kinder carelessly looking up clubs for such as may have no arms , and a few axes and crowbars for breaking into the Court House , if that should be necessary . But , as I said , let the guns remain hid in the sleighs till you have orders to take them out . For it is not exactly settled yet whether we shall march upon them as soon as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or coax them out , and so get possession ourselves . But , at any rate , you will have work on hand soon ; and if we do n't see fun before to-morrow morning , my name ai nt David Redding . But come , let 's all adjourn to the bar-room , and take a drop to warm us up a little . " Leaving Redding to his despicable task of endeavoring , in compliance with the directions of those whose base tool he was , to inflame the company he had collected , and work up their feelings to such a pitch of enmity and recklessness as should prepare them to imbrue their hands in the blood of their neighbors and countrymen , we will now proceed to note the conduct of more important personages in the events of the day . While the scene above described was transpiring , Patterson , Gale , Stearns , and one or two other tory leaders , who had been consulting at this tavern , and making their arrangements for active movements , left the house , and , with hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haughty secretary , which , by his special invitation , at this crisis , was made the permanent quarters of the judges and principal officers of the court , as well as of his numerous guests . " Upon the whole , perhaps you are right , Stearns , " said Patterson , as they were about to enter the house . " We will start off Chandler to the Court House to make one of his smooth speeches , and play Sir Plausible with the rebel rascals , as agreed on last night , and though he should have done it before , yet he may , even now , succeed in flattering them to quit the house long enough for us to get possession ; if not , we will take the other course . " In a few moments after these worthies had disappeared within the house , the door was again opened , and Chief Justice Chandler , the man to whose singularly compounded character , made up of timidity , selfishness , vanity , thirst of power , kindness , and duplicity , or rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloody tragedy that ensued , now made his appearance in the street . He wore a powdered wig , according to the fashion of the times among men of his official station , and his whole toilet had evidently been made with much attention . Carelessly flirting a light cane in his hand , and assuming an air of easy unconcern , he leisurely took his way along the street , towards the Court House , bowing low , and blandly smiling to every one he met , and often even crossing to the opposite side of the street to exchange salutations with the passers-by ; to each of whom , whatever his party or station , he was sure to say something complimentary , and aimed with no little sagacity to reach the peculiar feelings and interests of the person addressed . " This is Mr. French , I believe , " he said , turning out of his course to speak to the young man introduced in the last chapter , who , with the same restless , anxious look he then wore , was unobservantly hurrying by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , yes , sir , " replied French , slightly checking his speed , and looking back , with a half-surprised , half-vacant expression . " Ay , I was sure I knew you , " rejoined the judge . " How are the times with you , Mr. French ? You will pardon my freedom , sir , but the great interest I take in the success of our enterprising and intelligent young men like yourself  --  But no matter now . I see you are in haste . I will not detain you , sir . A very good day to you , Mr. French . " " Well , upon my word , now , here is my friend Colonel Carpenter ! " he again exclaimed , as , turning from the person he had just saluted with such poor success , his quick and wary eye caught sight of the gentleman thus addressed coming up behind him . " Most happy to fall in with you , colonel , " he continued , grasping and warmly shaking the hand of the other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , colonel ? I have really sometimes greatly envied you . " " Why so , sir ? " asked Carpenter , with a little coolness . " Envied you your well-deserved appellation  --  that of Friend of the People , as they call you , " replied the judge . " The people need a friend at this crisis , I think , sir , " responded the unbought yeoman , with cold dignity . " If there is one title that I should covet above all others , " resumed the judge , without appearing to notice the drift of the other 's remark , " it would be the one I have named . What can be a more truly honorable distinction ? I have often regretted being so trammelled by my station on the bench , as to prevent me from acting as I would otherwise like to do . But a judge , you know , colonel , in party times , must not act openly on any particular side . " " He had better do that , however , than act secretly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance . " O , doubtless , doubtless , sir , " rejoined the judge , with a forced laugh , but with the air of one perfectly unsuspicious of any intended personalities . " Yes , indeed . But , ah ! " he continued , slightly motioning towards the Court House , against which they had now arrived . " What have we here ? A public meeting ? " " Quite possible . At all events I think of going in myself , " said Carpenter , quietly turning from the other into the Court House yard , but soon pausing a little , though without looking round , to hear the remarks which the other seemed intent on making . " Indeed ! Why , I had not heard of it , else I should have been pleased to have dropped in . I came out , be sure , only for a little exercise , but  --  " Here he paused , in expectation that the other would speak ; but finding himself disappointed , and left alone in the street , he resumed his walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disquiet he felt at the rebuffs he had received in his attempts to conciliate Colonel Carpenter , and obtain from him an invitation to go into the meeting , which , in reality , it was his only object in coming out to attend . While digesting his mortification , and occupied in conjecturing how he could have become an object of suspicion among the opponents of the court party , as every thing now seemed to indicate , his attention was again arrested by the sounds of approaching footsteps ; and , looking up , his eyes encountered the sarcastic countenance of Tom Dunning , who , coming from an opposite direction , was also on his way to join the company at the Court House . " Ah , Mr. Dunning ! " exclaimed the judge , starting from his reverie and downcast attitude , while his face instantly brightened into smiles summoned for the occasion ; " right glad to meet you , sir . I have been thinking I must engage some such expert and lucky sportsman , as they say you are , to catch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose your never-failing spear will be put in requisition again , when the spring opens ; will it not ? " " Der  --  yes , your worship , unless I turn my attention to the catching  --  ditter  --  eels , or other slippery varments , " returned the hunter , with a sly , significant twinkling of his eyes , as he brushed by the rebuked cajoler , and pushed on without waiting for a reply . The judge did not pursue his walk much farther ; but now , soon facing about , began , with a quickened step and a look of increasing uneasiness , to retrace his way to his quarters . While these little incidents were occurring in the streets , about one hundred sturdy and determined men had collected within the walls of the Court House . As the construction of this building was somewhat peculiar , for one designed for such purposes , it may be necessary , for a clear understanding of the descriptions which follow , to say a few words respecting its interior arrangements . The court-room was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the east and south corners , that had been partitioned off for sleeping apartments . In the lower story , there was a wide passage running through the middle of the building , with doors at both ends ; while the stairs leading up into the court room faced the principal entrance , on the north-east side of the house . After passing by the stairs , there was a small passage leading from the large one , at right angles , and running back between prison-rooms , whose doors opened into it . The part of this lower story , on the opposite side of the main passage , consisted also of two rooms , with doors opening into it , and an entry , or short passage , leading out into the street . One of these rooms was used as a common , or bar-room , and the other as a sort of parlor , being both occupied by the jailer and his family . Although there had been , for many weeks , a growing disposition among the party here assembled to prevent the session of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the recommendations of Congress , yet there had been no settled intention among them to resort to any other than the peaceful measures of petition and remonstrance , which they believed would be sufficient to effect the desired result . It had been decided , therefore , that the court should be permitted to come together ; when such representations and arguments were to be laid before them , as could not fail , it was supposed , to convince any reasonable men of the wisdom of listening to the voice of the people . But when , on the preceding evening , it was discovered , in the way before related , and from other sources , that the people had been duped by the duplicity of Chandler , and that it was the secret purpose of the court , in defiance of all pledges to the contrary , to hold a full session , under the protection of an armed force , the hitherto modest and quiet spirit of patriotism was at once aroused among this resolute little band of revolutionists , and they came to the bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court House in advance of their opponents , and holding it till their remonstrances should be heard and heeded . This object , so far as respected the possession of the building , being now obtained , the company proceeded to organize and make arrangements for maintaining their advantage through the night . Their possession , however , was not destined to remain long undisputed . In a short time after they had begun to act , their new recruit , Barty Burt , who could not forego his desire of remaining among the tories ( where we left him acting the unsuspected spy on their movements ) till they should look for their guns , that he might have the pleasure of witnessing their discomfiture on discovering their loss , now arrived with news , that the latter , as soon as they made the discovery that their arms had been abstracted , were thrown into the greatest commotion ; and that under the direction of Patterson and Gale , both foaming with rage , they had hastily collected all the offensive implements they could find , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Court House . But notwithstanding this startling intelligence , no one manifested the least disposition of quitting his post . And although there was not a weapon of defence , beyond a cane , in the whole company , yet they seemed none the less inclined to maintain their position in consequence of the threatening aspect which the affair was beginning to assume ; but resolving , by acclamation , to keep possession of the house till compelled by force of arms to relinquish it , they placed a few strong and resolute men as guards at every door , and quietly awaited the result . And they were not kept long in suspense . In a short time , Patterson and his posse , armed with several old muskets , swords , pistols , and clubs , made their appearance , and , with many hostile manifestations , came rushing up within a few yards of the door . Commanding a halt , the sheriff then , in a loud and arrogant tone , summoned the company within to come forth and disperse . No voice , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clerk , then proceeded , upon the intimation of the former , to read the king 's proclamation to the outward walls of the house , or the supposed listeners within , with great form and solemnity . " Ditter  --  dickins ! " exclaimed Tom Dunning , after listening a moment to the reading of the riot act , or proclamation , as it was usually called , as , with several others , he stood just within the entrance . " Now I wonder if they expect to rout a body of Green Mountain Boys with that sort of  --  ditter  --  ammunition ? " " There ! " fiercely cried Patterson , as the reader concluded his task . " There , you d  --  d rascals , now disperse , or , by Heaven , I will blow a lane through ye ! " " Only  --  ditter  --  hear that ! " again remaked the hunter , contemptuously , at the menace and profanity of the haughty officer . " Natural enough , though , mayhap , for a bag of wind to blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart at  --  der  --  swearing , too , I think . But even at that , I guess he would have to haul in his horns a little , if old Ethan Allen was here , as I wish he was , to let off a few blasts of his  --  ditter  --  damnations at him . " Captain Wright , after a brief consultation with the other leaders , now coming down from the court-room , opened the door , ( Dunning and another strong-armed man having hold of it to guard against a rush , ) and addressed the besiegers . " Why is all this , gentlemen ? " he said , in a respectful , but firm manner . " Are you come here for war ? We are here for no such purpose , ourselves . We came with none other than peaceful intentions . And so long as we can say that , and say , also , above all , that we have come together with the approbation of the chief judge of your court , who has promised us a fair hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct violation of that judge 's pledge to us , you appear here in arms , to intimidate us , let me assure you , we shall not disperse under your threats . We , however , will permit you to come in , if you will lay aside your arms ; or we will hold a parley with you as you are . " " D  --  n your parley ! " exclaimed Gale , furiously . " D  --  n the parley with such d  --  d rascals as you are ! I will hold no parley with such d  --  d rascals , but by this ! " he added , drawing a pistol , and brandishing it towards his opponents . " Ay ! ay ! " cried Redding , who , next to the sheriff and clerk , appeared to be the most violent and officious among the assailants : " talk about being here without arms , and for peace , do ye ? when you have stolen a dozen of our guns , and have now got them in there among you . Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a parley that will send you all to hell before morning ! " Wright here began a denial of the charge made by the last speaker ; when he was interrupted by Dunning , who , jogging him , said , in an undertone ,  --  " Let ' em  --  der  --  believe it . They are such  --  ditter  --  cowards , that the idea of a dozen guns among us will make ' em more mannerly than all the preaching you could  --  ditter  --  do in a month . " Concluding to profit by this suggestion of the sagacious hunter , Wright now retired within doors , followed by the hisses , curses , and all manner of abusive epithets , of the assailants . The besiegers , now finding that the king 's proclamation , on whose potency for quelling the risings of the rebellious colonists , the tory authorities , at the commencement of the revolution , seemed to have greatly counted , did not annihilate their opponents , and , not seeing fit to attempt to carry their threats into execution at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently held a consultation . While they were thus occupied , a small deputation was sent out to them from the Court House , with another offer to hold a conference . But their proposals being received with fresh insults and abuse , they returned to the house ; while Patterson and his forces , evidently fearing to venture an attack , with their present strength , on the other party , whom they suspected to be armed with the lost guns , now moved off to head-quarters , to report progress , and wait for the expected renforcement , to hasten whose arrival , expresses had been despatched several hours before . A short time after the disappearance of Patterson 's band , Judge Chandler unexpectedly came up to the Court House , wholly unattended , and being readily admitted , he at once ascended into the court-room , and entered the somewhat surprised , but unmoved assembly , bowing low to individuals on the right and left , as he passed on to an unoffered seat , with the gratified air of one , who , after many detentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of his friends . After a rather embarrassing pause , the judge rose , and made a short speech , which left his hearers but little the wiser respecting his real wishes and intentions , though he had much to say about his solicitude for the welfare of the people , and his anxiety that they should do nothing to injure their cause . After he was seated , Wright , Carpenter , and Knowlton , each in turn , addressed him , stating , in general terms , the views and wishes of their party , and reminding him of his pledge , that no arms should be brought by the officers of the court , the recent violation of which they hoped he would be able to explain . Upon this , the former rejoined , declaring with great assurance , and not a little to the surprise of many in the room , that the arms complained of had been brought without his knowledge , and against his express wishes ; and he concluded by assuring his friends , as he said he was proud to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately secure the arms in question ; so that the company might now retire , in full confidence that their petitions would obtain a fair hearing , when the court came together the next morning . The speaker then resumed his seat , and glanced persuasively around him for some tokens of assent or approbation . But the men , whom he had thus undertaken to wheedle , had been taught by experience to heed the caution so well recommended by the tuneful Burns ,  --  " Beware the tongue that 's smoothly hung , "  --  and a chilling silence was the only response that greeted him . " You hear his honor 's remarks , " observed the chairman , at length breaking the ominous silence . " Have you any propositions to make before the judge retires . " Another long interval of deep silence ensued ; when Tom Dunning 's tall , sinewy form , and sharp , bronzed features , screwed up with an expression of sly mischief , was seen rising from a back seat in the room . " Seeing no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed to accept your invitation , Mr. Moderator , I do n't  --  ditter  --  know but I will make a small proposition on the occasion . Now , as I take it , we are to remain here to-night ; and as we have now learned that the judge and the people here are the  --  ditter  --  best of friends , I would just move , Mr. Moderator , that his honor be  --  der  --  ditter  --  invited to take up lodgings with us in the Court House to-night ; so that , if the enemy comes , " he added , imitating the manner of the judge , as described by Bart , " he can assist us to  --  ditter  --  temporize  --  temporize  --  till '  --  " Here the hunter bobbed down into his seat , while explosive bursts of laughter rose from several parts of the room , and a low , half-smothered titter ran through the whole assembly , at this sly , but cutting allusion to the part last night taken by the double-dealing judge , who now sat before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected criminal . He , however , while the chairman was calling to order , recovered his command of countenance , and , by the time the tumult had subsided into the less noisy expressions of mirth , he was smiling as gayly as the rest , and affecting to consider the remarks of the stammering humorist as merely a pleasant joke . " There is no cheating our friend Dunning out of his joke , I perceive , " he said , rising and taking up his hat ; " and , indeed , I do n't know that I can blame a hardy woodsman for laughing at the idea of one of our in-door and tender professional men , like myself , sleeping on floors and benches . I am afraid we deserve it for our effeminacy . Yes , yes , a good joke , truly ! and a good laughter-moving joke is an excellent thing to go to bed upon , they say , " he added , as with a merry , gleeful look , he bowed himself out of the assembly . No further comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this official double-dealer , after his departure ; for all seemed to think that the single shot of Dunning had rendered all further comments on his speech , and his motives in coming there to make it , entirely superfluous . And they therefore proceeded , as if nothing but an ordinary interruption had occurred , to the business on which they were engaged when the judge came in  --  that of passing some fresh resolves expressive of their determination to hold the Court House in defiance of the threats of their opponents , and of their now settled purpose of no longer submitting , on any conditions , to the continuance of a court which had proved itself so corrupt and treacherous . After this , and making arrangements for the posting and relieving of guards at the doors for the night , a part of the company left the house to seek lodgings elsewhere , as the usual hour of rest had now arrived . When the nonplused and disconcerted Chandler left the Court House , he rapidly took his way back to his quarters , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if he might not be able to accomplish by fair words what they had failed to effect by foul . Although he had put the best possible face upon the mortifying occurrence he had just been compelled to meet , and had made , as he believed , a handsome exit from the company , yet he felt keenly conscious that he had not only utterly failed in the object of his visit , but that much of his late base conduct was known . He perceived this in the allusions of Dunning , the pith of which he had affected not to understand . He had seen it , he had felt it , in the significant and knowing glances that had been exchanged on every side around him , and especially in the bitter derisive laugh that had assailed his tingling ears . He had also been taught a new lesson in the interview ! He had seen , in the firm manner and determined looks of those he had been confronting  --  he had seen that which told him of a spirit at work among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted strength , might not long be able to quell . He began now , with the instinctive sagacity of the true office-seeker , to perceive the possibility , perhaps probability , that the power of dispensing office and patronage was about to change hands ; and he inwardly trembled for his own safety . He found himself , in short , in one of those straits , to which men of his character are not unfrequently reduced  --  that of being wholly at a loss to decide which side was most likely to become the strongest . Could he have foreseen and decided this , his mind would have been comparatively at ease ; for he could have then trimmed his sails , so as to steer clear of the political breakers which he knew were somewhere ahead . Some course , however , he must decide upon ; and after lamenting his inability to pierce the future , so far as to know which party was destined to prevail , and thus secure the important advantages that might be derived from shaping his present course accordingly , he at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parties , believing he had so adroitly managed thus far , that whichever side might triumph , he could put in a specious claim of having acted with it , in reality , from the first . And having now made up his mind to this course , he avoided meeting the tory leaders again ; and , seeking out a safe messenger , and sending him to tell them , that " he had left the company at the Court House as he found it , " and that " a forgotten business engagement had compelled him to be absent from their councils for a few hours , " he took his way to a distant part of the village , where he called on an acquaintance of neutral politics . And here becoming much engaged in conversation , and feigning to have forgotten the hour of the night , he was at last prevailed on to accept , as he did with great seeming reluctance , the invitation of his host to tarry till morning . After Patterson and his minions retreated from the Court House , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , alternately cursing their opponents for rebellious obstinacy in not yielding to their commands and menaces , and their expected friends for their tardiness in reaching the place . And affairs remaining in this situation till a late hour in the evening , they were on the point of giving up all thoughts of renewing the attack that night , when the long and anxiously looked for reenforcement , consisting of thirty or forty armed men , came hurrying on to the ground . The sinking spirits and waning courage of the blustering sheriff and his confederates now instantly revived ; and , exulting that they now had the power to glut their vengeance , they resolved on making an immediate assault . And , after fortifying their courage with liberal potations of brandy , the whole party , now swelled , not only by the freshly arrived forces , but by Brush , Peters , Stearns , and many others , who had declined joining in the first sally , to nearly one hundred men , eagerly set forward to the scene of action . The other party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard at the doors of the Court House , had yet been so long exempted from an attack of their foes , that they were now in but little expectation of being any further molested till the next morning . And some were lying stretched upon the benches in the court-room , asleep ; some , with their great-coats under their heads , were reposing on the floors of the different passages of the house ; while others were sitting round the fires , engaged in smoking and conversation . Among those taking their turns as sentries , at this juncture , were Woodburn and Bart , who , with each a stout cane or cudgel in his hand , were now stationed at the principal entrance . " They are coming ! " cried Bart , who , having gone out into the street to ascertain what might be the noise which they had heard at a distance , now came running up , with an excited air , to his companion ; " they are upon us again , with twice as many men as before , and plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Woodburn , as the appearance of the hostile party wheeling up towards the Court House the next instant confirmed the other 's statement  --  " in with the news , and tell them to man the doors , or in two minutes we shall be routed . " Instantly springing into the door , which he unfortunately left open , Bart made the announcement to French , who was restlessly moving about in the passage , and who repeated the same in a voice which started all , both above and below to their feet . " They are coming for our blood ! " he added , in a tone of strange , wild glee . " Ay , there they come ! I see them levelling their guns in the yard ! Now for the victims ! Let us die like  --  " The report of two or three muskets , and the whistling of bullets through the passage just over his head , cut short the speaker . A moment of breathless silence ensued ; when the harsh , ruffian voice of Patterson was heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fire ? " A general discharge of the fire-arms of the assailants , flashing fiercely on the surrounding darkness , and sending their deadly missiles through the passage , windows , and sides of the house , in every direction , instantly followed the ferocious order . And , in the expiring light , the fated French was seen to leap into the air ; and then , spinning giddily round and round an instant , fall , with a low , short screech , prostrate on the floor ; while mingled groans , rising from a half dozen others along the passage , told also the fearful effect of the murderous volley . With the discharge of their arms , the assailing force , guided by their torch-bearers , made a rush for the Court House . As they approached the door , Woodburn , who had kept his post , unhurt , on one side of the steps , sprang forward to dispute their passage , and , after knocking up the swords and bayonets that were aimed at his breast , laid about him so lustily with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some moments , kept at bay . At length , however , Peters , who was near the rear of the hostile column , perceiving it was his hated opponent who was disputing the pass so resolutely , stealthily crept round those in front , and coming up partly behind his intended victim , with a protruded sabre , aimed a deadly lunge at his body , exultingly exclaiming with the supposed fatal thrust ,  --  " There ! d  --  d rebel , take that ! " " And you that ! " cried the other , who , having , from a lucky turn in his body at the instant , received only a flesh-wound on the inner side of his arm , now , with an upward sweep of his cudgel , knocked the sword of the detestable assassin twenty feet into the air  --  " and you that ! ay , and that ! " he added , as , with a quickly repeated blow over the head , he sent his foe reeling to the earth . But the weapon of the intrepid young man being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five of his exasperated foes , he was soon disarmed , and , in spite of his desperate struggles , borne into the court-house with the crowd , who now rushed furiously along the passages , wounding with their swords , and beating down with their guns and clubs , without distinction or mercy , all whom they met in their way . " Guard the doors instantly ! " shouted Patterson , who perceived that numbers of the vanquished party were retreating through the different doors ; " do n't let another of the d  --  d rascals escape ! And , hallo there , jailer ! bring on the keys of the prison-rooms ; we will cage the whole lot , dead or alive , and let ' em be enjoying a few of the fruits of their rebellion now , and the blessed anticipations of being hung for high treason hereafter . " The obsequious jailer soon appeared with the required keys ; and the doors of both prison-rooms were speedily unlocked and thrown open by the directions of the sheriff . " Now , tumble them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look and tone of savage exultation . Eager to obey , the supple tools of arbitrary power now commenced driving all those of their prisoners who had not been too much disabled by their wounds to stand , together into the prison-rooms . They then seized hold of the wounded , who lay weltering in their blood in different parts of the floor of the long passage , and began dragging them along by their limbs to the same destination . " Monster ! " exclaimed Woodburn , looking back from the felon 's cell which he was about to enter , and addressing Redding , who stood mimicking , with fiendish glee , the groans and contortions of French , as he lay gasping and writhing in mortal agony on the spot where he fell , just beyond the short passage dividing the prison-rooms  --  " monster , " he repeated , " would you insult the dying ? " " Yes , d  --  n you ! " savagely interposed Gale , stepping forward ; " he has got just what he deserved ; and I wish there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him along in there with the rest of ' em , Redding ! " " Ay , ay , " responded Patterson , " in with him ! And I can tell the rest of them , they had better be saving their pity for themselves , for they will all be in hell before to-morrow night ! " It is needless to say that this brutal order was promptly obeyed . And when the dying and insensible victim , pierced through head and body , and all the wounded , had been drawn in and thrown promiscuously together , on the cold , damp floors of the prison-rooms , the keys were turned upon them ; and their remorseless butchers , making not the least provision for the sufferers , by way of medical aid or otherwise , returned , after posting a strong guard at the doors , to the tavern or the house of Brush , to celebrate their victory in a drunken carousal . CHAPTER VI . " The brand is on their brows , A dark and guilty spot ; ' T is ne'er to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever may be the result of the present public movement for the abolition of capital punishment , and however far future experiments may go towards establishing the expediency and safety of such a change in criminal jurisprudence , the history of every nation and people will show , we believe , the remarkable fact , that ever since Cain stood before his Maker with his hands reeking with the blood of his murdered brother , and his heart so deeply smitten with the consciousness of having justly forfeited his own life by taking the life of another , that he could not divest himself of the belief that all men would seek to slay him , no one principle has been found to be more deeply implanted in the human breast than the desire to see the wilful shedding of blood atoned for by the blood of the perpetrator . So strong , so active , and so impelling , indeed , seems this principle , that no sooner goes forth the dread tale of homicide , than all community rise up , as one man , instinctively impressed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justice ; while the guilty themselves seem no less instinctively impressed with the abiding consciousness that the doom , which heaven and earth has decreed to their crimes , must inevitably overtake them . Deep and fearful was the excitement , in the hitherto quiet and peaceful village of Westminster , as from mouth to mouth , and house to house , spread the startling intelligence , that a meeting of unarmed citizens , assembled at the Court House , had been assailed , and numbers shot down in cold blood by the minions of British authority . The whole town was soon in commotion . No loud noise or clamor of voices , it is true , was heard proclaiming the deed on the midnight air ; but the rapid footfalls of men hurrying along the streets , the hastily exchanged inquiry , the eager , suppressed tones of those conversing in small groups at the corners and by-places around the village , the hasty opening and shutting of doors , and the dancing of lights in every direction , gave ominous indication of the feeling that had every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every where afoot among the people . A small band , who had gathered in the yard of what was called the People 's Tavern , were listening , with many a demonstration of horror and indignation , to the account of one who had escaped from the Court House after the tories had got possession . " Where are our leaders , Morris ? " asked one of the listeners , as the speaker , a fluent , energetic young man , closed his recital of the atrocities he had witnessed . " Did they escape , or are they among the wounded and prisoners ? " " Wright and Carpenter had gone off before we were attacked , " was the reply ; " the rest , not among the wounded I have named , escaped in the confusion , I think , except Dr. Jones , of Rockingham , who was driven into the felon 's hole with other prisoners ; and it may be well that he was , perhaps , as those bloodthirsty brutes would have suffered no surgeon to be sent for to attend those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunning , whose rifle we shall need ,  --  what became of him ? " " He got out in the same manner I did . We stood in a dark corner , at the head of the stairs , taking note of the proceedings below ; when that crafty little chap , that joined us from Brush 's , came wriggling like an eel out from between the legs of the crowding tories , in the passage ; and , working himself up stairs unnoticed , in the same way , beckoned us to follow him , as we did , into the court-room , where , at his suggestion , we stripped off the sheets of a bed , in one of those corner sleeping cuddies , made a rope , and by it let ourselves down through a window to the ground in the rear of the house ; when we separated , Dunning going home , as he said , to arm himself . But here he comes , " added the speaker , peering out towards the street , from which several forms were dimly seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him I should judge to be Carpenter and Fletcher , by their gait . " " Well , Dunning , " asked one of the company , as the hunter came striding up to the spot , " what is your response to all this ? " " Der  --  sixty bullets , and a  --  ditter  --  pound of powder ! " was the stern and significant reply of the other , as with one hand he struck his rattling bullet-pouch and huge powder-horn , and with the other brought down the breech of his rifle with a heavy blow upon the ground . " That 's the man for me ! " exclaimed Fletcher , now coming up with Carpenter . " Ay , Dunning is right ! " said Carpenter , with emphasis ; " if we hold our peace now , the very stones will cry out for vengeance ! But talking is only a small part of what must be done . We must act . And first of all , this tale of murder and outrage must instantly be thrown upon the four winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the settlement . Who will volunteer to ride express with the news ?  --  news which , if I know any thing of the spirit of the great mass of our people , will be taken as a call to arms , and responded to accordingly . " Several eager voices announced their readiness to start off at once on the proposed mission . " Follow me to the stables , then , " resumed the stanch patriot , hastily leading the way to the barn , and throwing open a stable door . " There ! " he continued , pointing to a pair of large , active-looking brutes , feeding together in one stall  --  " there are my two horses  --  take them . Let one of their riders go north , the other south ; and spare no horse-flesh of mine in an emergency like this ; but ride and rally , till you have sent the bloody tale to every house and hut this side the mountains . And you , Morris and Dunning , accompany me to Captain Wright 's . More messengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Hampshire , and much other business done before morning . " A far different scene , in the mean while , was in progress among the inmates of the loyal mansion , which we have before described , and which was destined to give shelter that night to the last conclave of royal office-holders ever known in the Green Mountains . Although the leaders of the court party had returned from the sanguinary scene they had enacted , in high exultation at the decisive victory they supposed they had achieved over their despised opponents , yet neither their own vain boastings , nor the deeply-quaffed wines of their host , could long keep up their spirits . Conscience soon began to be busy among them ; and their hearts waxed faint and fearful at the thought of what they had done . They instinctively drew close together , conversed in subdued tones , or sat uneasily listening to the sounds that occasionally reached them from without . And whatever they might have said to keep up their own and each other 's courage , it soon became apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retribution had taken possession of their guilt-smitten bosoms . And there was another person in that house , to whom the tragical events of the night brought deep disquietude ; but it was a disquietude of quite a different character from that which was experienced by the troubled wretches we have named : that person was the Tory 's Daughter  --  the pure , guileless , and noble-minded Sabrey Haviland . Having been apprised of the intention of Patterson and his confederates to make an assault upon their opponents as soon as the expected renforcements arrived , her anxieties on the subject had prevented her from retiring to rest , as her less concerned companion did , at the usual hour . And when the startling report of fire-arms broke upon the stillness of the night , she was not , like many others in the village , at loss to know the cause ; and her fears led her to divine but too well the fatal result . And after an interval of painful suspense , which was terminated by the return of the tory leaders to the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stairs , and there listened with mingled emotions of horror and disgust to the boastful recital of their sanguinary deeds , as given by the heartless Gale and others , to her father and Judge Sabin , who had remained in the house , but who , she perceived with sorrow , were warm approvers of all that had been done . But , as revolting to her gentle nature as was the general description of the event , the particulars the exulting narrators soon proceeded to give were much more so . And when she heard them relate the affray between Woodburn and Peters , and heard the latter , while making light of his own hurts , boast that he had first given the other a thrust with his sword through the body , which must finish him before morning , she could listen no longer , but , hastily retiring to her room , she walked the apartment for nearly an hour in the deepest agitation and distress . Among the many excellent traits of Miss Haviland 's character , a lively sense of right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and justice , unquestionably predominated . So strong and controlling , indeed , was this principle in her bosom , that it exhibited itself in all her conversation , and seemed to be the governing motive of all her actions . And when she had once discovered the truth and the right , at which she appeared to arrive with intuitive quickness , no wheedling or sophistry could blind her to their force ; and no inducements could be offered sufficient to cause her to waver in their support . And yet this peculiar trait , as deeply seated as it was , and as firmly as it was ever exercised , was so beautifully tempered by the benevolence of her heart , the equanimity of her mind , and the engaging sweetness of her demeanor , that it never seemed to impart the least tinge of arrogance to her character , or harshness to her manners . On the contrary , she was all gentleness and affection , and ever ready to comply with the wishes of others , when a compliance did not contravene , in her opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in case she felt bound to refuse to yield to their requests , her refusal was made and maintained with such mild firmness , that none could be offended , none feel inclined to charge her with obstinacy or perverseness . She was at this time the mistress of her father 's household , her exemplary and intellectual mother having several years before deceased , and her elder and only sister , the year previous , married one of the leading loyalists of Guilford . And it had been mainly through the influence of this sister and her husband , that she had been induced , the preceding fall , to take the step which was destined to cause her years of sorrow and perplexity  --  that of engaging herself in marriage to Peters . She had found few or no opportunities of studying this man 's character , having known him only as a parlor acquaintance , of easy manners and considerable intelligence . And although she saw nothing particularly objectionable in him , and although she knew that , in point of wealth and family distinction , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had entered into the engagement with many misgivings , and in compliance rather with the wishes of her friends above named , seconded by the urgent request of her father , than in accordance with the dictates of her own judgment and inclination . But whatever her doubts at that time , or during the months immediately following , they had not been sufficient to disturb the usual even tenor of her feelings , till she left home on her present excursion , during which , as already intimated , she had seen the character of her affianced in a new light  --  a light which showed him to be possessed of traits as abhorrent to her feelings , as , to her mind , they were base and reprehensible in themselves . And now , to crown all , he had , by an act of deliberate , private malice , even according to his own account , inflicted a mortal wound on the victim of his former injuries  --  the man who , but the day before , had snatched her , whom the other professed to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a watery grave . It was these painful reflections that were now agitating her bosom ; for the more she pondered upon the conduct of Peters , the more did her heart reject and despise him ; and in proportion as her feelings rose up against him were her sympathies drawn towards his victim , Woodburn , whose noble act had created so strong a claim upon her gratitude , and whose character and appearance had alike awakened her interest and admiration . " Is it indeed thus , " she at length uttered , as if summing up the thoughts that had been passing through her mind , " that he who saved my life , at the risk of his own , must die by the hand of one who should have been the first to thank and reward him ? Ay , and die , too , without receiving from me , or mine , one word of acknowledgment , even , of the service he so nobly rendered ? Perhaps the thought of our ingratitude is now embittering his dying moments ! Can I , should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into silence , and , slowly resuming her walk round the room , seemed for a while immersed in anxious thought ; when she suddenly paused , and , after a moment of apparent irresolution , stepped to the wall , and gave two or three pulls at the wire connected with the servants ' bell in the kitchen . In a few minutes the summons was answered by the appearance of the chamber-maid . " Will you go down to the gentlemen 's sitting-room , " said Miss Haviland , " ask out my father , and tell him I would see him a moment in my own room ? " The girl disappeared , and , in a short time , Esquire Haviland , with a slightly disturbed and anxious air , entered the room , and said ,  --  " What 's the matter , Sabrey ? Are you sick to-night , that you are yet up and send for me ? " " O , no , " replied the other ; " nothing of that kind led me to send for you , but my wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The squire cast a somewhat surprised and inquiring look at his daughter , but remained silent , while the latter resumed :  --  " You recollect that this morning , after apprising you of the extent of our obligations to Mr. Woodburn , about which you seem to have been so misinformed , I suggested that a personal acknowledgment , with offers of some more substantial token of our gratitude , should be immediately made to him . Has this been done ? " " No , " replied he , with a gathering frown : " having understood the fellow was assorting with the rebels in their treasonable plots , I did not feel myself bound to seek him in such company . Is that all you wish of me ? " " It is not , sir , " she answered seriously , and with the air of one determined not to be repulsed . " I have accidentally become apprised that Mr. Woodburn , in the affray of to-night , has been dangerously wounded , and , in this condition , thrust into prison . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of his services , it is my earnest request that you procure his release from prison , for which your influence here , I know , is sufficient ; that he may be brought out to-night and properly attended . " " Insane girl ! " muttered the father , angrily , " what can have put that absurd project into your head ? Had you been abed hours ago , as you ought , instead of being up and prying into the doings of our authorities , with which a woman has no concern , I should have been spared this exhibition of folly . Why , the wretched fellow is but receiving the just deserts of his crimes . He is in prison for high treason ; and had I the will , which I have not , I could not procure his release . " " I can not believe these opposers of the court will be held to answer for such a crime . Indeed , it has occurred to me that the authorities themselves may be called to account for firing upon these unarmed men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertions for Woodburn 's release , " urged the fair pleader . " You are to be the judge what is treason , then , hey ? And you are ready to side with these daring and desperate fellows , and condemn our authorities , are you ? What assurance ! You will hardly persuade me to favor your mad projects , I think , " harshly retorted the bigoted old gentleman . " You can , at least , go to the prison and return him the acknowledgments which our character and credit require of us , " still persisted the former . " Well , I shall do no such thing , " replied the other , with angry impatience ; " for I consider the fellow 's conduct to-night has wholly absolved me from my obligations to him , if I was ever under any , " he added , rising to depart . " I do not view it so , father , " returned the unmoved girl , in a mild , expostulating tone , " and I am sorry for your decision ; for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , refuse to perform it , I know not why I should not myself undertake the duty . " " You ! " " Yes , father . " " What , to-night ? " " Certainly ; another day may be too late . " " Madness and folly ! Why , who is to attend you , silly girl ? " " If no gentleman is to be found with courtesy enough to attend me , I shall not hesitate to go alone , sir . " " We will see if you do ! " exclaimed the old gentleman , looking back from the entrance at the other , with an expression of scornful defiance  --  " we will see if you do , madam ! " he repeated , closing the door after him , and turning the key on his daughter , whom he thus left a prisoner in her own room . As Miss Haviland listened to the springing bolt and her father 's departing steps , a slight flush overspread her face at the thought of the indignity thus put upon her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door to assure herself that she was not mistaken , proceeded , with a calm , determined air , to a table on one side of the room , on which stood the materials for writing ; and here , taking pen and paper , she seated herself , and addressed a brief note to Woodburn , delicately expressing her sense of obligation to him , and concluding with the hope that she might soon have it in her power to do something towards alleviating his present situation . Having signed , sealed , and superscribed the billet , she rose and stood some time hesitating and irresolute . By what means could this note , now it was written , be made to reach its destination ? Should she again summon the chamber-maid , she presumed her father had so managed that the call would not be answered ; besides , she felt a repugnance to the thought of resorting to such means . What other method could then be devised ? While thus casting about her for some expedient for effecting her purpose , she thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , beneath a window , opening from the rear end of the passage adjoining her room ; and , after listening a moment , she distinctly heard the person cautiously ascending . Not being of a timid cast , she quickly removed the thick , heavy curtains of the window in her room next and very near the one under which the unknown intruder was mounting the ladder , and , throwing up the sash , peered out ; when , to her surprise , she beheld , and at once recognized , the queer-looking figure of Barty Burt , standing on the top round of the ladder , scratching his head , and giving other tokens of embarrassment at being thus unexpectedly caught in this situation . " Master Bart , " said Miss Haviland , who had become somewhat acquainted with the other , while supplying her room with fuel , previous to his ejection from the house , to which she was knowing , " your appearance , at this time , to say the least of it , causes me much surprise . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " so that makes us even , and no questions on ither side , do n't it ? " " Perhaps not , sir , " returned the former , with seriousness : " at all events , you should be able to give a good reason for your appearance here , under such circumstances : please explain your object . " " And if I do n't , you will sing out for the squire , you said ? Well , I can get down , and off , before he can get here , I reckon , " responded Bart , in a tone of roguish defiance . " I did not say I would call Esquire Brush ; but , unless you explain  --  " " Yes , yes , jest as lieves as not , and will , if you 'll keep shut till I can run up garret and back . " " Your purpose there , sir ? " " An honest one  --  only to get my gun up there , which the squire did n't have put out for me , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which I darsent name then , fear he 'd have that thrown down , like my ' tother duds , and break it  --  only that  --  and if you 'll say nothing , and let me whip in , and up to get it , I 'll lay it up against you , as a great oblige , to be paid for , by a good turn to you some time , miss . " " If that is all , go  --  and I may wish to speak with you when you come back . " So saying , she gently let down the sash , and , withdrawing a little from her window , stood awaiting the result ; when she soon heard the other , with the light and stealthy movements of a cat , enter the house , and ascend into the garret , through a small sidedoor , opening from the passage we have named . Scarcely a minute had elapsed before she again heard his footsteps stealing back by her door to the window , through which he had so noiselessly entered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she found him already standing on the top of the ladder where she last saw him , he having effected his ingress and egress with such celerity , that but for the light fusil he now held in his hand , she would have believed herself mistaken in supposing he had entered at all . " Well , miss , I am waiting for your say so , " he said , in a low tone , peering warily around him . " Have you been to the Court House to-night ? " hesitatingly asked the other . " Well , now , " replied Bart , hesitating in his turn , " without more token for knowing what you 're up to , I 'll say , may be so , and may be no so . " " You need not fear me , Bart , " replied Sabrey , conjecturing the cause of his hesitation ; " I am no enemy of those who have suffered there to-night . But do you know Mr. Woodburn ? " " Harry , who got you out of that river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He is among the wounded and prisoners in jail , it is said ? " " Dreadful true , miss . " " Could you get this small letter to him to-night ? " she timidly asked . " Yes , through the grate ; glad to do it , glad of it , twice over , " replied Bart , reaching out and grasping the proffered billet . " Why , why do you say that ? " asked Sabrey , with an air of mingled doubt and curiosity . " Cause , in the first place , you 'll now keep my secret of being here ; and nextly , glad to find there 's one among the court folks that feels decent about this bloody business . But I must be off . Yes , I 'll get it to him , " said Bart , beginning to descend . " Stay , Barty . Is there any hope that Mr. Woodburn will survive his wounds ? " " Survive ? Live , do you mean ? O , yes ; though the lunge which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the heart , and the fellow wa n't at all to blame that it did n't reach it , instead of the inner part of the arm . " " Indeed ! " exclaimed Miss Haviland , in a tone of joyful surprise ; which the next instant , however , gave way to one of embarrassment . " Why , I heard  --  have written , indeed , under the belief that  --  and perhaps  --  Barty , I think , on the whole , I will not send that billet now . " As Bart heard these last words of the fair speaker , so inconsistent with all which both her words and manner had just expressed , he looked up with a stare of surprise to her face , now sufficiently revealed , by the glancing light standing near her in the room , to betray its varying expressions . But , as he ran his keen gray eyes over her hesitating and slightly confused countenance , he soon seemed to read the secret cause of her sudden change of purpose , arising from that curious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gush of awakened sympathy , often unfolds all the lurking secrets of the breast , but which , when the cause of that sympathy is removed , closes up the avenue , and conceals them from view , in the cold reserve of shrinking delicacy  --  the colder and more impenetrable in proportion as the disclosure has been complete . " O , yes , I will carry it , " said Bart , pretending to misunderstand the other , while he pocketed the billet and began to glide down the ladder . " No , " commenced Miss Haviland ; " no , Bart , I said  --  " " Yes , yes , I will have it there in a jiffy , " interrupted Bart , hastening his descent , and the next instant dodging away in the dark beneath the foot of the ladder . " Well , let it go , " said the foiled and somewhat mortified maiden to herself , after the disappearance of her strange visitor . " If what I expressed , when I thought him dying , was right and proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as she had thus reconciled herself to the unexpected turn which this matter had taken , Miss Haviland now began to reflect more on Bart 's motives in coming , at such an hour of the night , for his gun ; when it , for the first time , occurred to her mind , that he had been induced to take this step in consequence of some particular call for arms having reference to the events of the evening . Fearing she might have done wrong in suffering him to take away the gun , if it was to be used for hostile purposes , and anxious to know whether her conjectures relative to a rising of the people were well founded , she proceeded to an end window of her room , which overlooked a range of buildings known to her to be mostly occupied by the opposers of royal authority ; and removing the curtains and raising the sash , she leaned out and listened for any unusual sounds which might reach her from without . And it was not long before she became well convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evidently going on in the village . The low hum of suppressed voices , mingled with various sounds of busy preparation , came up , on the dense night air , from almost every direction around her . Here , was heard the small hammer , the grating file , with the occasional clicking of the firelock , undergoing repairs by the use of the instruments just named . There , could be distinguished the pecking of flints , the rattling of ramrods , and the regularly repeated rapping of bullet-moulds to disengage the freshly-cast balls . In other places could be perceived the hasty movements of men about the stables , evidently engaged in leading out and saddling horses , and making other preparations for mounting ; and then followed the sounds of the quick , short gallop of their steeds , starting off , on express , in various directions , under the sharply applied lashes of excited riders , and distinctly revealing their different routes out of the village , by the streams of fire that flew from their rapidly striking hoofs on the gravelly and frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent commotion through the town . Bart 's object in coming for his gun , at such an hour of the night , was now sufficiently explained ; for the quick and discerning mind of Miss Haviland at once told her that the country was indeed rising in arms to avenge the atrocities just committed by the party among whom were all her relatives and friends ; and she shuddered at the thought of to-morrow , feeling , as she did , a secret and boding consciousness that their downfall , brought about by their arrogance and crimes , was now at hand . CHAPTER VII . " A shout as of waters  --  a long-uttered cry : Hark ! hark ! how it leaps from the earth to the sky ! From the sky to the earth , from the earth to the sea , It is grandly rechoed , We are free , we are free ! " Every thing , the next morning , seemed as quiet and peaceful in the village , as if nothing unusual had occurred there . The commoiton of the preceding night appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , had the revolutionists managed , that no knowledge of their movements had yet reached the ears of any of their opponents . And so guarded was their conduct , through the whole morning , that the court party leaders , although their spies had early been out , prowling round the whole village , were yet kept in entire ignorance of all that had transpired among the former during the night . Being consequently deceived by the false appearance which every thing within the reach of their observation had been made to wear , and feeling thus relieved of their last night 's guilty fears of a popular outbreak , these cruel and dastardly minions of royalty now counted on their triumph as complete ; and , soon giving way to noisy exultation , they began openly to boast of the sanguinary measure by which their supposed victory had been achieved . And , about nine o'clock in the forenoon , the judges and officers of court , with a select number of their most devoted adherents , all in high spirits , and wholly unsuspicious of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession at the house of Brush , and , attended by a strong armed escort , marched ostentatiously through the street to the Court House , and entered the court-room to commence the session . After the judges had been ushered to their seats , and while they were waiting for the crowd to enter and settle in their places , Chandler , who had kept aloof till the procession had begun to form , was seen to run his wary and watchful eye several times over the assembly , to ascertain whether there were any discoverable indications there pointing to any different state of things from the one so confidently assumed by his confederates , when he soon appeared to have noted some circumstance which caused him suddenly to exchange the bland smile he had been wearing for a look of thoughtfulness and concern . " Do you notice any thing unusual in the crowd this morning , Judge Sabin ? " he said to his colleague , in an anxious whisper , as he closed his scrutiny . " No , your honor , " replied the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but friendly faces , instead of the hostile ones , which a man would have been led to expect to meet here , after so much clamor about popular disaffection . " Ay , " responded the former , with a dubious shake of the head  --  " ay , but that is the very circumstance that puzzles me . Had a portion of the assembly been made up of our opponents , quietly mingling with the rest , as I had rather hoped , I should have construed it into a token of submission ; or , had a committee been here to present a petition , or a remonstrance or two , I should have been prepared for that , and could have managed , by a little encouragement , and a good deal of delay , to give every troublesome thing the go-by , till the storm had blown over . But this entire absence of the disaffected looks a little suspicious , do n't it ? " " Why , no , " answered the stiff and stolid Sabin ; " I can see nothing suspicious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebellion is crushed ; for , as I presume , the honest but well-meaning part of the rebels are ashamed , and their leaders afraid to show their faces here to-day , after last night 's lesson . " " I hope it may be as you suppose ; but I have my doubts in the matter , " returned Chandler , with another dissenting shake of the head , as he turned away to renew his observations on the company before him . On resuming his scrutiny , the uneasy judge soon perceived that the assembly , during his conversation with his colleague , had received an accession of several individuals , whom he recognized as belonging to the party whose absence had awakened his suspicions . But the presence of these persons , after he had carefully noted their appearance , instead of tending to allay , only went to confirm , his apprehensions ; for , as he closely scanned the bearing and countenance of each , and marked the assured and determined look and covert smile which spoke of anticipated triumph , attended with an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the instinctive sagacity sometimes seen in men of his cast of character , enough to convince him , with what he had previously observed , that a movement of a dangerous magnitude was somewhere in progress , and soon to be developed against the court party . And he instantly resolved to lose no time before trimming his sails and preparing to meet the coming storm . And the next moment , to the surprise of his colleague and the officers of the court , he was on his feet , requesting silence that he might address the assembly . He then proceeded to remark on the unfortunate occurrences of the previous night , with a show of much feeling and regret , and concluded by expressing his disapprobation of the course taken in the affair by the sheriff and his abettors , in a manner that would have given the highest offence to all implicated , had they not believed that the speech was secretly designed only as a game on their opponents , whom he might think it expedient to quiet and delude a little longer . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained silent ; while the speaker sat down with the mental exclamation ,  --  " There , let it come now ! That speech will do to be quoted . I can refer them to it as the public expression of my views before I knew what was coming . " Having thus placed himself in a position , as he believed , where he could easily turn himself to meet any contingency ,  --  where , in case the apprehended overthrow of the court party took place , he could easily and safely leap the next hour to a favorable , if not a high stand among the new dispensers of place and power , or where , should the present authorities be able to sustain themselves , he could as easily explain away his objectionable doings , and retain his standing among them . Having done this , he then turned his attention to the official duties of his place , and ordered the crier to give the usual notice , that the court was now open for business . This being formally done , the court docket was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of for the time being , by the judges , till they came to that of Woodburn versus Peters ; which was a petition for a new trial for the recovery of the petitioner 's alleged farm , that had been decided , at the preceding term , to be the property of Peters , on the ground and in the manner mentioned in a former chapter . " Who answers for this Woodburn ? " said Sabin , with a contemptuous air . Significant glances were exchanged among the tory lawyers and officers about the bar at the question , and a malicious smile stole over the features of Peters , who had found a seat among them . " I move the court , " said Stearns , the attorney of Peters , " for a judgment in favor of my client for his costs , and also for a writ of possession of his land , of which he has been so unjustly kept out by this vexatious proceeding . And , as the petitioner has not entered his appearance according to rule , whereby he tacitly admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit myself to doubt that the court will so order , even at this early hour  --  they certainly have the power to do so . " " They have also the power to postpone the hearing , even to the last day of the term , before rendering judgment , " bluntly interposed Knights , a large , plain-looking practitioner at the bar , who had taken no active part either for or against the court party . " We all know how this young man is debarred from appearing here to-day ; and it seems to me manifestly unjust that any power which deprives a man of the opportunity of appearing at court , should render judgment against him in consequence of his nonappearance . I would , therefore , suggest a delay in this cause . Perhaps , within a short time , he will employ counsel , or be liberated . " " And perhaps be hung for treason , " said Stearns , in a sneering under-tone . " Do you answer for him or not , Mr. Knights ? " demanded Sabin , impatiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized me . I only made a suggestion , " answered the former . " Then judgment must go for Peters , " rejoined Sabin , with ill suppressed warmth . " Traitors and rebels must look somewhere else for favor , beside this court , while I hold a seat here . " " Nobody has yet been convicted of treason , I believe , " promptly responded Knights , while an expression of indignant scorn flashed over his manly and intelligent countenance ; " and till such is the case , I take it the rights of all have an equal claim on the court . I should be pleased to hear the opinion of the chief justice in this matter . " " Although I may have my doubts on this subject , Mr. Knights , " graciously replied Chandler , " you could hardly expect me to be guilty of so great a discourtesy to my colleague here , as to interfere , after the intimation he has just given . " " Make the entry , Mr. Clerk , " said Sabin , hastily ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not troubled with any doubts in the matter , and will take the responsibility of the decision . " Scarcely was the cause thus decided before Peters glided up to the clerk , and whispered in his ear ; when the latter , nodding assentingly , opened his desk , and taking out two nicely-folded papers , handed them slyly to the other , who , receiving them in the same manner , immediately left the court-room and proceeded down stairs . As the exulting suitor passed through the crowd gathered round the main entrance , he beckoned to a short , thick-set , harsh-featured fellow , who immediately followed him around a corner of the building . " Well , Fitch , " said Peters , pausing as soon as they were out of the reach of observation , " have you done up your business in town , so as to be ready for a start for Guilford ? " " Yes ; do n't know but I have . But you ca n't have got your decision , papers made out , and all , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All complete ! " returned Peters , triumphantly . " Why , the court has not been in session an hour ! " " True , but I had spoken to Judge Sabin to have my case taken up this morning ; and , as nobody was authorized to answer for Woodburn , the case was disposed of in a hurry . And the clerk , with whom I had also arranged matters , had made out the papers before going into court , and got them all signed off and ready , in anticipation ; and here they are , ready for your hands , Mr. Constable . " " Ay , I see ; but what is the necessity of serving them so immediately ? " " Why , there 's no knowing what may happen , Fitch . If the rebels , in revenge for last night 's peppering , should send over the mountain for old Ethan Allen and his gang to come here to stir up and lead on the disaffected , all legal proceedings might be stopped . I know most of our folks think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . But Chandler , who is as keen as a fox for smelling out trouble , acts to me as if he was frightened ; and I think he must have scented mischief brewing , somewhere . " " Some say he is a very timorsome man . " " Yes ; but watchful and sagacious , and therefore an index not to be disregarded . " " May be so . But what are your orders about these papers ? " " With this , the writ of possession , go , in the first place , and turn the old woman , his mother , neck and heels , from the house ; and then get some stiff fellow in for a tenant , rent free the first year , if you can do no better , provided he will defend the premises against Woodburn , if he escapes unhung . And with this paper , an execution for costs , as you will see , seize the fellow 's cow and oxen , and all else you can find , and sell them as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't leave enough of the fellow for a grease spot ! " " Blast him ; I do n't intend to . But now is the time to do it , before he can get out of jail and back there to give fight and trouble us . So you fix all these matters about right for me , Fitch , and I 'll do the handsome thing by you when I come over , after the roads get settled , in the spring . " " Never fear me , as long as I know what a friend 's wishes are , " replied the constable , with a significant wink , as he stuffed the documents into his hat , and bustled off on the detestable mission of his more detestable employer . While Peters and his official minion was thus engaged , Tom Dunning was seen coming , with hasty strides , along the road , from the direction of his cabin , which was situated without the village , about a half mile north of the Court House , from which it would have been visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosed . As the hunter was entering the village , he met Morris , hastening up the street , from the opposite part of the town . " Well met , " said Morris ; " for I was bound to your quarters with a message , which  --  " " Which I am ditter ready to receive , and give you one , which I started to carry to your folks , in return . So , first for yours . " " Mine is , that we are now drawn up , two hundred strong , in the first woods south of the village , and are ready to march . " " And mine , that we are der ditto ; besides being a hundred better than you , all chafing , like ditter tied-up dogs , to be let on . " " I will back , then , to my post with the news ; and in less than a half hour , tell them , they shall hear our signal of entering the village , as agreed , which we will expect you to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , to effect a junction , as we wheel into the court-yard . But stay : have the prisoners been apprized that their deliverance is at hand ? " " Yes ; I ran up at the time the court ditter went in , and , in the bustle , got a chance to tell them through the grate . " " All right ; but how are the wounded doing ? " " Ditter well , except French , who is fast going . " " Indeed ! Poor fellow ! But his blood will now soon be avenged , " said Morris , as the two now separated and hastened back to their respective posts . After Peters had despatched the constable on his work of legal plunder and revenge , he returned to the court-room for the purpose of pressing to a hearing some other cases which he had pending against political opponents , and which he hoped , through the favor of a biased and corrupt court , to carry as easily as the one wherein he had just so wickedly triumphed . But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for he found that another , actuated by motives no less unworthy than his own , had already gained the attention of the court to a case of which he had been the prime mover and complainant . This was Secretary Brush ; and the trial he had been urging on , through Stearns , the acting state 's attorney , was that of the alleged murderer , to whose somewhat mysterious , as well as suspicious , arrest and imprisonment allusion has already been made . " As you say the witnesses are in court , Mr. Stearns , " observed Chandler , after a moment 's consultation with his colleague , " as all the witnesses are here , we have concluded to take up the criminal case in question . You may therefore direct the sheriff to bring the prisoner into court without delay . " The sheriff , accordingly , left the court-room , and , in a short time , reappeared with the prisoner , followed by two armed men , who closely guarded and conducted him forward to the criminal 's box . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of rather slight proportions of body , but with a large head , and coarse features , that seemed to be kept almost constantly in play by a lively , flashing countenance , in which meekness and fire , kindness and austerity , were curiously blended . As he seated himself , he turned round and faced the court with a fearless and even scornful air , but promptly rose , at the bidding of the chief judge , to listen to the information , which the clerk proceeded to read against him at length , closing by addressing to the respondent the usual question as to his guilt or innocence of the charge . " I once , " calmly responded the prisoner  --  " I once knocked up a pistol , pointed at my breast by a robber . It went off and killed one of his fellows , and  --  " " Say , guilty or not guilty ? " sternly interrupted the clerk . " Not guilty , then , " answered the other , determined , while going through these preliminary forms , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , under other circumstances , he would have reserved for the more appropriate time of making his defence , or left to his counsel . " Ay , not guilty ; and that gentleman , " he rapidly continued , pointing to Brush , " that gentleman , who has offered to free me if I would submit to be robbed , well knows the truth of what I say . The witnesses , whom he has suborned , also know it , if they know any thing about that luckless affray . " " Liar ! " shouted Brush , springing up , in high excitement , as soon as he could recover from the surprise and confusion into which this bold and unexpected charge had thrown him . " The man 's insane  --  evidently insane , your honors ! " cried Stearns , who , in his anxiety to shield his friend Brush , thought not of the effect of such a remark . " I thank the attorney for the government for that admission , may it please the court , " said Knights , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may wish to make use of it . " " Are you counsel for the prisoner , sir ? " sharply demanded the other . " I am , sir , " coolly replied Knights ; " and you may find , before we get through the trial , that what the prisoner has said , as much out of place as it was , is not the only truth to be developed . But before the case proceeds any further , I offer a plea to the jurisdiction of this court , and at once submit , whether a man can be tried here for an offence alleged to have been committed in another county , without a special order from the governor for that purpose . " " That order is obtained and on file , sir . So that learned bubble is burst , as will all the rest you can raise in favor of the miserable wretch you have stooped to defend , " said Stevens , exultingly . " Mr. Clerk , pass up that order to the court . " " Are you satisfied now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , after glancing at the order which had been laid before the judges . " Mr. Stearns , proceed with the cause . " But that court , on whom the subservient attorney and his corrupt and arrogant friend depended to convict an innocent man of an infamous crime , that a private and nefarious object might thereby be enforced  --  that court were now destined to be arrested in their career of judicial oppression before they had time to add another stain to their already blackened characters : for , at this moment , a deep and piercing groan , issuing from one of the prison-rooms beneath , resounded through the building so fearfully distinct , as to cause every individual of the assembly to start , and even to bring the judges and officers of the court to a dead pause in their proceedings . A moment of death-like silence ensued ; when another and a sharper groan of anguish , bursting evidently from the same lips , and swelling up to the highest compass of the human voice , and ending in a prolonged screech of mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horror to the very hearts of the appalled multitude ! " Who ? What ? For God 's sake , what is that ? " exclaimed a dozen eager and trembling voices at once , as nearly the whole assembly started to their feet , and stood with amazed and perplexed countenances , inquiringly gazing at each other . " Do n't your consciences tell you that ? " exclaimed the prisoner , Herriot , in a loud , fearless voice , running his stern , indignant eye over the court , its officers , and leading partisans around the bar . " Do n't your consciences tell you what it was ? Then I will ! It was the death-screech of the poor murdered French , whose tortured spirit , now beyond the reach of your power , went out with that fearful cry which has just assailed your guilty ears ! " " Mr. Sheriff ! Mr. Sheriff ! " sputtered Sabin , boiling with wrath , and pointing menacingly to the prisoner . " Silence , there , blabbing miscreant ! " thundered Patterson . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mentioned , " returned Herriot , unflinchingly . Struck dumb with astonishment at the unexpected audacity of the prisoner in thus throwing out , in open court , such bold and cutting intimations of their guilty conduct , the judges and officers seemed perfectly at a loss how to act , or give vent to their maddened feelings , for some moments . Soon , however , the most prompt and reckless among them found the use of their tongues . " Shoot him down , Patterson ! " exclaimed Brush , with an oath . " Treason ! I charge him with treason , and demand that he be ironed and gagged on the spot ! " shouted Gale , bringing down his clinched fist heavily on the desk before him ! " Yes , high treason ; let us re-arrest him , and see if we can hang him on that , should he escape on the other charge , " chimed in Stearns . " I have my doubts , " began Chandler , who was growing every moment more wavering and uneasy . " No doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage . " I 'll not sit here and see the king 's authority insulted , and his court treated with such contempt and treasonable defiance ; and I order him instantly in irons  --  chains  --  yes , chains , Mr. Sheriff ! " " You can chain the body , but shall not fetter the tongue , " responded Herriot , in no way dismayed by the threats of his enraged persecutors , or their preparations to confine and torture his person ; " for I will speak , and you shall hear , ye tyrants ! Listen then , ye red-handed assassins ! The blood of your murdered victim has cried up to God for vengeance . The cry has been heard ! the unseen hand has already traced your doom on the wall ! and this day , ay , within this hour , " he continued , glancing through the window to a dark mass of men , who might now be partially discerned drawn up behind the point of woods at the north  --  " ay , within this very hour , that doom shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling tones , after a momentary pause  --  " hark ! do ye hear those signal guns , echoing from post to post , round your beleaguered Babylon ? Do you hear those shouts ? The avengers of blood are even now at your doors . Hear , and tremble ! " As the speaker closed his bold denunciations , he descended from the bench which he had mounted for the purpose , and , advancing to the sheriff and his assistants , now standing mute and doubtful with their hastily procured fetters in their hands , he paused , and stood confronting them with an ironical smile , and with folded arms , in token of his readiness now to submit himself to their hands . But a wonderful change had suddenly come over the whole band of these tory dignitaries . The dark and angry scowls of meditated revenge , and the more fiery expressions of undisguised wrath , which were bent on the dauntless old man during the first part of his denunciations , had , by the time he made his closing announcement , all given way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay hands on him ; for , as the truth of what he said was every moment more strongly confirmed by the increasing tumult without , no one had any thoughts to spare for any but himself . And soon the whole assembly broke from their places , and , in spite of the loud calls of the officers for silence and order , began to cry out in eager inquiries , and run about the room in the utmost confusion and alarm . At this juncture , David Redding , who had been thus far the most reckless and bloodthirsty tory of all , burst into the room , hurriedly exclaiming ,  --  " The people have risen in arms , and are pouring in upon us , by hundreds , from every direction ! In five minutes this house will be surrounded , and we in their power . Let every man look to his own safety ! I shall to mine , " he added , rushing back down to the front door , where , instead of attempting to escape through the back way , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hurra for Congress ! " and , " Down with the British court ! " at the very top of his voice . " I resign my commission , " cried Chandler , jumping up in great trepidation . " Let it be distinctly understood , " he repeated , raising his voice in his anxiety to be heard  --  " yes , let it be distinctly understood , that I have resigned my commission as judge of this court . " " D  --  n him ! what does he mean by that ? " muttered Gale , turning to Patterson . " It means he is going to turn tail , as I always thought he would ,  --  the cursed cowardly traitor ! " replied the latter , gnashing his teeth . " But let him , and that pitiful poltroon of a Redding , go where they please . We will see to matters ourselves . I do n't believe it is any thing more than a mere mob , who will scatter at the first fire . So follow me , Gale ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own shadows , follow me , and I 'll soon know what can be done . " And , while lawyers and suitors were hastily snatching up their papers , and all were making a general rush for the door , in the universal panic which had seized them , the boastful sheriff , attended by his assistants and the tiger-tempered Gale , pushed his way down stairs , shaking his sword over his head , and shouting with all his might ,  --  " To arms ! Every friend to the court and king , to arms ! Stand to your guns there below , guards , and shoot down every rebel that attempts to enter ! " But , when he reached the front entrance , the spectacle which there greeted his eyes seemed to have an instant effect in cooling his military ardor . There , to his dismay , he beheld drawn up , within thirty paces of the door , an organized and well-armed body of more than three hundred men ; while small detachments , constantly arriving , were falling in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole building . And as the discomfited loyalist ran his eye along the line of the broad-breasted and fierce-looking fellows before him , and recognized among them the Huntingtons , the Knights , the Stevenses , the Baileys , the Brighams , the Curtises , and other stanch and leading patriots , from nearly every town bordering on the Connecticut , and saw the determined look and the indignant flashing of their countenances , he at once read not only the entire overthrow of his party in this section of the country , but the individual peril in which he , and his abettors in the massacre , now stood before an outraged and excited populace . " What ails your men , Squire Sheriff ? " cried Barty Burt , now grown to a soldier in the ranks of the assailants , as he pointed tauntingly to the company of tory guards who had been stationed in the yard , but who now , sharing in the general panic , had thrown down their arms , and stood huddled together near the door ; " why do n't they pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  d rebels , ' as I think I heard you order , just now ? " " And if that wo n't ditter do , " exclaimed the well-known voice of Tom Dunning from another part of the ranks , " suppose you ditter read another king 's proclamation at us : no knowing but we might be ditter done for , entirely . " The sheriff waited to hear no more , but hastily retreated into the house , followed by a shout of derisive laughter ; and his place was the next moment occupied by Chandler , who bustled forward to the steps , and , in a flustered , supplicatory manner , asked leave to address his " respected fellow-citizens . " " Short speeches , judge ! " impatiently cried Colonel Carpenter , who seemed , from his position on horseback among the troops and other appearances , to be chief in command  --  " short speeches , if any . We have come here on a business which neither long speeches nor smooth ones will prevent us from executing . " The judge , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , with this doubtful license , he went on to say , that on hearing , in the morning , as he did with astonishment and horror , of the unauthorized proceedings of last night , he had denounced the outrage , in an address at the opening of the court ; and not finding himself supported , he had resigned , and left his seat on the bench . " And now , " he added in conclusion , " being freed from the trammels of my oath of office , which have lately become so painful to me , I feel myself again one of the people , and stand ready to coperate with them in any measure required by the public welfare . " A very faint and scattering shout of applause , in two or three places , mingled with hisses and murmurs in others , was the only response with which this address was received . But even with this equivocal testimony of public feeling towards him , this despicable functionary felt gratified . " I am safe , " said he to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , to watch an opportunity to mingle with the party with whom he was now especially anxious to be seen , and to whom he was ready to say , in the words of the satirist ,  --  " I 'm all submission , what you 'd have me , make me ; The only question is , sirs , will you take me ? " At this moment a sash was thrown up , and the prisoner , Herriot , appeared at a window of the court-room above . " I have been brought up here this morning , " he said , shaking back his gray locks , and raising his stern , solemn voice to a pitch clearly audible to all in the grounds below  --  " I have been brought here from my dungeon to answer to the charge of a foul crime ; and both my accusers and triers , fleeing even before any one appeared to pursue , have left their places , having neither tried nor condemned me . But scorning to follow their example , I now appear , to submit myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power  --  the people . " " Neither will we condemn thee , " cried Knowlton , pursuing the scriptural thought of the other ; " if thy accusers and judges have left thee uncondemned , thou shalt not be condemned by us ; at least not by me , who have long had my opinions of the character of this prosecution . " " As also have I , " responded Captain Wright . " I know something of the witnesses , on whom , it is said , they depended to convict father Herriot ; and I would not hang a dog on their testimony . I move , therefore , that we here pronounce a verdict of acquittal . Who says , ay ? " " Ay ! " promptly responded a dozen voices ; and " Ay ! " the next instant rose in one loud , unanimous shout from the whole multitude . " A thousand thanks to you , my friends , for your generous confidence in my innocence , " returned the old man with emotion ; " and , thank God , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , which has cost me many bitter tears of repentance ; but there is no blood on my hands , and I will now return to my hermit hut , from which they dragged me , there to pray for the success of the good cause in which you are engaged , leaving to you what lesson shall be taught those Hamans who have filled these dungeons with the dying and wounded , now demanding your care . " The effect of the old man 's closing hint was instantly visible on the multitude , who decided by acclamation to act upon it without delay ; and accordingly a score of resolute fellows were detached to proceed to the prisons , release their friends , and fill their places , for the present , with their murderous oppressors . CHAPTER VIII . "  --  right represt , Will heave with the deep earthquake 's fierce unrest , Then fling , with fiery strength , the mountain from its breast . " When the besieged tories , who were now mostly crowded together in the broad space on the lower floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and advancing upon them with levelled muskets to sacrifice them , as they supposed , on the spot , they were seized with a fresh and uncontrollable panic , and made such a tremendous rush for the back entrance , that the only sentry who happened at that moment to be there , was , in spite of all his threats to fire upon them , instantly borne down , or thrust aside , by the living torrent that now burst through the door ; and before a force sufficient to stop them could reach the spot , numbers had escaped into the adjoining fields , where , scattering in different directions , they commenced their disorderly flight , with all the speed which their guilty terrors could lend them . The next moment , however , as the cry that the tories were escaping was raised , a hundred of their most fleet-footed opponents were seen leaping the fences into the fields , and giving chase to the frightened fugitives . A scene , in which the ludicrous , the novel , the wild , and the fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although a strong guard still retained their places round the Court House , who , with the detachment that had entered as we have described , proceeded to take into custody the remaining tories and liberate the imprisoned , yet the main body of the revolutionists joined in the work of hunting down the flying enemy ; those not only who had escaped from the Court House in the manner we have named , but all concerned in the massacre that could be found secreted or lurking about the village ; while the exulting shouts of the victors as they overtook , seized , and brought to the ground the vanquished ; the abject cries of the latter for quarter ; the reports of muskets fired by pursuers over the heads of the pursued , to frighten them to surrender ; the beating of drums , and the loud clamor of mingling voices ,  --  all combined to swell the uproar and confusion of the exciting scene . " How like the ditter deuse these lawyers do scratch grav el ! " exclaimed Tom Dunning , as he singled out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making their way across the fields , in the direction of the river , as if life and death hung on their speed . " Ha ! ha ! " continued the tickled hunter , laughing so immoderately at the novel spectacle , as greatly to impede his own progress  --  " ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Why , I der do n't believe but what they 've got consciences , after all ! for what else could make their ditter drumsticks fly so ? " But although the hunter , in thus indulging his merriment , suffered himself actually to lose ground in the race , yet he had no notion of relinquishing the chase , or losing the game ; for , conscious of his own powers , and thinking lightly of those of the fugitives , he supposed , that , as soon as he chose to exert himself , he could easily make the race a short one , and as easily capture and lead them back in triumph ; and he began to think over the jokes he would crack at their expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next moment showed him , to his vexation , that his inaction , and confidence in his own powers to remedy the consequences of it , had cost him all the anticipated pleasures of his expected victory . For scarcely had he commenced the pursuit in earnest , when the fugitive lawyers reached the bank of the river , and at the very place too , as it provokingly happened , where his own log-canoe chanced to be moored , and hastily leaping into it , they managed with such dexterity and quickness , in handling the oars and cutting the fastenings , as to push off , and get fairly out of the reach of their pursuer , before he could gain the spot ; and his threat to fire at them , if they did not return , and the execution of that threat the next moment , which sent a bullet skipping over the water within a foot of the receding canoe , as he only intended , were all without effect in compelling the return of the panic-struck attorneys . And the balked pursuer had soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in safety on the opposite shore , which he had now no means of gaining , and disappear in the dark pine forest then lining the eastern bank of the Connecticut at this place . " Outwitted , by ditter Judas ! " exclaimed the hunter , in his vexation . " These lawyers , dog ' em ! they have so much of the Old Scratcher in ' em , that they will outdo a fellow at his own trade . However , I 've done the new state some ditter service , I reckon , seeing I 've fairly driven such a precious pair of ' em out of it . " * With this consolatory reflection , he now turned and retraced his steps towards the scene of action . While on his way thither , and soon after passing the rear of the building before described as the head-quarters of the tory leaders , his attention was arrested by the lamentable outcries of some one alternately bawling for help , and begging for mercy ; when , turning to the spot , he there beheld his associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion just named , who , with dress sadly soiled and disordered , was creeping on his hands and knees on the ground , towards his house , which , it appeared , he had nearly gained , when he was overtaken , thrown to the ground , and mounted by his agile and tormenting captor , who was now taking his whimsical revenge for former indignities , by compelling the fallen secretary , through the efficacy of a loaded pistol just wrenched from the latter 's hand , to carry him on his back , in the manner above described . " What the dogs are you ditter doing there , Bart ? " said Dunning , with a broad grin , as he came up and recognized the secretary in such a strange plight and attitude . " O , nothin very desput ; only showing Squire Brush , here , the differ between to-day and yesterday , that 's all , " replied Bart , kicking and spurring , like a boy on some broken-down horse . " Get up , here ! Gee ! whoa , Dobbin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his groaning prisoner  --  " kinder seems to me I heard somebody say , ' tother night , that Bart Burt was n't above a jackass . Wonder if I ai nt above a jackass now ? only his ears may need pulling and stretching a little , " he added , suiting the action to the word . " For God 's sake , my good man , " said Brush , turning imploringly to Dunning , " do relieve me from the clutches of this insatiate imp of hell . Let him shoot me , if he will ; but do n't leave me to be worried , and trod into the mud and splosh , like a dog , by the revengeful young savage . It is more than flesh and blood can bear . " " Well , now , squire , I would n't make such a tearing fuss about this little bit of a walloping , after what 's happened , if I was you , " said Bart . " There was our differ about who was the jackass , and sich like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might as well settle ; and then , again , there was your good-by , yesterday ; but may be I 've done enough to make that square , too . So I do n't care if I let you up , now , seeing as how Mr. Dunning has come to take care of your worship , " added the speaker , springing nimbly a few paces aside , and facing about with presented pistol , as if to keep the other on good behavior . " What can you want with me , sir ? " said the disencumbered secretary to the hunter , after gaining his feet and shaking off the mud from his bedraggled garments . " Ditter considerable , " replied the other . " In the first place , the people want to see you back to the Court House , where you may ditter consider yourself invited to go , under my care . They there may have the first claim on you . " " Well , if I am a prisoner , let us go there , then , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hope of being allowed to escape . " But what do you mean by first claim on me ? " " Well , I ditter mean that I have another , when they get through with you . " " Explain yourself , sir . " " I will . You ditter know that your governor has offered a reward of fifty pounds for the ditter delivery of Ethan Allen for the gallows , under a law got through the York Assembly , principally by one Squire Brush . Well , I ai nt a going to ditter fight old Ethan 's battles ; for he can der do that himself . But you may ditter know , also , that Ethan has offered the same reward for the governor and you . Now , as we are ditter expecting Allen over here , in a few days , I was der thinking , I and Bart , here , might as well ditter deliver you up , and claim the money . " * So saying , the hunter , bidding the prisoner to follow , and Bart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court House ; and , having delivered over his charge to the guard at the prison doors , sallied out into the village in quest of further adventures . Nor was he long in meeting with them . After gaining the street , he soon perceived a gathering and commotion nearly in front of the mansion whose owner he had just taken from the rear ; and , on reaching the spot , he found a crowd collected round a sleigh , filled with gentlemen and ladies , which proved to be that of Peters and his company . It appeared that Haviland , who had remained at his quarters that forenoon , and had thus become apprised of the rising of the people sooner than the mass of his party , had instantly ordered the team to be harnessed , and every thing prepared for an immediate departure , as soon as Peters should arrive . And the latter , who was among those who broke away from the Court House after it was invested , having at length reached the house undiscovered , and adopted such disguise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped into the sleigh , ( which could still be used better than any other vehicle , ) and were rapidly driving from the yard , in an attempt to escape from the town , when they were recognized and detained by a party of the revolutionists . Haviland and Peters had already been seized and taken from the sleigh , and would have instantly been forced off to prison , but for the entreaties and distress of the females , who refused to be conducted back to the house , or even to be separated from their protectors ; Miss Haviland , especially , declaring that if her father must go to prison , she would go with him . This had produced a momentary delay , during which a sharp altercation had arisen , some being for taking the prisoners back to the house , there to be guarded , and others strongly insisting on dragging them off , at once , to jail . The latter , at length , appeared to prevail , and were on the point of forcing the ladies , in spite of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man came pushing his way through the crowd :  --  " For shame ! shame ! my friends , " he cried ; " you surely would not molest innocent and defenceless females . " " I will tell you what it is , Harry Woodburn , " responded one of those who were for proceeding to active measures , " when ladies attempt to stand between murderers and their deserts , they must expect to be molested . " The circumstances of the case were then explained to Woodburn ; when the crowd , who had been irritated by the threats and arrogant behavior of the prisoners , at the outset , again began to cry , " Away with them , women and all , if they will have it so  --  away with them to prison ! " " Men , hear me ! " exclaimed Woodburn , planting himself between the ladies and the angry crowd . " You see this ! " he continued , holding up his bandaged and blood-stained arm : " the wound was received in defending your cause ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole , where I passed the night , for the part I took in the affray . Now , have I not earned the right to be heard ? " " Ay , ay , certainly , Harry ; go on ! " responded several , while the silence of the rest denoted a ready acquiescence in the request . " This , then , is what I would say , " resumed the former . " These ladies , who are doubtless anxious to escape from a scene of strife which may not yet be ended , came from a distance , under the care of this old gentleman , whose imprisonment would not only take from them their protector , but deprive them , probably , of all present means of returning to their home . I propose , therefore , to let him and them depart unmolested . " " If the ladies were all  --  but I do n't know about letting this old fellow off so easily , " said one , exchanging doubtful glances with those around him . " He is both tory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged another , " and who knows but he was among the murderers last night ? " " I have ascertained that he was not among the actors of last night 's outrage , " replied Woodburn . " Well , " rejoined the former , " I know the other was  --  that upper-crust tory by his side there , who was always too proud to wear an old coat and hat , till he thought they might help him in skulking away out of the reach of punishment . " " I know Peters was there , to my cost ; and I had no notion of asking any exemption for him , " returned Woodburn , with bitterness . " But this old gentleman , whatever may be his feelings , has committed none of those acts of violence , for which , only , I understand , our leaders intend to institute trials . Shall we not , then , let him and his ladies proceed , as I proposed ? " Receiving no direct answer to his appeal , the speaker now took two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them a few moments , returned , and announced to Haviland that he was at liberty to depart . How well and wisely had he read the human heart , who penned the scriptural apothegm , " If thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink ; for , in so doing , thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head " ! Haviland , though by nature an honorable man , had yet suffered himself to enter deeply into the personal animosities of Peters towards Woodburn , which , with his political and aristocratic prejudices , had caused him to think of the young man only with feelings of contempt and bitterness . And when he witnessed the noble conduct of the latter , first in rescuing his daughter from the flood , and now so generously interposing in his behalf , it produced that struggle between pride and conscience , whose operation is so forcibly expressed by the sacred writer just quoted . And , although he could bring himself to acknowledge his obligations only by a formal and constrained bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flitting over his disturbed countenance , as he now returned to the sleigh , plainly told how effectually , and with what punished feelings , his enmity had been silenced . But not so with his singleminded and quickly and justly appreciating daughter . She had no prejudices to combat , no pride to conquer ; and she , therefore , witnessed each new act of her deliverer with as much pleasure as gratitude  --  feelings which sought expression in no parade of words , it is true , but in the more meaning and eloquent language of the kindly tone and sweetly-beaming countenance . And , in her low-murmured , " Thank you  --  thank you for all , " as Woodburn handed her to her seat in the vehicle , he felt a thousand fold repaid for all he had ventured for her sake ; while the speaking smile , with which she the next moment turned to him , and nodded her adieu , left an impress on his heart destined never to be effaced . While this was transpiring , Peters , who had been standing apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without uttering a word , except to bid Haviland go on without him , contrived , without exciting any suspicion of his design , to work himself by degrees to the outer edge of the crowd , in the direction in which the team was about to pass . And , as the sleigh , which was now put in motion , approached him , he made a sudden feint of running the opposite way ; when , as the crowd were confusedly springing forward to head him , he quickly tacked about , leaped into the sleigh , and , snatching the reins and whip from Haviland 's hands , applied the lash so furiously , that the frantic horses bounded forward with a speed which carried the receding vehicle more than fifty yards on its course , before the balked and confused throng could recover themselves , and fairly comprehend what had happened . But the sharp , bitter shout of execrations , mingled with cries for immediate pursuit , which now rose from the agitated multitude , proclaimed at once their hatred of the haughty loyalist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice . And the next instant , a half dozen swift runners , led on by Dunning , shot out from the crowd , in the eager chase , like so many arrows speeding to the mark . And , notwithstanding the supposed advantages of horses over men in a race , and notwithstanding the increased speed with which the fugitive team thundered along over the half-bare and uneven ground , the pursued had scarcely reached the end of a furlong , before the fleet and determined hunter , still in advance of his companions , gained the side of the sleigh , leaped up , pounced upon his cringing victim , and brought him headlong to the ground , leaving Haviland to seize the relinquished reins , check the horses as he best could , and proceed on his way unmolested . " There ! you ditter sneak of a runaway tory . You will now go , I der rather calculate , where there 's no ditter petticoats to shelter you , " said Dunning , raising the chapfallen Peters by the collar , and drawing him along back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he and his friend Brush were then forced away , in no very gentle manner , to join their fellow-prisoners , in the same dungeon where the victims of their last night 's outrage were so unfeelingly and so unwisely immured . A detailed description of the various scenes which here succeeded , in the winding up of this local revolution , as it may justly be denominated , would occupy too much space for the limits of our tale , without evolving any further incident , having much bearing on the destinies of those of its personages whose fortunes we design to follow . We will now , therefore , sum up , in a few words , the doings of the triumphant party , and , with a comment or two of our own , dismiss the subject . In the first place , all the supposed actors and abettors of the massacre within reach were seized and secured , excepting Redding and one or two others of a like character , who , by their activity in assisting to apprehend the fugitive comrades whom they had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , had purchased an exemption from punishment , and excepting also the Janus-faced Chandler , who , by his duplicity , had contributed more than any other man , perhaps , towards this catastrophe , but who now contrived to make even his iniquities count in his favor. * After this was effected , the victors , all but enough to constitute a safe guard , laid aside their arms , and resolved themselves into a sort of civil convention , to take measures for the trial of the prisoners by some mode , which , in the absence of all proper authorities , should answer for a legal process . And , as the first step in the matter , a jury of inquest , to sit on the dead body of French , was ordered , and a committee appointed to see to the empanelling of impartial men , and collect evidence and conduct the investigations to be had before them . All this being duly accomplished , and the jury bringing in a verdict that the deceased came to his death by the discharges of muskets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therein enumerated , all the latter , thus designated as the murderers of the unfortunate young man , were taken , and , under the authority of another order or decree of the convention , marched off , under a strong guard , to the jail in Northampton , some forty or fifty miles into the interior of Massachusetts , and there confined , to be tried for their lives at the next court that should be holden in the county where the offence was committed ; while a less deeply implicated portion of the prisoners were put under bonds to appear at the court to answer to the charges of manslaughter and assault , or made to undergo other punishments and restrictions immediately imposed by the convention. * The actors in the outrage , who comprised nearly all the leading members of the British party in that part of the Grants lying east of the mountains , having been thus summarily disposed of , the people , now taking the government into their own hands , and acting in primitive assembly , proceeded to reorganize the county , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , of their own principles , to adopt measures to reduce to submission or drive away the remaining loyalists of the county , and , finally , to declare themselves alike independent of the government of Great Britain and of New York . Thus terminated this memorable outbreak , which acquired additional importance from the fact , that it resulted in the entire subversion of British authority in this , the only section among the Green Mountains where it ever gained a foothold . And not small the praise , which , in view of the circumstances , should be awarded to the hardy spirits by whom this miniature revolution was achieved ; for , so great was the power of patronage exercised by this court , and the influence of those enjoying office or immunities under it ,  --  a great majority of whom were stanch , and the rest tacit , supporters of the royal cause ,  --  that , till the occurrence of this sanguinary affair , it is evident the former had but little hope of being able to overthrow this petty local dynasty without assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform us , indeed , that but for the massacre of Westminster , it would have been difficult to predict whether the opening of the revolution , a few months afterwards , would have found , in the section in question , a whig or tory majority predominating . But that act of murder and madness , which the loyalists here , with the strange infatuation attending their doings almost every where else at the time , seemed destined to commit , as if to hasten their own overthrow , settled their doom . " It was the electric flame to fire the hearts Of a true people . " And while it opened the eyes of hundreds of the hitherto acquiescent , it armed the opposing with an energy and determination in their cause , which at once became irresistible ; and when the war-note was subsequently sounded by such patriots as Benjamin Carpenter and his associates , it found a ready response in every glen and corner of the surrounding country , and the hardy settlers seized their arms , and , with the cry of French and vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ticonderoga , and Bunker Hill . We are aware that some historians have classed this affair among the difficulties and skirmishes growing out of what has usually been termed the New York controversy , while others have treated the subject in a manner which shows them to be doubtful in what light to place the transaction ; and , for that reason apparently , they have slid over the matter in those general and ambiguous terms so often and reprehensibly indulged in by writers at a loss about facts , to conceal their own ignorance , or to avoid the responsibility of deciding the point at issue . But a careful examination of the subject has led us to the conclusion , that the affair in question had little or no connection , in reality , with the New York controversy , but that it was wholly of a revolutionary character . No resistance to the authority of New York had ever been previously made in this section of the Grants ; nor did the opposers of this court , in any of their remonstrances , or other proceedings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their doings which can be fairly construed into an objection to the jurisdiction of that province , as such ; or any otherwise than that it had , up to that time , refused to adopt the resolves and recommendations of the Continental Congress . On the contrary , all their arguments are based on their duty and determination of joining their revolting brethren in the other colonies , and , consequently , of resisting the longer continuance of British authority among them . Such , indeed , is the ground taken by Dr. Jones , in his minute and authentic account of the occurrence , in which he was , as we have made him in our illustrations , an actor . And even the inscription on the tombstone of the ill-fated French , written when the transaction , and all its attendant circumstances , were fresh in the minds of all , sufficiently proves , if further proof were necessary , that the version we have given of the affair is identical with the one generally understood and received at the time . " * It was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space we have devoted in attempting to illustrate it ; for it becomes invested with a new interest and new importance , when it is considered , as we think it must be , that here was enacted the first scene of the great drama that followed ; here was shed the first blood , and here fell the first martyr , of the American revolution . * Knights , who , unlike his companion , was no loyalist , appears to have become infected with the panic that had seized his loyal associates , in common with the whole court party ; and , though he had no cause for alarm , fled with those who escaped from the Court House , on this memorable occasion . It is probable , that owing to his supposed interest in the continuance of the court , and consequent unwillingness to coperate in the measures on foot to overthrow it , he was purposely kept in ignorance of the movements of the revolutionists , and therefore taken wholly by surprise when the storm burst . At all events , his speedy return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent promotion to the bench , abundantly shows that he no less enjoyed the confidence of the American party than his two namesakes , and , we believe , relatives , whom we have named as present among the assailants , and who were afterwards officers in our revolutionary forces . An aged and distinguished early settler , to whom the author is indebted for many of the incidents he has here delineated , thus writes in relation to the particular one in question :  --  " I have heard Judge Samuel Knights , who , as chief justice , presided in the Supreme Court from 1791 to 1793 , describe the trepidation that seized them , when , after the massacre , and on the rising of the surrounding country , they came to learn the excited state of the populace . He related how he and another member of the bar ( Stearns , I think , who was afterwards attorney secretary of Nova Scotia ) hurried down to the river , and finding there a boat , ( such as was used in those times for carrying seines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were frequent on both sides the river , below the Great Falls , ) they paddled themselves across , and lay all day under a log in the pine forest opposite the town ; and , when night came , went to Parson Fessenden 's , at Walpole , and obtained a horse , so that , by riding and tying , they got out of the country till the storm blew over , when Knights returned to Brattleborough. " * Crean Brush , who procured himself to be elected from this county to the New York legislature , for several years , was believed to be the main mover of the act of outlawry against Ethan Allen and others . He certainly , as chairman of the committee on the subject , reported , and recommended the passage of , that notorious measure . See Slade 's State Papers. * As the acts of this notorious personage , whose character we have been at considerable pains to ascertain , and accordingly portray , will have no further connection with our story , we can not forbear , before dismissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subsequent career , and singular end . Although , by his facility of accommodating his political principles to those of the majority , and his alacrity of tacking about , and mounting , like a squirrel on a wheel , so as to be found rising to the top in every revolution or counter-revolution of public sentiment , he thus adroitly managed to get appointed to some offices of minor importance , under the new state government , yet , becoming every year better and better understood , and consequently more and more distrusted , he finally sunk into utter insignificance and contempt ; and , falling into pecuniary embarrassments , brought about by a long course of secret fraud in selling wild lands , of which he had no titles , he was confined for debt in the very building in which the massacre occurred ; where , as if by the retribution of Heaven for the part he once there acted , he soon died , unhonored and unlamented . And , what is still more remarkable , his remains were strangely destined to be denied even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having attached the body , and the neighbors , from a notion that prevailed at that time , supposing , that by removing the body for a public burial they would make themselves liable for his debts , suffered it to remain till it became too offensive to be endured , when , at the dark hour of midnight , a few individuals went silently to the prison , got the putrid mass into some rough box , and drew it on the ground to the fence of the neighboring burial-ground ; and , having dug a horizontal trench under the fence , and a deep pit on the other side , pushed through and buried up all that remained of the once noted Chief Justice Chandler . An old , decayed oak stump , still standing , is the only object that marks the site of his grave . * Among the different kinds of sentences imposed on the class of offenders here last named , was one dooming Judge Sabin to the limits of his own farm , and making it lawful for any one catching him off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public indignation against this inveterate loyalist and supposed secret abettor of the massacre , that he was narrowly watched for the chance of executing the penalty . An aged revolutionist , from whom this fact was derived , stated that he had lain many a Sunday , with a loaded rifle , in the woods near the judge 's farm lines , to see if he would not , when coming out to salt his sheep , stray over his limits . But the old fellow , he said , was always too wary for him . * The inscription here alluded to , which we insert as supporting our position rather than as affording any new antiquarian curiosity to many readers , is verbatim as follows :  --  " In memory of William French , son of Mr. Nathaniel French , Who was shot at Westminster March ye 13th 1775 by the hands of Cruel Ministerial tools of George ye 3d , in the Court House , at 11 o'clock at night , in the 22d year of his age . " Here William French his Body lies For murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tory crew Tha with a bawl his head shot threw For liberty and his country 's good He lost his life and dearest blood . " CHAPTER IX . " They sank till their fair land became a sty Stygian with moral darkness . Heart and mind Debased  --  dark passions rose , and with red eye , Rushed to their revel ; until Freedom , as he enters the town of Guilford , on the southern confines of Vermont , will soon be struck with the peculiar appearance of many things around him . Few or no traces of a primitive forest are to be seen , while its place is supplied by a heavy second growth of woods , sixty or seventy years old , in the midst of which the remains of old enclosures and other indications of former habitations are not unfrequently observable . On the cleared farms , also , may often be seen three or four different clumps of aged fruit-trees , scattered about in the nooks and corners of the lot , and sometimes extending into the woods , in such a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted under any thing like the present arrangements of the farm and its buildings . Near these old relics of former orchards may likewise generally be perceived some levelled spot , remains of old chimneys , traces of cellars , or other marks of dwellings long since removed , or fallen to decay . These , with many other peculiarities , give to the whole town an aspect nowhere else to be seen in Vermont , nor even , perhaps , in any part of New England . And if the traveller be of a fanciful turn , he will associate the place with the idea of some deserted country , resettled by a new race of men ; and even if he be a mere matter-of-fact man , he can not fail to perceive that the town must have been originally tenanted under a division of lands and an order of things quite different from those now existing . And either of these suppositions would be far better justified by the facts than most of the speculations of modern tourists made in their flying visits through the land , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this town , of which , for the purpose of insuring a full understanding of some scenes here about to be described , we must be permitted to give a brief outline . The events connected with the first settlement of the town of Guilford , which afterwards became so noted as the stronghold of toryism and adherence to the New York supremacy , form a curious anomaly even in the anomalous history of Vermont . The territory comprising this township appears to have been granted , as early as 1754 , to a company of about fifty persons , by a charter , which , unlike that of any other town , empowered the proprietors , in express terms , to govern themselves and regulate the concerns of their little community , by such laws as the majority should be pleased to enact , without being made amenable to any power under heaven , save that which might be exercised by the British Parliament . Being thus constituted a band of freemen and legislators , at the outset , they soon took possession of their chartered piece of wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and assumed the title of an independent republic , which their charter , in fact , created , any control of the Parliament of England being as little to be apprehended , in their secluded retreat among the wilds of the Green Mountains , as that of the Great Mogul of Tartary . And as novel as was the idea of a republic at that early period , when " the divine right of kings " to govern all men was as little questioned as the divine right of Satan to afflict the pious Job of old , this enterprising little band of settlers , for many years , appear to have well sustained the character they had assumed , not only by carrying out , in all their public doings , that essential principle of a republic which makes the will of the majority supreme , but by the simplicity of their tastes and habits in private life , and their beautiful exemplification of the great law of love , that can only be fulfilled towards our neighbors by according to them equal rights and privileges with ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail , and the independent character of our little republic was soon , in a good degree , forfeited ; and that , too , by the very means , it would seem , which had been taken to make it flourish and increase . It had been one of the conditions of the charter that every grantee should become an actual settler , and , within five years , clear and cultivate five acres of land , for every fifty purchased . And in accordance with this cunning policy for insuring the actual and rapid settlement of the place , the township had been laid out in fifty and one hundred acre lots , except the governor 's right of five hundred acres , which his excellency of New Hampshire , in granting Vermont lands , never forgot to reserve for his own use , in every township , but which the proprietors generally contrived , as in this instance , to have set off on the highest mountain in town , considering it but respectful and fitting , as they used waggishly to observe , that so elevated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the effect of this policy , together with the low prices at which the lands were put , and other inducements held out to draw in settlers , soon became visible in the rapid increase of the population , and consequent improvement of the town . So unexampled in these new settlements was its progress , indeed , in both the particulars we have just named , that within twenty years from the time when the sound of the axe was first heard in its woody limits , the inhabitants were found to number nearly three thousand ; while fields were every where opened in the wilderness , and buildings raised in such neighborly contiguity , that the whole town presented the appearance of a continuous village . It is not very surprising , therefore , that , through such an influx of settlers , coming from all parts of the country , and including many interested and active partisans of the York jurisdiction , a majority should soon be obtained , who were induced to depart from the views of the first settlers respecting the independence of their community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which prevailed in all the towns around them . And accordingly we find them , at their annual meeting in 1772 , voting the district of Guilford , as they termed it , to belong to the county of Cumberland and province of New York , and thereupon proceeding to reorganize the town , agreeably to the laws of that province . This change , however , does not appear to have been followed by any material alteration of their internal polity , or to have been productive of any great civil discord , till about the time of the opening of the American revolution ; when the town became the prey of contending factions , of so fierce and lawless a character as to convert this once Arcadian abode of virtue , simplicity , and rural happiness , into a theatre of violence and social disorganization , which never , perhaps , found a parallel within the limits of order-loving New England . Sometimes the York party and tories ,  --  for , in this town , it so happened that the two were identical ,  --  and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were in the ascendant ; while scenes of such disorder and outrage were constantly occurring between the belligerent parties , that his honor , Judge Lynch , for many years , appears to have been not the least among the potentates of this notable republic . Nor was order restored to the ill-starred town till after the close of the war ; when every refractory spirit , whether tory or Yorker , was punished or awed into submission by the fiery energy of the iron-heeled Ethan Allen , who , then being relieved from the pursuit of more important game , came thundering down upon the town with his hundred Green Mountain Boys , proclaiming to the disaffected , with demonstrations which they well knew how to interpret , that the peaceable and instant submission of the place to the new authorities of the land should alone save it from being " made as desolate as the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . " It was a dark and gloomy day in April , and the sleety storm was beating , in fitful gusts , against the broken and creaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering of an old , dilapidated log-house , standing by the road-side , in one of the thousand little dales , which , with their corresponding hills , so beautifully diversify the face of the town we have been describing . But as comfortless as this miserable hut was , and as poor and insufficient a protection from the elements as it afforded , even for the healthy and robust , it was now the only shelter of a sick and destitute woman , the widowed mother of Harry Woodburn . The hand of her son 's persecutor , as it not unfrequently is seen to occur in the history of human oppression , was destined to fall even more heavily on her than on him for whom the blow was designed . The minion officer , selected by Peters for the purpose , had no sooner received his warrants , than , faithful to the cruel instructions of his employer , he had repaired post-haste to the residence of the absent Woodburn , of which he was authorized to take possession , and , with insults and abuse , rudely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in despite of all her entreaties for mercy , or delay till her son should return , or even for one day , to give her an opportunity to find some shelter for her now houseless head . He then , with the aid of the three or four ruffian assistants enlisted to accompany him , threw all the furniture out of the windows or doors into the mud and snow beneath , where the whole , consisting of crockery and glasses , now half broken by the fall , and beds , linen , kettles , chairs , tables , and the like , soon lay piled promiscuously together . Having thus driven the terrified and distressed woman from the comfortable abode which had formerly cost her and her deceased husband so many years of toil to erect and furnish , and having , to add to the wrong , either injured or destroyed the greater part of her little stock of goods , by the wanton or careless manner in which they had been removed , this brutal officer next proceeded to the barn , and by virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last remaining property of the wronged and ruined young man , which , after intrusting the present keeping and defence of the premises to two of his band , he drove away to another part of the town , to be sold at the post , as soon as the forms of the law , respecting notice of the sale , could be complied with . The poor widow , half distracted at being thus suddenly bereft of house and home , spent the remainder of the day in vainly endeavoring to procure some tenement into which she could remove with her furniture , or with so much of it as might yet be saved . On the next day , however , as a last resort , she obtained and accepted the present use of the deserted cabin we have described , situated but a short distance from the house from which she had been ejected . And into this comfortless place , after several days of incessant toil and exposure , she succeeded in getting her damaged furniture , but not till her exertions , combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malady , which , though not at first very threatening , became , each subsequent day , more and more alarmingly developed in her overtasked system . In this situation she was found by her son , who , being entirely ignorant that any judgment had passed against him , and , consequently , little dreaming what was taking place at home , had remained at Westminster nearly a week after the massacre , attending the public meetings , which , as we have before intimated , followed that event ; when he returned to Guilford , and , with feelings bordering on desperation , learned the extent of his misfortunes . But the bitterness of his feelings , as great as it was , at being stripped of all his property through such a series of wrongs , soon became wholly merged in anxiety and grief for his sick and sorrow-stricken parent , and in the exasperating thought that her sickness and suffering proceeded from the same source with his other injuries . And close and unremitting had been his attentions to her , until the day previous to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when he had been induced to leave for Brattleborough , or other more distant towns , to try to obtain money to redeem his stock , which was now about to be sold , and which was worth more than double the amount , as he had recently ascertained , of the execution on which it had been seized . On the morning after his departure , she had become so much worse that she was compelled to take to her bed , and despatch her only attendant for a doctor . That attendant was Barty Burt , who had come down from Westminster with Woodburn , and had been engaged by the latter to remain with his mother during his absence . Having thus glanced over the events which had occurred previously to the opening of this new scene of our story , we will now return to the point we left to make the digression . Slowly , to the suffering invalid , rolled the sad hours away , as , with thick and labored breathing , she lay tossing upon her rude couch , standing behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occasionally she would raise her fevered head from the pillow , and seem to listen to catch the sounds of expected footsteps , and her languid eye would turn anxiously towards the door ; when , after thus exerting her senses in vain a few moments , she would sink back upon her bed , with a long-drawn , sighing groan , which told alike of disappointment and bodily anguish . At length , however , footsteps were heard approaching , the door opened , and Barty Burt stilly glided into the apartment , and approached the bedside of the sufferer . " You have come at last , then , " said she , lifting her dim eyes to meet the face of the other . " It seemed as if you never would arrive . But where is the doctor ? " " He will be on afore long , mistress ; but I 've had a time o n't in getting round , I tell ye ! " replied Bart . " I am very sorry , if you have had any unexpected trouble on my account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befallen you ? " " O , nothin , " answered the former  --  " nothin , at least , but what I was willing to bear for Harry 's sake , who invited me home here till I got business , or for yours , who let me be . Though to be stopped and bothered , when one is going for the doctor , is worse than I ever thought of humans before . But it shows their character  --  dum ' em ! " " Did they really stop you , knowing your errand ? " " Yes , that they did , mistress . As I was going by the tavern , a mile or two up the road yonder , three or four of them torified Yorkers came out , and told me I could n't go for the doctor , nor nowhere else , without a pass from one of their committee . So I had to post back more than half way , to Squire Ashcrafts , and there had to be questioned a long while before he would give me any pass at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's , he said he wanted a pass , too ; for he darsent go to see a whig woman without one , which I must go and get him from Squire Evans , another committee man . Well , finding there was no other way to get him started , I went , feeling all the time just between crying and fighting . And as soon as I got the bit of paper into the doctor 's hands , I put for home , leaving him fixing to come horseback , which is the reason of my getting here first . " " These are , indeed , dreadful times , " sighed the widow . " But they can not always remain ; for , though God may chastise us a while for our sins , yet the rods of the oppressors will surely be broken . " " I 'd rather see their necks broken , " responded Bart , dryly . " When we left Westminster , I thought , as much as could be , the tories were all used up ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as sarcy and spiteful as a nest of yellow jackets , that , like them , have been routed in one place and got fixed in another . Blast their picturs , how I hate ' em ! " " That is not right , Barty . You should love your enemies . Evil wishes , towards those who injure us , are both wicked and foolish . " " I do n't understand , mistress . " " Why , Barty , to love is to be happy , as far as circumstances will permit ; and to hate is but to feel disquieted and miserable . So when we keep the command to love our enemies , we obtain a reward which often outbalances the evil they inflict on us , or , at least , enables us the better to bear it ; while , on the contrary , when we hate those who injure us , we receive a double evil  --  the wrong they inflict , and the unhappiness created by the exercise of our revengeful passions . Did you ever think of that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinder that way , sometimes ; but I ca n't understand it , no how . " " With your means of moral instruction , perhaps it is not surprising that you should not ; so I will drop the subject , and ask you if you heard any thing of Harry , while you were gone . " " No , mistress ; did n't see nobody that knew he was gone . " " O , when will he return ? He has now been gone two long , long days ; but I must not repine . " " Why , mistress , I kinder guess he 'll be along to-night , unless so be he 's met with considerable bother to get the money , or somethin . He must be here afore to-morrow afternoon , when the sale is , you know . " " Yes , I knew the sale was delayed till town meeting day , which is to-morrow , I believe ; though for what reason they put it off I never heard . Harry felt so bitter about the affair , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any allusions to the subject . But there appeared to be something about it that I did n't understand . Why did n't the sale take place last week , as first appointed ? " " For as good a reason as ever a tory officer had for doing any thing  --  or not doing any thing , may be , I should say  --  in the world , " replied Bart , with a knowing look . " What was it ? " " Why , when the day come , he could n't find any cattle to sell . " " What had become of them ? " " Well , mistress , I do n't know how much it is best to say about that , considering . But I should n't be surprised , " continued the speaker , while a sly , roguish expression stole over his usually grave , impenetrable countenance , " that is , not much surprised , if it turned out that two or three of Harry 's friends got the cattle out of the barn where they were keeping , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , near the top of Governor 's Mountain , and then backed up hay enough to keep ' em a spell ; while the company took turns , for a few days , in going a hunting over the mountain , so as to come round , once in a while , to fodder and see to the creters , for which old Bug-Horn paid in milk , on the spot . Now , mind , I have n't said I knew this was so , but was only kinder guessing at it ; for all that 's really known about it  --  that is , out loud  --  is , that Fitch and his men found the cattle up there ; and the way they found them was by following up the trail made by the hay straws that some one , after a while , grew careless enough to scatter from his back-load along the path . " " Did my son have any hand in this affair ? " asked the widow , anxiously . " No , mistress ; Harry is so kinder notional about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess some thought  --  it was n't best to say any thing to him about the plan till his cattle were fairly saved . " " I am glad to hear it . I should rather see him deprived of his last penny than do a questionable act . We should never do wrong because others have done wrong to us . " " There is a differ between your think and mine , I see , mistress . If they did wrong in getting away Harry 's cattle so , as every body knows they did , then the tother of that  --  getting them back again  --  must be right . But you need n't tell any body what I 've said , mistress ; for they might , perhaps , have Bill Piper and me up , and try to make barglary out of it  --  or simony , I do n't know but the law folks would call it  --  the breaking into a log-barn . But hush ! Somebody 's coming . It is the doctor . " Doctor Soper , who now entered , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , and high pretensions to skill and knowledge in his profession ; though , in fact , he was but a quack , and of that most dangerous class , too , who dip into books rather to acquire learned terms than to study principles , and who , consequently , as often as otherwise , are found " doctoring to a name , " which chance has suggested , but which has little connection with the case which is engaging their attention . " Ah , how do you find yourself , madam ? " said the doctor , throwing off his dripping overcoat , and drawing up a chair towards the head of the patient 's bed . " Very ill , doctor , " replied the other . " Not so much on account of the loss of strength , as yet , as the deeply-seated pain in the chest , which , for the last twenty-four hours , has caused me great suffering ; though , for the last half hour , not so severe . " " Indeed , madam ! Well , now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnostics . Your wrist , madam , if you please , " said the doctor , proceeding to feel the pulse of his patient , with an air intended for a very professional one . " Tense  --  frequent  --  this pulse of yours , madam ; showing great irritability . Your tongue , now . Ay  --  rubric  --  dry and streaked ; usual prognostics of neuralgy . Pretty much made up my mind about your complaint coming along , madam , having learned from your lad here something of your troubles and fright on losing your home . And I was right , I see . It is neuralgy  --  decidedly a neuralgy . " " What is that , doctor ? " " Always happy to explain , madam , so as to bring my meaning within the comprehension of common minds . Neuralgy , madam , is a derangement of the nerves . Your disease , precisely . " " Why , I am not at all nervous , sir , " responded the patient , looking up in surprise . " You may not think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And then , doctor , I have an intense inward fever , " persisted the other , " and my lungs seem much affected . " " Nervous fever , madam , " returned the doctor , too wise to be instructed , " and lungs sympathetically affected  --  that 's all . Quiet and strengthen the nerves , and all will be right in a short time . I shall prescribe Radix Rhei , in small doses , assafoetida , quinine , and brandy bitters of my own preparing . These , with nourishing food , as soon as you can bear it , will speedily restore you , madam . " Having dealt out the prescribed medicines , calculated rather to increase than check the poor woman 's malady , which was inflammation of the lungs , the self-satisfied doctor , swelling with his own importance , departed , leaving his patient now to contend with two evils , instead of one  --  a dangerous disease , and the more dangerous effects of a quack 's prescription . " What time is it now , Barty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she awoke from a troubled slumber , into which she had fallen after the doctor 's departure . " Why , do n't know exactly , mistress , " answered Bart , rousing himself from the dreamy abstraction in which he had been indulging , as he sat looking into the decaying fire  --  " do n't know , exactly ; but it has got a considerable piece into the night . About nine o'clock , guess ; may be more . " " Nine o'clock at night , and Harry not yet returned ! " sighed the invalid . " Well , well , I will complain no more . " " Can I do any thing for you , mistress ? " asked her untutored attendant , touched at the sad and despondent tone of the other . " You may bring me in a pitcher of fresh , cold water , with some ice in it , if you will , Barty , " replied the former . " It seems to me as if this inward heat was consuming my vitals , since I took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , then disappeared with his pitcher , and , in a few moments , returned with it filled with water and several pieces of clear , pure ice , which were heard dashing against its sides . " How grateful ! " said the sick woman , as she took from her lips the wooden cup which had been filled and handed her by her attendant , and from which she had eagerly drained nearly a pint of the cooling beverage at a single draught . " There , now , set the pitcher on the table yonder , and raise the largest piece of ice up in sight , so , as I lie here , I can look at it . The mere sight of it seems to do me good . " Another dreary hour rolled away in silence , which was broken only by the restless motions and occasional suppressed groans of the invalid within , and the wailing of the winds and the pattering of the rain against the windows without , when a slow , heavy step was heard coming up to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " faintly exclaimed the sick woman , partially raising herself in bed , and gazing eagerly towards the door ; while her pain-contracted features were , for the moment , smoothed by the smile of affection and pleasure that now broke over them , like the faint electric illumining of a weeping cloud . The quick ears of the afflicted mother had not deceived her . The next instant Harry Woodburn entered the room , and , with a gloomy , abstracted air , proceeded to divest himself of his wet coat and muddy boots , without uttering a word , or bestowing any thing more than a casual glance towards the bed , to which he supposed his mother had just retired , as was usual with her , about this hour , and not suspecting that she was more indisposed than when he left her . But as he now turned and approached the fire , his eyes fell , for the first time , on her haggard features , when , stopping short , with a look of surprise and lively concern , he exclaimed ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Harry , I am very , very sick ; and O , how glad I am that you are come . " For several moments he said nothing , but stood gazing at her with the distressed and stupefied air of one struggling to shut out painful apprehensions . At length , however , he aroused himself , and made a few hasty inquiries relative to her disorder , and what had been done for her ; and , having been informed of all that had occurred in his absence , and now appearing fully to comprehend the danger of her situation , he sat down by her bedside , when his lip soon began to quiver , and his strong bosom heave with tumultuous emotions , while bitter tears flowed down his manly cheeks , as this crowning blow to his misfortunes was brought home to his feelings . " Had they been content , " he said , struggling hard , but vainly , to master his feelings  --  " had they but been content with robbing me of my property , I could have borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of murdering my only parent , is more than I can endure . God help me , or I shall go mad ! " " Do not  --  do not be so distressed , my son , " said the mother , deeply touched at this exhibition of feeling , accompanied as it was with such a proof of filial affection in her idolized son , and anxious to soothe and divert his mind . " I shall recover , if God wills it . Let us , then , bow in resignation to his dispensations , and not disturb our feelings with unavailing regrets . Come , my dear son , cheer up , and tell me how you have succeeded in the object of your journey . " " No success , " he replied , gloomily . " No ; I have been running from town to town since yesterday morning , and have not been able to obtain a single dollar . So the cattle must go to satisfy the stolen judgment of that insatiable Peters . " At this moment the conversation was arrested by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customary walk in had been pronounced by Woodburn , the door was gently opened , and a tall , robust young man , with a frank , open countenance , hesitatingly entered . " Good evening , folks , " he said , in a suppressed tone . " I did n't exactly know what to do about calling to-night , on account of disturbing your mother , Harry ; but wishing to know whether you had got home , and hear the news if you had , I thought I would venture to rap . What is going on up country ? " " Nothing very new , I believe , Mr. Piper . " " Well , what luck about the money , Harry ? " " None  --  none whatever . " " I am sorry for that . No , I wo n't lie , now ; I am not sorry , Harry ; and I will tell you why , hereafter . All I wanted to know to-night was , whether you had got the wherewith to redeem the cattle , to-morrow being the last chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was aware of it , friend Piper ; and many thanks for the interest you take in my misfortunes . But I can not redeem the stock . It must go : nothing more can be done to save it . " " Well , I do n't quite know about that , Harry . I do n't know about standing by , and seeing a neighbor 's property snatched away from him on such smuggled papers . But let that turn as it may , the subject brings to mind a certain circumstance , which I will name , after first asking a question ; and that is , whether Peters has not been hung ? " " Peters hung ? Why , no ; the prisoners are not to be tried till the new court we have been appointing at Westminster holds its first session , some weeks hence . But why do you ask so strange a question ? " " Well , Harry , by way of answer , I will tell you the circumstance I alluded to , which was this : Last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend the meeting to-morrow , seeing we are expecting a hard tussle , I met a man that I could have sworn was John Peters , if I had not known the fellow was close in Northampton jail ; and as it was , I could swear it was his exact shape and appearance . Well , knowing it could not be him bodily , it soon struck me that they had been hanging off a parcel of them there , Peters among the rest , and that this was his ghost , kinder hovering about here to see if his affairs were fixed up to his liking . " " Your notion of a ghost , Piper , if you are serious about it , is all nonsense , " said Woodburn , who had listened with lively interest to the singular story of the other . " Yes , that is nonsense ; but it has brought to mind a rumor which reached Brattleborough yesterday , that all the prisoners at Northampton had been liberated by habeas corpus from the chief justice of New York , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , if you saw Peters here last night , as I begin to fear , the story must have been true . And he appears here , at this time , for the double purpose of seeing , as you said , whether his orders have been carried into execution , and of being present to use his corrupting influence at town meeting to-morrow . " " Well , Harry , that 's about what I meant ; for I saw him sure enough , and knew , at once , that we had got to have him against us at town meeting , which makes our case rather doubtful . We felt quite sure , before this , of being able to carry a majority ; and , in that case , some of us counted on getting a vote to rescue your cattle , or , at least , putting them into the hands of our sheriff. * And either of these ways would be the means , we thought , of saving your property , and , at the same time , be a plaguy sight more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now there 's no saying how it will go . I expect hot work there to-morrow ; and that minds me to ask if you heard whether help from the towns up the river is coming down to join us on the occasion ? " " Yes , Tom Dunning came down with me , and he informed me that several others were on the way . " " Good . Tom himself , in matter of managing , will be almost a match for Peters , whether ghost or no ghost . But where is he ? " " He stopped back at the Liberty Pole tavern . " " All happens right , then . I am bound there myself . We are going to hold a little meeting at the Pole , after folks are to bed , to make up our plans and arrangements for to-morrow . You ca n't go , I suppose . " " No , I must not think of it . " " But you will be at town meeting to-morrow ? " " Quite uncertain . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the next , my feelings are in such a state of bitterness , that I dare hardly trust myself in such a scene , lest I should do that which would cost me months of painful regret . No , Piper , in mercy to a desperate man , let me keep away . But here is Bart to go , if he choose , both to-night and to-morrow . " " Bart is agreeable to that , if Harry and mistress do n't want him , " said the person just named , rousing up from the long-silent reverie in which he had been sitting before the fire , apparently inattentive to the conversation of the others , which had been carried on in a low tone , at the opposite side of the room . " So here goes for the Pole to-night , and meeting to-morrow , " he added , taking down his gun from the pegs on which it was suspended , near the ceiling above . " What do you want to do with that , Bart ? " asked Woodburn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Bart . " If our coats had all been lined in that fashion , the first night there , at Westminster , we need n't have had to attend French 's funeral , nor you been troubled about the papers they got out when you was in jail . " " Bravo , Bart . You see that my coat is not wanting of that kind of lining , do n't you ? " said Piper , throwing open his great-coat and displaying a rifle , as the two now left the house together , on their way to the rendezvous of the liberty party . * During the period of anarchy , change , and discord , in this distracted town , each of the belligerent parties had their sheriff , or constable , and other town officers , and would yield obedience to the officers of their opponents only on compulsion , though the officers of the majority were not generally resisted , except , perhaps , in matters purely political . CHAPTER X. " Agreed in nothing , but t ' abolish , Subvert , extirpate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new state of Vermont ! The victory is won , and the town is redeemed ! hurrah ! hurrah ! " Such were the sounds that rose and rung among the rafters of the crowded old log Town House of Guilford , as , for the first time for several years , a New Statesman and whig moderator was declared elected by a majority of the suffrages of the freemen . The next moment , the door was seen vomiting forth its throng of excited victors , who , as they reached the open air , joined the crowd eagerly awaiting the result at the entrance , and , with them , renewed and reiterated the glad shout , till the distant hills responded in loud echoes to the roar of the stentorian voices of the triumphant party . After a fortnight 's active exertions on the part of each of the opposing parties , in mustering and drilling their respective forces , preparatory to the approaching contest , in which both were equally confident of victory , though too sensible of the danger of losing it to remit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon . After spending several hours in a disorderly and wrangling debate , in relation to the qualification of voters , which at last resulted in rejecting the test required by the charter ,  --  that of being a freeholder ,  --  and in permitting every resident to vote , the ballots had been taken for moderator , or chairman of the meeting , when , as much to the dismay of the tories as the joy of their opponents , it was found that victory , in a majority of three , had declared for the latter , who thereupon testified their exultation in the uproarious manner we have described . After a while , the noise and tumult within the house was suddenly hushed , and the clear , deliberate tones of some new speaker addressing the assembly , became audible to those without the building ; while the attent and eager looks of those who stood listening in the crowded pass-way , plainly evinced that some important and exciting subject had been introduced . At length the voice ceased , and a new commotion ensued within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in there now , Piper ? " asked one standing near the door , as the young man came elbowing his way out of the house . " Why , they are on Colonel Carpenter 's resolution . Have n't none of you here been in there to hear it ? " said Piper , turning to the querist and other political associates , standing near by . " No ; what is it about ? " inquired several of the latter , with interest . " The York Rule , " answered Piper , with an animated air . " The colonel offered a resolve that we shake off the York government now , henceforth and forever . And this he backed with a speech which would have done you good to hear . He went into them , I tell you , like a thousand of brick ; and not a single tory tongue of ' em all dare wag in trying to answer it . They are now beginning to vote on the resolution , which , if carried , the colonel intends to follow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and branch . " At this moment , they were joined by Tom Dunning , who came hurrying out of the house , and , taking Piper aside , said ,  --  " Do you ditter understand the plan of what 's going on in there , Piper , and the importance to you here , in Guilford , of carrying it ? " " Not fully , perhaps , " answered Piper . " I did n't have a chance to talk with Carpenter and the other committee before this move was made , and do n't understand why they did not urge on the election of the other town officers , as usual , after making a moderator , instead of getting up these resolutions . " " Der well , this is it ; they are afraid to ditter try any of the town officers on so slim a majority , lest the tory candidates should have got some of our voters under their thumbs , by way of debts or other obligations , which they will der make use of to get their votes for them personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That is well thought of , " responded Piper . " They have indeed got the screws on some I know of , and would so threaten ' em with prosecutions , that I 'm fearful they would get ' em , sure enough . But what 's the prospect about the resolutions ? " " Well , the colonel thinks , after what has ditter taken place at Westminster , that we can carry them ; and if we can , it will pretty effectually tie ' em up , even if they got their officers . But we der do n't mean to let ' em . For the plan is , that as soon as we 've ditter carried the resolves , to dissolve the meeting without making any town officers at all , which we think can be carried by the same voters , and which if we can ditter do it , with the resolves , will kill Fitch and his papers as dead as a ditter dum smelt , and so save the property of Harry , and that of all others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclaimed Piper , with animation ; " I see through the move now ; and we 'll go at ' em , and whip ' em out on it ; and then if Fitch do n't give up the cattle , we 'll make him , by the course we thought of taking , last night , in case we failed electing our officers to-day , or of getting any vote on Harry 's affair . " " Yes ; but we must be ditter lively in getting in the voters . You and Bart go in and vote ; and I will beat about the bush , here , for more help , before I go in ; for as they have just admitted some to vote on a twenty hours ' residence ,  --  as I can ditter swear they did ,  --  I intend to vote myself , this time , and have all those from my way der do the same , " said the hunter , bustling off to muster his forces . Just as Dunning , who had collected a band of voters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house at the head of his recruits , an outcry was raised within ; and , the next moment , Bart Burt was seen hastily emerging from the crowd , followed by the kicks and cudgel-blows of the tories , through whom he had been compelled , to save himself from a rougher handling , to run the gauntlet to the door . " What , in the name of der Tophet , is the meaning of that ditter treatment , ye shameless lubbers ? " sternly demanded the hunter , shaking his stout beech cane over the heads of the foremost of his opponents . " He deserves it ! He is an impostor ! He tried to get in his vote when he ai nt over eighteen years old ! " shouted several tory voices in reply . " They let me vote last time without a word , " said Bart , facing round upon his foes , with a grin of spite and pain ; " and so they did John Stubbs and Jo Snelling , then and now too ; and they ai nt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will der have you in , and vote too , if the ditter divil stands at the door ! " fiercely exclaimed the hunter . " Let them prove he ai nt one and twenty , " said one of the same party . " He was n't born in these parts , nor does he know himself , I understand , where he was born , or how old he is ; and until they can prove him under age , I motion , blow high or blow low , that we make them receive his vote . " " Ay , ay , he shall vote ! he shall vote ! " shouted a dozen others . " They have admitted others under age , and they shall him , whether or no ! Let ' em live up to their own rules ! Sauce for goose is sauce for gander , the world over ; they shall take him ! they shall take him ! " A hasty consultation was now held , and a plan of operations for compelling the opposite party to admit Bart to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan , Bart , who was short and light of weight , was mounted astride the brawny shoulders of Dunning , while Piper , with his burly frame , was placed in front , with a stiff cudgel in hand , to act as the battering-ram or entering wedge to the crowd of tories , who had closed up the way with their bodies , obviously to prevent Bart , or any other whig , indeed , from again entering till the ballot-box was turned . Eight or ten stout , resolute young men were then selected and formed in column to bring up the rear , and give such an impetus to those before them as to force them forward in spite of all opposing obstacles , till they reached the voters ' stand in the house . " Ditter ready , boys ? " now cried Dunning , firmly grasping Bart 's legs , and glancing over his shoulders to his lusty little band of backers . " All ready there , behind , boys ? Then go ahead , as if ditter Belzebub kicked ye an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like a ram for a butting match , made a lunge head foremost into the recoiling ranks of the tories , and , borne irresistibly forward by the force of the rushing phalanx behind , overthrew , prostrated , and shoved aside , all before him , till the whole column gained the interior , and came to a halt before the ballot-box . " I protest against that fellow 's voting ! " exclaimed Peters , approaching the stand as Bart , from his lofty seat on Dunning 's shoulders , was about to put in his vote , which was a simple yea , written on a slip of paper , and handed up to him by some one stationed near the box to furnish the unsupplied . " I protest against such a glaring outrage ! He is under age , and was very properly driven from the house . " " Prove it ! prove it ! " shouted several of Bart 's friends . " You ca n't do it , " cried another , " and if you could , two of your party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is a fact ; deny it if you can ! " " In with it , Bart ! " said Dunning , bending down to give the other a chance . " Yes , in with it ; for he shall vote ! " responded the rest . " He shall not vote ! " vociferated Peters ; " and if he attempts to do it , I 'll blow his brains out ! " he added , pulling out and levelling a pistol . Quick as thought , Bart threw open his over-coat , and , drawing from beneath it the light , short gun there concealed , cocked , and brought it to his shoulder ; while the threatening weapon of his foe was seen flying to a distant part of the room , from a sudden blow of Piper 's cudgel , and its disarmed and nonplused owner slinking away out of the range of the suspicious-looking barrel still kept aimed at his head . Amidst the loud cries of order , and the heated vociferations of both parties , now raised to condemn or defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others of their company , who had not voted , now hastily deposited their votes , and retired unmolested . Although the portion of the revolutionary party , whose movements we have been more particularly describing , acting on the supposed and probably actual frauds of their opponents , had thus secured Bart 's vote , and the votes of two or three others , perhaps equally illegal , yet the event soon showed that their policy in so doing was a mistaken one , and calculated to defeat the very object they intended to promote ; for , as will always be the result where one party attempts to adopt the wrongful measures of their opponents , the tories , now armed with the fact that they had detected the other party in a wrong more glaring , because more public , than any they had perpetrated , made use of the advantage with such effect as to bring over several , intending to support the resolutions , to change their intention , and go against them . And , in addition to this , by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground lost by the questionable votes forced upon them , they brought forward every minor they could find approximating the size of a man , and boldly demanded their admittance to the polls . An opposition was , indeed , attempted to a measure so manifestly illegal , by the leaders of the other party ; but they had become too much disarmed by the acts of their own partisans to produce any sensible effect ; and their voices were soon drowned by the clamors of the tories , who now admitted the boys by acclamation . This , as will be anticipated , decided the contest . On counting the votes , the resolution was found to have been rejected by more than a dozen majority  --  a victory which the tories failed not to announce by shouts of exultation , which out-thundered those of their opponents in their late short-lived triumph . The friends of freedom , being thus caught in their own trap , or , at least , worsted by the indiscretion of their own friends , now pretty much yielded the contest ; while the victorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electing their town officers , passing denunciatory and loyal resolutions , and continuing their discussions unopposed , till it was nearly dark , when the meeting broke up in noisy confusion . " Oyez ! Oyez ! Oyez ! " was now heard crying the well-known voice of Constable Fitch , as he mounted a stump in the yard ; while near by stood a gang of his confederates , hedging in Woodburn 's cow and oxen , which the former had found the means to have on the spot , in readiness for the sale , the moment the assembly broke up . " Oyez ! A cow and oxen , taken on execution , now about to be sold to the highest bidder , gentlemen . We will take the oxen first ; as fine a yoke as ever drew plough . Who will give us the first bid ? Sha n't dwell three minutes . Who bids , I say ? One pound bid , gentlemen ; one pound ten ! one pound ten ! and on Mr. Peters . Who bids higher ? " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not , as he intended , take the friends of Woodburn by surprise . They had withdrawn from the meeting a short time before it dissolved , and met for consultation in the rear of the house , where , having arranged their plan of operations , they stood awaiting for the proper time to carry it into execution . " There ! " exclaimed Dunning , as the constable began to cry the sale in the manner we have just described  --  " there , that is ditter Fitch ; he is at it ! All ready , boys ? You , Piper and Bart , with your vials of oil of vitriol in your sleeves , ready to uncork on to their ditter tails ? " " Ay , ay ! " " And your ditter snuff to throw into their eyes ? " " Yes , that , too . " " And your guns ditter cocked , and safe under your coats , you that are to fire ? " " Ay , all right and ready  --  lead on ! " " Der well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up on different sides of the crowd ; and mind , do n't let off your guns till the creatures begin to ditter grow uneasy and der snort and blow . " While Fitch was repeating the bids he had received for the oxen , and was about to knock them off to the highest bidder , which still chanced to be Peters , he was suddenly told to hold on , by several persons who had just at that moment made their appearance in different parts of the crowd , and who expressed their wish to bid , as soon as they could get up to examine the cattle . Owing to the duskiness , the faces of the new comers did not seem to be recognized by the tories , who unsuspectingly opened and admitted them to the stand . Quickly availing themselves of the opportunity , the former , among the foremost of whom were Piper and Bart , now crowded eagerly round the cattle , and , after rapidly passing their hands over the cow and each of the oxen a moment , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time , however , was allowed them to do either ; for the cattle , all at once , became unaccountably restless , at first backing and wheeling about in their confined space , and then wildly tossing up their heads , snuffing , and assuming the startled and furious appearance generally exhibited by this class of animals when about to make a desperate effort to break away . At this critical juncture , the fierce flashes and stunning reports of a half dozen muskets burst over the heads of the startled and astonished company from various points on the outer edge of the crowd ; and the next instant the already maddened cattle , with loud snorts , leaping over or trampling down all in their way , broke through the living hedge of tories around them , and bounded off , with their tails thrown aloft , and bellowing in wild affright , in different directions , towards the woods , leaving the amazed and broken crowd jostling and pitching about with exclamations of surprise , groans of pain , volleys of oaths , and shouts of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the work of the cursed rebels ! " exclaimed Peters , the first to rally and comprehend the affair . " Fitch ! " he added , pointing after the runaway cattle , " where the devil are your wits , that you do n't order a pursuit ? " " Yes , pursue and bring ' em back , instantly ! " screamed the constable , awaking from the stupor and confusion of ideas into which he seemed to have been thrown by the strange and unexpected occurrence . " Yes , ' t is an unlawful rescue  --  it 's a conspiracy ! bring back the cattle ! seize the offenders , every one of ' em ! in the king 's name I command ye . " Obedient to the call , the obsequious tories instantly rallied for the pursuit , and , breaking off into three distinct bands , eagerly set forward in the different directions taken by the fugitive cattle , then just disappearing over the distant swells , or in the borders of the woods . Dunning , Piper and Bart , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuspected in the darkness and confusion , stood in the throng , keenly watching the result of their plan , no sooner heard the expected order of pursuit given , than , separating , like their opponents , and each joining a different band of the pursuers , they sprang in before the rest , and , by their superior alacrity and speed , soon succeeded in taking the lead , and finally in completely distancing all others in the promiscuous chase . The tories , now soon wholly losing sight of their fleet , and , as they still supposed , trusty guides in the pursuit , became , in a short time , confused and at fault respecting the courses to be taken ; and , after hallooing and running about the woods and pastures at random , nearly an hour , without discovering any traces either of the lost cattle or the missing pursuers , at length came straggling back to the Town House , and , by way of saving their own credit , reported to Fitch , Peters , and the small party remaining there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cattle , and would soon be in with them , or that the creatures had been headed , and were on their way back , in another direction . On this , the company waited another hour ; when , neither the cattle nor the expected pursuers appearing , they began to suspect something amiss ; and the inquiries and investigations then put afoot soon resulted in the mortifying conviction , that the cattle had been overtaken and driven off by the same persons who previously had caused them to break away . Prompted by the enraged Peters , Fitch then offered a reward for the recovery of the cattle and the detection of those who had abducted them ; when the company separated , to resume the search the next day . But although this was done , and the country scoured in every direction for several days , yet the search proved wholly fruitless . Not one of the cattle was to be found . Nor were the actors in the transaction , with any certainty , identified , though the absence of Piper and Bart , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected and marked for punishment , when they should again appear abroad . CHAPTER XI . " Vital spark of heavenly flame ! Quit , O quit this mortal frame ! Trembling , hoping , lingering , flying , O the pain , the bliss of dying ! Cease , fond nature ! cease thy strife , And let me languish into life . " Perhaps the nearest and dearest , as well as the most interesting , tie of consanguity , is that existing between mother and son . Who has not witnessed the unfailing and unconquerable strength of a mother 's love for the son of her heart and her vows , cleaving to its object through prosperity and through adversity , through honor and through shame , with a constancy which never wavers ? And what son , especially after the thoughtlessness of youth has given place to the reflection of maturer years , and experience has taught him the insincerity and selfishness of the world  --  what son has not turned back and lingered , with the most grateful emotions , over the pleasing memories of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the deep , pure , and undying nature of a mother 's love ; realized more and more the priceless value of a sentiment so fraught with moral beauty , so exalted , so proof against all those considerations of self , those temptations of interest , before which all other ties are seen to give way , and , while thus realizing , found his yearning bosom oftener and oftener prompting him to exclaim with the poet ,  --  " Where'er I roam , whatever realms I see , My heart , untravelled , fondly turns to thee . " While the scenes of disorder and tumult we last described , and the similar ones that followed , were being enacted among the belligerent parties of this misgoverned town , the dutiful and sorrowing Woodburn was continuing his attendance on his sick mother , from whose bedside no call of business or of pleasure was suffered for a single hour to lure him . And well might he have done so , aside even from the dictates of filial duty ; for she was a woman not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her he had been mainly indebted for all that was good and elevated in his character . She had emigrated with her husband to this town , at an early period of its settlement , from the vicinity of Boston , where the latter had become so much straitened in his pecuniary circumstances , in consequence of being surety for an improvident and luckless brother , that he was induced , with the hope of bettering his fortunes , to gather up the poor remnant of his property , and , with it , remove to the New Hampshire Grant 's , at that time the Eldorado most in vogue among those seeking new countries . Here , having purchased one of the best tracts of land in the place , he commenced the slow and laborious process of clearing up a new farm . And this Herculean task , which may well be considered the work of a man 's life , he had , after years of incessant toil and privation , nearly succeeded in accomplishing , and begun to catch glimpses of easier and brighter days ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property to his wife and son , an only child , then drawing towards manhood . And nobly had that son discharged the double duty which now devolved upon him ,  --  that of becoming the stay and comforter of his widowed mother , and the sole manager of the farm , their only dependence . For , while discharging his filial duties in such a manner as to gain him the reputation of being a pattern of a son , he not only kept good , but , by his industry and enterprise , even improved , the property to which he had thus succeeded . And he was fast surmounting the difficulties of his situation , and making hopeful advances towards a competence , when , in an evil hour , his flourishing little establishment attracted the coveting eye of the unconscionable Peters , who , owning an adjoining farm , which would be rendered much more salable by being united with Woodburn 's , undertook , at first , to wheedle the young man into a sale , or rather an exchange of his valuable farm for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful titles . But , finding himself wholly mistaken in the character of the person whom he thus endeavored to overreach , and consequently failing in his attempt , he next began to think of the quibbles of the law , as the means of accomplishing his purpose . And having discovered some slight irregularity in Woodburn 's deed , to begin upon , he then resorted to a trick quite fashionable among the corrupt speculators of those unsettled times  --  that of purchasing from some unprincipled person , ready , for a small sum , to enter into the fraud , a deed of prior date to that of the one to be defeated , with descriptions of premises and references to suit the purchaser , the worthless assumed owner neither knowing nor caring what his deed might convey . Having secretly procured a prior deed of Woodburn 's farm in this manner , Peters could see but one obstacle now in the way of his success , which was the town records , embracing that of Woodburn 's deed . How was this to be disposed of ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under political pretences , occurred to him ; and the result was , that part of the town record soon disappeared . Peters then commenced an action against Woodburn , to eject him from his farm , the course and consequences of which are already known to the reader . Spring had now come ; but its bland and balmy breath brought no relief to the suffering widow . From the hour she had been compelled to take to her bed , her disease , though sometimes lulled , or raging less fiercely than at other times , had never for a moment loosened its tenacious grasp . And although her cheerful words , and meek , uncomplaining looks , had often misled her anxious son , or , at least , prevented him from despairing of her recovery , yet the dry , parched , red tongue , the daily return of the bright hectic spot , and the tense , hurrying and unvarying beat of the strained pulses , might have told him how certainly and rapidly the work of destruction was going on at the citadel of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now to follow . It was a calm and pleasant evening towards the close of April , and the low-descending sun was shedding the mellow light of his parting beams over the joyful face of reanimating nature . The invalid , during all the fore part of the day , had suffered greatly from pain  --  that general and undefinable distress which is so frequently found to be the precursor of approaching dissolution . To this had succeeded a sort of lethargic sleep , from which it was not easy to arouse her , so that she could be made to take any notice of what was passing around her . But now she awoke , clear and collected ; and , glancing round the room , with a sort of pensive animation , met and answered the inquiring and solicitious look of her son with an affectionate smile . Presently , her wandering eye rested on some objects of the landscape , glimpses of which she had caught through one of the small , patched windows of the room , and she faintly observed ,  --  " How pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a thoughtful pause , " could you take out that window before me ? I feel a desire to look out once more on the green earth , and breathe the sweet air of spring . " " Yes , mother , " said the other , approaching the bed , with a surprised and hesitating air ; " yes , I could easily do it , I presume ; but would it be quite safe for you to be exposed to the evening air ? " " Yes , Harry ; the time for the exercise of such cares is gone by . You need fear no more for me , now , my son , " she replied , in accents of tender sadness . The son then , with a doubtful and troubled look , proceeded in silence to comply with the unexpected request ; after which , he gently raised the head of the invalid , who , thereupon , gazed long and thoughtfully on the variegated landscape , which lay spread out in tranquil beauty beneath her dimly-kindling eye . " How beautiful ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy rapture  --  " beautiful of itself , but more beautiful as the type of man 's destiny after his body has mingled with the dust . The scene we here behold , my son , exhibits the resurrection of nature . In summer the foliage and blossom expands , in autumn the fruit is perfected , and in winter the visible part falls back to earth and perishes , leaving the hidden seed or germ to spring forth again into another life . So it has been , so it will be , with me . I have had my brief summer of life , my still briefer autumn , and now my winter of death is at hand , from which I trust to come forth into the more glorious spring of life eternal . " " Do not talk thus , mother , " responded the son , greatly moved  --  " do not talk thus : you distress me . I trust you may yet recover . You certainly look brighter this evening ; and I hope another day will find you still better . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I appear brighter , it is but the brightness of the last flashing up of the expiring taper . I feel that my time is come ; and thanks to Him who has prepared my heart to hail the event as a relief and a blessing . " " O my mother , my mother , how can I part with you ? " " My longer sojourn here , my son , would be of little benefit to others  --  even to you : my blessing is worth more than would be my further abiding : come and receive it . " The weeping son then knelt down at the bedside , and the mother , laying her hand on his head , pronounced her blessing and a brief prayer for his earthly prosperity and eternal happiness . For several minutes , the son , overcome by his emotions , remained kneeling , with his head , on which still languidly rested the emaciated hand of the dying mother , bowed upon the bedclothes , while the latter , sinking back exhausted on her pillow , closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She soon , however , aroused herself , and observed ,  --  " My work is not yet quite done . I have a little more to say before the scene closes . " " Say on , mother , " said the other , making an effort to calm himself , as he now rose , and , taking a seat near , wistfully rivetted his gaze on her pallid face . " If you are , indeed , about to leave me forever , withhold nothing you feel inclined to communicate ; for your dying counsels , my dear parent , will be received with pleasure and gratitude , and treasured up in heart and memory , as the last , best lesson of one to whom I am under such countless obligations . " " You have ever acted the part of a dutiful son towards me , Harry ; and that is always a mother 's best reward for her care and affection for her offspring . And I know not that I have aught now to say to you , by way of counsel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practise upon the principles I have endeavored to inculcate , and be to others what you have been to me . But it was not of that I intended to speak . I was about to name some facts connected with our early reverses , which , it being always unpleasant to recur to those scenes of trial , I think I have never told you , but which , I thought , it might , perhaps , some day avail you something to know . You have heard us casually speak , I presume , of your uncle Charles Woodburn ? " " I have , mother . " " And you may also be aware that , through his misconduct , we were suddenly reduced from the easy competence we once enjoyed to poverty and distress . " " I have so understood it , but never knew what kind of misconduct it was that led to our misfortunes . " " It was imprudence in speculations , and profligacy in living , and not dishonesty , or any intentional wrong to us , as I ever believed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , would listen to no extenuation , but drove him from his presence with bitter reproaches and accusations . But your uncle , before leaving the country , as he soon after did , sought an interview with me ; and , after deploring the misfortunes he had brought on my family as well as himself , solemnly pledged himself that he would , some day or other , more than compensate me or mine for all the losses he had occasioned us . And this is the circumstance I wished to tell you ; for , though we never received any certain information of him , yet something tells me he still is alive , and has the means and disposition to fulfil his promise to you whenever you may find him , and he recognize you as the representative of his brother 's family , of whose location here he probably was never apprised . I would suggest to you , therefore , the expediency of trying to trace him out , and , if you succeed in doing so , make yourself and your situation known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result with Providence . " " Your suggestion , mother , shall not pass from me unheeded , nor shall I fail , in due time , to act upon it ; but , at present , I know not if the last tie that binds me to this place should be severed  --  I know not but our down-trodden country may have the first claim on my services . Ever since the startling news of the massacre of Lexington reached us , a sense of the duty of devoting myself to her defence has pressed heavily and constantly on my mind . And but for the stronger claim which nature and my own feelings have given you , in your situation , to my presence and attention , I might , before this , have been with my shouldered musket on my way to the scene of action . But even in the event of your death , I should hesitate to obey the call if I knew I must do it without your sanction . " " I thank you , my son , for your affectionate deference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having conjectured what might be your feelings at this dark hour of our country 's peril , I was about to speak to you on the subject . Yes , Harry , if you think duty calls you to the field , in defence of a cause so just and righteous as ours , go . You will be under the care of the same Providence there as elsewhere . Go , and with a dying mother 's blessing , and a prayer of faith for your safety and success , do battle manfully for the Heaven-favored side , till the oppressor be cast down , and the oppressed go free . " With a heart swelling with conflicting emotions , the young man looked up to reply , when his words were arrested on his lips , by the evident change that the countenance of the other had suddenly undergone . The unnatural animation , which she had exhibited during the conversation , had faded away . She lay listless and exhausted , with her eyes nearly closed , and her lips slightly moving in secret prayer . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she at length audibly uttered . " But I am not to wait , " she continued , in a firmer tone , after a short pause . " The final moment is at hand ! Farewell , earth ! farewell , my son ! May Heaven 's blessings rest on you  --  on all , and be the offences of all forgiven . Ah ! the light of day is fading ; but O , that brighter light which opens ! those angel forms , with smiling faces , which beckon me away ! Ready ! I come !  --  I come ! " And thus ,  --  "  --  blessing and blest , In death she went smiling away To the heavenly bosom of rest . " CHAPTER XII . " Whene'er your case can be no worse , The desperate is the wiser course . " Late in the afternoon , several days subsequent to the melancholy event described in the preceding chapter , a mingled company , of some dozens of persons , including several town officials , were seen assembling at the Tory Tavern , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the holding of a magistrates ' court , to try an offender who had that morning been arrested , and who now , in custody of Constable Fitch , was demurely sitting on a rude bench under an open window of the room in which the trial was to be had , and in which the two justices composing the court had already seated themselves at a table , in readiness , on their part , to commence proceedings . That offender was no other than our humble friend , Barty Burt , who had lucklessly fallen into one of the snares which had been set for him and his suspected companions , round the country , in consequence of the part they had acted in spiriting away , in so strange a manner , Woodburn 's cattle , when about to be sold on town meeting day . He and Piper , during the night following that affair , after meeting Dunning at an appointed place , and giving him charge of the cattle , which had been successfully pursued and there collected , to be driven out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left town in different directions , to avoid the arrest they anticipated , in case they remained ; Piper going down the river in quest of some temporary employment till the storm blew over , and Bart setting off on a fishing excursion to Marlboro ' Pond , situated in a then nearly unsettled section , about ten miles to the north . Here Bart had pursued his sport unmolested , many days , occasionally going out to Brattleborough to sell his fish and buy provisions , and considering himself in this secluded situation perfectly safe from any search which might be made for him by the officers of Guilford . But the reward offered by the constable for the apprehension of the offenders , who had been soon pretty well identified , had put all the tories in the town and vicinity on the watch ; and the result was , that Bart had been seen , traced to his retreat , seized and brought back for trial . Although Bart 's general demeanor seemed to show a perfect indifference to the fate that now threatened him , yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indifference , he noted every movement of those into whose power he had fallen , and the restlesness he exhibited when their eyes were not upon him , gave token of no little inward perturbation . And it was not without reason that his apprehensions were excited ; he knew the character and disposition of the two tory justices whom he saw taking their seats to try him , and he rightly judged that he need not expect either mercy or justice at their hands . He had also detected one of the constable 's minions , who had been despatched to the woods for the purpose , stealing slyly round into the horseshed , on his return , with a half dozen formidable looking green beech rods ; and he was at no loss to decide for whose back they were intended , or by whose ruthless hand they were to be applied . " You ca n't go that , Bart , " he mentally exclaimed . " You must get away ; so now put your best contrivances in motion , for I tell you it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And as hopeless as , to all appearance , was any attempt to escape his captors , who stood round him with loaded pistols in their hands , Bart yet confidently counted on being able , in some way or other , to slip through their fingers , and avoid the fearful punishment which he knew was in store for him , if he remained many hours longer in their hands . To effect this , he looked for no aid from others ; for experience had taught him the value of self-reliance . The whole life of this singular being , indeed , had been one which was peculiarly calculated to throw him on his own resources , sharpen his wits , and render him fertile in expedients . He had been a foundling , and knew no more of his parentage than a young ostrich , that springs from the deserted egg in the sand . He was left , when an infant , at the door of a poor mechanic , in Boston , by the name of Burt , and by him transferred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finder , with the pet name of Barty , given him by his nurse . Here he was kept till he was four or five years old , when he was given to the Shakers , from whom he ran away at ten or twelve . From that time , the poor friendless boy became a wanderer through the interior country , generally remaining but a few months in a place , being driven from each successive home by misusage , or for want of profitable work for him to do , or , what was still oftener the case , perhaps , for playing off some trick to avenge the fancied or real insults he had received , till , after having been kicked about the world like a foot-ball , cheated , abused , cowed in feeling , and become , in consequence , abject , uncouth and singular in manner and appearance , he at length reached the situation in the family of the haughty loyalist where we found him . While Bart was thus uneasily revolving the matter of his present concern in his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , the constable was called aside by those who had undertaken to manage the prosecution , for the purpose of holding with them a consultation , the purport of which , though carried on in a low tone , and at some distance , was soon gathered by the quick and practised ears of the prisoner . It appeared that the trial was being delayed in consequence of the absence of Peters , who was an important witness , and who unaccountably failed to make his appearance . And it being feared that he might have been waylaid , and detained on the road , by some band of the other party , to prevent him from testifying , as all knew he was anxious to do , it was settled that Fitch should start immediately in search of him to the house which he usually made his temporary quarters in another part of the town . Accordingly the constable , after putting the prisoner in charge of two stout fellows who were in his interest , with orders to guard him closely , and shoot him down the instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission after Peters . Bart 's countenance brightened when he saw the savage officer depart , for he believed the absence of the latter would greatly increase his chances of escape ; and in spite of all the threats he had received of being shot , he resolved to improve that absence in making the attempt , though the manner of doing so yet remained to be decided , by the circumstances which might occur . In the mean time a trotting-match had been got up in the road in front of the tavern , by a small party who had been boasting of the speed and other qualities of their horses ; and it being now understood that the trial was to be delayed till the constable 's return , the whole company left the house , and went out to the road to witness the performance . Bart 's keepers not being able , where they stood , to see and hear what was going on very distinctly , and being equally desirous with the rest to get a favorable stand for that purpose , after renewing the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him along with them , and entered the line of spectators extended along the road . After a few trials among those who began the contest , several new competitors led on their horses and entered the lists . By this time most of the company began to take a lively interest in the performance , taking sides , and betting on the success of the different horses now put into the contest . The prisoner having , by this time , through dint of persevering in good humor and sociability , in return for the abusive epithets , by which all his attempts to converse were , for a while , received , succeeded , in a great measure , in disarming his keepers of the stern reserve and jealous distrust they at first exhibited towards him , he was soon permitted to talk freely , and offer , unrebuked , his opinions of the success of the various horses about to make a trial , which his previous observation and acquaintance with many of them , made during his residence in town the preceding year , enabled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily fulfilled in several instances , and especially in one in which his most rigid keeper had been saved from losing , in a bet , which would have been made but for his timely cautions , Bart at length found himself on such a footing of confidence and good will with those whom he wished to conciliate , that he thought it would now do to commence operations for himself . " I do n't think much of such trotting , myself , " said Bart , carelessly , as one of the contests afoot had just terminated ; " but there is one animal I notice here to-day , I should like to bet on . " " What horse is that ? " asked the keeper above designated . " That dapple gray mare hitched over there in the corner of the cow-yard yonder , " replied Bart , pointing to a small , longtailed pony , whose shabby coat of shedding and neglected hair greatly disguised the remarkable make of her limbs and other indications of strength and activity . " That creature ! " exclaimed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than a good-sized sheep . You may bet if you want to , and lose ; for there 's not a horse on the ground but would beat her . " " Well , for all that , Mr. Sturges , " responded Bart , banteringly , " I 'll not take back what I 've said about the nag . And to prove my earnest , I 'll make you an offer ; I 'll bet my gun , which you saw me hand the landlord for safe keeping when they brought me in  --  I 'll bet my gun against your hat , I 'll take that creature and out-trot you , with any hoss you may choose to bring on . " " Done ! " exclaimed Sturges ; " but you are contriving this up for a chance to get away , you scamp . " " What should I want to get away for ? " I haint done nothin ; and there 's a witness here that will swear to a thing or two for me , when the trial comes on , guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride by my side , with a loaded pistol in your hand ? " " Yes , and that ai nt all ; I 'll put a bullet through you the instant you make the least move to be off . " " I 'm agreed to that . " " Well , but will they let you take the colt for the match ? " " Guess so ; I 'll venture to take her . The boy that rode her here has cleared out down to the brook a fishing ; but I know him , and think he would n't object . " " Who owns the colt ? " " Old Turner did , last year , when I lived with him ; and the boy is from that way , and borrowed her , likely . " " Then you have rode her , have you ? " asked Sturges , doubtfully . " Never rid her with any other hoss , but know she can trot faster than any thing you can find here ; so you may as well back out at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not by a jug-full , sir ; but I must look me up a horse , and fix matters a little first ; and then , if it is thought safe for me to trust you to ride , I 'll go it , " returned the other , with some hesitation . Sturges then stepped aside with the other keeper , and , after consulting with him a few moments , went forward and announced to the company the bet offered by the prisoner , and his own intention of accepting it , and indulging the fellow in a trial , if they thought best , and would assist in measures to prevent the possibility of his escape . The proposal was received with shouts of laughter by the tories ; and eager for the fun they expected to see in so queer a contest , they agreed to be answerable for the prisoner 's safety , and urged on the performance . The two keepers , now calling in others to take charge of the prisoner , while they made their preparations , proceeded to arrange the company on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals along the whole line of the course , commencing back about two hundred yards south of the tavern , and extending to the sign-post , which , standing on the edge of the beaten path in front of the house , had been agreed on as the goal . And not satisfied with this precaution , they then procured four long , heavy , spruce poles , and , extending them from fence to fence across the enclosed road leading from the tavern yard northward , formed a barricade five or six feet high , which , with the strong , high fences on each side of the whole course , except at the starting-point , where no danger was apprehended , seemed to cut off the prisoner , even without being guarded , from all possible chance to escape on horseback , as it was most feared he would do , after being allowed control of the reins . " There , Bixby ! " exclaimed Sturges , exultingly turning to his fellow-keeper , as they completed the barricade across the road beyond the goal  --  " there ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any of the fences on the way , as to that matter . So the little rebel will hardly escape us by running his horse from the ground , I fancy . But we must look out that he do n't jump off at the end of the race , or before , and cut into the fields . You may therefore station yourself somewhere between this and the sign-post ; and if he attempts to leap from his horse and run , as we fetch up here , shoot him down as you would a dog , and charge the blame to me or Fitch ; either of us will bear it . " Having thus arranged every thing to his satisfaction , Sturges , ordering the pony we have described , and the horse he had selected for himself , to be brought on , then took charge of his prisoner and rival , and conducted him , with great show of mock dignity , and amidst a noisy and jeering troop of attendants , to the ground marked off for the place of starting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stationed across the road to guard against the prisoner 's escape in that direction . Bart , in the mean time , seemed perfectly indifferent to all these precautions of the tories , as well as the gibes and laughter which constantly greeted him on the way , and , on reaching the prescribed limit , quietly dropped down on the grass among the company , and awaited the coming of the horses with the greatest unconcern . The latter soon made their appearance on the ground , and were immediately led up and presented to their respective riders . " Lightfoot ! " exclaimed Bart , springing up to receive his chosen pony ; " do you know me , Lightfoot ? " The animal instantly pricked up her ears , and responded by a sort of low , chuckling whinny , by rubbing her nose against his arm , and by other demonstrations of recognition and pleasure , which plainly showed the two to have been old acquaintances and friends . Bart then , stripping off the saddle and handing it to a boy to be carried back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pony , and , after patting her on her neck , repeated certain words in her ear , which seemed to produce the instant effect of arousing her spirit , and making her restless and impatient for a start . After going through these and other ceremonies of the kind , which seemed greatly to amuse the company , he mounted , reined up , and announced himself ready for the signal . After another delay , to indulge the company in the renewed shouts of laughter which were called forth by the ludicrous contrast now presented in the appearance of the oddly-matched competitors , as the diminutive and shabby-looking prisoner sat awkwardly mounted on his no less diminutive and shabby pony , by the side of the portly Sturges and his large and finely-built horse , the signal was given , and the parties set forth amidst the encouraging hurrahs of the crowd . Their progress , for a while , was nearly equal ; and the pony , though very unskilfully managed by her seemingly raw and timid rider , continued to maintain her place by the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the contest extremely doubtful . But as they drew near the end of the course , and the horse , by the renewed incentives of his rider began to gain on her , she suddenly flounced , broke into a gallop , shot by the horse , giving him a staggering kick in the chops as she passed , and , in spite of the apparent efforts of her rider , to bring her up at the goal , plunged on directly towards the fence that had been thrown across the road . " Whoa ! whoa ! " cried Bart , in tones of distress and affright , still appearing to strain every nerve to hold in the ungovernable animal  --  " whoa ! whoa ! help , or I shall be thrown ! " " Help him there ! stop her ! seize her by the bits ! " shouted Sturges , now riding up to the goal to claim the bet . But the perverse pony , veering about among those approaching on either side to seize , or head her , with sundry monitory kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next moment reached , and , with a tremendous leap , cleared the barricade , and landed safely with her rider in the open road on the other side . Here Bart hastily made another apparent attempt to rein her up ; but rearing and spinning round on her heels , she again made a plunge forward , and set out in a keen run , making the ground smoke beneath her feet as she flew , with astonishing speed along the road ; while her rider , grasping her mane with both hands , and swaying from side to side , as if hardly able to keep his seat at that , continued to bawl and screech , at every step , " Whoa ! whoa ! stop her ! stop her ! " with all his might . The tories were so completely taken by surprise by these manoeuvres , and the unexpected feat of leaping the barricade , that Bart and his fleet pony were nearly a quarter of a mile off , before they sufficiently rallied from their astonishment and confusion to realize what had passed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , and expecting every moment to see him hurled headlong from his horse , they stood doubtfully looking at him and each other , several seconds longer , before they thought of following him . Sturges , however , now took the alarm , and , ordering the barricade to be thrown down , started off , with those who , like himself , happened to be mounted , in pursuit . By this time , the fugitive had passed over an intervening swell , which hid him from the view of the pursuers ; and though their progress was rapid , yet , when they gained the top of the swell , which commanded a view of the road till it entered the woods , almost a half mile beyond , he was nowhere to be seen . But believing he must have gained the woods , they pushed on , in the vain pursuit , about a mile farther ; when , meeting some townsmen , they ascertained that he had not passed in that direction . They then retraced their steps , carefully examining every by-path and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be made to go ; but making no discoveries , they concluded to return to the tavern for consultation ; for they grew more and more puzzled to know what to make of the prisoner , or how to account for his mysterious escape , some affirming " he must have been in league with the devil , as no horse , in a natural state , could have leaped that barricade , or have gone off so like a streak of lightning after he was over it ; and his strange doings with the pony , when he first met her , and the bluish appearance that attended him along the road as he went off , with such unnattural swiftness , " were cited in confirmation . But when they reached the tavern , the prisoner , and every thing attending his escape , were for the time forgotten in the excitement occasioned by the more startling tidings just received . The constable had just arrived in great haste , announcing that Peters had been waylaid , and found murdered in the road , and calling on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the horrid deed . CHAPTER XIII .  --  " despair itself grew strong And vengeance fed its torch from wrong . " On the same day , and near the same hour , on which Bart so singularly and luckily effected his escape from his vindictive enemies , the bereft Woodburn left his lonely residence and walked to the graveyard , to shed another tear over the freshly-laid turf that covered the remains of his sainted mother . Here , as , standing over her grave , he reflected on the many excellences of her character , recalled the many acts of her kindness and love towards him , never before justly appreciated , and , at the same time , thought of the circumstances under which she had sickened and died , his tears flowed fast and bitterly . While he was still lingering near the sacred spot , immersed in these painful reflections , two ladies , from a neighboring cottage , came , unperceived by him , along the road leading by the graveyard ; when the younger of the two , wholly unconscious that any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the next house , and entered the yard to amuse herself there till her companion returned . Now pausing to read an inscription , and now to pluck a wild violet , she slowly wandered towards that part of the yard where Woodburn , still screened from her view by a clump of intervening evergreens , was pensively reclining against a tombstone in the vicinity of his mother 's grave . And here , taking a turn round the shrubbery , she came suddenly upon him ; and , stopping short in her course , she stood mute and confused before him , while her cheeks were mantled with a deep blush at the awkwardness of the position in which she unexpectedly found herself . " Miss Haviland ! " exclaimed Woodburn , looking up in equal surprise . " Excuse me if I am wrong , but , as little as I was expecting it , I think it is Miss Haviland whom I am addressing ? " " It is , sir , " she replied , in a slightly tremulous voice ; " but I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No intrusion , fair lady . You do not rightly interpret my expression , which was one of surprise at seeing you here , when I had supposed you to be in another part of the country . When I last saw you , I supposed you on your return to Bennington . " " I was so at that time . But having recently come over with my father , who was journeying to Connecticut , I am now tarrying with a sister in this neighborhood till he returns . Your allusion to our parting , however , can not but bring to mind the circumstances connected with our meeting , nor fail to admonish me of my great obligations to you , sir , which I have never before found a suitable opportunity of personally acknowledging . But be assured , Mr. Woodburn , I shall never forget that fearful hour ; yet sooner far the hour , than the hand that snatched me from my seemingly inevitable doom . " " We both may have cause to remember the incidents attendant on that journey to Westminster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common duty in assisting you , shall remember them , on more accounts than one , I fear but too long . " " If you allude to your difficulties on that journey , and subsequently with one with whom we were in company , I can only say , sir , that I have heard of them , and all your consequent misfortunes , with the deepest regret , scarcely less on account of the author than the victim . " " I could have submitted to my pecuniary losses with a good degree of resignation ; but , when I think of the crowning act , and the consequences that followed it  --  when I look on that grave , " continued the speaker , pointing to the fresh mound , with an effort to master his emotions , " it is hard to endure . " " Such misfortunes , " responded Miss Haviland , visibly touched at his distress ; " such misfortunes ,  --  injuries , perhaps , I should call them ,  --  I am sensible , are not easily forgotten ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate to be associated with them in your mind . " " O , no , lady , no , " said Woodburn , promptly ; " though it were better for my happiness , perhaps , if I could , " he added , more gloomily ; " for who will care what may be the feelings of one who is now an outcast , without property , family , or friends ? " " Think not thus of yourself , Mr. Woodburn , " replied the other , while a scarcely perceptible tinge appeared on her fair cheek ; " feel not thus . You do to yourself , and I doubt not to many others , great injustice ; certainly to one who can only think of you with the warmest gratitude . " " O , if all were like you , Miss Haviland ! " returned Woodburn , with much feeling ; " so just , so generous , so pure , so beautiful ! But I have already said too much , " he continued , checking himself . " I intended not to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves upon me , even before I heard these kind expressions . And though what I have said can not be recalled , yet I have no thought of pressing any questions upon you under the accidental advantage which your gratitude  --  other things being the same  --  might give me . I ask for no corresponding impressions  --  I expect none . Being aware of your position , as well as my own , I shall not drive you to the unpleasant task of repulsing me . I will repulse myself . I will conquer this new enemy , though planted in my own bosom , lest it prove more dangerous to my peace than the one with whom I have so vainly contended in another rivalry . " She raised her eyes with a look full of maidenly embarrassment , indeed , but with an expression more resembling that of sorrow than resentment , as she gently replied ,  --  " I feel additionally grateful to you , Mr. Woodburn , for your delicate and generous course under the circumstances in which , as you seem to be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my companion approaching in the road , you will excuse my departure . " " Certainly , " said Woodburn ; " and you will forgive what has been said by one who is so truly the prey of conflicting emotions ? " " O , yes , sir , " she answered , looking up with a witching smile , as she bowed her adieu ; " that is , I will when you do any thing worthy of my forgiveness . " Woodburn stood mutely gazing after his lovely visitor till her small and graceful figure , floating on in its devious course through the diversified grounds in almost fairy lightness , receded from his enraptured sight ; when he turned away with a sigh to commune with himself , try to analyze his feelings , weigh consequences , give Reason her rightful sway , and follow her dictates . After a long and deep struggle with his feelings , he appeared to come to some determination , and , resolutely bringing down a foot on the ground , he exclaimed ,  --  " No , never ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disappointment and mortification . Begone , enticing vision , begone ! I will harbor you no longer . " And under the impulse of his freshly-formed resulution , he abruptly left the spot , and hastened through the enclosure to take his way homeward . As he was about to pass out into the road , his attention was attracted by the barking of a small dog , that , having followed the ladies , and tarried behind on their return , seemed to be intent on dragging out something from under a broad , flat stone lying in one corner of the graveyard . Feeling some inclination to know what discoveries the dog was making in a spot so unpromising of any game that would be likely to attract him , Woodburn walked to the spot ; when he perceived the animal to be eagerly tugging away at some object , which presented the appearance of the corners of some old , leather-bound book , buried beneath the stone . His curiosity being now excited , he stood by and patiently waited to see the result . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question , which proved to be an old recordbook , or rather the remains of one , for a part of it had been converted by the mice into a nest , and the rest was mutilated and falling to pieces . Leaving the dog to pursue his object , which was now sufficiently explained , Woodburn gathered up the remains of the book and stepped aside to examine them . On beating off the dirt and opening the unmutilated parts , he soon , and to his great surprise , discovered it to be a volume of the town records ; the very volume , the loss of which , as he believed , had caused his defeat in his lawsuit with Peters . And hurriedly running over the leaves , his eye , the next moment , fell on the record of his own deed , with the dates precisely as he had contended , and standing in a connection which would have proved the priority of his title , furnished him a complete defence , and saved him from ruin ! The previous suspicions of Woodburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters , were now confirmed in the mind of the former , as certainly as if he had witnessed the act ; and this aggravating discovery , coming as it did too late to be of any benefit to him , and at a moment , too , when his feelings , notwithstanding his recent declarations to Miss Haviland , and his subsequent resolves , were sore from the insidious workings of jealousy , and the revolting thought of the pretensions of his hated foe to her hand  --  this discovery , we say , wrought up his mind , already imbittered to the last degree of endurance , to a state little short of absolute frenzy . And clinching the fragments of the book , which contained the proof of the black transaction , in one hand , and flourishing the heavy oak cane he had with him in the other , he rushed out of the enclosure , and , with a disturbed air and hurrying step , took his way towards his desolate home , resolved , that in case he found , as he feared , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , at least , unsparingly make use of the means now in his power in trumpeting the villany of Peters to the world . In this state of exasperation , after proceeding a short distance , he unexpectedly and unfortunately encountered the very object of his pent indignation , the haughty and hated Peters , who , on horseback , was coming up a cross-road on his way to the Tory Tavern , where , as the reader has been already apprised , his tools and partisans were anxiously awaiting his arrival . " Ha ! here ? Then he shall be the first to hear it , " muttered Woodburn , as with a flashing eye he suddenly turned and sternly confronted the other in his path . " What now , sir ? " said Peters , reigning up with a look of surprise not unmingled with uneasiness . " I will tell you what , now , sir , " replied Woodburn , in a voice quivering with suppressed passion ; " your frauds are exposed ! Here are the remains of those very records you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph over me , and now just found buried in yonder graveyard ! " " Away , sir ! " exclaimed Peters , recovering his usual assurance . " I know nothing of your crazy jargon : stand aside and let me pass . " " Not till you have looked at the proof of what I assert , or acknowledged its correctness , " persisted the other , extending his cane before the horse with his right hand , and thrusting forward the open book with his left . " Here it is ; here is the record of my deed  --  dates and all , as I and you , too , sir , well knew them to be . Look at it , sir , and restore me my property , or confess yourself a villain ! " At this juncture Peters , who had covertly reversed the loaded whip he carried in his hand that he might strike more effectually , suddenly rose in his stirrups , and aimed a furious blow at the head of his accuser . But as sudden and unexpected as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest and parry the descending implement , when , quick as thought , he paid back the intended blow with a force , of which , in the madness of the moment , he was little conscious , full on the exposed head of his antagonist , who , curling like a struck bullock beneath the fearful stroke , rolled heavily from his saddle to the ground . The exclamation of triumph that rose to the lips of the victor died in his throat , as he took a second glance at the motionless form and corpse-like aspect of the victim ; and , recoiling a step , he stood aghast at the thought of what he had done . After standing a minute with his eyes rivetted on the face of his prostrate foe , Woodburn , arousing himself , hurried forward , and , raising the head , chafed the temples and wrists a moment , and then felt for the pulse , when , finding no signs of life , he suddenly relinquished his hold , and with a look of horror and unutterable distress , hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A murderer !  --  to crown the host of misfortunes  --  a murderer ! " Soon striking off into a deep glade , diverging from the public way , he continued his course , with a rapid step and troubled brow , on through the woods and back pastures , till he gained , unobserved , the rear of his own cabin , when , entering , he threw himself into a chair , and , burying his face in his hands , sat many minutes motionless and silent , apparently engaged in deep and anxious thought . At length , he arose with a more composed look , and proceeded to make up a pack of his wardrobe , with such valuables as could be conveniently carried , including his mother 's Bible . He then fitted his pack to his shoulders , took down his gun and ammunition , and , throwing a sorrowful farewell glance round the lonely apartment , left the house , and bent his course for the woods , in a northerly direction . After travelling in the woods and unfrequented fields about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersection between the road near which he had been holding his course , and a road coming into it from the central parts of the town . Here , concluding to pause till the approaching darkness should more perfectly screen him , before going out into the main thoroughfare leading up the Connecticut , he sat down on a log within the border of the woods , and again gave way to the remorseful feelings and moody reflections that still painfully oppressed him . His meditations , however , were soon disturbed by the quick , heavy tread of some animal , which seemed to be approaching in the woods , at no great distance behind him . Instantly peering out through the thicket in which he had ensconced himself , he soon , to his great surprise , descried a horseman descending a difficult ledge , leaping old windfalls , and making his way through all the opposing obstacles of the forest with wonderful facility , directly towards the spot where he stood concealed in the thicket . Knowing that whatever might be the object of the person approaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert , from which he could not move unobserved , and his curiosity being excited by the appearance of a horseman in a spot that would have scarcely been deemed passable for a wild deer , he kept his stand ; and continued to regard the advancing figure with the most lively interest . But owing to the thickness of the now full-leaved undergrowth , and the duskiness that by this time had gathered in the forest , he could only catch occasional glimpses of either horse or rider , which enabled him to ascertain nothing more than that they both were quite diminutive , and , as it struck him , rather oddly accoutred . They continued to advance directly towards him till within fifty yards of his covert , when the horse , in emerging from a clump of bushes , which still enveloped the rider , stopped short , and , looking keenly into the thicket , gave a quick , significant snort . " What 's in the wind now , Lightfoot ? " said the rider to his horse , as , parting the obstructing foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disclosed to the surprised and gratified Woodburn the well-known visage of his trusty friend , Barty Burt . " This is , indeed , unexpected , Bart , " said Woodburn , stepping out into plain view . " Harry ! " exclaimed the other , agreeably surprised in turn ; " but are you sure there are no more of you there in the bush ? " he added , with a cautious glance at the thicket . " Yes , I am alone here , " answered the former . " Well , I vags now ! " resumed Bart , drawing a long breath , and riding forward  --  " I vags , if I did n't begin to feel rather ticklish when Lightfoot give me that hint to look out for snakes , just now . But the case ai nt quite what it might have been , considering . " " Considering what ? " " I know . " " Of course you do , as well as what brought you here with a horse , in so strange a place for a horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you know what brought you here with a pack on your back , in so queer a route for a journey , when a smooth road is so near you . " Well knowing Bart 's peculiarities , and that it would be useless to try to draw from him the secret of his appearance here until he chose to reveal it , Woodburn , while the other dismounted and told his pony to be cropping the bushes in the mean time , related all that had transpired between himself and the victim of his deeply regretted paroxysm of passion , adding , at the close of his gloomy and self-accusing recital ,  --  " I first thought , after reaching my house , that I would return and give myself up to the authorities ; but knowing , whether Peters should live or die , that I should be a doomed man in this part of the country , I at length brought myself , perhaps wrongly , to try to get out of it undiscovered . And I have now set my course for Boston , to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Heaven knows with what pleasure I shall now sacrifice my life in her battles . " " Good ! that 's grand ! " warmly responded Bart , who had listened to the other with many a whew ! of surprise at his accompanying expressions of self-condemnation for killing an antagonist who struck the first blow  --  " that 's grand ! Here is what goes with you , Harry ; for , between us here , I and Lightfoot are clipping it from a predicament , as well as you . " " So I suspected . But what is it ? Let us have your story now . " " Well , Harry , in the first place , do you know this critter I call Lightfoot ? " " No ; at least I do n't now remember to have noticed the animal before . " " Well , it is the colt old skin-flint Turner cheated me out of , last year . " " I think you told me something about it , but do n't recollect the particulars ; though I had then no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , as I understood you worked very hard for him through the season . " " I did , like a niggar  --  cause he promised to give me this colt , then a little snubby three-year-old , for my summer 's work , if I would stay and work well for him , which I did , as I said . Well , supposing the colt was to be mine , without any mistake , I made a sight of her , named her Lightfoot , fed her , got her as tame as a dog , then trained her to understand certain words and signs , which I at last got her to obey ; and whether it was to trot , run , or jump fences , she would do it as no other critter could . But just as I had got her to mind and love me , as I did her , my time was out ; and I went to settle off matters with the old man , and tell him I was going to take her off with me , when  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about his promise to let me have her , and forbid my touching her , saying he had paid me all I earnt in the old clothes which he urged on to me , against my will , and which were not worth one week 's work , as true as the book , Harry . Well , I could n't help crying , to be cheated so , and , what was worse , to lose Lightfoot . But it did no good . I had to come away without her , or any other pay ; and , from that time , I have n't seen her till to-day . " " But you have not now stole and run away with her , I trust , Bart ? " " No ; she run away with me , " replied Bart , roguishly , as I can prove ; for I hollered whoa all the time , as loud as I could yell . " " But how came you mounted upon her at all ? " " Well , Harry , that brings me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; and here goes for it . " Bart , in his own peculiar manner , then related , with great accuracy , the particulars of his arrest and escape from the tories , as we have already described them in the preceding chapter , merely explaining , in addition , that Lightfoot well understood the game , and knew she was to obey the signs he secretly gave her with his feet and hands , however loud he , or others , might cry whoa , or any of the terms usually addressed to horses . He then proceeded :  --  " Well , you see , as soon as I got over the hill , out of sight , I looked out for a hard , stony place , where Lightfoot could n't be tracked ; and , soon finding one , I leaped her over the fence , and made full speed for the woods , which I luckily reached jest in time to wheel round in safety , and see them thundering along by , in the road , after me . I then took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods , where I had learnt Lightfoot , in riding after the cows , last summer , to be as much at home in as in the road . " " And what do you propose to do with this horse now ? " asked Woodburn . " Take her along with me , to be sure , Harry . " " And so make yourself , in law , a horse-thief , eh ? Do you expect me to join company with such a character ? " " Well , now , Harry , I did n't expect the like of that from you , any how , " observed Bart , evidently touched at the remark . " The creature is honestly mine ; and I supposed I had a right to get what was mine away , if I could , without going to law , which would help me about as much as it has you , I reckon . But supposing that to be law which ai nt right and justice , and so make me out a thief , as you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , to swap predicaments with me ? You have just called yourself a murderer , which you ai nt , and me a horse-thief , which I ai nt , any more than you the other . Now , how will you swap characters ? " " Bart , you have silenced me . Injustice and oppression have made us both outlaws , but not intentionally wrong-doers . Let us still abstain from all intentional wrong , however trifling . And that leads me to observe , that whatever justification you may have for taking away the horse , you probably have none for carrying off the bridle . " " There you are out again , Harry . That bridle , which queerly happened to be put on Lightfoot to-day , ( as if it was kinder ordered I should get the beast , ) is the very one I bought last fall to take her off with ; but being so worked up , when I left , I forgot to bring it away . " " Upon my word , Bart , you are successful to-day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , Harry . Nobody has any honest claims on me in Guilford , now , nor I any on them . I leave ' em with every thing squared , according to my religion . " " Except in the matter of your gun , which you leave  --  not exactly won by your opponent  --  behind you ; do you not ? " " They are welcome to it ; much good may it do ' em . It has gone pretty much where I calkerlated to get it off  --  among those who used me the worst ; though I 'd some rather it had gone to Fitch , who hunts some , and would be sure to try it . " " That is queer reasoning , Bart . " " Well , there is a head and tail to it , for all that , Harry . " " What are they ? " " Why , the head , or cause , is , that the last time I shot the piece , I overloaded it , being for black ducks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel , which I could blow through . And the tail , or consequence , is , that the next man who shoots it will wish he 'd never seen it , I reckon . " " Ah , Bart , Bart , your religion , as you term it , is a strange one ! But let us now dismiss the past , and think of the future . If you join me for the army , what do you propose to do with your horse  --  sell her ? " " Sell her ? " why , I 'd as soon sell my daddy , if I had one . No , we 'll keep her between us . You , and Tom Dunning , and Lightfoot are the only friends I have in the world , Harry ; and I want we should kinder stick together . So I 've been thinking up the plan , that we ride and tie , or keep along together and foot it by turns , to-night , till we get to Westminster , when we will beat up Dunning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of his sly places over the mountain , and have her kept for us . Then , if one of us gets killed , or any thing , so as never to come back , let the other take her ; and if both fail to come , then let Tom have her for his own . " And Bart 's plan being adopted , our two humble , friendless , and nearly penniless adventurers left the wood , and entering the northern road , set forth on their destination , Woodburn first mounting the pony and keeping some hundred yards in advance , and Bart forming the rear-guard , under the agreement that the latter , on hearing any sounds of pursuit , should utter the cry of the raccoon , when both were to plunge into the woods , and remain till the danger had passed by . After travelling in this manner , and at a rapid rate , about two hours , without encountering any thing to excite their apprehensions or delay their progress , they entered a long reach of unbroken forest , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not being able to conceive where they could have turned off from the river road , which was their intended route , they continued to move doubtingly onwards some miles farther , till the increasing obstructions and narrowness of the path , together with the absence of the settlements which they knew they must have found before this time on the road up the Connecticut , fully convinced Woodburn they had lost their way . And he was on the point of proposing to retrace their steps , when , descrying a light some distance ahead , emanating , as he supposed , from the hut of a new settler , he at once concluded to push on towards it , for the purpose of making inquiries of the occupants to ascertain their situation . In making for the light , of which , for a while , only feeble and occasional glimmerings could be obtained through the dense foliage that overhung the devious path , they at length came to an apparently well-cultivated opening , containing about a dozen acres , on one side of which stood a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly projecting ledge of rocks . As they approached the house , their attention was arrested by the loud and earnest voice of a man within , engaged , evidently , in prayer . Concluding that the man was at his family evening devotions , which they had no thought of disturbing , they left the horse at a little distance from the house , and silently drawing near to the door , paused and reverently listened . A confused recollection of the supplicant 's voice , together with his deep and fervid tones , his bold language , and especially the subject that seemed then mostly to engross his thoughts , at once awakened the interest and rivetted the attention of Woodburn . The great burden of his soul was , obviously , the political condition of his country . And , after vividly painting the many wrongs she had suffered from her haughty oppressors , and warmly setting forth her claims to divine assistance , he broke forth , in conclusion ,  --  " My country ! O my injured , oppressed , and down-trodden country ! shall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will not the God of battles hear and help thee , in this the hour of thy peril and of thy need ? O , wilt thou not , Lord , extend thy mighty arm in her defence ? O , teach the proud Britons , now thronging our shores  --  teach them , scoffing Goliahs as they are , that there are young Davids in our land ! O , bring their counsels to nought ! Scatter their fleets by thy tempests at sea , and destroy their armies on land ! Sweep them off by bullet and plague ! and  --  and "  --  suddenly checking himself , he meekly added , " and save their souls ; and this , Lord , is all that in conscience I can ask for them . Amen . " Woodburn now gently rapped at the door , which , after a slight pause , was opened , and Herriot , the late prisoner of the royal court , stood before him . " If this is Harry Woodburn , " he said , after scrutinizing the other 's features a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you are not alone ? " he added , glancing towards Bart , who stood several paces in the background . " No , " replied Woodburn ; " I have in company a young man whom you may , perhaps , recollect as the messenger that appeared several times at the grate of our prison at Westminster , to bring us news of the progress of the rising . " " Ah , yes , well do I recollect that goodly youth , and have ever since taken a peculiar interest in him . Invite him in . All this is opportune , very  --  very , " said Herriot , leading the way into the house . After the recluse had ushered his guests into the principal room of his very simply furnished house , of which he and a servant boy , of perhaps fifteen , were the only inmates , he turned to Woodburn , and said ,  --  " As my retreat here in the woods , and the road that leads to it , are known to so few , I conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your guide on the occasion . " " O , no , " replied the other ; " we had lost our way , having left the river road inadvertently , and were about to turn back , when , catching a glimpse of your light , we came on to make inquiries . We neither of us knew when we struck into the road leading hither . " " Do you agree to that statement , without any qualification , master Bart ? " asked the recluse , with a doubting and slightly puzzled air . " Well , some of it , I reckon , " answered Bart , with a look of droll gravity . " Why , you told me , sir , " responded Woodburn , rather sharply , " that you had never travelled this road before . " " No more I had n't , " replied Bart , composedly ; " but I did n't say I did n't know where it turned off , for Tom Dunning told me that . " " Bart , " said Woodburn , seriously , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father Herriot , yet , as between you and me , this needs explanation . It looks as if you purposely led me astray . " " Well now , Harry , no offence , I hope . The thing was kinder agreed on , somehow , that you should come this way , when you left Guilford , which was understood would happen soon . If I had n't fell in with you as I did , it was my notion to take Lightfoot here , or at Dunning 's , and then go back and skulk there somewheres till you was ready to come ; but finding you and things all coming so handy like , when we got to where the road turned off , I thought I 'd let you follow me into it , if you would , and say nothing till we got here . " " I am still perfectly at a loss how to understand all this , Bart ; and I still wish you would more fully explain it . " " I will take that task upon myself ; for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot of your friends , " said Herriot , going to a chest , and bringing forward a small bag of money . " This has been deposited with me for your use and benefit . It is the price of your cow and oxen , sold by Dunning to a drover from Rhode Island . The sum is , I believe , about fifty dollars , which I now deliver you , as your own unquestionable property . " In the explanation that now ensued , it appeared that the cattle , which had been rescued by the friends of Woodburn , without his privity , lest the scruples it was feared he might entertain should lead him to interfere with the plan , were taken that night to the retreat of Herriot , who was made acquainted with the whole transaction ; and that the next day , while Dunning went up the river in search of a purchaser , the other , who was not without his scruples , also , about sanctioning the procedure , repaired to lawyer Knights for his opinion on the subject . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and given it as his decided opinion that the judgment , to satisfy which the cattle had been seized , was an illegal and void one , and that the cattle so seized might rightfully be taken for the owner , without legal process , if found out of the hands of the officer , the recluse returned and actively coperated with the hunter ; the result of which was , that a purchaser was soon found , who paid the money for the stock , and immediately drove it from the country . This , to Woodburn , was an unexpected development . And now , after hearing the explanation of Herriot , being satisfied of the propriety of the course so generously taken by his friends in his behalf , he gratefully received the money ; and , in turn , while Bart and the servant were out caring for the pony , he confidentially disclosed to the recluse the painful occurrence of the afternoon which had led to his sudden flight from home , and his determination of immediately joining the army , concluding by giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tories . " You have acted wisely , Mr. Woodburn , " observed Herriot , after listening with deep interest to the recital . " Peters may yet recover ; but should he not , I do not view the act in so criminal a light as that in which you yourself have placed it . And in the absence of all intention of killing the man , I feel very clear that it is not a deed meriting the punishment you would be likely to receive , if you had put your fate into the hands of the corrupted witnesses who would probably have been brought against you . Yes , you have acted wisely in leaving that wicked Babel of toryism , and nobly in devoting yourself to the cause of your bleeding country . My blessing and prayers will attend you and your young friend , to whom , I trust , you will act the friend and adviser he will doubtless need . But come , Harry , " he added , taking up a light , and making a sign for the other to follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I became acquainted with you and your young friend , at Westminster , and knowing of no two persons in whom I take greater interest , I have concluded to impart something to you in confidence . " So saying , he led the way into the cellar , the bottom of which was flagged over with stones of various shapes and sizes ; when , pointing to a broad , flat stone lying near the centre of the room , he asked Woodburn to raise it . Wondering what could be the object of so unexpected a request , the latter , with considerable effort , succeeded in raising the stone to an upright position , and in so doing brought to view two small iron-bound casks , standing in a cavity beneath , and labelled , in large inky letters , " Printer 's Type . " " Printing , then , was formerly your trade ? " said Woodburn , inquiringly , perceiving the other not inclined to be the first to speak . " Well , that is a respectable calling , is it not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Woodburn ; " but I had not looked for any immediate use for such implements in this new settlement . " " The contents of those casks , nevertheless , are of more value than you may think them , Harry , and may soon be needed for the public , in the times now at hand . But what I wish to say to you is , in the first place , that you are not to divulge what you have seen to any one but your young friend , and not to him unless you are satisfied he can be trusted , or you are about to die . And , in the second place , if you hear of my death , both of you are to come here , take possession of these casks , and divide the contents equally between you as your own . I have now no relative that will appear to claim them . You will also find , enclosed in one of the casks , certain documents , which I have recently deposited there , explaining my wishes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately made by me , that interest others besides myself . This you , or the survivor of you two , if one should die , will do in case I am taken away . And even if I continue to live , my designs will probably not be altered ; and I shall wish to see you both again when you are permitted to return to your old homes . And still further , I would say , that should you be in want at any time , and will apply to me , I will dispose of enough of this property to supply your necessities . Now replace the stone , and let us return to the room above . " Woodburn knew not what to make of all this mystery , or affected mystery , as he believed it . But knowing the singularities of the man , he forebore to ask any questions , and they left the cellar in silence . Soon after they had returned , Bart and the servant came in ; when a frugal meal was set before the travellers . And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recluse procured his writing materials , and penning a brief letter , presented it to Woodburn , saying , " There is a letter of introduction to a former friend of mine , who , I understand , is appointed to an important command in the army now mustering at Cambridge . It may be of service to you . And now , " he added , as his guests rose to depart  --  " now , my young friends and fellow-sufferers from oppression , go  --  deserve well of your country , and desert her not till the British Dagons are all levelled to the dust , which may God speedily grant . Amen . " In a few minutes more , our adventurers were on their way . And being now invigorated , both in body and mind , by what had occurred during their call at the retreat of their mysterious friend , they pressed on so rapidly , for the next three or four hours , that they arrived at Dunning 's cabin , in Westminster , just as the first faint flush of daylight appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cooking his breakfast , preparatory to an early start on some new excursion , they joined him in his delicious meal , which consisted of the rich steaks of a salmon caught the preceding evening . And having finished their breakfast , and made the contemplated arrangement with Dunning , to take charge of Lightfoot , their now common favorite , the last-named person set them across the Connecticut in his log canoe ; when , looking back from the woody shore of the New Hampshire side , they bade a long farewell to the Green Mountains , whose tall , blue peaks were then beginning to grow bright in the rays of the rising sun , and resolutely plunged into the dark recesses before them .
