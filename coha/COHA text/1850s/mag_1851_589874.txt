Political Portraits with Pen and Pencil . October , POLITICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . HORATIO SEYMOUR , OF NEW-YORK . JN introducing the subject of this sketch , a man upon whom , as one of the rising pillars of the state , the hopeful eye of the Democracy of NewYork is intently fixed , it is believed that an interest attaches to him , not confined to the state of his birth and residence , and the scene of his entire immediate connection with political life . The powerful influence which the state of polities in New-York , from the very necessity of the case , exerts upon the welfare of the Democratic party of the Union , and the remarkable and anomalous position of parties in the state of late years , naturally gives an importance , as well as interest , to the career of one who has been prominently identified as a leader with the political movements , which have been looked upon by the country at large with so much solicitude , and which have been attended with such momentous consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly embraced within the period occupied by these movements , the writer will of course be called upon , cursorily of necessity , to notice some of the peculiar features of these bitter and very unfortunate controversies . Before entering upon this part of the subject , however , it is proper to give a brief sketch of his more immediately personal biography . HORATIO SEYMOUR was born in the year 1811 , in the town of Ppmpey county of Onondaga , in the state of New-York , and is now of course just forty ye rs of age . He may be said with truth to be descended from distinguished democratic stock , his ancestors and numerous connections in this and other states having been , as far as the writer is aware , always attached to the Democratic party . The larger portion of the family in its various branches resides in the state of Connecticut . They are all the descendants of RICHARD SEYMOUR , one of the original settlers of Hartford , in that state , where he and the two or three subsequent generations lived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , **served with distinction in the war of the Revolution , and was present at the surrender of Burgoyne . He represented , with great credit , and most acceptably to his constituents , the town of Litchfield iii the legislature of Connecticut for seventeen years . He also held many important and responsible stations in the town church . He had five sons , of whom HENRY SEYMOUR , the father of Horatio , was one . He was born in 1780 , and on arriving at man 's estate , he removed to Onondaga County , in the state of NeW-York , * hence , shortly after the birth of Horatio , he removed to Utica , where , after serving the state with great ability in the legislature , and as one of the earliest Canal Commissioners for many years , he died , leaving a large fortune and a distinguished reputation . A brother of Henry , whose name does not occur to the writer , was a member of the United States Senate , from Vermont , for about twelve years . The Hon. ORIGEN S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Connecticut , is a son of another brother named Ozias . The Hon. DAvID L. SEYMOUR , member // of Congress elect from the Rensselaer district , New-York , and the present Governor Seymour , of Connecticut , are also , the writer believes , sons of others of these brothers . The father of Governor Seymour was , we believe , a soldier in the Revolution . The family have always been distinguished for their ability , and renowned for their patriotism. * Horatio Seymour , having received a liheral education , directed his attention towards the study of law , was admitted early in life to the bar , and commenced the practice of his profession in the city of Utica . The cares of a large , and widely extended estate , however , devolving upon him on the death of his father , together with that of which he came into possession in the right of his wife , a daughter of the late John R. Bleecker , Esq. , one of the wealthiest citizens of Albany , requiring all his time and attention , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , he was obliged to relinquish the practice of a profession of which he had every prospect of becoming a successful and eminent member . In his duties as a citizen , and in all other relations in life , he has always been an active and influential member of the community , and his personal popularity was signally manifested , when he came before the people for their suifrages , by his election to the mayoralty , in the spring after his first election to the legislature , being then only thirty years of age , by a handsome majority , in a city where the whigs were , at the time , largely in the ascendant . Mr. Seymour had , from his youth , been strongly attached to , the Democratic party , and performed his duty in the ranks with an ability and effect , which soon rendered him conspicuously useful . In 1841 , having in previous years declined the same honor , he accepted a nomination for the legislature from the county of Oneida , and was elected by one of those large majorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this period , just ten years ago , commenced the public career of Mr. Seymour . The history of the Democratic party of the state of New-York , since that period , has been a subject of curiosity and perplexity throughout the Union . The democracy of the whole nation have felt and realized the unfortunate results growing out of the divisions and dissensions which have prostrated the power of the party in this state , so long looked upon as the citadel , on whose preservation against the assaults of federalism , depended the triumph of the Democratic party in the Union ; but they have regarded the causes which have led to these results , as too intricate a subject to be easily unravelled . That the conflicting statements of parties , more immediately connected with these dissensions , are calculated to en*barrass the minds of those who depend upon the representations of others , rather than an examination of their own , for the formation of their opinions , is very true ; yet , this is a subject so important , in the magnitude of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consideration of every intelligent democrat in the country . The suicidal and pusillanim ous policy adopted by the last National Democratic Convention , in not recognizing its responsibilities , and refusing to pass upon the question of organi * In the brief space of time allowed the writer to prepare this sketch , he has not had the opportunity of that communication with Mr. Seymour or his connections , which was desirable ; and it is therefore not improbable that these personal details in regard to his family relations , as well as himself , are incomplete , and possibly not netirely accurate . // zation , growing out of the division *n New-York , which was brought before that body , as the sole tribunal competent to dispose of it , was , in a degree , the result of this disposition on the part of many members to avoid the difficulty of examining and deciding for themselves . This difficulty has been unnecessarily magnified and exaggerated . A candid consideration of the facts obviously presented , with the exercise of that ordinary discrimination or common sense which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time , and with the greatest ease , demolish any difficulty that appeared to lie in the way . In political , as well as physical optics , when objects are thrown upon the retina in an inverted position , the brain , if allowed to perform its natural and friendly function , will very kindly set them on their legs . It is to be hoped that the next national convention may not be called upon to pass upon this much vexed question ; but , if it should be , ( and it is not at all impossible that it may be , ) it is equally desirable that it should be met in a candid and discriminating spirit , and with a just and fearless determination to settle it on its merits . To repeat the error of the last convention will result in the perpetuation of the disorganization , and the permanent demoralization of the Democratic party of New-York . The propriety of these incidental remarks , in connection with the present biographical sketch , should not be questioned , as the political career of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the movements which have accompanied the controversy from its commencement , that the brief and hurried notice which the limits of the Review will allow , will necessarily touch upon some of the principal points involved in it . The continuous and earnest efforts made by Mr. Seymour to remove the causes of dissension , and to bring the masses of the party together on the broad platform of its ancient faith , from which a portion of them have unfortunately strayed , have been so conspicuous , that a cursory notice of the rise and progress of the division is conducive , if not necessary to a proper appreciation of his motives and conduct . It is not the design of the writer to discuss the *nerits of the subjects in controversy , but merely to let the circumstances attending Mr. Seymour 's public course and action , point the moral deducible from the political movements in the State of New-York , embraced within the period alluded to . It is a lamentable , and not very creditable fact , that the history of the Democratic party of New-York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of internal feud and discord  --  a history of " a house divided against itself . " It is of course , as a necessary coincident , that this , for a great part of that period , is a history of disaster and defeat . It should not be inferred , however , that Mr. Seymour is to be regarded as an agitator in these divisions . He has always been the apostle of peace . In all the excitement of debate , and at every period of this heated controversy , he has constantly extended the olive-branch . Indeed , his efforts in behalf of conciliation have been so urgent , that their expediency has sometimes been questioned by many of his more ardent and irritated associates of the Old Line Democracy . It is not to be wondered at , that there should be a difference of opinion among the soundest democrats in regard to the true course for bringing back to the Democratic party the sheep that have strayed from the fold . Mr. Seymour 's spirit is exceedingly liberal and generous , and these efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his natural disposition . In all his political course . - in the legislature and in the party movements , in which he has partici // pated ,  --  he has always gone in the same direction , as far as he could , without a sacrifice of his principles . As in the legislature , notwithstanding his liberality , hewas the bold and efficient defender of the time-honored landmarks of the democracy , so he should be relied on as a faithful chainpion of sound principles now . In speaking of Mr. Seymour 's characteristics , it may be as well to give in this connection a portion of a brief sketch given by Judge Hammond , in his " Political History of NewYork . " Referring to Mr. S. , at the time of his service in the legislature , he says : " We have seldom known a man who possessed higher aud better qualifications for usefulness and success in a popular government than Horatio Seymour . Kind and social by nature , affable in his deportment , possessing a shrewd , discerning mind , fluent , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal almost to a fault to his opponents , and fascinating in his address , no man seemed better calculated to acquire an influence in a legislative body than he , and few , indeed , at his time of life , have in fact acquired a better standing or more substantial moral power . He had early made himself well acquainted with the great and varied interests of the state of New-York , an acquisition which aided him much in debate , and gave him an advantage over older members , and which , at the same time , enabled him to render services in legislation highly useful and beneficial to the state . " Mr. Seymour was elected to the assembly in 1841 , for the session commencing on the 1st January , 1842 . The assembly comprised at that session an unusually large number of eminent and talented men . In enumerating them , Judge Hammond says : " Horatio Seymour , from Utica ; John A. Dix , late secretary of state , now United States senator , from Albany ; Lemuel Stetson , from Clinton county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Essex ; John W. Tamlin from Jefferson ; John A. iLott , fro* Kings ; Levi S. Chatfield , from Otsego ; George R. Davis , from Rensselaer ; the benevolent friend of popular education and of man , Calvin T. Hurlbut , from St. Lawrence ; the active and energetic Halsey Rogers , and John Cramer , from Saratoga ; Ziba A. Leland , from Steuben ; Charles Humphrey , former speaker , and now clerk of the Supreme Court , from Tompkins ; anti Michael Hoffman and Arphaxad Loomis , from the county of Herkimer , were all men of distinguished ability . " It is sufficient evidence of the ability and character of Mr. Seymour , that although at that time quite young , just 30 years of age , he at once took rank as a prominent and leading member . The Democratic party had regained its ascendency in both branches of the legislature . Many important measures which can not here be enumerated were passed , in all of which Mr. S. took an active part . The great measure of the session was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the finances , which had such a powerful effect in restoring the depreciated financial credit of the state . This bill was supported by the democratic members with great unanimity ; but met with violent opposition from the whigs . It was at this session , that a schism began to manifest itself in the democratic ranks . It did not show itself in the debates , or in the action in regard to legislative matters , but in expressions of opposition to the renomination of Mr. Bouck for Governor , and to those who were supposed to be his especial fi-iends . Strange tests of political faith began to be talked about  --  a new dispensation seemed to have visited some of the prominent members of the party , and it began to be insinuated that those who did not // embrace it would be unchurched . Forgetting that the fathers and apostles of our time-honored political faith had based the Democratic party upon certain grand and comprehensive principles , " as broad and general as the easing air , " they desired to substitute certain notions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . It is needless to say , that Mr. Seymour opposed these factious movements in caucus and otherwise , and refused to bow to these strange gods . The fire was , however , smothered for the time , and Win . C. Bouck and Daniel S. Dickinson were re-nominated and elected Governor and LieutenantGovernor of the state . Mr. Seymour was a member of the assembly the succeeding session , as , indeed , he was until , and including the session of 1845 . The session of 1843 was principally distinguished by an open effort to create a breach in the Democratic party of the state . Governor Bouck 's administration was met at the threshold , by an organized , and vindictive opposition among lending men of the section before referred to . This opposition was manifested especially with reference to the appointments made by the governor . A bitter , sectional feeling was beginning to be fomented throughout the state . The particulars of the quarrel , at that period , can not be given within the limits of this sketch . Suffice it to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his judgment , to allay it . In the bestowal of his patronage , he endeavored to recognise no sections , but to divide it as equally as possible . This conciliatory spirit met with no response from the section in the senate in opposition to him , who voted with the whig members to defeat his nominations of those who were supposed to be his friends . This feud was most bitter in the senate , and did not make much manifestation in the action of the assembly . Mr. Seymour , however , exerted his strong , personal influence , in and out of the house , in endeavoring to stem the encroachments of this mischievous spirit of disorganization . Among the masses of the party , however , the disorganizing spirit did not extend with sufficient violence to prevent a united action in the support of the nominations for the legislature in the fall , and a large and controlling democratic majority was returned to both houses . This , the session of 1844 , was an exciting and most important one . Both branches contained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly , among others , was returned Michael Hoffman , who had been the recognized leader in the legislature of 1842 . He was known to be strongly opposed to Governor Bouck 's administration , and was , of course , recognised as their leader , by the section that sympathised with him . In the excited , and somewhat acrimonious contests that occurred in the assembly , Mr. Seymour very soon became looked upon as the champion of the friends of the democratic administration . In this , as in the performance of the regular duties that devolved on him , on the floor as well as a member of important committees , he acquitted himself with marked ability . Mr. Hoffman was a powerful antagonist , and had been universally regarded as the most formidable man in debate in the legislature . Though he was dignified and chivalrous in his manner , he was excessively dogmatical and dictatorial , in the expression of his views . He was , as a general thing , tyrannical in the exercise of his power over those who differed with him , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was manifested , for instance , in the unmerciful manner in which be demolished the darling project of Mr. O'Sullivan , viz , his bill for the abrogation of the death penalty , on which he had hoped to rear a lasting fame . Such // was the charm of Mr. Seymour 's manner , and such the manliness and frankness of his general course , however , that he secured from Mr. Hoffman the most respectful consideration ; and it was regarded by many , as a remarkable sight , to behold the domineering dictator of the house defer to the commanding courtesy of his competitor . In reference to Mr. Seymour 's participation in the general course of legislation , at this session , we have only space to refer , in particular , to his course on the canal policy . As this is a subject of interest and importance in itself ; and as it will doubtless have a great bearing upon the coming contests in this state , it is worthy of a somewhat extended notice , which we can give in no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings of that session . He says : " On the 23d of April , Mr. Seymour , from the committee on canals in the assembly , made a report on that part of the governor 's message which related to canals . That committee consisted of Messrs . Seymour , M. L. Harris , Linn , S. Cole , and Dickinson . This report was drawn by Mr. Seymour , and occupies seventy-one large octavo pages . We do not hesitate to pronounce it one of the ablest and best-written documents ever presented to a legislative body . We should do injustice to the author of it were we to pretend to give a skeleton of it . From the able and masterly review that it takes of our system of internal improvements , the great mass of well-arranged facts it contains , its lucid , candid , liberal , and able reasoning , and brief ; but intelligent picture it presents of the finances of the state , it will amply reward any person for the time which the perusal of it would occupy . It ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be acquainted with the situation of the public works , and the financial condition of the state in the year 1844 . It will be found in voL vii . of the assembly documents of that year , No. 177 . " We will merely remark , that the report unequivocally takes ground in favor of sustaining and carrying out all the pledges of the act of 1842 ; that it shows there will be a surplus of revenue after. , redeeming those pledges ; that it admits the necessity of suspending the enlargement of the Erie Canal , but recommends the employment of the surplus revenue in enlarging the locks upon it , in preserving the unfinished works , and in gradually progressing with the construction of the Black River and Genesee Valley canals ; and where unfinished parts of the enlarged canal can be completed , at an expense not greater than that of repairs to contiguous parts of the old canals , as in the case of the Schoharie Creek aqueduct , the report recommends that such parts should be completed . The report condemns and repudiates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing new canals or enlarging the Erie Canal , and it commends the policy recommended by Mr. Flagg and the canal board in 1835 , that only the surplus revenue of the canals should be used for such purposes. * The following are the concluding paragraphs of the report : " The present period is eminently favorable for the establishment of a system of improvements which shall not conflict with the rapid payment of our great liabilities . But to accomplish this , the subject must be approached and treated with the fairness and candor its importance demands . If ; stimulated by success , we have , in a period of excitement and delusion , exceeded the bounds of prudence or discretion , we have but fallen into the errors which ever attend upon the progress of human enterprises . The errors we have committed are not without their utility or profitable teachings . The corruptions of extravagance , and the bitter consequences of indebtedness , have produced their own correctives and public opinion , admonished by the past , has returned to its accustomed and * It is worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are substantially those adopted by the last constitutional convention , and are now a part of the organic law of the state . // healthful channels , from which it will not be readily diverted . There is no portion of our citizens who desire to increase our state indebtedness , or to do aught to the detriment of our common interests , when they are shown the evils that inevitably follow in the train of borrowing large sums of money , to be repaid perhaps in periods of pecuniary distress and embarrassment . But just views of political economy are not to be disseminated by harsh denunciations , which create the suspicion that there is more of hostility to the interests of those assailed , than an honest desire to protect the treasury of the state . Neither is it true , on the other hand , that any considerable number of our citizens are opposed to the extension of our canals when it can be effected by the aid of surplus revenues . " The issue which has been made between improvements on the one hand , and finances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if the committee have succeeded in establishing the truth of their positions , we may and should have in this state a liberal system of internal improvements , furnishing the elements of and predicated upon a sound financial policy . " Mr. Seymour brought in a bill in accordance with the views of this report , which passed both houses . The length to Which this sketch has been already extended , renders it necessary to run over the events of the ensuing session , that of 1845 , more geiierally. *Uhe great democratic triumph in the nation , in the election of Col. Polk to the Presidency , had inspired the party with an invigorated spirit . The divisions to which we have referred , but which we find can not , for want of space , be here noticed with any particularity , it was hoped by many , might be allayed in consequence of the election of Silas Wright as Governor . There is every reason to believe that Mr. Wright assumed the office with an earnest disposition and intention to allay these dissensions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction were kept alive , and were as fatal to him as they had been to Gov . Bouck . At this session , Mr. Seymour was elected Speaker , meeting with a strong opposition in caucus from the divisionists . He had declined the position in the last session , and was only induced to become a candidate at this , by the urgent solicitation of the friends of sound principles and the integrity of the party . It is sufficient to say , that he filled the chair with distinguished ability . Among the interesting events at this session , was the election of Mr. Dickinson to the Senate of the United States . In securing the nomination , Mr. Seymour took an active and influential part . The feeling in the caucus among a few members in opposition to the nomination , was very bitter . Mr. Seymour exerted himself to the utmost to allay it . The ballot stood , 54 for Mr. Dickinson to 17 scattering and 4 blanks . On a motion to make the nomination unanimous , one member opposed it . In reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority In his speech , which produced great effect , he appealed ( in his own words ) to them , " by the recollection of the recent common victory , by the determination which then actuated our whole party as one man , under the feeling that we were contending for common principles and in a common cause . " Although a conspiracy was set on foot to defeat the nomination of the caucus , by a union of the recusants with the whigs , it was easily exploded and frustrated . Mr. Seymour did the country and the state a great service in this strenuous and effective effort to place in the Senate that fearless and indomitable champion of sound democratic principles ,  --  " the bold and eloquent exponent of the nation 's will , " - who on the floor of that body , upheld // so nobly the credit of his state , and achieved for himself such immortal honor . At this session , the bill providing for a convention for the revision of the constitution of the state was adopted . This was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the general overturn that such a measure would bring about , to effect the disorganization of the Democratic party . There was a general desire among the regular democracy to effect certain amendments of the Constitution , which , however , many wished to accomplish in the manner provided for by the Constitution itself . This was Mr. Seymour 's view , and he advocated it on the floor of the house with ability and effect . The debate between him and John Young , the leader of the whigs , as well as of this movement for a convention , on the convention bill , attracted much attention , and was characterized by great eloquence and power on both sides . We can not pretend to give a sketch of the line and scope of the argument , but the conclusion of Mr. Seymour 's closing speech is so characteristic of the man , and the temper in which he approached important questions , that we present it here . Mr. S. concluded by saying : " If a bill can be passed which shall be in accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a majority of the people shall govern-that sovereignty resides with the people-which shall , is a fair , manly , and open manner , indicate the objects of those who contend for it , I shall be willing to give it my support . I have reflected on the subject with anxiety-feeling the importance of this measure to the well-being of our state . God knows I have endeavored to act on it solely with a view to the best interests and highest happiness of our common constituents . And to those who differ with me , I accord an equal degree of consideration-an equally honest desire to promote the interests of those who have intrusted us with power . And I will only express the hope , that in approaching this subject , all pride of opinion will be laid aside-all personal and political objects overlooked-and that we shall be actuated only by a wish to consult the best interests of the great and glorious state whose representatives we are . " With this session ended Mr. Seymour 's legislative career . It has not been possible to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active and leading part . For almost the whole period of his service in the legislature , the assembly comprised a far more than ordinary number . of able and influential men , and from his first entrance into that body , he took rank among the foremost . It may be said that his personal influence was greater than that of any other member . The courtesy , liberality and generosity , marking his whole course as a member , contributed , in a great degree , to secure for him the position , which his skill and ability in debate , combined with his admitted sagacity and tact , fairly entitled him to . The upholders of the integrity of the Democratic party owe him a lasting debt of gratitude , for the steadiness and power which he brought to bear in the defence of sound principles of policy , and the time.honored landmarks of their political faith . In adverting briefly to Mr. Seymour 's course in the subsequent political movements in the state , a deserved tribute must be paid to the untiring zeal and devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore the Democratic party of the state to its proper and commanding position . With the termination of his legislative services , also ended the ascendency of the party in the legislative and executive departments of the government . Faction had done its work , and produced its inevitable // consequences . The administration of Gov . Wright , from which so much had been hoped , was no more successful in combining the discordant eleinents into harmonious action , than that of Goy . Bouck . The divisionist , having control of the Canal Board , by a bitterly proscriptive policy in their appointments , together with the vindictive and violent course pursued by the presses in their interest throughout the state , produced such as pervading feeling of indignation and disgust among the masses of the party , that it was found to be impossible to rally their strength at the polls : and in the election of 1846 , the Democratic party of New-York sustained a total and inglorious defeat . The adoption of the new constitution brought the election of the state officers , theretofore made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit among the masses of the Democratic party , and a spontaneous and irresistible movement among them , in all parts of the state , demanded that " new men , " uncontaminated with the feuds at Albany , should be nominated to the state offices . This movement met with a most desperate resistance from the incumbents and their adherents , who demanded a renomination . Their whole power was brought to bear in opposition to it , but the popular wave was not to be stayed . The friends of " new men " carried a decided majority of the delegates to the state convention of 1847 , and " new men " were nominatted . Then it was , that that faction took its last and fatal step to destruction . Infuriated by their defeat , the divisionists threw their " firebrand of freedom "  --  the " Wilmot Proviso , " which only a few hours before had been voted down in their own caucus , receiving only six votes in its favor-into the convention , to distract and divide it . It was laid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the adjournment , to call another convention and set up an organization against the election of the ticket nominated . Of the regular convention , Mr. Seymour was a leading and distinguished member , and sustained with firmness and consistency the voice of the democratic masses . This is as far as we can here trace the progress of this division and dcfection . The question of organization ( which was really no question at all ) went to the National Convention . To the view which we have given of its treatment there , nothing farther need be added than that it was the action , or inaction , of that body , on that question , that formally and effectually divided the party in New-York . It is unnecessary to dwell upon the disastrous result of the election of 1848 . Since that memorable period , Mr. Seymour has been more prominent than , perhaps , any other man , in endeavoring to close the breach between the Old Line democrats and the seceders . Believing that the masses of the latter had not lost their attachment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led astray under the influence of clamor and misrepresentation , he has been " instant in season and out of season , " in his efforts to restore them to their former position on the national democratic platform . Many doubt the probability , some the possibility , of the success of this effort , as far as the leaders are concerned ; but the laudability of the intention ought not to be questioned . A seeming approach has been made to the result , and it is to be hoped that the action of this fall 's convention may contribute to its further advancement . The effect of Mr. Seymour 's course in all these movements , as far as he is personally concerned , could not perhaps be more clearly manifested than by his securing , last fall , a unanimous nomination from a convention com // posed of both sections , for Governor of the state . The breach of faith on the part of a few of those in whose behalf he had made such strenuous efforts , defeated him by a little over two hundred votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office had ever been beaten , He wa* supported , with great unanimity , by the masses of the Democratic party generally throughout the state ; and , as he was opposed by the antirenters and all other factions , his close run must be regarded as a striking evidence of his strength with the people . But , as we have said before , the democracy of the state have still their hopeful eye fixed steadily upon him , and are not likely to allow another opportunity of showing their attachment and regard to be lost . Mr. Seymour has been again , and very recently , called prominently before the people , by the extraordinary circumstances attending the passage , by the whig majority in the last legislature , of a bill providing for the immediate enlargement of the Erie Canal , and directing an appropriation of the revenues of the state in direct contravention of the provisions of the constitution . His intimate knowledge of the whole subject , and the active and influential part he had taken in the legislature in carrying out the demands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial credit of the state , and to burden it with debt , without providing definite and specific means for its payment , seemed to make it especially his duty , to raise his voice in resisting this shameless effort to override the provisions of a constitution so recently adopted by the people . Accordingly , during the late canvass for the election to supply the places of those senators who resigned for the questionable purpose of breaking up the legislature , Mr. Seymour eloquently and forcibly denounced before the people , in various portions of the state , the barefaced attempt to violate the sanctity of their constitution . The unprecedented and indefensible course which had been taken by the resigning senators , however , raised an extraneous issue which rendered his efforts and those of other able defenders of the guarantees of the constitution , in a great measure , nugatory , and would , indeed , have rendered the eloquence of an army of Ciceros of little avail in preventing the inevitable result which an ordinary sagacity would have enabled these legislative Solons to foresee . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the dissensions in the Democratic party of New-York , is necessarily very incomplete . The writer has found his limits entirely inadequate to do any thing like justice to the subject . As far as it goes , however , it presents the true aspect in which these divisions are to be regarded . The same cause has also made the sketch of Mr. Seymour 's political course little else than a mere outline . Although this sketch is styled a " political portrait , " it may not be inappropriate to add a word in regard to the personal and social qualities of Mr. Seymour . The courtesy and liberality of his conduct in public life were not more distinctly marked , than are his urbanity and generosity in private intercourse . His " troops of friends " among all those with whom he is brought in contact , constitute a " cloud of witnesses " to bear testimony to his general kindness of heart , and the many acts of delicate courtesy and considerate benevolence which eminently characterize him as a citizen and as a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
