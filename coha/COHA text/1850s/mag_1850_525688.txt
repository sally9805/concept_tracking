CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY . It is our melancholy duty to record the death of General Zachary Taylor , President of the United States . At thirty*five minutes past ten of the evening of July 9 , in the sixtysixth year of his age , President Taylor expired after a brief illness , occasioned by exposure on the fourth of July . This event , so totally unexpected from the well known vigor of health always enjoyed by the President , has been met by the most unequivocal and sincere regret from all parts of the country , and from men of all parties . None were prepared to see the veteran who had passed through severe military duties in the swamps of Florida , and on the plains of Mexico , unharmed by bullet or pestilence , struck down in the midst of his friends , and in the high station to which his country had raised him . The sincerity of purpose , and unbending rectitude of President Taylor , had drawn out not only the attachment of those of his own political principles , but the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his character , and his republican plainness of manners , contrasted with the greatness of his military achievements , had inspired in all hearts a*pride in him as being the man of the times . We fully believe that the grandeur of his public career , and the unpretending integrity of his private life , though acknowledged now , will only meet with due appreciation from posterity . His virtues are now partially concealed by the rush of events into which the latter portion of his life was thrown . But when the present becomes history , what is now love for an eminent fellow-citizen , will become enthusiasm for the republican chief . His last words were : - " I am prepared ; I have endeavored to do my duty . " In the elevation of General Zachary Taylor to the Presidency , we see not only the virtues of the man , but the presence of similar characteristics in the people whose votes raised him into power . We see not only the admiration for miltary deeds , which proceeds from the element of ardor and enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to our national institutions , but the straight-forward views , and the home-loving habits of the great body of our fellow-citizens . The quiet parlor at the White House was the home , not only of President Taylor , but of the genius of the American people . Few men rise into power except by embodying in their own persons , the thoughts , opinion , or wishes of those with whom the power rests . Here lies the source of the universal sorrow that chilled the whole country on the death of our late President . Zachary Taylor , with all his military renown , would have been out of place at the head of the French republic ; with all his plainness anil freedom from ostentation , he would never have suited the earlier revolutionists of the same nation . As much as the sober , lawabiding , conservative liberty of our people differs from the revelry and license of that period , does President Taylor differ from their sans cullottes chiefs ; and for like reasons , the republican simplicity at Washington could never degenerate into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues and simple dignity that early Rome demanded in her generals and civic leaders , mitigated in this age by a higher civilization , have raised to the presidency the mild and kind-hearted , but resolute man that a nation now mourns . The following judicious observations , taken from the Literary World of July 20 , show the singular degree in which the feelings of the cotmntry had become enlisted in the welfare of its first citizen " One of the most affecting incidents we have heard connected with the death of General Taylor , that great event which has , more than any similar incident of many years , touched the heart of the American community , is the circumstance of crowds of the country people flocking to the railway stations to ascertain if this sudden report could be true . This individualizes to our minds the interest in the late President felt by the masses , which seems vague and indefinite , abstract and remote , when spoken of simply as felt by the country . The nation collectively does feel this calamity , but in this incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . We see the men coming from their houses and from their labors , seeking news of a personal friend , and we may imagine some // Congressional Summary . qwq the parallel in their lives and fortunes . There were grounds for the suggestion of resemhlance . Both were remarkable , not merely for their military and civic worth , but for the same modesty and sincerity in its manifestation . Talking with neither at Washington would you have been likely to to be reminded of the soldier . They did not carry the military man out of the camp , or battle field . Members of a profession , the military , the most prone to public display and the exercise of l ) ersonal vanity , - a profession living*on the breath of popular admiration in proportion as it is essentially unsupported by the healthy natural instincts of society-neither bore about him that atmosphere of egotism apt to invest great popular commanders . People heard no trumpetings from Washington of Trenton , or from Taylor of Buena Vista . The latter can afford to throw discredit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this moderation regarding his military calling is seen in the notices written of him since his death . His friends seem to have forgotten his brilliant Mexican victories in their consideration of him as a man , a lover of justice . of moderation , of simple habits , the firm patriot and Piotector of the Union ,  --  the President of the whole American People . His memory , it is felt , does not need the tinsel glorification of ordinary military fame . " The public view of President Taylor of late was blended with the consideration of the peculiar state questions in which his office was connected . It will now return to the man as he first became known to the people in the half-forgotten epithet , " Old Zack . " His douoh* ty resolution , his courage , his honesty , * plain sincerity , his simple " rough and ready " manners , come back to us as we recall the time when the whole nation hung in suspense upon his movements in a fcreign land , with his isolated band of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peril , and the perlilexities of statesmanship at home would have been aggravated by his defeat ,  - -  but that defeat was never heard of . Still he fought on and fought it out , repaired all the errors of the campaign by victory , and still remained the placid , calm Zachary Taylor , with not a trace of egotism or vanity about him . lt was felt that enough of the man lay under the soldier to support the civilian , and that such virtues were useful to any station . They were fast proving so in the capital , At a meeting of the Historical Society , in New York , President Charles King , of Columbia College , made the following eloquent re-marks : The fact that such a man presided over the country-when Disunion raised its hideous head , was of itself a guarantee-slaveliolder as he was , that he would not permit the Republic to receive any detriment , and although men , the most eminent among the statesmen of our country , took other views-not to say conflicting views  --  the confidence , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President would adhere to it , relieved the question of much embarrassment , and the public mind of much anxiety . Reposing with entire faith in this conviction , I was startled , as by the voice of an earthquake , and almost with the earthquakes ' ominous portent , at the annunciation of General TAYLOR 'S death . It would be unseasonable wholly on this occasion , and to such an audience quite superfluous , to dwell upon the rriilitary career of Gen. TAYLOR . It is too brilliant , as well as too recent , to require anything more than this partial allusion to it , as developing the virtues , the moderation , and the humanity of high Christian civilization and morality , not less signally than the martial qualities of valor and enterprise iii battle , and of fortitude and selfreliance in all privation and difficulties . Returning laurel-crowned and victorious from a foreign war , he was hailed , from his first landing on his iiative strand , as the future President . With what unaffected modesty he received these new honors-how scrul ) ulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like seeking this high office-how calmly and how simply , when installed as President , he bore his honors-how resolutely he has encountered the urgent claims of the station upon all his faculties  --  and with what truly national views he had inaugurated his administration-I need not attempt to recite . But when contrasting the universal trust in him , to carry the country triumphaiitly through its difficulties -- with the suddenness an ( 1 the completeness of his overthrow from the summit of earthly power -- we reflect upon our shivered hopes and frail human reliances-we may exclaim with the eloquent French preacher , " God alone is great ; " and although , in the presumption of human success , we be too lit18*l0. // tie mindful of this truth , it is most irresistibly brought home to every heart by one such signal demonstration as that we are now called to mourn . I confess myself , sir , to have been , and still to be deeply moved by this most unexpected and most lamented death . With no other interest now in political men and political events than such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn , most happily for myself , from the public arena , where for so many years I was an earnest combatant , I yet had not been unmindful of the scenes passing at Washington . What American , loving his country , could be 1 But I had been little excited by them , and not at all by the hot breath of Disunion , sent forth by turbulent agitators at the seat of Government-living in their own little circle , heating each other by reciprocal action  --  and uttering the cries of their crazy fanaticism as though it were the great voice of the people . I knew that the masses were sound-  --  and that , however politicians might rave , they could not and would not be permitted to shake the glorious fabric of our Union . I trusted in these masses-  --  and I trusted , too , in that single-hearted patriotic brave old soldier , whom the unerring instinct of those masses had called from the field to the Executive chair . Other men there were of all parties , better known and more eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of those in so great a degree as he , took hold of the popular heart , and inspired it with the confidence , that in the Presidential chair , as at Palo Alto , Resaca , Monterey , and Buena Vista , he would be master of himself , and , therefore , probably master of events . In presence of the two Houses of Congress , Mr. WEBSTER spoke in eulogy of President Taylor , to the following effect : At a time when remarkable health and happiness is enjoyed throughout the whole country , it has pleased Divine Providence to visit the Houses of Congress with repeated occasions of mourning and lamentation . Since the commencement of the Session , we have followed two of our members to their last home* and we are now called upon to take a part in the solemnities of the funeral of the President of the United States . Truly has a great man fallen among us . The late President , a soldier by profession , after a splendid career of military service , had , at the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States with such a regard and confidence that , without solicitation , or devious policy , ' without turning a hair 's breadth from the path of duty , the popular vote and voice conferred upon him the highest civil authority in the nation . We can not forget that the pub . lic feeling was carried away in a degree by the eclat of military renown . A high respect for noble feats of arms has ever been found in the hearts of the members of a popular government . But it was not to this alone that President Taylor owed his acceptability with the people and his advancement to high civil trust . " 1 believe , " said Mr. WEBSTER , " that , associated with these qualities , there was spread throughout the community a high degree of confidence and faith in the integrity and honor and uprightness of the man . I believe he was especially regarded as both a firm and mild man , in the exercise of authority . And I have observed more than once in this , and in other popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind , for conferring high power on individuals , is a confidence in their mildness . Their parental protection is regarded as a sure and safe character . The people naturally feel safe where they feel themselves to be under the control and protection of sober council -- men of impartial minds , and a general paternal superintendence . I suppose , sir , that no case ever happened in the very best days of the Roman Republic , where any man found himself clothed with the highest authority in the State , under circumstances more repelling all suspicion of personal application , all suspicion of pursuing any crooked path in politics , or all suspicion of having been actuated by sinister views and purposes , than in the case of the worthy , and eminent , and distinguished , and good man , whose death we now deplore . " Ma . SEwARD 's speech in Senate , July 2 , 1850 . The Compromise Bill being under consideration , MR . SEWARD having the floor , spoke to the following effect : If an alien in our land were to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stranger and an enemy , or an unwelcome intruder , or a fugitive , powerless , and importunate , or a dangerous oppressor . California is none of this . She has yielded to persuasion , and not to conquest ; she has delivered to us the treasures of the eastern world ; but she refuses to allow us to buy and sell each other within her domain . This is the head and front of her offending . The President of the United States recommends that California shall be admitted unconditionally , while a committee of the Senate insists on conditions . I prefer , said MR . SEWARD , the President 's suggestion , not merely because it is the President 's , though he fully trusted in his patriotism and wisdom , nor out of disrespect to the statesmen by whom it was opposed , but because the proposed conditions were unreasonable and oppressive in regard to California . These conditions are the establishment of a territorial government in New // Mexico , silent concerning slavery ; the establishment of a like government at Washington ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas ; and some collateral conditions respecting slavery in the District of Columbia , the recapture of fugitives , etc . It is not contended that California needs the aid of those measures ; hut she is avowedly taxed to carry in safety into port , what would be utterly lost without such assistance . And why should California be subjected to this embarrassment i She does not come to us without right ; for she has a treaty which is neither denied nor questioned . Her necessities are great , for her anomalous condition touches not only our sense of justice , but our compassion . She is not the cause of these difficulties , for she neither brought the states into confederation , nor framed the constitution ; she neither planted slavery in the slave states , nor uprooted it in the free states ; she neither invades New Mexico with Texas , nor resists Texas with New Mexico ; she neither buys , sells , holds , emancipates , reclaims , or harbors slaves ; she has neither speech nor vote in this angry strife ; she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah and New Mexico . The slave states indeed insist on a right to colonize new territory with a caste , but do not deny that the community in such territory may establish a constitution without a caste ; and this , California , already colonized and mature , has done for herself . We have been told that California would save time by yielding to this most unjust combination , and the error of this hope has been fully demonstrated . We have been told that a minority in another part of the legislature might prevent her admission , and even arrest the action of the general government . But it must work in its own democratic and constitutional way , or must cease to work at all ; for surely no one or more of the states can assume the responsibility of bringing the government to a ( lead stand by faction . These conditions are equally unreasonable in regard to Texas , New Mexico , Utah , and the District of Columbia , for each of these parties asks only a just award , and Congress is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . The incongruous combination of these claims seems adapted to enable senators to speak on one side and vote for the other ; to promote The Wilmot proviso , and yet defeat its application to the only territories open to its introduction . While I leave , said MR . SEWARD , the interests of Texas in the care of her honorable and excellent senators , I must be allowed to think that their consent to this bill betrays a want of confidence in her claims or in the justice of Congress . A just claim ought not to need an unjust combination . Those who assume that Texas has a valid title to all of New Mexico east of the Rio Grande , as high as the 42d parallel , will necessarily regard that state as surrendering , for a pecuniary equivalent , an extensive region effectively secured to slavery , to the equivocations of this compromise . Those , on the contrary , who regard the pretensions of Texas in New Mexico as groundless , will as certainly protest against the surrender of 70,000 square miles of soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of these parties , I think , must agree that the United States ought not to pay Texas the equivalent unless her title is good , and that if her title is good , then the United States have no constitutional power to buy her territory . If they may buy a part of Texas for purposes not defined in the constitution , they may buy the whole . If they may buy the territory of a slave state to make it free , they may equally buy the soil of a free state to sterilize with slavery . If it be replied that the title is in dispute , then the transaction changes character . The equivalent is paid for peace , and Texas is not yet lifted up so high , nor the United States brought down so low , as to obtain my consent to so humiliating a traffic . He could vote , the senator continued . to pay the debt of Texas , on the ground that the repudiation in the agreement of annexation was fraudulent . But Texas prefers that we should buy domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must satisfy us then concerning the cardinal points in the bargain , viz : First , The reasonableness of the amount to be paid . Second , The value of the equivalent . Third , The title of the vendor . Fourth , The use to which the territory is to be applied . The amount to be paid in the bill of compromise is set down in blank , and the blank kept open . We are obliged to assume that Texas is to be paid more than her claim is worth , since she will not trust to a distinct and independent negociation . The payment is a condition of the admission of California ; and thus we see California tbe desire of the nation and the envy of the world , chaffering with money-changers and stock-jobbers to obtain her admission into the Union . The extent and value of the acquisition are equally unsatisfactory . When the question is on the sum to be paid , Texas owns nearly all New Mexico , but when it comes on the domain to be obtained , it turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that province to save the rest . Surely if we concede to Texas the admiration her representatives require , they must admit that she knows how to coin our admiration into gold . // 208 Congresszonat Summary . Concerning the title , it is beyond dispute that the territory which Texas offers , was from time immemorial , an integral part of New Mexico ; that not an acre of it was ever in the possession of Texas , either by bargain , by conquest , or by treaty concession ; and that the United States found it in the possession of New Mexico , conquered , bought it , and holds it by treaty solemnly executed . Texas , it is true , asserted in 1826 , by a law on her statute-book , that her boundary should be the 42d parallel ; that is , she declared her purpose to conquer so much of New Mexico . B ut this purpose she never executed , she came into the Union without it , and her statute was , therefore , mere brutem fulmen . The United States , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claim ot Texas . Subsequently the United States waged war against Mexico , not for the claim of Texas , but for other causes , and being thus engaged , accepted New Mexico and California as indemnities for the expenses of the contest , after paying fifteen millions of dollars for their excess in value . Thus the United States , free from obligation to Texas , acquired the territory of New Mexico , making the conquest and paying the whole consideration alone . The claim of Texas is as groundless in equity , as by the strict rules of law ; it is as good to the whole of California as to New Mexico . With regard to the purposes to which the territory is to be applied , the proposition is equally unsatisfactory . New Mexico is free soil now by the operation of unrepealed Mexican laws ; the bill might raise a doubt upon that subject . I prefer , said Mr. SEwARD , to leave New Mexico as it is . Every phase of this compromise exhibits injustice to New Mexico , and a dismemberment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas already possessing a vast and fertile domain , is to be still further enriched at the expense of New Mexico , less extensive and comparatively sterile . This perversion of right proceeds upon the ground that either New Mexico has no certain title , or that she has no political government to defend it . But this province was a distinct colony of Spain . She was a State in the Republic of Mexico , and afterwards a political territory in that Republic . She has domain , population , resources and qualified dominion , arts , customs , laws , and religion . She has all of the elements of greatness , subordinate to the United States , but nevertheless distinctly apart from other communities . Pressed by the encroachments of Texas , and by the jealousy of the slave States , she implores from us the protection of her territory and of her constitution . Her ancient charter contains the glowing words established by the consent of mankind , and which Jefferson has made our own : All men naturally were born free , and were by privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey earthly authority , not derived from their own consent . ' That charter is in our own hands . If we erase this principle , and give it back to New Mexico , a mutilated and lifeless thing , we shall have repeated the crime of the partition of Poland , the crime of the subversion of the recent Republic of Italy , the crime of the Stuart who seized the charters of the free corporations of England , and lost a throne , and of the Guelph who interpolated taxation without representation into the constitution of Britain , and lost a continent . It would be an act so unjust and tyrannical , that upon the principles of our separation from Great Britain , it would forfeit our title altogether . But it is said the ordinance of 87 is unnecessary in New Mexico , and therefore is an abstraction , and that it gives offence . I can not , said Mr. SEWARD , yield implicit faith to those who assure me that the peculiarities of soil and climate in New Mexico exclude slavery . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bill itself expressly concedes it , by covenanting to admit New Mexico as a slave State should she come in that character . There are slaves at this moment in Utah , and a benevolent purpose can not be conceded to arguments which knit contradictions as closely as words can lie together . All promulgations of rights are necessarily abstractions . Our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States are full of such abstractions ; the constitutions of some of the slave States contain them , hopefully looking to future realization . The abstraction now in question is the right of all the members of a State to equal political freedom . That is the Wilmot provisothe proviso of freedom . It can be renounced safely nowhere , certainly not in New Mexico , which is the very field of contest . It is the vantage ground of freedom , and if we surrender here , where else shall we make resistance * We have taken a breathing spell from Annexation of Territory , to divide the gains . this division once made , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies , and invigorated by martial ambition , will hurry us on in a career that presents scarce formidable obstructions . Whatever seemed attractive to the Slave States in Louisiana , in Florida , in Texas in New Mexico amid in California , is surpassed in the Valley of Mexico , in Yucatan , in Cuba , in Nicaragua , in Guatemala and in other States of Central America . There are fields native to the Tobacco plant , to the Rice plant , to the Cotton plant , and to the sugar cane and the tropical fruits ; and there are even mines of silver and of gold . There the climate disposes to indolence , indolence to luxu // 211 ry , and luxury to Slavery . There , those who can read the Wilmot Proviso only in the rigors of perpetual winter , or in arid sands , will fail to discern its inhibition . Our pioneers are already abroad in these inviting regions . Our capital is making passages through them from ocean to ocean ; and within ten years these passages will be environed by American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in numbers , the unsettled and unenterprising States now existing there . You will say that National moderation will prevent further Annexation . But National moderation did not hold us back from the Mississippi , nor from the Nueces , nor from the Rio Grande , nor from the coast of the Pacific ocean . The virtue grows weaker always as the nation grows stronger . " The demand of the Slave States for a division line of 36* 30 ' , or elsewhere across the continent , between Slavery in the South and Freedom in the North , betrays the near expectation of these conquests . The domestic production and commerce in slaves will supplant the African slave trade , and new Slave States will surround the Gulf of Mexico and cover its islands . These new States , combined with Slave States already existing , will constitute a Slave Empire , whose seat of commerce on the Crescent Levee will domineer not only over the Southern portion of the continent , but through the Mississippi and its far-reaching tributaries , over the valley between the Alleghanies and the Rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaveholder , and this is the interpretation thereof . I know full well that it is woven of the stuff which all dreams are made of : ' I know how hopeless would be the attempt to establish and to maintain such States , and an Empire composed of such States . But I know that nothing seems to Slavery impossible , after advantages already won , and that calamities distant , and therefore divided , will not deter it from the prosecution of its purpose , or extinguish the hope of success . " Cherishing these opinions , said Mr. SEwARD , I have struggled hard to extend the ordinance of 87 over New Mexico . Failing in that , he should fall hack , as in the case of California , and leave New Mexico to the protection of her ancient laws , deeming her more safe than in the suspicious security of the coinpromise . This is non-intervention , but it is compulsory , and not the non-intervention of treachery . This is the plan proposed by the President , who anticipated the present failure from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we al cipated it . 1 might well have anti Another condition in the bill of compromise , relates to slavery in the District of Columbia . This District , the offspring of the Republic , is cherished equally by all the States ; but it VOL . VI . NO . II . NEW SERIES . lacks , in the high position that the destinies of the nation will give it , one element of prosperity , the freedom of labor , and one element of greatness , the dignity of labor . Are these great interests of the Capital to be kept down by the weight of California-not California by herself , for she would need no assistance , but California loaded with the weight of your gratuity to Texas , and of the suppression of freedom in Utah and New Mexico * The scheme of compromise has engrossed the Senate six months to the exclusion of every other measure . We have been driven and harrassed into its consideration by alarms of danger to the Republic . The Commonwealth labored with wounds that threatened its safety . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of which is the alleged neglect to surrender fugitive slaves . It has not been proved that three fugitives a year are withheld against lawful demand . Nay , said Mr. SEWARD , I think it is not proved that even one is so withheld . The value of slave property has not been impaired one dollar . Where then is the evil * The people of the free States hesitate at the execution of the act of 1793 among them , without an adequate provision for distinguishing between the real fugitive and the free citizen . The remedy proposed is to allow , after surrender , a trial to the alleged fugitive in the State to which he is conveyed ; a remedy which will only serve to aggravate the evil . Are we then prepared to confess that this proud Republic approaches its downfall because a slave sometimes finds refuge under it in spite of its laws * The next of these evils is the agitation of slavery in the District of Columbia . There are only a thousand slaves here , all told . The people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently until the mind of the nation can be moved to abolish it . The bill proposes to stop the traffic in slaves , and in lieu thereof , to exact a guarantee for the continuance of slavery . This is healing the wound by plunging the knife more deeply in . The next evil is the encroachment of Texas upon new Mexico . Well , we will leave the territory of New Mexico in the keeping of the President , and her free institutions to the care of her own people , until she can come here as a State , and demand admission into the Union . The fourth of these disasters is the solitude of 10,000 Mormons in the basin of the Salt Lake . But this solitude is of their own choosing ; and when they have gathered a population adequate to sustain a State Government , they can establish one ; and , in the meantime , they are living under the protection of our laws and arms . The only real wound , then , upon the body politic is , the suspension of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heal immediately , and by itself alone . Still , it is said that the country is irritated and distracted . The country is neither irritated nor excited , but worried and become impatient by our own delays . But it is replied , the slavery question must be settled . The slavery question never can be settled , at least hy this bill . Slavery and Freedom are conflicting systems , brought together by the union of the States , but not harmonized nor neutralized . Their antagonism is radical , and therefore perpetual . In entering the career of conquest , you have kindled to a fierce heat the fire you seek to extinguish , by throwing into them the fuel of Propagandism  --  the propagandism of slavery , and the propagandism of freedom  --  and on neither side can it be arrested . The sea is covered with exiles , and they swarm over the land . Emigration from all quarters of the globe goes on , and must go on , in obedience to laws higher than the Constitution . They form continuous , unbroken processions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and wherever colonies , states , or nations are founded , labor is always there , and commences its strife for freedom and power . " You may slay the Wilmot proviso in the Senate Chamber , and bury it beneath the capitol to-day , the corse in complete steel will haunt your legislative halls to-morrow . When the strife is ended in the territories you now possess , it will be renewed on ne'v fields ; for both of the parties know , there is yet the word hereafter . ' " We subjoin the following Resolutions , as unanimously adopted on the 10th of June , by the Convention at Nashville . They seem to present two alternatives for the settlement of the controversy , viz. The early enactment by Congress of such laws as may be necessary and expedient to secure to the slaveholder wishing to emigrate to the territories with his slaves , his rights of ownership in them ; or a partition of the territories between the sections of the country upon the basis of the Missouri Compromise line . TUE RESOLUTIONS . 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people of the several States of this Union as their common property ; that the citizens of the several States have equal rights to migrate with their property to these Territories , and are equally entitled to the protection of the Federal Government in the enjoyment of that property so long as the Territories remain under the charge of that Government . 2 . Resolved , That Congress has no power to exclude from the territory of the United States any property lawfully held in the States of the Union , and any acts which may be passed by Congress to affect this result is a plain violation of the Consti tution of the United States . 3 . Resolved , That it is the duty of Congress to provide governments for the Territories , since the spirit of American institutions forbids the maintenance of military governments in time of peace ; and as all laws heretofore existing in Territories once belonging to foreign powers which interfere with the full enjoyment of religion , the freedom of the press , the trial by jury , and all other rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution of the United States , are iiecessarily void so soon as such territories become American Territories , it is the duty of the Federal Government to make early provision for the enactment of those laws which may be expedient and necessary to secure to the inhabitants of and emigrants to such Territories the full benefit of the constitutional rights we assert . 4 . Resolved , That to protect property existing in the several States of the Union , the people of these States invested the Federal Government with the powers of war and negotiation , and of sustaining armies and navies , and prohibited to State authorities the exercise of the same powers . They made no discrimination in the protection to be afforded or the description of the property to be defended , nor was it allowed to the Federal Government to determine what should be held as property . Whatever the States deal with as property the Federal Government is bound to recognise and defend as such . Therefore it is the sense of this convention that all acts of the Federal Government which tend to denationalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States , or that discriminate in the degree and efficiency of the protection to be afforded to it , or which weaken or destroy the title of any citizen upon American Territories , are plain and palpable viotations of the fundamental law under which it exists . 5 . Resolved , That the slaveholding States can not and will not submit to the enactment by Congress of any law imposing onerous conditions or restraints upon the rights of masters to remove with their property into the Territories of the United States , or to any law making discriminations in favor of the proprietors of other property against them . 6 . Resolved , That it is the duty of the Federal Government plainly to recognize and firmly to maintain the equal rights of the citizens of the several States in the Territories of the United States , and to repudiate the power to make a discrimination between the proprietors of different species of property in the Federal legislation . The fulfilment of this duty by the Federal Government would greatly tend to restore the peace of the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different sections of the Union . For it is the deliberate opinion of this Convention that the tolerance Congress has given to the notion that Federal authority might be employed incidentally and indirectly or to subvert or weaken the institutions existing in the States confessedly beyond Federal jurisdiction and control , is a main cause of the oiscord which menaces the existence of the Union , and which has well nigh // destroyed the efficient action of the Federal Government itself . 7 . Resolved , That the performance of this duty is required by the fundamental law of the Union . The equality of the people of the several States composing the Union can not be distnrbed without disturbing the frame of the American institutions . This principle is violated in the denial to the citizens of the slaveholding States of power to enter into the Territories with the property lawfully acquired in the States . The warfare against this right is a war upon the Constitution . The defenders of this right are defenders of the Constitution . Those who deny or impair its exercise , are unfaithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right , they are the disunionists . S. Resolved , That the performance of its duties , upon the principle we declare , would enable Congress to remove the embarrassments in which the country is now involved . The vacant territories of the United States , no longer regarded as prizes for sectional rapacity and ambition , would be gradually occupied by inhabitants drawn to them by their interests and feelings . The institutions fitted to them would be naturally applied by governments formed on American ideas , and approved by the deliberate choice of their constituents . The community would be educated and disciplined under a republican administration in habits of self-government , and fitted for an association as a State , and to the enjoyment of a plaqe in the Confederacy . A community so brined and otganized might well claim admission to the Union , and none would dispute the validity of the claim . 9 . Resolved , That a recognition of this principle would deprive the questions between Texas and the United States of their sectional character , and would leave them for adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnanimity and justice . 10 . Resolved , That a recognition of this principle would infuse a spirit of conciliation in the discussion and adjustment of all the subjects of sectional dispute , which would afford a guaranty of an early and satisfactory determination . 11 . Resolved , That in the event a dominant majority shall refuse to recognize the great constitutional rights we assert , and shall continue to deny the obligations of the Federal Government to maintain them , it is the sense of this convention that the Territories should be treated as property , and divided between the sections of the Union , so that the rights of both sections be adequately secured in their respective shares . That we are aware this course is open to grave objections , but we are ready to acquiesce in the adoption of the line of 36* 30* north latitude , extending to the Pacific ocean , as an extreme concession , upon considerations of what is due to the stability of our institutions . 12 . Resolved , That it is the opinion of this convention that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutional rights of the southern people , or by an equitable partition of the Territories . That the spectacle of a confederacy of States , inv*dved in quarrels over the fruits of a war in which the American arms were crowned with glory , is humiliating . That the incorporation of the Wilmot proviso , in the offer of settlement  --  a proposition which fourteen States regard as disparaging and dishonorable-is degrading to the country . A termination to this controversy by the disruption of the Confederacy , or by the abandonment of the Territories to prevent such a result , would be a climax to the shame which attaches to the controversy which it is the paramount duty of Congress to avoid . 13 . Resolved , That this convention will not conclude that Congress will adjourn without making an adjustment of this controversy ; and in the condition in which the convention finds the questions before Congress , it does not feel at liberty to discuss the methods suitable for a resistance to measures not yet adopted , which might involve &amp; dishonor to the Southern States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks after the adjournment of the present Congress . On the last day of their session , the convention adopted an address to the following effect to the people of Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Tennessee , Kentucky , Lousiana , Texas , Missouri , and Arkansas . They had met together , they stated* in obedience to the commands of those they represented , to confer with each other concerning the relation of the people of the Southern States towards the general government , and the non-slaveholding states of the Union , on the subject of slavery . It is sixteen years since this question and the Southern rights connected with it , began to be assailed in Congress . The agitation was commenced by claiming the right to petition Congress on any subject whatever ; among the rest , those interdicted to the general government by the constitution . But it was clear that the right to petition a legislative body must be limited by its powers of legislation , for a petition is only the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask of another to do what he has no moral or legal right to do . Nor can any tribunal have the power to receive and consider any matter beyond its jurisdiction . The claim , therefore , to present petitions on this subject , was consilered as an attempt indirectly to assume jurisdiction over slavery throughout the Union . The ultimate object of their assailants was the overthrow of slave institutions , but their attacks were aimed chiefly at its existence in the District of Columbia , and at the internal slave-trade . Conscious of the fatal tendency of this agitation in Congress , to destroy the peace and stability of the Union , an effort was made , supported by a large portion of the Northern members , to suppress it by a rule in the House of Representatives , which provided that all petitions of this kind should be neither considered , printed , nor referred . This rule // was assailed by the North as an infringement on the right of petition , and finally fell before their almost unanimous voice , and thus the unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress was asserted . But this was only one of the means of agitation set on foot by the people of the Northern States . Newspapers were set up , and lecturers sent through the country to excite it against the institutions of the South , organizations were started to carry off slaves , and to protect them by forcible means . Though the Constitution of the United States requires that fugitive slaves , like fugitives from justice , should be rendered up by the States to which they may have fled , the legislatures of every Northern State passed laws with the txpressed purpose of defeating this provision . *I'he agitation was even introduced into the religious associations throughout the Union , and produced a separation in the Baptist and Methodist churches . Thus was an institution exclusively belonging to the South , wrested from its control , and instead of receiving the protection due to it from the general government , became the object of its unceasing attack . On the breaking out of the Mexican war , instead of the hearty co-operation of all sections of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation by endeavoring to thrust the question of slavery into the very first appropriation bill for carrying on operations . On the close of the war , an immense territory was added to the United States . The previous threats were realized , and the non-slaveholding States immediately claimed to exclude the people of the Southern States from all territory acquired , and to appropriate it to themselves . This pretension , arising not merely from a lust of power , but from a settled purpose of abolishing slavery by the multiplication of nonslaveholding States in the Union , is as alarming as it is insulting . The Southern States have consequently set forth with great unanimity , in their several legislatures , their rights in the territories of the United States , and have declared their determination to maintain these rights , and the more effectually to effect that purpose the present convention has assembled . These transactions now force upon our attention the degraded position occupied by the South in the councils of the country . Their representatives daily insulted by the most opprobious epithets directed to the institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Congress become little else than a grand instrument in the hands of the abolitionists to degrade and ruin the South . As States , the South has from its sister States denunciation and contumely ; as a part of the Union , it has from the rest of the Union aggression and robbery . They are not to extend on account of their institutions , while the North are to increase and multiply , that the shame of slavery hy their philanthropic efforts may be extinguished from among you . But were the South to yield everything the North now requires , would their demands stop here * These are all means aiming at one great end  --  the abolition of slavery in the States . In fifty years , twenty new non-slaveholding States may be added , whilst many more which are now slaveholding , may be joined to the list . Then there will be no need to put aside the Constitution to effect their grand purpose . The non-slaveholding States will then have the power by two-thirds in Congress , and three-fourths of the States , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consummate their policy . But while Northern aggressions have been thus advancing , the South has adopted a suicidal course of action . They have been passive , whilst their supporters and the defenders of the constitution , in the Northern States , in their efforts to protect them from the agitations of slavery in Congress have been politically annihilated , or have turned their foes . They have tamely acquiesced , until to hate and persecute the South has become a high passport to honor and power in the Union . They have waited until the Constitution of the United States has been virtually abolished- ? r , what is worse , has become what the majority in Congress think fit to make it . That great principle which leaves to the general government only what is general in its nature , and reserves for the local governments whatever is local and sectional , is uprooted from the Constitution , and Congress has become a sectional despotism , totally irresponsible to the people of the South , at the same time that it is ignorant of its feelings , condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , such results will not seem to be either new or strange . There is but omie condition in which one people can be safe under the dominion of another people , and that is when their interests are entirely identical . Thea the dominant can not oppress the subject people without oppressing themselves . The identity of interest between them is the security of right government . But , as this identity can scarcely ever exist between any two people , history bears but one testimony as to the fate of the subject people . They have always been compelled to minister to the prosperity and aggrandizement of their masters . If this has always been the case under the ordinary difference of interests and feelings which exist between States , how much more certainly must the experience of history be realized between the // People of the Northern and Southern States . Here is a difference of climate and productions throughout a territory stretching along the whole belt of the temperate zone , affecting the pursuits and character of the people inhabiting it . But the great difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist among a people-is the institution of slavery . This alone sets apart the Southern States as a peculiar people , with whom independence , as to their internal policy , is the condition of their existence . They must rule themselves or perish . Every colony in the world , where African slavery existed , with one exception , has been destroyed ; and if this has been the case under the old and effete governments of Europe , will it not prevail under the dominion of the restless people of the Northern States * They do not practically recognize the inferiority of the African to the Caucasian race . They do not realize , because the circumstances of their condition do not compel them to realize , the impossibility of an amalgamation between the races . Exempt from the institution of slavery , it is not surprising that their sympathies should be against us , whilst the dogma on which they profess to build their system of free government - the absolute rule of the majority - leaves no barrier to their power in the affairs of the general government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , false or real , fires their enthusiasm against an institution which many of its professors believe to be inconsistent with its principles and precepts . To expect forbearance from such a people , under such circumstances , toward the institution of slavery , is manifestly vain . If* they have been false to the compact made with us in the constitution , and have allowed passion and prejudice to master reason , they have only exemplified that frailty and infallibility of our nature , which has produced the necessity of all governments , and which , if unchecked , ever produces wrong . The institution of slavery having once entered the popular mind of the non-slaveholding States , for action and control , the re4 is inevitable . If unrestrained by us , they will go on , until African slavery will be swept from the broad and fertile South . The nature of things , therefore , independent of experience , teaches us that there can be no safety in submission . The limitations of the constitution are designed for the protection of minorities , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution does not protect the majority , for they have all the powers of government in their own hands , and can protect themselves . The South , by submission , would as much betray their duty , as the North by aggression . In what way , then , shall they preserve the constitution and secure their own safety l As a general rule , it is undoubtedly true that when , in a government like ours , a constitution is violated by a majority-who alone can violate it in matters of legislation , it can not be restored to its integrity through the ordinary means of government , for those means being under the control of the majority are not available to the minority . For this reason , frequent elections of our rulers take place , that the people , by their direct intervention , may change the majority . But this is no longer a resource to us , for our representatives have been true to the trust confided to them , and have done all that men can do to preserve the constitution from assaults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , that every new election only serves to increase the preponderance of the majority . The ballotbox is at last powerless for the protection of Southern interests . The present Congress has been six months in session , and during that time slavery has been the absorbing topic of discussion . Yet nothing has been done to heal the discontents which so justly exist at the South . Its attention is now occupied by the measures proposed in a report made by a Committee of thirteen members . As these measures have been pressed on the South as worthy her acceptance , a brief consideration of the matters they treat of is deemed proper . This report embraces four distinct measures : - lst , the admission of California as a State , with the exclusion of slavery in her constitution . 2d , territorial governments to be erected over the territories o* Utah and New Mexico , with nearly one half of Texas to be added to the latter . 3d , the prohibition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia . 4th , provisions for the recapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excludes the South from the whole of that part of California lying on the Pacific , including one hundred and fifty thousand square miles of territory . This exclusion of slavery is essentially the consequence of the leglslation of Congress , whether by direct action or by confirming and carrying out the pretensions of the individuals in that territory who have appropriated the soil to themselves and erected a government over it . The constitution of California becomes the act of Congress , and the Wilmot proviso it contains is the Wilmot proviso passed and enforced by the legislation of Congress . Had this constitution , thus proposed by California , been silent on the subject of slavery , would the North have consented to her admission l The territorial bills brought forward for California at the last Congress were of this nature , but they were rejected , because the South was not excluded from this territory in express terms . The people of California have in this way been exposed to the inconveniences of // being left without a civil government , in consequence of the determination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made for these hardships , and in the resolutions submitted by the Convention of the people of the Southern States , it is recommended that California he admitted as a State on certain conditions . The next measure reported by the Committee of thirteen , relates to the houndary of Texas and New Mexico . It takes from Texas territory sufficient to form two large States , and adds them to New Mexico . This province is intended in another year to follow the example of California , and to be admitted into the Union with a constitution prohibiting slavery . Thus will territory , over which slavery now exists , be snatched from the South and be handed over to the non-slaveholding States . The pretext for this is , that there is some doubt as to the boundaries of Texas . But Texas , by her laws when she was admitted into the Union , had but one boundary , and that was the Rio Grande . Congress , in the resolutions of annexation , recognized the boundary by laying down a line of limitation between the slaveholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that very part of her territory , the right to which is now questioned . To vindicate this boundary , the Mexican war took place , and in the treaty of Guadalope Hidalgo , it was finally settled beyond all doubt , by a clause designating the Rio Grande as the boundary between Mexico and the United States . Texas should , undoubtedly , be quieted as to her boundaries , but it should be by a law plainly acknowledging them . If , after such acknowledgment , the general government should think proper to purchase any territory from Texas , the arrangement would be unobjectionable . But any settlement of these difficulties which would leave a shade of doubt as to the right of the South to enter any portion of these territories , neither Texas nor the general government have any right to make . The country proposed to be surrendered by Texas lies along the western frontier of the Indian territory . This is now a slaveholding section and properly is a part of the South . Place alongside of this , two non-slaveholding States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southern States , with far less ability on the part of the Indian to withstand them . Another concession there is , which the South is called upon to make , and not even to the interest , but to the mere prejudices of the North . Slavery existed in the District of Columbia , when Congress accepted the cession of the territory composing it , from the States of Maryland and Virginia . No one can suppose that these States could ever have designed to give Congress any power over the institution of slavery in this district , for independently of the wrong done to the inhabitants , it would be an intolerable evil to have a portion of territory between them where emancipation prevails by the authority of Congress . Nevertheless , the bill of Compromise proposes that Congress should begin the work of emancipation , by declaring free every slave that is brought into the district for the purposes of sale . For all these concessions to the North , the South is to receive a return in the fugitive slave bill . This bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate to restore the fugitive to his owner ; and in the second place , is no concession on the part of the North , as it gives the South no more than she is entitled to . More than this , under pretext of a benefit , it perpetrates a usurpation on the reserved rights of the States . It provides that a slave may arraign his master before the courts of the State , and the United States , to try his right to his freedom . This is virtually extending the jurisdiction of Congress over slavery in the States . The only compromise that the South could accept without dishonor , was one that has been already twice sanctioned . If the North offers the Missouri compromise line to extend to the Pacific Ocean , though they thereby gain more than three-fourths of the vacant territory of the United States , they will have renounced the insufferable pretension of restricting and preventing the extension of the South , whilst they themselves should extend indefinitely . The South should take this line as a partition line between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but what the Constitution bestows.
