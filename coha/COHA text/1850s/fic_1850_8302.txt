Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : FUNERAL OF THE YOUNG . from Funeral of the young ( 1850 ) Go from thy father 's door ,  --  Fair friend , who oft hast play 'd Delighted round the cheerful hearth And ' neath the garden-shade ,  --  Go from thy mother 's side ,  --  Thou , who in nursery dear Didst nightly draw her warbled hymn Into thine infant ear ,  --  Go from thy sisters sweet ,  --  Though the deep wail of grief Is bursting from their stricken hearts Refusing all relief ,  --  Go from thy brother 's arms ,  --  Not with fleet step of cheer ,  --  But softly laid by mournful hands Upon the sable bier . " Come to our white rob 'd band , " The hovering angels sing ,  --  We have a treasur 'd harp for thee . That knows no jarring string ,  --  " Come to our fond embrace , " Those kindred spirits cry , Who shar 'd thy love , and earlier took The journey of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep tones His greeting bore , Who once was crucified and slain , But liveth evermore Oh ! blessed lot to leave This world 's unresting strife ,  --  And find such welcome on the shores Of everlasting life .
