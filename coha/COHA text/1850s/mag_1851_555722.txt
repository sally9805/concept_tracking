ART . IX . - The Memoir and Writings of JAMES HANDASYD PERKINS . Edited by WILLIAM HENRY CHANNING . Boston : Crosby &amp; Nichols . 1851. 2 vols. l2mo . MORALISTS of the old school were wont to draw a strongly marked distinction between personal and social duties , as if the two classes rested on different bases of obligation , and were capable of being separated , not only in ethical discussion , but in actual life . Until recently , what is called personal virtue had the precedence . The purpose and the effort to do good were not essential to a high reputation for excellence . A large measure of selfishness and penuriousness , contracted sympathies , bigotry , intolerance , self-isolation , were hardly deemed blots upon a character , especially if to freedom from vice , and systematic habits of business and care for one 's own household , there were added the decencies of religious profession and observance . The tendency of our own times is towards the opposite error . Doing good is regarded as of more importance than heing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than as souls endowed each with an independent existence and destiny . Conscience is made an external organ , and its province is to ferret out the sins of classes and communities , not to detect one 's own moral infirmities . Philanthropy is deemed not only the first , but almost the sole , duty . Men , who never learned to subdue their own passions , occupy the van in the assault on the inveterate wrongs and evils of the body politic . We know some people who , when a stranger is named , ask in their cant phrase whether he is a reformer , ( not whether he needs reformation , ) and who think that they fully know his character , when they have learned to what benevolent societies he belongs , * and at what kinds of public meetings he makes speeches . Things have now reached such a pass , that almost every cause of humanity that deserves championship is in the hands of the very men whose services are a perpetual disservice ; while informal and miscellaneous modes of influence are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the guides and helpers of their brethren . Meanwhile , personal excellence and social usefulness are // inseparable , and bear so close a proportion to each other , that the one may invariably be assumed as the measure of the other . A good man is every day and hour throwing off proof impressions of himself . He is enacting , not playing , the philanthropist in his labor , in his traffic , in his casual intercourse , in his home life , in the very scenes and transactions in which he makes the least show of benevolent intent . His mere presence creates a purer moral atmosphere . An obscurity or retirement can no more suppress his beneficent agency , than linen garments can smother fire . He can make his virtue inefficient only by becoming a voluntary recluse , and then he ceases to be good . One 's usefulness depends on his quantity of character , and is enhanced by every accession of purity and strength , - by every finer touch and richer hue of spiritual beauty . Nay , the very traits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of which a show is made only by those that lack them , - those habits of thought and feeling which ally the soul to God and heaven , - pass as factors into the sum of operative benevolence , and are transmuted into the utilities and amenities of common intercourse . Nor is this law for the expression of character materially affected by xvhat is called a more or less favorable position . Could outward means and opportunities have well been less ample than they were in the case of John Pounds , the cobbler , in his stall ten feet square ? Yet we can hardly conceive that any exaltation or enlargement of his sphere could have made him more useful . Indeed , the power of example bears an inverse proportion to the capacity of active benevolence . One who occupies a conspicuous place , and has the ability to perform signal services for others , discourages imitation , except on the part of the very few who move on the same social plane . On the other hand , he who has neither the full purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who therefore is scarcely conscious of doing good to others , may present an example which no beholder need despair of attaining , - a goodness which seems within the reach of all , because self-nurtured and unpropped from without , - a beneficence which none are too poor or ignorant to copy . An indefinite or fluctuating position might appear least of all propitious as regards usefulness ; but it is , in fact , injurious // to the perspective , rather than to the actual power , of character . The man who has a permanent post of business or professional duty is a well-known , trustworthy , calculable element in the current moral force of society , - a fixed luminary of registered ma0nitude and lustre ; but for that very reason , his beneficent agency has its limits , which are but seldom and casually overpassed . On the other hand , he who seems never to find the right niche , and the phases of whose outward life are hardly less numerous than his years , though less distinctly recognized in his influence , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellowmen , - impulses which outlast his immediate agency , and are still propagated when he is forgotten . His unsettled life may indefinitely multiply his opportunities and enlarge his sphere , while his virtue is made more venerable , lovely , and attractive , at once by its diversified manifestation , and by its having passed the frequent test of vicissitude and disappointment . But we are disposed to rebard this unsettled , desultory , vacillating mode of life , as the result less of circumstances than of character . Some men are nomadic by constitution ; and to this type belong not a few of the loftiest minds and the noblest hearts . No one , who would lead a true life , is conscious of frilly reaching his aims and embodying his conceptions . Every profession and condition has its untoward circumstances , its malign influences , its distasteful associations , its belittling drudgery , its defective standards . Every position , too , has its demands so intense , so vast , so various , as to give the consciousness of incompetency , and to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-culture and unembarrassed influence . It is , no doubt , the part of wisdom to make a truce with one 's aspirations , to be and do all that he can in the place where his lot is cast , and to content himself with its resources for increasing excellence and usefulness . But some good men are by the necessity of their nature morbidly sensitive to the straitnesses and disadvantages of their present condition . They are impatient of obstacles which will not yield to a first assault , of a standard which they can not elevate by immediate effort , of taskwork which seems fruitless as to the higher ends of their spiritual being . They imagine that limitations and necessities , which are inevitable conditions of human existence , are their // peculiar misfortune . Such men are the tent-dwellers of civilized society . They dread the contracting and secularizing tendencies of a settled life ; and , with noble energy of purpose , in the spirit of sincere self-sacrifice , they are perpetually devising new plans , launching out into new enterprises , and creating for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it failure or misfortune alone that sustains the nomadic habit . Such spirits are rendered even more uneasy by success or the promise of it . They are prone to regard emolument or applause either as a token that they have parted with their integrity and simplicity , or as the world 's retaining fee to pledge them to the wrong side in the conflict with evil . Mr. Perkins , the *subject of the Memoir and the author of the other Writings in the volumes now before us , was one of the noblest specimens of the class of men whom we have just described . Of talents adequate for the highest place , of social endowments which rendered his intimacy a privilege ever to be borne in grateful remembrance , of a purity and loftiness of character which made his youth surpassingly lovely and the prime of his manhood venerable , he seems never to have attained a position which satisfied his spiritual yearnings , or gave him the consciousness of perfect freedom and entire adaptation to his sphere of duty . Always eminently successful , ( except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nature to seek , or to retain if won , ) he felt himself always distanced by the exalted standard and the ever-receding goal , which alone he could persuade himself to pursue . Never was a life so brief more full of great and varied usefulness ; yet his intense self-distrust made him shrink from responsibilities , which no outward change could diminish , so long as he retained the eloquent address , the ripe wisdom , and the fervent philanthropy that won for him universal confidence , reverence , and love . Modest , unassuming almost without parallel , he was a centre of commanding influence , regarded with pride by the city of his adoption , honored in life and mourned in death as a public benefactor by men of all classes , sects , and conditions . Mr. Perkins was born in Boston , in 1810 . His early education was such as to fit him either for a mercantile life or for a course of professional study . He was happy in // enjoying the services of a series of teachers no less capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imparting the mere rudiments of knowledge . Not to speak of the living , it was an inestimable privilege to have been , for several of the most critical years of boyhood , under the charge of Solomon P. Miles , a man who could give his pupils nothing better than his own example ; and then to have passed from his tuition to that of Dr. Abbot , and to the scholarly and manly training in which Exeter has taken the lead among our New England academies . As a member of a family of merchant-princes , than whom none have done more to liberalize their profession and to adorn it by uncorrupt faith and munificent charity , James was destined for a commercial life ; and at the age of eighteen , commenced his novitiate in the counting-room of his kinsman , Col. Thomas H. Perkins . But the details of business proved irksome to him , its temptations filled him with alarm , and even its most honorable walks seemed to him dishonored by the multitude of supernumeraries , who drain their subsistence from the public by arresting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer to the consumer . His morbid conscientiousness as to these matters preyed upon his spirits to such a degree , that he was sent abroad at the age of twenty , ostensibly on a business mission , but really to regain the healthy action of his mind . On his return , he resolved to take his final leave of commerce , and turned his face westward , with the purpose of becoming a farmer . In February , 1832 , Mr. Perkins arrived at Cincinnati , and , while waiting for the opening of spring to choose a location for his first experiment in agriculture , he was invited to spend his leisure hours in the law-office of his former tutor , Judge Walker . He became at once enamored with the law , and found himself a student in earnest of the books with which he had merely intended to beguile a brief and else idle interval of time . He was admitted to the bar with the most brilliant prospects , and established his reputation by his very first argument . But he had hardly entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opening career by conscientious scruples , and by scruples for which his legal friends admit that , then and there , justifying ground was not wanting . He might indeed have labored , as those very // friends have , and not without encouraging success , to elevate the moral standard of the profession , and to connect with its practice those maxims of veracity , integrity , and frankness , which , so far as they prevail , check litigation and establish the reign of impartial justice . But he dared not trust himself to the encounter with licensed falsity and legalized iniquity . He feared lest he might contract the very stains which it would have been his mission to purge away from the fraternity with which he was numbered . He accordingly left the bar before the expiration of his first year . For a few months he was an editor . He then accepted the agency of a mining , milling , and manufacturing enterprise at Pomeroy , on the Ohio . This proved a failure , and nearly swallowed up the little capital which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commence the world anew . He purchased a few acres of ground in the neighborhood of Cincinnati , intending to lay them out as a nursery and market-garden . While completing his arrangements for this purpose , he published a Digest of the " Constitutional Opinions of Chief Justice Marshall , " - a work which received the high commendation of Judge Story for its completeness , its lucid arrangement , and its felicitous style . Meanwhile , his character as an upright and energetic citizen , his influence in every form of benevolent effort and progressive movement , and his agency in the establishment and support of the literary , educational , and moral institutions of the metropolis of the West induced his numerous friends to make a strong effort to retain him at Cincinnati . A Ministry at Large had been recently instituted by the First Congregational Society , of which his kinsman and biographer was then the Pastor . He was urged to accept this Ministry , and entered upon its duties in the winter of 1838 - 39 . From that time to the day of his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Here he found the true sphere for an unselfish and self-abasing spirit . The field was at first all his own ; and , when others entered upon it , his was still the leading and controlling mind . He systematized the labor of relief , gauged and registered the various forms of pauperism and vice , and was the means of bringing the whole mass of destitution , ignorance , and crime in the city under the influence of Christian instruction and benevolence . As essential // parts of this work , he busied himself largely in the reform of the County Prisons of Ohio , in the amelioration of the condition of the colored population , and in the development of the common school system of Cincinnati , - a system founded under the auspices of emigrants from New England , and bearing a closer resemblance than can elsewhere be traced to the best school organizations of our northern cities . Finding the small salary attached to his Ministry inadequate to his support , he opened a school for young ladies , to which he devoted three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his missionary toil . But the time had arrived , and the avenue was now opened , for his entrance upon the profession for which he had always been predminently adapted , and which he undoubtedly would have chosen in his early manhood , but for the clinging weight of diffidence and self-distrust . He had been persuaded , in the absence of his friend and pastor , occasionally to lead the religious services of the congregation ; and , the pulpit becoming vacant in 1841 , he was unanimously elected their minister . He accepted the charge , though but in part and without any permanent contract . The arrangement was subsequently suspended and renewed ; and at the time of his death , he was still the pastor in the choice and affections of his flock , though he regarded himself as but the occupant of the pulpit during a protracted vacancy . The affecting story of his death may be best told in the words of a friend , as quoted by Mr. Chanfling . " For a period of between fifteen and twenty years , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been subject to a sudden rush of blood to the head , which has produced distressing vertigo , at times greatly impaired his sight , and often thrown him into deep despondency . Within the past five or six years , he has suffered intensely from palpitation of the heart , often being incapacitated by this distressing affection for the discharge of his pastoral and other duties . On Friday last , a paroxysm of this kind was produced by the agitation he suffered in consequence of the supposed loss of his two children . In the morning of that day , one of his little boys , aged nine years , and another aged seven , rode to the city from Mr. Perkins 's residence , on Walnut Hills , with a neighbor , and were to return home in the omnibus , at the stand of which their father , who was to come in by another conveyance , was to meet them . Not finding them // there at the appointed time , Mr. Perkins feared that they had lost themselves , and commenced searching for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farther he went , and finally employed the crier , who met with no better success . The search was at length abandoned , and in despair , and fatigued as he was , Mr. Perkins walked home , a distance of nearly four miles , whither his children had preceded him . " He reached his residence about one o'clock in the afternoon , utterly exhausted ; but , after lying down for a time , rose and dined . He could not , however , overcome the excitement into which he had been thrown , although the children were with him and well . He was restless and nervous to a degree never before witnessed by his family ; and so continuing , about five o'clock he told his wife that he would take a walk to calm his nerves , but not be gone long ,  --  that he wished to try and allay the excitement , but would be back before tea time . He went out thus , but did not return , and nothing was seen of him afterwards by his family or friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread from- the Jamestown Crossing of the Ohio , that on the previous evening a man had drowned himself from the ferry-boat at that point , leaving behind him several articles of clothing , among them an overcoat , in one of the pockets of which was found a memorandum book , with initials in several places . A gentleman of the city , who happened to have business on the boat , asked to see the book , and upon opening it saw the letters J. H. P. , ' with which he was familiar . He immediately rode to the residence of Mr. Perkins*s family with the information . " Upon subsequent inquiry , it was ascertained that not quite half an hour elapsed between leaving his home and reaching the ferry , which is distant from a half to three fourths of a mile . With his arms folded and eyes bent upon the ground , he walked hastily on board , and crossed to the outer side of the boat , standing on the very edge , and looking into the water . There being no carriages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly enough for him to hear , That man will be overboard if he does not take care . ' Mr. Perkins looked round , but did not speak . He , however , changed his position . This was the last that was seen of him . After a while , the collector discovered an overcoat , - in which was found the memorandum-book referred to ,  --  a wrapper , a vest , a cap , and a pair of spectacles , all of which have been indentified as belonging to Mr. Perkins . " The supposition among those well acquainted with the pecu* liar mental constitution of the deceased , and his severe physical sufferings , is , that his walk , instead of allaying his excitement , // still further increased it , till reason was temporarily dethroned . In a wandering mood , not knowing whither he went , he had doubtless reached the Jamestown Ferry , and in a paroxysm of mental aberration had thrown himself into the stream . " The unusual fatigue and excitement of Friday morning had brought on a more violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced . In lighter attacks , his friends have frequently thought his brain temporarily affected by his sufferings ; and although nothing of the kind was observed by those who assisted him in the search for his children on Friday morning , or by his family when he left the house for the walk on Friday evening , it probably soon came on , producing the melancholy termination recorded of his beautiful and useful life . " In this rapid sketch , we have incidentally referred to the leading traits of Mr. Perkins 's character . The most prominent feature of his spirit seemed the entire supremacy of conscience . His whole life was an embodiment of the principle of duty . Some men attach the sense of obligation only to their public life , and are careless of the daily details of domestic and social intercourse . Others are rigidly dutiful in little things , yet ready to surrender their self-guidance in professional or political conduct to the dictation of cliques , parties , or a multiform and Protean public . He united the strictest independence in all public relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so prudently ordered , and so watchfully governed , that Argus-eyed calumny might have dogged his steps and sat at his table , without finding matter of reproach or ground for accusation . If he committed any errors , they were on the side of undue self-denial and excessive self-sacrifice . Yet this close adherence to conscience was to him no ungenial or ascetic task-work . He was so absorbed in the love of moral excellence , that a serene gladness of spirit pervaded his walks of arduous duty , gave a rhythmical beauty to the prosaic details of philanthropic service , and imparted a glow as of heavenly radiance to his countenance and his social intercourse . The constant pressure of obligation was to him like that of the vital air , invigorating , refreshing , joy-giving . We have never known a man , whose sympathies were freer , warmer , or more comprehensive . His was no exclusive or one-sided philanthrophy . With his mind , time , and hands seemingly full , he was always open to new appeals for his // countenance and aid . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of the poor , the patient instructor of the ignorant , he was at the same time intimately connected with every movement in the direction of the highest literary and scientific culture , and the intimate associate in their respective plans and departments of scholars and savans of every name and description . His simple hospitality and his most cordial attei*tions and services were bestowed , not only on those whom it might be on independent grounds a privilege to know or to aid , but on all who could plead the mere name of a stranger . Young men , especially those otherwise homeless , found homelike reception and kindness at his house , and , without the show of formal counsel , were warned and guided , and inspired with pure tastes and noble aims by his brotherly communion . An eminently good man of our acquaintance once said tous : " I never am brought even into the most transient intercourse with a human being , without feeling that I have a message from God for that person 's good , and I am dissatisfied unless I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or better by the interview. ** We do not believe that Mr. Perkins ever said any thing like this , or had established for himself any such rule of life ; but his conscientiousness , his overflowing benevolence , and the readiness and versatility of his conversational powers must have produced this same result ; and none but the unimprovable can have enjoyed his society without some healthful impulse toward a nobler , truer , more industrious , and more generous life . The catholicity of his sympathies preserved Mr. Perkins from ultraisms of all kinds , while his hopeful enthusiasm shut him out of the ranks of the blindly conservative . He was too much of a scholar , not to reverence the past ; he was too earnest a Christian not to labQr for the future . He was a devoted friend of the negro race ; but he entered with almost a slaveholder 's self-consciousness into the complex and embarrassing problems involved alike in the continuance , the immediate abolition , and the gradual removal of the burden of slavery ; and while his own views pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , " they were urged with a calmness , candor , and kind consideration , the prevalence of which throughout the country would // be of immeasurably better omen both for the Union and the slave , than the strongest manifestation of patriotic or philanthropic zeal . While he could not but perceive the vicious elements embodied in the social organization of modern Christendom , he was not a Socialist in the fanatical or destructive sense of the term . He had too precious a home , and too dear an interest in many homes not his own , to think with complacency of the barrack-life of the Phalanstery ; and his strongly defined individuality and conscious need of an independent sphere of action indisposed him for any form of Coinmunism . With him , the great social desideratum was the substitution of coaperation for hostile competition in the various departments of industry and commerce . Yet he trusted more to the gradual incorporation of Christian principle and feeling with the relations of capital , enterprise , and labor , than to any merely external measures of reform ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present order of the family or of society , but in the selfishness of the unchristianized character . It is often said of men both devout and kind , the living and the dead , that they were no sectarians . And , as the phrase is commonly used , we think the worse of him to whom it is applied ; for it generally denotes a weak indifference to the prevalence of his peculiar religious views , which can result only from a lack of faith in their importance , or from a charity too feeble to transcend the half-amiable , halfdespicable form of good-nature . But in a far higher sense Mr. Perkins was no sectarian . He had risen above " the centre of indifference , " above the plane of sectarian warfare , to the centre of religious union . His opinions were not speculative dogmas ; but had been transmuted in the earliest stages of their growth into those types of religious purpose , reverence , and love , which are common to the consciousness of all good men . He seemed incapable of holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to discern its metaphysical bearings . It might have been difficult for him at any time to say to what sect he belonged . He found in all spiritual experiences , which tallied with his own , modes of devotional feeling into which he could enter , - examples of holy living that awakened his admiration and attracted his affectionate regard . It was his repeated , and , had his life // been spared , it would no doubt have been a succcessful , effort , to reorganize the congregation of which he was minister , so that it could bear no name but Christian , could be charged with having no creed except the Bible , and should be an association not merely for Christian worship , but for the vigorous prosecution of works of reform and of charity . As a preacher , Mr. Perkins formed a school by himself . His sermons were extemporaneous , and he devoted very little time to his preparation for the pulpit . Yet he always preached on subjects which had long occupied his n ) ind , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been the fruit only of thorough research and prolonged and fervent meditation . His range of subjects was wide beyond all precedent , and embraced the leading social and political questions of the day , the characters of eminent men in every walk of life , and the numerous enterprises and interests of a busy and growing community . But his treatment of them was preilminently Christian . We heard him preach two sermons on the Political Aspects of the Times ; and they were as thoroughly religious sermons , as full of unction , as heart-searching and heart-probing , as well adapted to the awakening of penitence , devout resolution , and the spirit of prayer , as if his nominal subject had been regeneration , or divine influences . At the close of the second of these services , he announced for the theme of the next Sunday evening the Life of Aaron Burr ; and we have been told by one who heard him then , that a sermon more full of the profoundest views of human responsibility and divine retribution was never uttered . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner than his . In the commencement of a discourse , he seemed oppressed by diffidence , and by a deep sense of the inadequacy of human lips to the momentous office of an ambassador from God to man ; but as he kindled with the glow of fastthronging thoughts and emotions , his whole countenance was irradiated , the tones of his voice rose into lofty and comrnanding eloquence , and his vivid fancy and rich imagery almost painted to the eye the truths which he poured into the ear and heart . He lamented the lack of early theological training , and to the last persisted in regarding himself as only standing in the way of some better qualified preacher . Not // so thought his hearers ; for while he held the strongest and most cultivated minds more completely under his influence than they themselves were aware till they could listen to him no longer , the humhler and less intelligent members of his flock found themselves constantly nourished , guided , and elevated by his ministry . Of the joint efficacy of his pure life , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clerical office , the honor , which waited upon his last years and multiplied memorials of itself on his untimely death , hears ample testimony . He was at first identified with an unpopular denomination , and his reputation encountered the strongest prejudices , and won gradual and reluctant assent . Yet , at the time of his death , he had long enjoyed the cordial fellowship of Christians of every name , and sects with which his only connection had been that of spiritual fellow-feeling were ready to claim him as virtually their own . Journals and letter-writers of various denominations vied with one another in their trihutes of veneration for his character and memory ; and the best men of the whole city were sincere mourners at his departure . Our constant readers can hardly need an elaborate sketch of Mr. Perkins 's literary character . His articles on Mohammed , Gregory , Saint Louis , and Loyola , on the Pioneers of Kentucky , and on the Settlement of the Northwestern Territory , once read , are unforgotten . Many may have written as well ; - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such abundance and versatility of resource . His style is simple and direct , vivid and pointed , rich in imagery , hut rigidly chaste and severely pure . It has the glow of fresh thought and rapid composition , and at the same time the precision and thoroughness of careful elaboration . Metaphors are crowded , hut never mixed . His words are thickset pictures ; but they never overlay one another , or present abrupt and harsh transitions or contrasts of coloring . His diction has the grace at once of spontaneity and of the highest art . But what impresses us most of all in his writings , is their perfect genuineness , - their truth to his own nature and his profound convictions . He never wrote for effect , or performed literary jobwork . His subjects were such as interested him for their own sake ; and his sole aim was to give his readers a literal // transcript of what occupied his mind , charmed his fancy , or enlisted his hearty sympathy . Mr. Channing has performed his task as a biographer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent Mr. Perkins 's views and opinions as in harmony with his own . He gracefully blends much of the narrative of his own early life with that of his cousin , schoolmate , and inseparable companion , up to the time when their paths diverged ; and then he retires into the background , and gives us the simple story of his friend 's struggles and trials , successes and attainments . Yet the whole Memoir is so pervaded by more than a brother 's love , and breathes so much of the spirit of a threnody of regretful , yearning , longing affection , that as we read it , its whole burden seemed , - " Ah ! te me si partem animm rapit Maturior vis , quid motor altera 2 " The second of these volumes consists almost entirely of articles originally published in this Journal , which it is therefore neither graceful for us to criticize , nor needful to quote . The first volume contains a great variety of pieces , juvenile compositions , contributions to newspapers and magazines , essays , tales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles are of widely different degrees of merit ; but , considered with reference to their dates , subjects , occasions , and purposes , they are of a singularly uniform excellence . They are in part interspersed with separate portions of the Memoir , and , thus arranged , form of themselves an autobiography , which needed but a slender thread of narrative for its entire completeness . We have been delighted , and our readers can be no less so , with what we are told was a schoolboy sketch , " though revised at a later day . " Happy the family , which in these days of perambulating " help , " and Hibernian nursery guardianship , still cherishes the declining years or the fragrant memory of an " AUNT ESTHER . " My first and best , and oldest of aunts ! and yet no more my relation than the town.pump . Aunt Esther ! she was the nursing mother of the whole dynasty of -s , father and grandfather , son and grandson ; - they had all been fondled and spanked , // washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From her I learned to love " lasses candy ; " from her I learned to bate Tom Jefferson . Many an evening as I sat by her rush-bottomed and rickety chair , threading her needle , or holding , while she wound , skeins of silk or yarn , that I thought must be as long as the equator , - many an evening has she discoursed of the archrebel Napoleon , whom " she would have torn to finders , " she said , " if she could only have got her hands on him ; " though the next day she would set free the very mouse that had stolen her last pet morsel of cheese ; for she was a very Uncle Toby , or rather Aunt Toby , in such matters . " She told me of Napoleon , and her little work-table was the battle-field . Here was the ball of yarn , and there was the halffinished stocking , and yonder was the big Bible , supported by the spectacle case . Old Boney himself moved among them in the form of a knitting-needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Little Corporal , but as a tall bit of cold steel , with a head made of beeswax . " From her , too , came my portrait of Washington , whom she had seen during his visit to the North . Year after year did those well-beloved lips pronounce his eulogy , and often was the hourly prayer put up by me for a long life to Aunt Esther and General Washington ; little did I dream that one who to me had just begun to live , had been dead these ten years and more ! " And then came the war and the Hartford Convention ; and such a time as we had of it , up in our little back-room ! I do n't know what it was that preserved the nation ; for there was Aunt Esther and I , and the whole race of -s , in such a passion that we almost walked to England dry-shod . " Aunt Esther had one fault , - she was always too cleanly in her notions . It was probably because of her Federal and aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even see a dirty boy without wanting to wash her hands . And this her most prominent organ was exercised most fully upon generation after generation , as each marched through her dominions . " As bad as to be washed by Aunt Esther , " was a proverb in the dynasty . For many a long year no lines in the language were to me so pathetic and soul-harrowing as those from the Columbiad - " Still on thy rocks the broad Atlantic roars , And washes still unceasingly thy shores . " To be " washed unceasingly " was my beau-ideal of misery . " Aunt Esther , familiar as she was , was still a mysterious being to me . I had never met any other of her name ; and , having early in life heard the Book of Esther read , always thought of my old nurse in connection with Ahasuerus and Mor // decai , and the tall gallows . Nor was the mystery diminished on being told , when I asked how long it was since Mordecai , that it was hundreds and thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare to ask ! " Brought up to bring up others , the venerable matron loved nothing so dearly as Scotch snuff and noisy children . When the storm waxed loudest in the nursery , she was most in her element , and walked undisturbed amid CC The wreck of horses and the crash of toys. ** " Her chief text and comfort was that in which we are told that our Saviour blessed the children brought to him , and said that of such was the kingdom of heaven ; for to her it conveyed the idea that the place of rest would be brimful of babies . " And I grew up , and another generation came forward to claim my rocking-horses , and my long-legged chairs . I went to school ; and when I came home , I found Aunt Esther just as of old , only ( as the saying is ) a good deal more so . But though to me time was a matter of some import , she defied it . Nay , I received a letter from my cousin , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced at her wedding . - was the old lady 's last favorite ; gentle and kindly , she loved her foster.mother more than many do their own parents , and she meant to take the ancient to her new home , she told me . But when I arrived at Boston again , I found that this had not been done ; Aunt Esther could not leave the old nursery , with its yellow floor and barred windows ; and as little could she bear to lose her pet . From the day of s wedding , she began to go out ; her work on earth was done ; and from the arms of the last she had brought up in the fear of the Lord , she passed away to meet her new colony of infants beyond the skies . " In one corner of the churchyard there had been a great oak , of which all had departed but a shell of bark a few feet high . From this shell , within a year or two , a young , tall sprout had sprung up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aunt Esther . Above her they placed a three-sided obelisk ; upon the west side was carved the form of an aged woman , on the brink of the grave ; upon the east , that of a bright spirit springing from that same grave ; while upon the front was her name and age ,  --  " Esther Pray , aged 91 years , " with a part of her favorite text , perverted , and yet true , - " Of such is the kingdom of ' heaven . " Vol. i. pp. 19- 22 . Our next extract is from an article on the " Prospects of the West , " which may be assumed as a not inadequate expression of the aims to which Mr. Perkins consecrated the // whole power of his mind , the full fervor of his affections , and the unremitted labor of his maturer years . " And what is a Christian Republicanism ? It is not , in social life , a want of caste , and absence of rank ; for as surely as one star differeth from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes , powers , and habits walk apart from one another . In the hour of turmoil , the great deep may be broken up , and society , storm-shaken and chaotic , be devoid of all order and beauty ; but when stillness comes back , the laws of social are as certain as those of mineral crystallization , and every layer , one above the other , will return to its place , silently , but surely . It is not in politics , the absence of place , power , patronage ; it is not that democracy which would , by rotation in office , place in the chair any and every man , nor that which would bestow office as a reward . It would , on the contrary , forbid the mass to hold place ; it would silence him that shouted aloud of his services , and asked to be paid in power . " The great idea , - as Coleridge would call it , - the great informing idea of republicanism is , not that distinctions , and ranks , and privileges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of BIRTH , WEALTH , and PROWESS , and become the basis of an aristocracy ; and Christian republicanism makes Christ the judge of merit . " What is merit ? It is genius , learning , experience , and , above all , character . It is whatever Christianity and the good sense of the time may make it . Merit was the basis of the European aristocracy , at a time when might of arm was merit . The error , the fatal error , was to make that which can belong but to the man descend , as an heirloom , to his sons ; in that hour the true principle of rank was lost sight of . " We wish upon this point to be clear . We therefore again say , that to us republicanism does not oppose differences of rank ; it does not teach that men are born equal , or are ever equal ; it does not level , for to level is ever to lower . No , it leaves those that are high there , and seeks to raise others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , and only this , that its standard of height , its principle of classification , is wide of theirs . " The true republican , then , will not seek to believe , or to make those about him believe , that he and they are as good as any ; his desire and struggle will be to make himself and his fellows as good , not only as others , but as the oracle within tells him they should be . When a l ) lace is to be filled , he will vote , speak , write , for the man best fitted for it . He will revere the wise , and good , and aged , as men of a rank above his own ; he // will look up to them ; they will he , in his eyes , nobles . But you will say this is so already . We reply , to some extent it is ; the mass feel , though they do not see , the idea we have spoken of ; they cry aloud , All men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts mock their words daily ; - and why ? Because they do not think of inequality , unless in fortune , birth , and education ; they mean to say , when they speak of all men being horn equal , that no man , merely hecause of the condition of his fathers , is high ; nor is , for any thing he may have himself done , entitled to other than the natural and certain results thereof . For instance , the son of Daniel Webster has not , hecause of his father 's stand , a claim to any preeminence himself ; nor , having equal merit with his father , can he claim to give more votes than others , or receive a support from the state . But he can and will claim to exert a greater moral and intellectual influence than others , to stand higher and he more respected than others . And nature guarantees his claim , for republicanism* is the order of nature ; the aristocracy of a republic is the aristocracy of nature . It is an error to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground of merit , not of birth ; he rules on the true republican ground , and so does the sachem of the Indian tribe . And each of nature 's governors , each and all , rule on the score of merit , - merit measured by the unenlightened sense , while with us , as we have before said , the judge of merit should and must be Him that inhabiteth eternity . " This Christian repuhlicanism we hope will one day abide in the West ; it is the social and political philosophy which is to become the marked faith of this land . Old in theory , it will , applied to practice , be new ; and though it must ever come short of the point of perfection , much , very much , may be done towards its growth and power ; and much is doing even now , while we write . " And a new religious philosophy is to spring up here ; not a new system of religious faith and rite , but new principles of religious thought , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope nor wish to see the one creed here ; identity of doctrine God never meant should be , for he gave us our minds , and placed us where we are ; by the last he made us Christians rather than Turks , and by the first he made us Calvinists . Methodists , or Unitarians . Until the original and broad differences between men are done away , the same proofs , arguments , appeals , will affect them differently ; and there is as little chance of their agreeing as there is that the herdsmen of Bukharia will become Christian . He may be made so , and the strong bonds of temper and training may be rent , and far-sundered sectarians be united ; but such // 208 July , a union will not be general . One man is born a Socinian , another a Calvinist , a third a disciple of Emanuel Swedenborg . And never in this valley may the Sabbath smile upon a dead uniformity ! Long may the follower of the Genevan here pour forth his unwritten prayer ! Long may the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devotion of his most beautiful service , the Roman Catholic in his vast cathedral , speak the words of truth and wisdom to those who , of all , most need them , the Methodist seek God in the wilderness , and the Baptist call aloud to him from the watercourses ! We would not blot out one church , nor take from any the faith which forms his staff . " The religious ideas which we hope may become the life of faith here are those of the Reformation , as they were in the breast of Luther when passion slept , and the strong voice of his own good and right sense spake out . Freedom from naked authority ; toleration in heart as well as act ; modesty , hope , faith , in doctrine and demeanor ; appeals to the reason - not the understanding which rejects mysteries that reason receives , but the true reason which takes hold on the mysterious moral , as on the mathematical truth , and believes- rather than passion and prejudice ; - these form the central points of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet unknown in the world of feeling and action ; but which we trust may find a dwelling upon our plains , and walk unfettered among the green pastures , and by the still waters , of the West . " Vol. i. pp. 154- 157 . Of the Poems we hardly know which to select . Mr. Perkins did not deem himself a poet . He certainly was one in the highest , truest , sense of the word ; but perhaps less so under the infrequent shackles of rhyme and rhythm , than in the lofty breathing , rich flow , and harmonious cadence of his most animated prose writings . But the poems in this volume are precious because they are truly his , draped in the translucent purity of his spirit , veined with his lambent fancy , and fragrant with the aroma of his simple piety . The following " Invocation , " beautiful in itself , will be read with deep emotion by those who knew him ; for it will seem to them but a leaf from the book of his daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hallow his entire walk a ? nong men . " SPIRITS who hover near me , - ye whose wings Beat back the Tempter , - whose sweet presence brings Calm , gentle feelings , wishes pure and kind , An eye for all God 's beauty , and a mind // Open to all his voices , - still be nigh , When the Great Mystery its broad shadow flings Over earth 's firmest visions , till they fly Like phantoms of the night , and teach me how to die . When my breath faileth , as the summer air Fainteth at evening , - when my heart , whose care Jesus bath lightened , throbs , stops , throbs again , Then , slowly sinking , ceases without pain Its noiseless , voiceless labors , - still be nigh ; Let not the form of ghastly Death he there , But to my clouded , yet clear-seeing eye Reveal your forms of light , and make me love to die . The pinions of the Dark and Dreaded One Shall not , then , fan my temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fingers shall untie My earthward bonds ; your voices silently Whisper , " Come home , your course is hut begun ; " And in your arms borne upward , far on high , With mind and heart tuned to heaven 's harmony , I shall know all , love all , and find t is Life to die . " Vol. i. p. 371 . The prayer is answered . For a brief space of bewilderment and agony , " the shining ones , " under whose watch and ward he had led a life so sacred and so beautiful , may have been withdrawn from his view , and " the pinions of the Dark and Dreaded One " flapped heavily upon his flesh-burdened spirit . Then indeed he " sank low , but mounted high Through the dear might of him that walk 'd the waves , Where other groves , and other streams along , With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves , And hears the unexpressive nuptial song , In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love . There entertain him all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sing , and singing in their glory move , And wipe the tears forever from his eyes . "
