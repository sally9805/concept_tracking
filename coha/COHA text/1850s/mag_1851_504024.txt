txt THINGS happen in the world every day which appear incredible on paper . Individuals may secretly acknowledge to themselves the likelihood of such things , but the bulk of mankind feel it necessary to treat them openly with skepticism and ridicule . The real is sometimes too real for the line and plummet of the established criticism . It is the province of art to avoid these exceptional incidents , or to modify and adapt them so that they shall appear to harmonize with universal humanity . Hence it is that fiction is often more truthful than biography ; and it is obvious enough that it ought to be so , if it deal only with materials that are reconcilable with the general experience . But I am not amenable to the canons of art . 1 am not writing fiction . I am relating facts ; and if they should appear unreasonable or improbable , I appeal , for their vindication , to the candor of the reader . Every man , if he looks back into the vicissitudes of his life , will find passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel . When I met Astr*ea the next morning , I could perceive those traces of deep anxiety which recent circumstances had naturally left behind , and which the flush and excitement of the preceding evening had concealed . She was very pale and nervous . She felt that the moment had come when all disguises between us must end forever , and she trembled on the verge of disclosures that visibly shook her fortitude . The day was calm and breathless . Scarcely a leaf stirred in the trees , and the long shadows slept without a ruffle on the turf . The stillness of the place contrasted strangely with the tem * Continued from VoL II . p. 762. pest of emotions that was raging in my heart . I longed to get into the air . I felt the house stifling , and thought that I should breathe more freely among the branches of the little wood that looked so green and cool down by the margin of the stream . There was a rustic seat there under a canopy of ( Irooping boughs , close upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury of perfect solitude . Requesting her to follow me , I went alone into the wood . The interval seemed to me long before she came ; and when she did come , she was paler and more agitated than before . I tried to give her confidence by repeated protestations of my devotion* and as she seemed to gather courag. from the earnestness of my language , I again and again renewed the pledges which bound me to her , at any risk our position might demand . " It is that , ** sbe exclaimed , " which give* me hope and comfort . You have bad time to reflect on these pledges , and weigh the consequences they involve , and you now repeat them to me with an ardor which I should do you a great wrong to doubt . I entirely trust to you . If I am deceived , I will try still to be just , and hardly blame you so much as the world , which few men can relinquish for love . " There was a pause , during which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a nobler motive for surrendering every thing for her sake . She seemed to make me a hero by the penalties my devotion enforced upon me ; and I was eager to prove myself capable of the most heroic sacrifices . In the abyss of an overwhelming passion , where reason is imprisoned by the senses , every man is willing to be a martyr . " You have required of me , Astrm*a , " said I , " no , not required ; but you have placed before me the possibility of sufferings and trials result ing from our union-loss of friends , the surrender of many things that enter into the ordinary scheme of married life , and that are considered by the world indispensable to its happiness . I am ready to relinquish them all . I have looked for this end . I know not why it should be so , nor does it give me a moment 's concern . I only know that I love you passionately , and that life is desolation to me without you . Let us therefore have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . We have our destinies in our own hands . Let us knit them into one , and disappoint the scandal and malignity which , from that hour , can exercise no further influence over us . " " You spoke , " returned Astr*a , looking with a calm , clear gaze into my face , as if she penetrated my soul , " you spoke of married life . " The question surprised me . It was her look more than her words that conveyed a meaning , indistinct , but full of terrible suggestions . it was a key to a thousand painful conjectures , which flashed upon me in an instant , leaving confusion and giddiness behind , and nothing certain but the fear of what was to follow . I could not answer her ; or , rather , did not know // how to answer her , and merely tried to reassure her with a smile , which I felt was hollow and unnatural . " One * she proceeded , in the same tone , " must dispel that dream forever . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not for me . Our destinies , if they be knit together , must be cemented by onr own hands not at the altar in the church , but in the sight of heaven  --  a bond more solemn , and imposing a more sacred obligation . " I will not attempt to describe the effect of these expressions . A cold dew crept over my body , and I felt as if a paralysis had struck my senses . Yet at the same moment and while she was speaking so quietly and deliberately , and uttering words , under the heavy weight of which the fabric I had reared in my imagination crumbled down , and fell with a crash that smote my brain  --  a crowd of memories came upon me - isolated words and gestures , the dark allusions of the dwarf , and the warnings of Astrna herself  --  a crowd of things that were all dark before were now lighted up . As the stream of electricity flies along the chain , traversing link after link and nile after mile , with a rapidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every incident of the past . I now understood it all  --  the mystery that lay buried in Astrua 's words and abstractions  --  the vacant heart-  --  the hope that looked out from her eyes , and then fled back to be quenched in silent despair-her yearnings for solitude and reposethe devotional spirit that , blighted in the world , and condemned to be shut out from seeking happiness in social conventions , had fallen back upon its own lonely strength , and made to itself a faith of passion ! It was all plain to me now . But there were explanations yet to come . " Astnaa ! " I cried , hoarsely , and I felt the echoes of the name moaning through the trees . " Astrna ! What is the meaning of these dreadful words ? Have you not pledged your faith to me ? " " Irrevocably ! " she returned . " Then what new impediment has arisen to our union ? " " None that has not existed all along . Have you not seen it darkening every hour of our intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given such intensity to feelings which , had all been open before us , would have been calm and unperturbed ? - that has imparted to love , otherwise sweet and tranquil , the wild ardor of obstructed passion ? Your instincts must have told you , had you allowed yourself a moment of reflection , that the woman who consents to immolate her pride , her delicacy , her fame , for the man she loves , must be fettered by ties which leave her no alternative between him and the world . Why am I here alone with you ? " This was not said in a tone of reproach but it sounded like reproach , and wounded me . It was all true . I ought to have understood that suffering of her soul which , now that the clouds were rolling back from before my eyes , had become all at once intelligible . But to be surprised into such a discovery , to have misunderstood her unspoken agonies and sacrifices , jarred upon me , and made me feel as if my nature were not lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandeur ef her character . I imagined myself humiliated n her presence , and this consideration was paramount , for the moment , over all others . It stripped my devotion of all claim to a heroism kindred to her own , and deprived me of the only merit that could render me worthy of her love . Yet in the midst of this conflict , other thoughts came flooding upon me ; and voices from the world I was about to relinquish for her rung like a knell upon my ears . There were still explanations to come that might afford me some refuge from these tortures . " Yes , Astrna , I was conscious of some obstruction* but how could I divine what it was ? Even now I must confess myself bewildered . But as all necessity for further reserve is at an end , you will be candid and explicit with me . What is the impediment that stands in the way of our union ? " I did not intend it , but I was aware , while I was speaking , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued from my lips as if they were frozen . " You mean , " she replied , coldly , but in s tone that conveyed a feeling of rising scor* , " you mean our marriage ? " " Certainly . " " I never can be your * As I had anticipated some such statement , I ought not to have betrayed the amazement with which I looked at her ; but it was involuntary . I did not ask her to go on ; seeing , however , that I expected it , she added , " I am the wife of another ! " I started from my seat , and , in a paroxysm of frenzy , paced up and down before her . I did not exclaim aloud , " You have deceived me but my flashing eyes and flushed brow expressed it more eloquently than language . She bore this in silence for a few minutes , and then addressed me again , " I said I would try not to blame you . I blame only myself . Like all men , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vacillating in action . You are thinking now of the world , which only last night you so courageously despised . A few hours ago , you believed yourself so superior to the common weaknesses of your sex , that you were ready to make the most heroic sacrifices . What has become of that vehement resolution , that brave selfreliance ? Vanished on the instant you are put to the proof . Believe me , you have miscalculated your own nature-all men do in such cases . A woman whose heart is her life , and who shrinks in terror from all other conflicts , is alone equal to such a struggle as this . The world is your proper sphere ; do not deceive // yourself . You could not sustain isolation ; you would be forever looking back , as you are at this moment , for the consolations and support you had abandoned . " " No . Astrna ! " I exclaimed ; " you wrong me . My resolution is unchanged ; but you must allow something for the suddenness - the shock- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the best intentions . It is not your fault that habit and a constitutional acquiescence in it have left you no power over your will in great emergencies . You are what the world has made you ; and you should be thankful that you have found it out in time . For me , what does it matter ? By coming here , I have violated obligations for which society will hold me accountable , though they pressed like prison-bars upon me , lacerating and corroding my soul . It will admit no excuse for their abandonment in the unutterable misery they entailed . I am as guilty by this one step as if I had plunged into the depths of crime . The world does not recognize the doctrine that the real crime is in the admission of the first disloyal thought ; it only looks to appearances which I have outraged . I have coinpromised myself beyond redemption . I can not retrieve my disgrace , though I am as pure in a , t as if we had never met . But I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the penalty fall . From this hour I release you . " Her language , and the dignity of her manner , stung me . She seemed to tower above me in the strength of her will , and the firmness with which she went through a scene that shattered my nerves fearfully , and made me equally irresolute of speech and purpose . While I was harrowed by an agony that fluttered in every pulse , she was perfectly calm and collected , and , rising quietly from her seat , turned away to leave me . This action roused me from the stupor of indecision . The situation in which she was placed - making so new a demand upon my feelings - gave me a sort of advantage which I thought might enable me to recover the ground I had *ost . By the exercise of magnanimity in such circumstances , I should vindicate myself in her estimation , and prove myself once more worthy of the opinion she had originally formed of me . It was something nobler , I thought , to embrace rum at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along , and had come to that conclusion by a deliberate process of reasoning . This train of subtle sophistry , which has taken tsp some space to detail , struck me like a flash of light on the instant I thought I was about to lose her . 1 could bear all things but that , and could suffer all things to avert it . And so again I became her suitor , in a kind of proud generosity , that flattered itself by stooping to gain its own ends . How mean and selfish the human heart is when our desires are set in opposition to our duties I sprang forward , and clasped her eagerly by the hands . I flung myself on my knees before her . Tears leaped into my eyes . I told her that I had wronged her-that we had wronged each other-that I had never wavered in my faith-that we were bound to each other-and that we could commit no crime now except that of doubting , at either side , the truth of the love which had brought us there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world forever . She had a woman 's heart , full of tenderness and pity ; and it is the tendency of woman s nature to forgive and believe where the affections are interested without exacting much proof or penalty . She bent over me , and raised me in her arms . The storm has passed away , arid she trusted in me implicitly again . Her history ? What was it ? We shall come to it presently . x . The storm had passed away ; but it left traces of disorder behind , such as a tempest leaves in a garden over which it has recently swept . The collision had set us both thinking . We felt as if a mist had suddenly melted down , and enabled us , for the first time , to see clearly before us . We felt this differently , but we were equally conscious of the change . " I am the wife of another The words still throbbed in my brain . I could not escape from the images they conjured up . I could not rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressive , thus forced upon me . I could not recall a single incident out of which until these words were uttered , I could have extracted the remotest suspicion of her situation . To me , and to every person around her , Astrna had always appeared a fred agent . She bore no man 's name . She acted with perfect independence , so far as outward action was concerned ; and the only restraint that ever seemed to bang upon her was some dark memory , or heavy sorrow , that clouded her spirit . Here was the mystery solved . She was a bond-woman , and had hidden her fetters from the world . In our English society , where usages are strict , and shadows upon a woman s reputation , even where there is not a solitary stain , blot it out forever , this was strange and painful . It looked like a deception , and , in the estimate of all others , it was a deception . This was the way in which it first presented itself to me . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit , or prejudice , or whatever that feeling may be called which instinctively refers such questions to the social standard . The recoil was sudden and violent . Yet , nevertheless . I felt rebuked by the superiority of Astrna in the strength of purpose and moral courage she displayed under circumstances which would have overwhelmed most other women . Her steadfastness had a kind of grandeur in it , that seemed to look down upon my misgivings as failings or weaknesses of character . And she sat silently in this pomp of a clear and unfaltering resolution , while I , fretted and chafed , exhibited too plainly my double sens ' * // alike of the injury she had inflicted on me , and of the ascendency which , even in the hour of injury , she exercised over me . It was the stronger mind , made stronger by the force of love , overawing the weaker , made weaker by the prostration of the &amp;ffections . And she , too , had something to reflect upon hi this moment of mutual revolt . She loved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronting all risks and perils . The profound unselfishness and truthfulness of her love made her serene at heart , and inspired her with a calmness which enabled her to endure the worst without flinching . There was not a single doubt of herself in her own mind . Her faith gave her the fortitude needful for the martyr . When a woman trusts every thing to this faith , and feels her reliance on it sufficient for the last sacrifice , she is prepared for an issue which no man contemplates , and which no man is able to encounter with an equal degree of courage or confidence in his own constancy . With her it is otherwise . By one step , the ground is closed up behind her forever ; no remorse can help her , no suffering can make atonement , or propitiate reconciliation she can not retract , she can not retreat , she can not return ! No man is ever placed in this extremity , though his sin be of a ten-fold deeper dye . Such is the moral justice of society . lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always room to retrieve , to recover , to reinstate himself . But she is lost ! The foreknowledge of her doom , which shuts out hope , makes her strong in endurance ; the magnitude *of her sacrifice enhances and deepens the idolatry from which it proceeded ; she clings to it , and lives in it evermore , as the air which she must breathe , or die . But he ? He has ever the backward hope , the consciousness of the power of retracing his steps . The world is there behind him , as he left it , its eager tumult still floating into his ears froth afar off its reckless gayeties , its panting ambition , its occupations , amid its pleasures ; and he knows he can re-enter it when he lists . He , then , if he consent to commit the great treason against a confiding devotion , can afford to be bold ; that boldness which has always an escape and safeguard in reserve ! But it is this consideration which makes him irresolute and infirm-it is this which dashes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loose in his thoughts , while his lips overflow with the fervid declamation of passion . He may believe himself to be sincere hut no man understands himself who believes that he has renounced the world . The world has arranged it otherwise for him . The whole conditions of her position were clear to Astrna . She had not now considered them for the first time but the mistrust , not of my love for her , but of my character , was now first awakened* and if she trembled for the consequences , it was not for her own sake , but for mine . Men can not comprehend this abuega tion of self in women , and , not being able to comprehend it , they do not believe in it . it requires an elevation and generosity rare in the crisis of temptation , and , perhaps , also , an entire change of surrounding circumstances and responsibilities , to enable them to estimate it justly ; the power of bestowing happiness through a life-long sacrifice , instead of the privilege of receiving it at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at out ease , and I had endeavored by a variety of commonplaces to revive her faith in me , Astrica , with the most perfect frankness , entered upon her history . I will not break up the narrative by the occasional interruptions to which it was subjected by my curiosity and impatience , but preserve it as nearly entire as I can . " There is a period , " said Astr*a , " in all our lives when we pass through delusions which an enlarged experience dispels . We too often begin by making deities , and end by total skepticism . I suppose , like every body else , I had my season of self-deception , although it has not made me an absolute infidel . " And as she said this , she looked at me with a smile so full of sweetness , that I yielded myself up implicitly to the enchantment . " I was devotedly attached to my father , " she continued ; " ho educated me , and was so proud of the faculties which his own careful tending drew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to deserve the kindness which anticipated their development . There was no task my father set to me I did not feel myself able to conquer by the mere energy of the love I bore him . The education he bestowed upon me was not the cultivation of the intellect alone-I owe him a deeper debt , fatally as I have discharged it-for it was his higher aim to educate my affections . He succeeded so well , that I would at any moment have cheerfully surrendered my own fondest desires , or have sacrificed life itself , to comply with any wish of his . You shall judge whether I have a right to say that I loved him better than I loved myself . " My mother was a beauty . A woman of whom one can say nothing more than that she was a beauty , is misplaced in the home of a man of intellect . One can never cease wondering how it is that such men marry such women ; but I believe there are no men so easily ensnared by their own imaginations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They make an ideal , and worship it ; and , as your true believers contrive to refresh their motionless saints by new draperies and tinsel , so they go on perpetually investing their idols with fictitious attributes , to encourage and sustain their devotions . But that sort of self-imposition can not last very long ; and the best possibL recipe for stripping the idol of its false glitter is to marry it ! My father made this discovery in due time . He found that beauty without enthusiasm or intel lect is even less satisfying than a picture , // which is at least , suggestive , and leaves something to the imagination . There was no sympathy between them . She existed only in company , which , from the languor of her nature , she hardly seemed to enjoy . Change , and varie ? y , and the flutter of new faces were as necessary to her as they were wearisome to laim ; and so gradually and imperceptibly the ( distance widened between them , and his whole affections were concentrated on me . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . I was neither weakened nor benefited by maternal tenderness ; and my studies and habits , shaped and regulated by my father , imparted to me a strength and earnestness which-now that they avail me nothing I may speak of as existing in the past . " It is nearly ten years since my mother died ; she went out as a flower dies , drooping slowly , and retaining something of its sweetness to the end . My father outlived her several years . That was the happiest period of my life . There was not a break in the love that hound us together . But there came a struggle at last between us  --  a struggle in which that love was bitterly tried and tested on both sides . " I made a deity to myself ; as most young people do , especially when they are flattered into the belief that they are more spirituelle and capable of judging for themselves , than the rest of the world . It was a girlish fancy ; all girls have such fancies , and look back upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect and put together forms and colors that fade rapidly in the daylight of experience . " One of our visitors made an impression upon mc ; perhaps that is the best way to describe it . He had a sombre and poetical air-that was the first thing that touched rue-an oval face , very pale and thoughtful , and chiseled to an exzess of refinement* a sensitive mouth* dark , melancholy eyes ; and black , lustrous hair . I remember he had quite a Spanish or Italian cast of features ; and that was dangerous to a young girl steeped in the lore of history and chivalry . You think it strange , perhaps , 1 should make this sort of confession to you ; you expect that I should rather suffer you to believe that , until we met , I had never been disturbed by the sentiment of love ; yet you may entirely believe it . This was a mere phantasy  --  the prescience of what was to come  --  the awakening of the consciousness of a capacity of loving which , until now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what was in my nature , but did not draw it out . " The fascination was on the surface ; but , while it lasted , I thought it intense and such *s the contradiction in the constitution of youth , that a little opposition from my father only helped to strengthen it . In the presence of that sad face , into which was condensed an irresisP ible influence , I was silent and timid , frightened at the touch of his white hands and so confused that I could neither speak to him , nor look at him : but in my father 's presence , when we talked of him , and my father hinted distrusts and antipathies , I was bold in his defense and soared into an enthusiasm that often surprised us both . It was evident that I was in love  --  to speak by the card  --  and that the admonitions of experience were thrown away upon me . " My father was grieved at this discovery , when it really came to take a serious shape of resistance to his advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confines of the subject , and neither of us had openly recognized it as a reality . The action of the drama was in my own brain . The hero of my rantastic reveries regarded me only as a precocious child : was amused , or , at the utmost , interested by my admiration of him , which he could not fail to detect* and it was not until he imagined he had traced a deeper sentiment in my shy and embarrassed looks , that he began to feel any emotion himself . But the emotions which spring out of vanity or compassion , which come only as a sort of generous or pitying acknowledgment of an unsought devotion , h ave no stability in them . It is more natural , and more likely to insure duration of love that they should originate at the other side . Woman was formed to be sued and won* it is the law of our organization . Men value our affection in proportion to the efforts it has cost to gain them . The rights of a difficult conquest are worn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are held in indifference . These things , however , were mysteries to me then . " There was a kind of love-scene between us . I can hardly recall any thing of it , except that I thought him more grand and noble than ever , and full of a magnificent patronage of my nerves and my . ignorance . He was several years older than I was , which made a great distance between us , and made me look up to him with a superstitious homage . I remember nothing more about it , only that when I left him , I felt as if I had suddenly grown up into a woman . " And now came the beginning of the struggle . " We had other visitors who were better liked by my father . I could not then understand his objections to my Orlando . I have understood them since , and know that he was right in that , if he erred in the rest . " Among our visitors was one whom I can not speak of without a shudder . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with aversion , which grew from day to day into loathing . I do not believe my father really liked that man . Circumstances , however , had given him an influence in our house , against which it was vain for me to contend . His fain .. ily was closely conne* ' 4ed with my mother ; and my father hact acquired an estate through his marriage , with which these people we c // mixed up as trustees ; they had , in fact , a lien upon us , which it was impossible to shake off and by this means maihtained a position with us which was at once so familiar and harassing to me , that nothing but my devotion to my father restrained me from an open mutiny against them . " This man , who was not much my senior in years , but who seemed to have been born old , and to have lived centuries for every year of my life , entertained the most violent passion for me . I had no suspicion of it at first and as the closeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding it unknowingly for a long time before I discovered it . I will spare you what I felt when I made that discoverythe horror ! the despair ! " When I compared this man , loathsome and hideous to me , with him who was the Orlando , the Bayard , the Crichton of my foolish dreams ' , it made me sick at heart . So deep was the detestation he inspired , that , young as I was , I would have gladly renounced my own choice to have escaped from him . But there was one consideration paramount even to that ; it was my father 's desire that I should marry him . " By some such sorcery as wicked demons in the wise allegories of fable obtain a control over good spirits , the demon who had thus risen up in my path obtained an ascendency over my father . It was impossible that he could have persuaded my father , who was clear-sighted and sagacious , into the belief that he possessed a single attribute of goodness it must have been by the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise over children , that he wrought his ends . And the compnrison was never applied with greater justice , for my father was as guileless as a child in mere worldly affairs , while the other was a subtle compound of cunning and venom , glazed over with a most bypocritical exterior . " He worked at his purpose for months and months in the dark , by artifices which assisted his progress without betraying his aim . He adroitly avoided an abrupt disclosure of his design , for he knew , or feared , that if it came too suddenly , it would have shocked even my father . He saw that my fancy was taken up elsewhere , and the first part of his plot was , to prejudice and poison my father 's mind against his rival . In this he effectually succeeded . But it was a more difficult matter to bring round his own object , and he never could have achieved it with all his skill had he not been so mixed up with our affairs as to have it in his power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meshes were woven round him with consummate ingenuity , and every effort at extrication only drew them tighter and tighter . " Had I known as much of the world then as I do now I might have acted differently . But I was a girl ; my sensibility was easily moved ; my terrors were easily alarmed* and I loved my father too passionately to be able to exercise a calm judgment where his safety was concerned . It was this devotion-impetuous and iAnreflecting-that gave an advantage to the fiend , of which he availed himself unrelentingly , and which threw me , bound and fettered , at his feet . " I will not dwell on these memories . My heart was harrowed by a terrible conflict . I know not how it might have been , had I not gathered a little strength from wounded pride . A circumstance came to my relief which crushed my enthusiasm , and from that instant determined my fate . " My father had often thrown out doubts of the sincerity of him to whom I looked ip with so much admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told me that the hero of my dreams was merely trifling with my feelings , and amusing himself at the expense of my credulity-in short , that he was no better than a libertine . I revolted against these cruel accusations , and repelled them by asserting that he was the noblest and truest of human beings . But my father knew more of him than I did . Even while these painful discussions were going on between us , news arrived that he had been detected in a heartless conspiracy to entrap and carry off a ward in chancery  --  a discovery which compelled him to fly the country . " I was stunned and humiliated . The dream was over . The idol was broken , and the shrine degraded forever . What resource should women have in such cases if pride did not come to their help-that pride which smiles while the heart is bleeding , and makes the world think that we do not suffer ! They know not what we suffer-what we hide ! Our education trains us up in a mask , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has fed upon oni hearts , and consumed our lives , day by day , descends into the dark grave with us ! My sufferings at the time were very great-I thought they would kill me . What mattered it to me then how they disposed of me . Poor fool ! I looked in on my desolated fancy , and gave myself up for lost . " It was in this mood the machinations of that man whom I abhorred triumphed over me . My father 's affairs had become hopelessly en tangled in his , and a proposal to avert chancery suits and settle disputed titles by a union between the families of the litigants presented the only means of adjustment . My father listened to this insidious proposal at first reluctantly ; then , day by day , as difficulties thickened , he became more reconciled to it ; and , at length , he broke it to me , with a deprecating gentleness that never sued in vain to the heart that idolized him . I had nothing left in the world but my father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made me waver . As it was , wounded and hopeless , galled , deceived , and cast off-for I felt as all girls do , and was thoroughly in earnest in my sentimental misery-my love for him lightened the sacrifice he prayed , rather than demanded at my hands . // " Girl as I was , I could see the change that had passed over my father . The strong man was subdued and broken down . His clear understanding had given way ; even his heart was no longer as generous and impulsive as it used to be . I could not bear to witness these alterations ; and wben Iwas told that it was in my power to rtAieve him from the weight that pressed upon him , what could I do ? " There were many violent struggles-many fits of tears and solitary remorse ; but they all yielded to that imperative necessity , to that claim upon my feelings , which was paramount to every thing else . The first step was a contract of marriage , which I was simply required to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration was thrown in as a sort of tender forbearance to me , which , it was hoped , would propitiate my reluctant spirit . And from that hour , the demon , claiming me for his own , was incessant in his attendance upon me . I had hoped by that act to shake him off my father ; but he was the Old Man of the Waters to his drowning victim , and at every moment only clutched and clung to him more closely . " At last my father fell ill . First , he moped about the house , with a low , wearing cough . None of his old resources availed him . He could n't read ; the pleasant things he used to talk of-books , character , philosophy-no longer interested him . The placid mind was growing carped and restless . He was absorbed in his ailments . Trifles vexed him , and instead of the large and genial subjects which formerly engrossed him , he was taken up with petty annoyances . Oh , with what agony I watched that change from day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , from whence he never rose again . " It was in his last sickness-toward the close-when the wings of the Angel of Death were darkening his lids , and his utterance was thickening , and his vision becoming dimmerand dimmer , that he called me to his side . He knew the horror that was in my thoughts ; but I was already pledged , and it was not a time for me to shrink , when he , in whom my affections were garnered up , besought me to make his deathbed happy by completing the sacrifice . There were those around us who said that it was merely to ease his mind , that he might feel he did not leave me behind him alone and without a protector ; that the marriage would be performed in his presence that we should then separate , and that my husband-oh , how I nave hated that word ! what images of wrong and cruelty are condensed into it ! - would regard that ghastly ceremony only as a guarantee that when my grief had abated , and the signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become his wife before the world . I believed in that and trusted to it . It was all written dwn and witnessed , that he would not enforce this marriage till time had soothed and reconciled me to it ; and as the realization of it was to *lepend upon myself , I thonght I was secure against the worst . Upon these conditions I was married beside the death-bed of my father . " The plot was deeply laid . The snare was covered with flowers . I was nominally free . I was the wife , and not the wife , of him who , when a little time had passed away , and my father was in the grave , and I was at his mei - cy , assumed the right of asserting over me the authority of a husband . I did not then know the full extent of my dependence . Upon the failure of my consent , the whole property was to devolve upon him . Of that I thought little ; it was a cheap escape from a bondage I abhorred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ id escape . There was nothing left in my own hands , but the power of withholding my conse t , and I did withhold it ; and my aversion increased with the base , unmanly , and vindictive means he used to wring it from me . " Years passed away ; he was ever in my path , blighting me with threats and scoffs My life was one continued mental slavery . He had the right , or he usurped it , of holding me in perpetual bondage - hovering about me , watching my actions , and subjecting me to a persecution which , invisible to every body else , was felt by me in the minutest trifles . And all this time my heart , shut up and stifled , felt a longing , such as prisoners feel , to breathe the free air , to find its wings and escape . I was conscious of a capacity for happiness ; I felt that my existence was wasting under a hideous influence-that my situation was cruel and anomalous-that it was equally guilty to stay and feed the rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad , or to fly from the evil thoughts that fascinated and beset me - and long contemplation of this corroding misery convinced me that the greater guilt was the hourly falsehood  --  the constant mutiny of my soulthe sin I was committing against nature by continuing to tolerate the semblance of an obligation that made me almost doubt the justice of heaven ! " Again and again he renewed the subject , only to be again and again repulsed with increased bitterness and scorn . The sternness of my resolution gradually obtained a victory over his perseverance . No man , be his devotion as intense as it may , can persist in this way , when he is thoroughly assured that a woman hates or despises him ; and he had ample reason to know that I did both . Threats failed-hints of scandal and defamation failed - prayers and entreaties failed-he tried them all and he saw at last that my determination was irrevocable . I would not redeem my pledge . I took all the consequence of the perfidy . I submitted to the ignominy of his taunts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain my soul with a blacker crime . What was left to him ? His arts were baffled -- his pride turned to dust-his love rejected ? What was left to him out of this ruin of his long cherished scheme ? REvENGE ! " Although he could not force me to fulfill // the contract , he could blast my life in its bloom - wither the tree to the core-make a desert round it-poison the very atmosphere that gave it nourishment and strength  --  and wait patientto see it die , leaf by leaf ; and branch by branch , This was his devilish project . Love-if ever so sacred a passion had found its way into his soul-was transformed into hate , deadly and unrelenting ; the red current had become gall ; and the same slow , insatiable energy , with which he had before urged and forced his suit , was now applied to torture and distract me . I wonder it did not drive me to some act of des-peration ! " And all this time I moved through society like others . Nobody suspected the vulture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wretched necessity of acting a daily lie to the world . It gave a false severity to my manner - it made me seem austere and lofty , where I only meant to avert approaches which it would have been criminal to have admitted and deceived . And I had need of all that repellant armor ; and it served me , and saved me-till I met you ! " Shall I proceed any farther ? Shall I tell you how a new state of existence seemed insensibly opening before me * ? - how the want in my heart became unconsciously filled ? - and that which had been a dream to me all my life long , vague , flitting , and undefined , was now a reality , clear , fixed , and distinct ? What that sympathy was it is needless to ask , which made me feel that your history was something ike my own-that you , too , had some discontent with the world , that made you yearn for peace and solitude , and the refuge of love , like me . I fought bravely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prohed my wounded spirit , and battled with the temptatien . All that was hidden from you ; but it was not the less fierce and agonizing . The blessed thought and hope of freedom , of a happiness which I had never trusted myself to contemplate , was a strong and blinding fascination . I saw my wretchedness , and close at hand its perilous remedy . Doomed either way , which was I to choose ? The world ? - my soul ? All was darkness and terror to me . Calamity had made me desperate ; yet I was outwardly calm and self-sustained . But I was goaded too far at last ; he goaded me ; and my resolution was taken ; it was one plunge-and all was over . I fled from the misery I could no longer endure , and live ; and I know the cost-I know the penalty-I see before me the retribution . Let it come-my fate is sealed ! " XI . This narrative occupied a longer time in the relation than in the shape to which I have reduced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I have not thought it necessary to insert here . When she concluded , the day was already waning , and the long shadows from the woods were stretching down the stream , and the setting sun was , here and there , blazing through the trees , like focal rays caught on the surface of a burning .. glass . The haze of evening was gathering round us , and settling over the little bridge which was now slowly fading into the distance . Astrna had confided her whole life to me with the utmost candor . The strong emotions she exhibited throughout afforded the best proof if any were wanted , of her perfect sin. *erity There was nothing kept back-no arri*s-e-pesi see-no false coloring ; her real characte cain* ' out forcibly in this painful confession . Few women would have had the requisite fc4titude to submit to such an ordeal , and take their final stand upon a position which marked them out as Pariahs in the eyes of the world . I felt how great the misery must have been from which she sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of will that sustained her in the resolution to embrace it . Her wild sense of natural justice had risen in resistance against laws which it appeared to her more criminal to obey than to violate . It was not a paroxysm of the passions-it was not the sophistry that seeks for its own convenience to arraign the dispensations of society ; it was a strong mind , contending in its own right against obligations founded on force and violence , and wrong-asserting its claim to liberate itself from trammels to which it had never given a voluntary assent-recoiling from a life of skepticism and hypocrisy , and the frightful conflicts it entails between duty and the instincts of reason and the heart  --  and prepared , since no other alternative was left , t suffer in itself alone , and in the consequences of its own act , all obloquy , all vengeance tue world could inflict . That there lay beneath this a grave error , undermining the foundations upon which the whole social superstructure rested , was , in a certain large and general sense , sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against convictions based upon individual and exceptional injuries ? Who could require , in the very moment and agony of sacrifice , that she who had been thus wronged and tortured , and who had never , of her own free action , incurred the responsibility from which she revolted , should offer herself up a victim to laws that afforded her no protection , and condemned her to eternal strife , and the sins of a rebellious conscience ? I would have saved her if I could . It was my first impulse - my most earnest desire . But of what avail was the attempt ? Where was she to find refuge ? Only one of two courses lay before her  --  to return and fulfil her contract , or to renounce the world : the first was doubtful perhaps impossible ; the second , she had resolved upon . Even if I were to hold hack on the brink of the precipice , it woull r*ot shake her determination . In this extremity and in the last resort , I felt myself bound to her by every consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our casuistry , the peril is at its height // " Have you never endeavored to release yourself from this contract ? " I inquired . " He would not release me . " " Have you explicitly demanded it of him , so that you should have the satisfaction of feeling that you had tried all other means before you broke the bond yourself ? " " I have demanded and besought it of himprayed to him-appealed to bim , by his soul 's hopes here and hereafter , to release me . I have laid my own perdition on his refusal-and he still refused . I gave up all ; offered to leave England forever ; to give him security that , be my fate what it might , neither he nor his should he troubled with me . To no purpose-he was iron . He could have procured a separation , which I could not . I gave him the means , and would have borne any humiliation to obtain my freedom . He would not release me he neid me bound , that he might gloat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-this fiend-you have not told me , Astrua , who he is " While I was speaking , I observed her looking keenly through the mist that was collecting about us . Some object had attracted her attention . My eyes followed the direction hers had taken , and I discerned a figure , apparently wrapped up in a cloak , about the centre of the bridge , on the near side . We watched it in silence for a space of two or three minutes , when it moved slowly from its position , and winding down among the trees , took the path that led directly to the spot where we were 5 ? ated , She grasped my arm , and cried in a Wi1iS* ? 5 - " Stan . firm . Speak not . It is my deed , not yours The hour I have looked for through long years of anguish is come at last . Fear nothing for me The figure approached , still enveloped in a cloak , and stood exactly opposite to us . For a moment  --  the most intense I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger spoke . " It is , then , as I expected . I have tracked you to your hiding-place , and I find you with your paramour . " It was the voice of the dwarf ! The blood leaped in my veins , and , hardly conscious of what I was doing , or meant to do , I sprang from my seat . Astriua rose at the same moment , and interposed . " If you have the least regard or respect for me , " she said , " do not interfere . For my sake , control yourself . " " For your sake ! " echoed the dwarf . " Do you glory in his shame , as well as your own ? " Shame ! " cried Astrrea . " Take back the foul word , and begone . You have no authority , n* rights here . The shame is yours , not mine - yours , unmanly , pitiful , and mean , who have taken advantage of a contract wrung from a girl to doom the life of a woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoth the dwarf . " Listen to me-you must-you shall-if it kill you in your heroics . I am your husband-my authority is law . I can command you to my foot , and you must obey me . You think you are secure ; but I will show you that you have committed an egregious mistake . Believe me , " he added in a tone of supercilious mockery , for which I could have inflicted summary chastisement- " believe me , you only deceive yourself , as you have tried to deceive * " In what have I tried to deceive you ? " she demanded . " I have been so explicit with you , that none but the most contemptible of your sex would have persisted at such a sacrifice of pride and feeling . Pride ? You have none . Where you proffered love-oh ! such love you found aversion ; - where you sought , sued , and threatened , you received nothing in return but loathing and scorn . And now henceforth and forever , I break all bonds between us . Since you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obey you 9 I owe you no obedience . Be wise take my answer , and leave me . " Not at your bidding , madam . I did not come here to visit you in your retirement , and be turned away so unceremoniously . It is not my intention to leave you . Where you are , there must I be too . " The insolent coolness with which this was spoken , rendered it very difficult for me to sub . mit to the injunction Astrna had imposed upon me . I began to feel that I , too , had rights , and that the course this husband-in-law was pursuing , was not the best calculated to induce me to surrender them . " Where I am you shall never come again I " ieturned Astrua . " That is over . A g* if yawns between us . Do not tempt it any further . " " I will not be critical about words with you , " said the dwarf . " If I am not to come where you are , you shall come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only wasting your fine speeches . I have come here to take you back to London . " " To take me back ? " she echoed . " Are you mad ? Do you believe such a thing credible ? I have chosen my own course ; and no power , authority , or force can turn me from it . Take me back ! Even were I willing to gosuppose I were weak enough to repent the step I have taken-can you not see-have you not eyes and understanding to see and comprehend , that it would he to your own eternal dishonor -- that it would only bring upon you the contempt and derision of the world ? " " It is for me to judge of that . Come-we are losing time , and it is growing dark already . " " Then why do you stay ? Why do you not go as you came . I have given you my answer ; and if you were to stand here forever , you will get none other . Have you no particle of selfrespect left ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dwarf , in a low and bitter tone , you have trampled upon , and raised up a demo. - niac spirit in this place . It might have been // otherwise once . I loved you-ay ! writhe under the word-I loved you ; but I was ill-favored , misshapen , stunted , and loathsome to look upon . You thought that love and ambition and high thcughts could not take up with such a frame as this-that they all went with straight limbs and milky faces . Nature could not condescend to endow the dwarf with the attributes of humanity . But I was a man as well as they had the passions and hopes of a man , the capabilities of good and evil . You never sought the good ; you never felt it to be your duty to seek and cultivate the better qualities which my own consciousness of my outward defects made irresolute and wayward in development . You only looked upon the surface : and in the selfishness of your heart you spurned me from you . You never thought of asking yourself whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for noble ends , the human soul that was pent up in this weak and distorted body . You never stopped to reflect whether , by your contumely and pride of beauty , you were not destroying the germs of all self-respect , perverting the virtuous instincts into poisonous fangs , and shattering to the core the best resolves of a human being who might be better than yourself . A word of kindness in season  --  a genera ous construction of my character-an effort to call my moral strength into action , might have raised me to the dignity of the manhood it was your pleasure to disdain and degrade-might have given me the fortitude and the compensating motive to resign you-might have saved us both ! But that word was never on your lips-that effort you were not generous enough to try . What I am , then , you have made me - bitter to the dregs , engrossed by one thought , living but for one object . Life is a curse to me . Every new day that rises upon me , humiliation and despair are before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What have I to lose ? You hate me -- I return you hate for hate , loaded with the recollections of years of scorn and defiance . Defiance ? Ha ! ha- ! It is my turn now , and no remorse shall step in between us to mitigate my vengeance His voice rose almost into a shriek at the close , he had worked himself up to such a height of fanatic excitement ; yet , notwithstanding the denunciation with which he ended , it was impossible not to be touched with pity for the real suffering that had reduced him to this condition . A great sorrow had converted this wretched man into a human fiend ; and I never before believed that there were the elements of tenderness in him which these references to the past seemed dimly to light up . Astrrea heard it all very calmly . " We are not answerable for our likings or antipathies , " she replied ; " and I am no more accountable for my feeling than you are for your shape . Had you possessed the instincts you speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have long since secured , at least , my gratitude , and spared us both the ignominy of this night . But it is useless to look back . I have nothing more to say . Let us part-in hate , if you will I am indifferent alike to your opinions and your vengeance . Avail yourself of whatever power the law gives you ; but hero we now part , never to meet again As she said this , she moved away , and I still lingered behind to protect her retreat , if it should be necessary . " No , madam ; not so easily . We do not part . I command you to leave this place , and go with me . It is my pleasure . Do not compel me to enforce it . " Seeing him rush forward to follow her , I placed myself between them . " I charge you , " cried the dwarf , " to stand out of my path . It will be dangerous . " " You have threatened me before , " I exclaimed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should understand each other . I have an advantage over you which I do not desire to use , except in extremity ; be careful , therefore , how you provoke it . Advance no further , or I will not answer for the consequences " So , then , you champion her in her guilt , " he cried . " I know of no guilt , " I replied . " I have not interfered hitherto ; I had no right to do so . But I will not suffer any violence to be committed toward her ; she must be free to act as she pleases " And what right have you to interfere now ? " " The right which every man has to protect a woman against outrage . " " I warn you for the last time ! " exclaimed the dwarf , his eyeballs flashing fire . " It is yes who have done this ; you who have tempted and destroyed her-destroyed us both . Do not urge me to the retribution I thirst for . Put your hand upon me ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put me on my defense ! " Astrna was standing at my side . " I charge you , " she said , " to leave him , and go into the house . He will not dare to follow me 1 " " I will dare the depths of perdition , and follow you wherever you go . See how he shrinks from me ! - this champion and bully , for whom you stand condemned and branded before the world " Bully ! " I cried , " if you were not the feeble , wretched thing you are , I would strike you to the earth . It is you , not I , that have worked out this shame for your own fiendish ends . Did you not tell me that you helped and encouraged our intercourse-that you saw feelings growing up , and used all your arts to heighten them into an attachment which you knew would bring misery upon us all ? For what purpose , devil as you are , did you do this ? " " To break her heart-for she had broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dons , and leave us . You have placed me n a posi tion which no fear of consequences can imidrice
