txt ART . 1. - THE CHRISTIAN TRINITY A PRACTICAL TRUTH . IT *5 most remarkable that our Lord Jesus Christ , at just the moment when we look to find him offering what is most of all practical and distinctive in his Gospel , most necessary in that view to its power in the earth , advances just the Christian Trinity and nothing else . His work is now done , and the hour of his final ascension is conie. rns disciples are gathered round him to receive their commission of trust and the Farewell Address , so to speak , of their Great Leader . Now he will seize on the first truths of the kingdom and put them forward . No matter of mere theory or of idle curiosity will obtrude . He will give them counsel for the guidance of their future course - cautions , encouragements , suggestions of heavenly wisdom . He will bring out the great truth of salvation , the change to be wrought in mankind , the manner and means of the change-the way to preach and what to preach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise conduct of the future church about to be gathered in all parts of the world by their ministry . What then does he say ? - " Go ye therefore and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the // Son , and of the Holy Ghost . " This , and this alone , is the commission . What then does it mean , that Christ himself , the simplest and most practical and , in the higher sense , most rational of all teachers , in a parting charge to his disciples , gives them not any truth or vestige of truth over and above this one difficult , ever to be contested formula of Trinity ? At first view the fact appears to have no agreement either with the time or with the general manner of the teacher ; but , as we pause upon it and ponder it a little more deeply , we begin to suspect that this formula of Trinity is given , simply because it is the Gospel in its most condensed term of statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreground of the commission , as a general denomination for all that is practical in the Christian truth . And that such was the real understanding of Christ sufficiently appears in the fact , that the commission given is itself a working commission . They are to go " teaching and baptizing all nations , " and the converts made are to be baptized into the name of the Sacred Three , as being the name of that power by which alone they are renewed , and are to have their spiritual cleansing accomplished . In some deeper sense of it open to him , the Trinity , as we are thus left to understand , is the underlying truth , and contains the whole working matter of his Gospel . No sentiment or opinion could be farther off from the current impressions of our time . That the Christian Trinity is , in any sense , a practical truth appears in our day to be very generally unsuspected . Thus among the outsiders , the light-minded critics and worldly cavilers of profane literature , the Trinity is taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren futilities preached and contended for as articles of religion . The class of Unitarian believers handle the subject more seriously , and arrive at the conclusion , which they assert with peremptory confidence , that it is a stupendous theologic fiction , a plain absurdity in itself and in its effects , one of the worst practical hindrances to the power of the Gospel ; for how can it be less when it annihilates the simplicity of God , confuses the mind of the worshiper , and even makes the faith of God an impossible subject to the unbeliever . Meantime how many of the formally professed believers of the doctrine are free to acknowledge that they see no practical value in it , and will even blame the preacher who maintains it , for spending his time and breath in a matter so far out of the way of the practical life , a merely curious article or riddle of the faith . And how many others , even of the more serious // class of believers , would say , if they were to speak out what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable drawback on the idea of God . They would recoil indeed from the thought , as being even a blameable irreverence , of imagining any improvement of God ; but if they could think of him as a simple unit of personality , in the manner of the Unitarians , he would consciously be just so much more to their mind , and their practical relations towards him would be proportionally cleared and comforted . An issue is thus made up , it will be seen , between the ascending iRedeemer , on one side , and a very general sentiment or opinion of the Christian world on the other , regarding the practical import of the Christian Trinity . On the side last named , it is very commonly asserted that it has no practical value , , and is only a kind of scholastic futility which , if we do not reject , we receive as a faith wholly inoperative and useless . On the side of the Son of God himself , it is assumed to be , in fact , a condensed expression for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protected by so great a name , it requires no courage in us to venture some considerations , from our human point of view , that may go to illustrate the intense practical significance of this great truth . For what Christ has given us from his higher point of authority , evidently needs in this , as in other cases , to be naturalized in our human convictions by a discovery of the want on our own side , . which his truth is given to supply . Indeed it has often seemed to us that nothing is ever needed , as regards the evidence of this much litigated truth , but to know it in its practical uses , and perceive the sublime facility with which it limbers the play of our thought to all that is most transcendent in the divine nature and the new economy of the Gospel of Christ . In asserting the immense practical value thus of the Christian Trinity , we do not mean , it is hardly necessary to say , that the Trinity is practical in the sense of presenting something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of showing in what manner something else is to be done . It is practical only as an instrument of thought , action , self-application to all the great matters of the faith . What is more practical than human language ? And as by the use of language our understandings are adjusted , our feelings expressed , our information received , our mind itself developed , so by the Christian Trinity it is that our sense of God is opened ; what he has done for us and will do , put in terms of use ; all the relations of what he does in o'ne part of his kingdom to what he has instituted and // done in another-mysteries of law and grace , letter and spiritplayed into our practical apprehension , so that by mere names and signals , our faith is inducted into uses before we can discover reasons and settle definitions . The Trinity , in short , is so related to the Gospel and our approach to God in the faith of the Gospel , that the grace of it , without such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered practically in* efficient . But this , again , we could not say of all the possible or existing forms of Trinity ; for it is not to be denied that conceptions of this great truth are held by many which are so far abhorrent from its proper simplicity , and so badly distorted by the perverse ingenuity of human speculation , as to oppose great hindrances to the practical repose of faith , and even to counteract , in a great degree , the real benefit of the doctrine . We undertake to show the practical value only of the Christian Trinity , or Trinity of the Christian Scriptures . And the Scriptures offer no theoretic , or scientific statement of the doctrine whatever , give us nothing pertaining to the subject in terms of logical definition . They assume the strict unity and simplicity of God , that he is one substance or entity , only one ; which one they also assume , will , at least , be most effectively thought as three , a threefold grammatic personality , or three persons , Father , Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called persons , but are only set in the grammar of uses silently as such . Of course it is nowhere said or implied that they are three persons in the same sense that John , James , and Peter , are three ; and the mere laws of grammar , in which they stand , support no such inference , any more than the grammar of sex , supports a like inference respecting the real gender of the sun and moon . The three are persons , evidently , only in some sense that recognizes a radical unity of substance , ( which is not tine of any three men , ) some tropical , or instrumental sense , that needs not any way to be , and can not be , exactly defined . The plurality therefore , whatever it be , does not divide , but only more sufficiently communicates , the One . Our argument does not require that we should go into any discussion regarding either the evidence , or the interior significance of the Trinity . It fixes simply on the Scripture fact , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and necessity . And for the present , we shall speak as if it were only a matter of form or language , accommodated in that manmer to our finite wants and uses , but before we close , shall ascend to a point more interior , and to higher apprehensions of the subject , viz : to the discovery of something more intenor , // as a ground in the eternity of God , antecedent to the revelation in time . Our present concern is to show , that assuming the oneness and infinity of God , Trinity is needed as a way of conceiving God , and working our piety towards him , in the matters of grace and redemption . So far , Trinity may be regarded as language for God , or as an expedient in the manner of the Sabellians . The arguments for use or practical necessity , will be greatly simplified by including , in the question , nothing more than this : or at least , by including nothing more , till we have reached a point where the transition to a deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a grand preliminary in this mode of argument , we need to observe , that in conceiving God , we are obliged to represent Him , as we do all spiritual realities , by images and figures , taken from things we know . And then there is , of course , a sense in which the representation is true , and a sense in which it is not true , and exactly where the line is to be drawn , we often can not tell more exactly , than simply to say that we speak in a figure . Thus we describe the heavenly state as a paradise , a garden , watered by a river , with trees of healing on its banks ; or we conceive it as a city whose height , length , and breadth are equal , and whose walls are built of precious stones ; and then we can not tell more exactly where truth ends and error begins , than simply to say that the representation holds figuratively , and not literally . Or we may take a different illustration , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most of us have no thought of difficulty in affirming it , that God is a person , or a personal being . But a little reflection will show us , that the word person thus applied , is only a figure derived from our finite human personality , and is , in fact , a strictly finite word . After all , God is not a person save in a figure , as we shall see at a glance , if we ask what constitutes our idea of a person . This we shall readily answer out of our own consciousness , by saying that a person is a conscious being , an agent or intelligent self-active force-exactly what our consciousness conceives to be included in itself . But the moment we begin to recite the inventory of our consciousness , we find that almost every article in it , is in such a type of measure and mode , that we can not refer it to God at all . Thus a person or agent , as we conceive the term , drawing on our own consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without which new determinations , personality is null , and no agency at all . But God never does that : his determinations are all passed even from eternity . So a person thinks , or has successions // of thought coming in , as it were , in file , one after another . God never thinks in any such sense . As all his acts are done , so all his thoughts are present contemporaneously from eternity . A person or intelli gcut agent reasons , drawing one proposition out of others-in this sense God never reasons . A person remembers-God never remembers ; for nothing past is ever out of mind . A person hopes and conjectures-God does neither ; for the future is as truly present to him , as the past . A person has e-motions , simple movings out of feeling into the foreground of the hour . God has no such temporary movings , in which one feeling jets rip for the hour into eminence , and takes the foreground of his life ; all movings or states of affection are in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so we find that a very great part , certainly of what we were affirming , in the assertion that God is a person , is in some other view not true . Literally , God is not a person ; for the very word is finite in all its measures and implications ; because it is derived from ourselves . Figuratively , he is a person ; and beyond this , nothing can be said which is more definite , save that he is in some sense unconceived , a real agent who holds himself related personally to us , meeting us in terms of mutuality , such that we can have the sense of society with him , and the confidence of his society with us , as if he were in truth , a literal persdn like ourselves . There is a value in this last illustration , beyond the mere showing under what conditions of figure we are obliged to speak of the divine nature , and what are the conditions of truth in our representation . We do not remember ever to have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , as regards truth or intelligent comprehension , when we say that God is a person , that we do when we say that he is three persons , and there is really no difficulty in one case that does not exist in the other . As we can say that God is a person without any real denial of his infinity , so we can say that he is three persons , without any breach of his unity . Indeed , we shall hereafter see that he is set forth , and needs to be , as three persons , for the very purpose , in part , of mending a difficulty created by asserting that he is one person ; that is , to save the impression of his infinity . The word person is , in either case , a figure , and as truly in one as in the other . And if the question be raised , what correspondent reality there is in the divine nature to meet and justify the figure , there can plainly be no literal correspondence between the infinite substance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three ; or , if we suppose a correspondence undefinable and tropical , it may as well answer to three persons , as to one . // Neither is there any difficulty in removing the logical objections so pertinaciously urged against the Trinity , on the ground that three distinct personal pronouns are applied to God , requiring us to regard him as a council or plurality of beings ; after which it is impossible that he should be one being . Grammatic laws and relations may as well pass into figure as mere names of things . Thus , to convey a certain undefined or indefinable impression , we may apply the feminine pronoun she to a ship , using a grammatic term of gender for a descriptive and representative purpose . And then , to represent or connect another impression , we may give the ship a masculine name , such as Hercules or Agamemnon . Whereupon the man of logic , scandalized by so great absurdity , may begin to argue that since the ship is feminine as to gender , it can not be masculine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine . But it will be sufficient , for any one but him , to answer that we use these terms of gender only to represent some indefinable partiall y correspondent reality which we can signify by this short method better than by any other . So if it be urged that person means person , and number means number , by the inevitable laws of grammar , and that when we have called God three persons , it must be absurd to speak any longer of his unity , it is sufficient to answer , that there may be a representative personality and number , as well as a representative or tropical gender , and that any mere logical practice on the words will , in both cases , be equally futile and puerile . Indeed , the pronoun he applied to each one of the persons of the Trinity , is itself a word of gender , as truly as of number and person , and it would not be as great an offense to the majority of mankind to say that God is impersonal , as to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create so great difficulty that God is represented as a Trinity of persons ? Why not go into a logical practice on the gender of the pronoun , as well on the number and the grammatic personality . There may , it is true , be a much closer degree of correspondence in these latter cases , with something interior in God-of that we shall speak hereafter-but , for aught that appears , the logical process covers precisely the same kind of falsity in one case as in the other . But these are matters inductive and preliminary . We come now to the question itself , what is the practical import of the Trinity ? Wherein consists its value ? It is needed , we answer , to serve two main purposes I. To save the dimensions or the practical infinity of God , consistently with his personality . God is never fully presented // to the mind , or adequately conceived , except when lie is conceived under these two conditions together ; viz , as a being really infinite , and also as existing in terms of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the right and left of the Christian Trinity , two distinct views which are both fatally defective and mutually opposite to each other . First , the view of the pantheists , who are instigated by a desire to establish , or adequately conceive , the infinity of God . Struggling after this they spread themselves over all space and time and substance , and looking at the All , as an eternal going on of spiritual development under laws of eternal necessity , they call it God . Their God is the largest thought they can raise-largest , that is , in extent , and containing boundary , but he is no person . Personality has been lost in the struggle after magnitude , or rather it has been actually dismissed as untenable ; because the word , logically treated and literally taken , presents God under conditions of time and date , waking up to create worlds , exercised by thoughts , remembrances , reasonings , attentions and affections personal-all which is contrary to the rational infinity of God . The doctrine of God 's personality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit on his perfection ; for it is not perceived that though the word person is finite , it may yet have an application figurative , that is legitimate , and leaves all finite implications behind , availing only to set the infinite in terms of society with us . The result is that God , in this rejection of his personality , becomes a vast platitude ; or , if not this , a dreary , all containing abyss ; a being unconscious , a fate , a stupendous IT , without meaning or value to our religious nature ; a theme of barren rhapsody and vaporing declamation , not a friend , not a redeemer , not an object of personal affinity , love or truth . Over against these pantheistic aberrations , we have the doctrine of lliFnitarianism , which represents God , in opposition to pantheism , as a being personal , and , because of the supposed absurdities , or rational impossibilities of Trinity , one person . Clearing thus , at once , the dearth of pantheism and the contradictions of Trinity , it presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strict undivisible unity , is therefore no offense or stumbling block to reason . The result is that the personality , or relational state of God is saved in the completest manner ; God is a person , a simple *unit of reason , a Father eternal , creating and ruling the worlds : and doing all things for the benefit of his children . But the difficulty now is that the dimensions are lost the infinite mag - nitude is practically taken away . And precisely here , as was just // now intimated , is one of the grand practical uses of Trinity . The Unitarians supposed that when they had carried out their doctrine and shown that God is a simple unit of fatherhood , they had gained a great point , cleared the confusion , reduced the absurdity , and presented to the world a being so lovely in his character and so rational in his evidence , that all intelligent worshipers must rejoice , and the world itself must shortly turn itself to urn in love . But alas ! there was a fatal difficulty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal ; . viz , that in going on to assert the one God , always under th' same figure of personality , till that figure became a well nigh literal affirmation , the dimensions of God would be reduced to the measures of the human figure , and their one God , their Great Father , would be a name without magnitude , or any henuine power of impression . We do not of course mean , when we thus speak , to imply that the Unitarian will become any the less a believer theoretically in the infinity of God ; or that he will not save himself from the letting down process , in a degree , by the great tokens of power and majesty he will trace in the worlds of matter , and the adjectives he will set about the name of God , such as eternal , infinite , all-present , all-seeing , all-powerful , the Creator , Governor , Judge of the worlds . All this he gill do , and yet for some reason , he may not guess what the reason is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a diminution of tonic force in the idea of God , such as once it had , before he broke loose from the absurdities of Trinity ; or above all such as he discovers in the writings and history of his fathers , before they broke loose , and led their children out , as they supposed , in the paths of intelligence and reason . An impression will finally begin to crowd upon him that there is , after all , something in the Trinitarian feeling not in his ; that their God is more a God , higher in majesty , and heavier on the soul 's feeling . And the sense of this fact will by and by appear in other and more decisive indications ; as when , for example , poets , essayists , and nominally Christian teachers brought up in his doctrine , begin to be heard speaking in a heathenish and mock-classic way of " the qod8 . " They will do it because their God , their one person or Father , has somehow lost magnitude in their impressions and because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " god8 " than there is in their boasted unity of reason-God . It could not be otherwise . How is it possible to keep up the figure of a one personality , and be always seeing God under that figure , without finally dragging him down by the force of its finite associations , and subjecting him practically to its mea // sures . Suppose that by reason of some analogy discovered in the rock , God were always called , as he is a few times in the Scriptures , the IRock , and conceived under no other name , does any one doubt that such an image would , by its natural associ-ations vitiat* , finally obdurate or harden , and in that manner radically the conception of God 's character ? He was familiarly known to the ancient race as the " Jehovah-angel ; i. e. a visitor appearing in the human form to represent and speak for God . Suppose then he had always been called the Angel , never conceived in any other way , how plain is it that he would be gradually let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acting in space ! What then must follow when he is spoken of and worshiped only in the type of a person , which is nothing but a metaphysically finite conception ? One good point is gained , viz , the mutuality , the reciprocal relationship of God ; but with that everything necessary to the grandeur , the transcendent wonder , the immeasurable vastness of God , is lost or left behind . Setting now these two failures against one another , the failure of pantheism and the failure of Unitarianism , we perceive exactly what is the problem answered by the Christian Trinity . By asserting three persons instead of one , and also instead of none , it secures at once the practical infinity of God and the practical personality of God . By these cross relations of a threefold grammatic personality , the mind is thrown into a maze of sublimity , and made to feel at once the vastness , and with that the close society , also , of God . lie is not less personal than he would be under the one personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threefold personality , from any possible diminution under the literal measures of the fi*ure ; for God can not become either one person or three , in any literal sense , when steadfastly held as both . In this respect , the Trinity , Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , practically accepted and freely used , with never a question about the speculative nature of the mystery , with never a doubt of God 's rigid and perfect unity , will be found to answer exactly the great problem of the practical life of religion ; viz , how to keep alive the profoundest , most adequate sense of God 's infinity , and , at the same time , the most vivid and intensest sense of his social and mutual relationship as a person . And this , if I am right , is more to say than could be said of any other known or possible denomination for God . Regarded simply as a literary exploit , if that were all , it is at once the profoundest practical expedient ever adopted , and the highest wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reason of this matter , as if it were the easiest , most extempore thing in the world , to make a valid and true communication of God , not considering either the hard limitations of language or the more stringent limitations of a finite creature 's thought . In this radical and somewhat feeble assumption , we have the beginningf of the Unitarian attemptas if it were nothing , could involve no mystery , no paradox , to give expression to the infinite God ! Who that can take Job 's thought of his incomprehensible , inconceivable majesty , . - Canst thou by searching find out God ? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection ? It is high as heaven , what canst thou do ? deeper than hell , what canst thou know ? The measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea-who , we ask , that can take up such a thought of God , will have it for a perfectly easy and simple matter to present such a being to the world ? Far more equal and fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wise heathen who , when it was required of him to give the definition of God , demanded a certain time for thought , and when the time expired double the time , and then again the double of that , till at last , by so many delays , he had given the most expressive and truest answer possible ; declaring , in that manner , the sense he had of God 's inscrutable , inconceivable mystery . Who that has a mind really opened to the difficulties of the subject , will not see beforehand , that when such a being communicates himself to the world , nothing will serve his object but some wondrous compilation of apparently conflicting and paradoxical iinages ,  --  such exactly as we have in the Christian Trinity ? The very mystery , and all the conflicting terminology which the Unitarians undertook to clear and logically reduce , had even a presumption in its favor . And the new explication they attempted of these absurdities of Scripture , their " Truth made Simple , " it was even as clear beforehand as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little for the great , the feeble for the sublime , a merely childish half-truth for the grand , wellrounded majesty of the triune formula . Nothing is easier than the method of a " Norton 's Reasons , " and when implicitly followed , nothing will more certainly show the problem resolved , how it may be possible , with only a moderate force , drudged in the ploddings of unilluminated scholarship , to empty a Gospel most effectually of all that is necessary to its life . It is no difficult task to make God intelligible , and set him clear of all terms that stagger comprehension ; and then , when it is done , it is not less easy to find that he is just as much diminished as he is more completely leveled to the logical understanding . // Withdrawn from the imagination and reduced to the measures of logical practice , he will be , in fact , to the true Almighty Infinite God , what the wax-doll Napoleon is to the mysterious living paradox of genius , before whose name and coming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three persons , as a necessary means , in this manner , of preserving at once the personality and practical infinity of God , we ought perhaps to notice what is really a striking confirmation of our suggestion , that the Old Testament word commonly translated God , ( Elohim , ) is a plural word . Over this word , particularly as it occurs in the first chapter of Genesis , in connection with the phrase , " Let us make man in our image , " there has been a good deal of frivolous and impertinent debate ,  --  frivolous and impertinent of necessity , because the question raised , whether these pluralities are not affirmations of Trinity , is a fictitious and wholly unscholarly question . The true question is different , viz : what is the reason-for some reason there certainly was-why this plural name occurs and becomes accepted as the name of God ? Such a question opens up , it will be seen , a previous history in the word , conducting us back upon the great natural fact , that plurality is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite as readily received , and for some purposes more adequate than a simple grammatic unity . In this respect , the plural name of the Old Testament answered some of the important conditions of the Trinity of the New . The pluralities introduced by means of the Jehovah Angel , the IMlemra or word of the Lord , and by such uses or conceptions of the Holy Spirit as we find in the 51st Psalm , show also in what manner the advantages of the New Testainent Trinity are made up in the Old by another process-if indeed it is another , which many will deny . We pass now , II . To another view of the Christian Trinity , in which it is seen to have a practical relation to our character and our state as sinners . Here it is the instrument and co-efficient of a supernatural grace or redemptive economy . Not , as we sometimes hear , that an infinite atonement is wanted , which none but an infinite and divine person could execute-that is only a very crude and distant approximation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader and more comprehensive , resting in the fact that God 's universal economy is , in its very conception , twofold ; comprising at one pole , an economy of nature and , at the other , an economy of supernatural grace ; requiring , in order to an easy practical adjustment of our life // under it , a twofold conception of God that corresponds ; for which reason the Scripture three are sometimes spoken of by Calvin and others , as composing an economic Trinity . In the department of nature , we discover , as we think , a realm of complete systematic causation . All events proceed in right lines of invariable sequence , under fixed laws . But as laws are only another name for God 's will , or the action of forces representing his will , the system of nature becomes a symbol in its whole development , of the regulative mind of God . What we call the natural consequences are determinations of that mind in the same manner . In this view it will be seen that , if the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception God , would answer all our necessary uses-so far there would be no discoverable economic need of Trinity . But the universal economy is larger and contains , of necessity , another and partially contending factor , supernaturalism , even as the balance of the firmament is settled between two natural factors or forces always contending with each other . Nature is a realm so adjusted that , whenever any moral agent or race of agents , cast off the law moral , a train of natural consequences forthwith takes them in hand for discipline , or retribution . The action begun is that of disease , disorder , pain , constituting what is fitly called a fall . The penal train is a run of justice , and the run is downward even forever ; for it is inconceivable that disorder should ever of itself beget order . As little to be conceived that we , who have broken up the ideal harmony of nature , by starting a malignant and diseased action , should be able to will it back into a state of perfection , or ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke and raise up nature was one thing , to smooth and restore it , auother . Nothing but a force supernatural can restore the mischief , and without that any thought of our own self-clearance and self-preparation for a state of perfected health and felicity is even absurd . Inasmuch then , as the spiritual training of a race of free moral agents included the certain fact of their sin , there was , we perceive , a grand prior necessity that , if they are to have any advantage in existence , the scheme of God 's economy should comprehend two factors , nature and the supernatural . And this again is the same , it will be seen , as to say that God - will institute and actuate two realms of forces , a kingdom of nature and a kingdom of grace ; for as we have seen that nature is the presiding will of God , so also must the supernatnal be ; and then , the perfection , or completeness of God 's economy // will consis't in the orderly comprehension of both , under harmonizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only imaginable to us . And now the question is , conceiving that we are in the state of retributive disorder , to be recovered from it , related thus to God as the Head of the two economies , and having our salvation to seek under their joint action , how we shall be able to conceive God in any manner that will set him continually in this twofold relation towards us ? If we have only the single term God , then we must speak of God as dealing with God , contending with the causations of God , the grace-force of God delivering from the nature-force of God . If the work includes an incarnation , as we suppose it must of necessity , then it must be God sending God into the world . Or , if it includes a renovating spirit within , then we go to God to give us God , and expect that God within will graciously master the retributive causations of God within-all of which , as we may see , is a conception too clumsy and confused , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . There is , in short , no intellectual machinery , in a close theoretic monotheism , for any such thing as a work of grace , or supernatural redemption . We should even say before hand , that no such thing can ever be ; for how can God rescue from his own causes and open a way through his own retributions ? Accordingly , it will be observed that where this Unitarian conception is held , there is also discovered an almost irresistible tendency to naturalism , and so to a loss or dying out of all that distinctively constitutes the gospel God is the king of nature , and nature is the inclusive name of all that constitutes his dominion . There is , in fact , no legitimate place for anything but nature . Sin is softened , depravity ignored . Nature is conceived to be ideally perfect and the palpable disorders and deformities of the world are not regarded , in the admiration offered to its beauty . The gospel is education and the run of life is a course of development in right lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , there is no alternative but to say as some are obliged , in fidelity to their scheme itself to do , and have not shrunk from doing , that if we are saved at all , we must be saved by justice , or the natural law of retribution . Now there is , we have already intimated , a higher and more comprehensive view of God 's universal kingdom , in which it includes and harmonizes these two economies , viz , nature and the supernatural , and by these two factors , like the contending forces of astronomy , settles and adjusts its orbit . And the Christian Trinity gives us a conception of God which exactly // meets such a truth , leveling it always to the practical uses of ' our life . Using the term God sometimes in a sense broad enough to comprehend all the complexities of his kingdom , we are able , when we need such aid for the practical accommodation of our faith , to lay hold of relational terms that exactly represent the two economies in their action with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term Father , which sets him before us as the king of nature , the author and ground of all existent things and causes . Kext , we have the Son and the Spirit , which represent the supernatural ; the Son coming into nature from above nature , incarnate in the person of Jesus , by a method not in the compass of nature , erecting a kingdom in the world that is not of the world : the Spirit coming in the power of the Son , to complete , by an inward supernatural working , what the Son began by the address he made without to human thought , and the forces he imported into nature by his doctrine , his works , his life , and his death . Having now these terms or denominations provided , we use them freely in their cross relations , as a machinery accommodated to our sin and the struggles of our faith ; putting our trust in the Son as coming own from God , offering himself before God , going up to God , interceding before God , reigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and allowed to put all things under his feet ; invoking also God and Christ to send down the Spirit , and let him be the power of a real indwelling life , coursing through our nature , breathing health into its diseases , and so rolling back the penal currents of justice to set us free . Having these for the instruments of our thought and feeling and faith towards God , and suffering no foolish quibbles of speculative logic to intervene and plaque us , asking never how many Gods there are , or how it is possible for one to come out from another , act before another , take us from or to another ; but assured of this , at every moment , that God is one and only one forever , however niultiform in his vehicle ; how lively , and full , and blessed , and easy too , is the converse we receive through these living personations , so pliant to our use as finite men , so gloriously accommodated to our state as sinners . Our argument for the twofold practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Trinity we have , is now sufficiently stated , and is brought , we think , to a point of rational conviction as decisive as the nature of the subject permits . Thus far , it will be remarked , we have nothing to do with the interior mystery of the divine nature  --  the argument // amounts to nothing more than that God , even assuming his strict unity , must needs be exhibited in this way , in order to the uses stated . Finding a certain threefold designation of God given out in the Christian scriptures , in which he is presented , in form , as three personalities , Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , we take up the subject at this point and show that , taken as means of divine representation , they are necessary to the adequate impression of God , and the practical uses of a supernatural and redemptive economy . But the question will be raised by many , at this point , whether , after all , there is any thing in God answering to these personalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just this point and admitted the force of our argument , may require to be informed wherein the truth or reality of the triune formula consists or what there is in God 's nature to support these personalities of revelation ? And to this we might well enough reply by handing back the question . Having shown the practical need of just what the scripture gives , it is not therefore specially incumbent on us to settle all other and deeper questions that may be raised . Let him bring the matter to that issue that will best satisfy himself . Let him stop at Sabellianism , if the air is not too thin to feed his breath . Or let him vault clean over , at a single stride of logic , if he will , and rest himself in the conclusion that , since the three are persons , there must be three Gods , or a council of Gods . non h for us that we have shown him the practical need of the scripture Trinity . But we will not so dismiss the question , lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may seem to regard the Trinity as a matter only of words , and not in any proper sense an eternal fact . Our impression then is that a very great gain , as regards the intelligent apprehension of this subject , will be made by simply giving full place , at the outset , to the admission that God is not a person or personal being , save in some qualified and partly tropical sense . For we can every one see , at a glance , that he can not , as an infinite being , be comprehended under any such finite term literally taken . And yet he is a person . Who of us except a few speculative pantheists , 4oubts that he is a person , or apprehends any want of honest reality , or solid eternity in the word when he is called a person ? Doubtless the word is a figure , ( whether we have ever so thought of it or not , ) but it does not follow that because it is a figure , there is therefore nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way , and with as good reason , God may be a Trinity of persons . There is in fact no greater difflcul* ty in conceiving God as three persons , than there is in conceiv // ing him as one ; for he may as well be three without any breach of his unity as one without any breach of his infinity . Indeed , it may be and very probably is true , that what we mean by asserting the personality of God is simply to predicate of him that sociality , conversibility , or , to coin a word yet more general , that relationality which is verified to us , and practically realized in us by the Trinity . However this may be , it is an important consideration , and one that goes far to evince the profound reality of the persons , that as God in revelation assumes all the attitudes and acts all the forms of personality , so , in a like free manner , he displays a relative action of three persons towards each other and upon the world-God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascending to , proceeding from- a her , Son and Holy Ghost . In all which the Trinity is seen to be not a matter of words only , but a reality or fact *n the world of action . So far at least , the case is clear . What then shall we say of this tripersonality acted by God-what account shall we make of it ? Is it that God will accommodate himself in this manner to finite minds ? That would reduce the Trinity to an occasional matter , a voluntary expedient ; which would be a supposition as painful and quite as mmote from all our most earnest convictions as to believe that his personality is a merely occasional matter , an act of voluntary accommodation to our finite apprehensions , and not any part of his eternal property or idea . What then is it that gives us the impression , when we speak of God 's personality , that it is an eternal property in him , a something which appertains to the divine idea itself ? It can not be that he exists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it can not be that there is a core of literal . personality wrapped up in His infinite substance . It is not enough that he acts personality in a way of voluntary accommodation to men . It can be only that by some interior nece8-8ity , he is thus accommodated in his action , to the finite ; for what he does by the necessity of his nature , as truly pertains to his idea , and is as truly inherent in him , as if it were the form of his divine substance itself . And precisely here we come upon the Nicene Trinity . This and all the formulas of ' Trinity that assert the " eternal generation , " affirm the unity of the persons as a unity of substance-*oo6c*os , " same in substanee " - and then regarding the eternal going on , so to speak , of God , this living process or act actus purissimus the y find him eternally threeing himself , or generating three persons . These documents do not mean that God , at some date in his almanac called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit , VOL . XII . // but that in some high sense undefinable , he is datelessly and eternally becoming three , or by a certain inward necessity being accommodated in his action to the categories of finite apprehension-adjusted to that as that to the receiving of his mystery . This necessary act of God is sometimes illusti*ated by a reference to our necessary action , in the process of consciousness . Thus in simply being conscious , which we are , not by act of will , but by force of simply being what we are , we first take note of ourselves ; secondly , raise a conception or thought of ourselves ; and *thirdly , recognize the correspondence of that conception with ourselves . And this we do as long as we exist , and because we exist . And some have gone so far as even to discover , in this fact , a parallel and a real explication of the Trinity of God . The illustration is reliable however , only as a demonstration of the intensel5* inherent character of all necessary action . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be more truly inherent than it is , regarded as an act . If then we dare to assume what is the deepest , most adorable fact of God 's nature , that he is a being infinite , inherently related in act , to the finite , otherwise impossible ever to be found in that relation , thus and therefore a being who is everlastingI* threeing himself in his action , to be and to be known as a her Son , and Holy Ghost from eternity to eternity ; we are brought out full upon the Christian Trinity , and that in the simple line of practical inquiry itself . It is nothing but the doctrine that God is a leing practically related to his creatures . *And for just this reason it was that Christ , in the commission given to his disciples , set forth his formula of Trinity , as a comprehensive designation for the gospel , and a revelation of the everlasting ground it has , in the inherent properties of God . He *c.alls it therein as emphatically as possible his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity of God , a valid and credible work , because it is based in the Trinity of God . So glorious and high , and yet so nigh is God ; related in all that is inmost , most inherent in his nature and eternity , to our finite want , *and the double kingdom of nature and grace , by which we are to be raised up and perfected for the skies  --  a being who is *at once absolute and relational ; an all-containing , allupporting Unity , and a manifolding humanly personal love ; the All in all itself , and yet above all , through all , and in all ; of whom also , and through whom , and to whom be glory forever . How vea*y distant any such conception of the Christian // Trinity may be from most persons , we are well aware . The most they look for in it , is to find that it is barely defensible . That it contains the whole staple of Christianity , they do not suspect , and will be ready , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of its import . With the greater satisfaction , therefore do we hail the expression of a deeper and more adequate conviction , by some of the first minds of our age ; accepting in their words , the tokens of an ultimate return of the world to a more thoughtful spirit and a more truly Christian impresion . Thus Mr. Coleridge  --  and who has given a more pervading and more thoroughly Christian impulse to the English mind of the day , than he ? - declares that " the article of rIlri**j*y is religion , is reason , and its universal formula ; that there neither is nor can be any religion , any reason , but what is , or is an expression of the truth of , the Trinity . " Neander , in like manner and with a similar title to respect , calls it " the fundamental article of the Christian faith ; and we recognize therein , " he says , " the essential contents of Christianity summed up in brief ; * * in which threefold relation the whole Christian knowledge is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 572 . ) But these are testimonies of opinion , not of practice . There is yet another class of witnesses , even a great cloud of them , who are more to ou* purpose and better authorities than these . We mean those living myriads of God on earth and above , who , apart from all scholarship and philosophy , have been raised to a l ) articipation of God so transcendent in the faith of this adorable mystery . Why or how it is a truth they have not been able , it may be , and as little cared , to find ; for it had proved itself to their experience in such a raising of their consciousness and a comniunication to them of the divine nature so indisputably witnessed , as to make them inaccessible to all the colder assaults of scepticism . Sometimes they have stated a Trinity to which there have been abundant reasons for exception , and yet they have found such practical virtue in that , as to be raised quite above the incumbrances added , and seem even to have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the fires of their faith could burn up all the chaff of their head . The wise ones of the church and the speculative schools sometimes give them pity ; or , what is not far different , set them forth as the weaklings of the faith , who make a virtue of their ecstasies over what has been imposed upon their superstition ; but the revelations of eternity will show who were weakest and most on a level with pity , they who could so readily fall into the abysses of the divine mystery , or the wise pretenders who stood questioning over // syllables and refining in distinctions , till they had shut away all mystery and taken up for God , a dull residuum just equal to the petty measures of their understanding . Could we bring up this great cloud of witnesses and hear them speak to the question we have here on hand ; or could we but gather up the words in which they have recorded their experience in the faith , even these would contribute a weight of evidence to the truth we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to quite forbid the need of any other argument . Thus , for example , we should hear , at Heidelberg two centuries and a half ago , the distinguished Professor of divinity , Francis Junins , testifying that he was in fact , converted from atheism by the Christian Trinity , or by the sense of God rolled in upon his soul by means of that stupendous mystery of the gospel . Having fallen into great looseness of living , and become an atheist in his opinions , his Christian father kindly puts a New Testament in his hands , requesting him to read it , and the result is that , opening on a passage most of all likely as it would commonly be supposed to offend and fortify his scepticism , he is visited in its mysterious and sublime words by such a sense of God as overwhelms and instantly stifles the doubts which no mere argument of books and treatises had been able to remove . He shall give the account in his own words. - " Here therefore I open that New Testament , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I light upon that most august chapter of the Evangelist and Apostle St. John . In the beginning was the word and the word was with God , and the word was God , ' &amp;c . I read part of the ch3pter and am so affected as I read that , on a sudden , I perceive the divinity of the subject and the majesty and authority of the writing , far exceeding all human eloquence . I shuddered , was confounded and was so affected that I scarce knew myself . Thou didst remember me , o Lord my God , for thy great mercy , and didst receive a lost sheep into thy flock " . ( I3ayle 's Dictionary . ) The testimonies of Christian experience rejoicing in this truth , are , of course more frequent . Thus the mild and sober Howe , explaining in what manner the Trinity is to be connected with Christian experience , says coincidently with what we have advanced concerning the relational nature of the fact " When , therefore , we are to consider God as related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring together each of these notions and conceptions concerning Him ; we must take in the conceptions of each of the persons God the Father , God the Son , and God the Holy Ghost is my God . ' How admirable a thing is this ! How great and high thoughts ought we to have // concerning the privilege state of our case ! Indeed there is nothing that we have to consider of this God , or to look after the knowledge of , to answer the curiosity of a vain mind , but everything and anything that may answer the necessity of a perishing soul . Whatever is requisite to onr real felicity and blessedness , we may look to all that is in God , as determined by a special relation unto us . " ( Works , p. 1100 . ) Jeremy Taylor , holding the truth of the Christian Trinity to be a truth entirely practical , apprehensible therefore in its real evidence , only by experience , says- " He who goes about to speak of the mystery of the Trinity , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking of essences and existencies , hypostases and personalities , priorities in coequalities , and unity in pluralities , may amuse himself and build a tabernacle in his head , and talk of something he knows not what ; but the good man who feel8 the power of the Father , to whom the Son is become wisdoni , sanctification , and righteousness , and in whose heart the Spirit is shed abroad* this man , though he understands nothing of what is unintelligible , yet he alone truly understands the Christian doctrine of the Trinity . " Again , the Marquis de iRenty , a distinguished French disciple of the seventeenth century , opens the secret of his own living experience in these words ,  --  " I bear in me ordinarily an experimental verification and a plenitude of the most holy Trinity , which elevates me to a simple view of God , and with that I do all that his providence enjoins me , not regarding any thing for the greatness or littleness of it , but only the order of God and the glory it may render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The testimony of Edwards , a man whose intellectual sobrietX and philosophic majesty of character are not to be disrespecte corresponds ,  --  " And God has appeared glorious unto me on account of the Trinity . It has made me have exalting thoughts of God that he subsists in three persons , Father , Son , and Holy Ghost . The sweetest joys and delights I have experienced have not been those that have arisen from the hope of my own good estate , but in a direct view of the glorious things of the gospel . " ( Life , p. 132-3 . ) The celebrated Lady Maxwell , a follower of Wesley , is more abundant in these revelations . She says : " Yesterday he made his goodness to pass before me in a remarkable manner , while attending public worship . I was favored with a clear view of the Trinity , which I never had before , and enjoyed fellowship with a triune God . I was in the spirit on the Lord 's day , and felt my mind fixed in deep contemplation upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitherto I // have been led to view the Hoiy Ghost chiefly as an agent , now I behold Him distinctly as the third pers:n of the Trinity . I have , in my own soul , an eceperimental proof of the truth of this doctrine , but find human language perfectly insufficient for speaking or writing intelligibly on the subj ect . Eternity alone can unfold the sacred mystery , but in the mean time what we may and do comprehend of it is replete with comfort to the Christian . " ( Life , p. 258 . ) It is impossible not to admire the Gospel formula , that can so flood the human soul in its narrowed and blinded state with the sense of God , and raise it to a pitch of blessing so transcendent . The amazing power of the Trinity , acting thus on the human imagination , and the contribution thus made to Christian experience , can not be over-estimated . After we have discovered , in this manner , how closely related the Christian Trinity is to Christian experience , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for the remarkable tenacity of the doctrine . No doctrine is more paradoxical in its terms . None can be more mercilessly tortured by the application of a little logic , such as the weakest and smallest wits are master ef . None has been more often or with a more peremptory confidence repudiated by sections of the church and teachers of high distinction . The argument itself ; too , has always been triumphant regarding the mere logical result ; for the fact is logically absurd , and there is no child who can not so handle the words as to show that no three persons can be one . And yet , for some reason , the doctrine would not die ! It can not die ! Once thought , it can not be expelled from the world . And this for the reason that its life is in men 's hearts , not in their heads . Impressing God in his true personality and magnitude-impressing and communicating God in that grand twofold economy , by which he is brought nigh to our fallen state and accommodated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related both to our finite capacity and our evil necessity , what can ever expel it from the world 's thought ! As soon shall we part with the day-light or the air as lapse into the cold and feeble monotheism in which some teachers of our time are ready to boast as the Gospel of reason and the unity of a personal fatherhood . No ; this corner-stone is not to be so easily removed . It was planted before the foundation of the world , and it will remain . It is eternally woven into the practical economy of God 's kingdom , and must therefore stand firm . Look up , 0 man ! Look up , thou sinner ! in thy fall , and behold thy God , eternally Father , Son , // and Holy Ghost , bringing all his vastness down to thy littleness , all the power of his will to release thee from the power of his will , acting , manifolding , circling ronnd thee , inherently fitted , though infinite , to thy finite want , and so to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of the tameness and poverty of the illustrations by which we have endeavored to set forth this greatest of all subjects . What can a mortal say that is worthy of this transcendent mystery of God ? Even if he should sometime seem to be raised in it quite above mortality , how can he ntter that which is so plainly unutterable ? Well is it if he does not seem rather to have blurred than cleared the glorious majesty of the subject , by the consciously dull and feeble trivialities he has offered . Indeed we could not dare to offer a discussion so far below the real merit of the theme , were it not for the conviction that there is a lower and feebler inadequacy , in our common holding of the theme , from which it is scarcely possible to detract . To hold this grand subtonic mystery , in the ring of whose deep reverberation we receive our heaviest impressions of God , as if it were only a thing just receivable , not profitable ; a dead truth , not a living ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a truth so scholastic and subtle as to have , in fact , no relation to Christian experience ; nothing , we are sure , can be less adequate than this , or bring a loss to religion that is more deplorable , unless it be a fiat denial of the mystery itself . In this view , we can not but indulge a degree of hope that what we have been able to say , however insufficient or unequal to the theme , may yet have a certain value , as a tract for the times , raising at least a question of respect for the doctrine , where it has been renounced , starting other and worthier contemplations of it where it is received , and preparing some , in the legitimate use , to find how glorious and blessed a gift to experience , how vast an opening of God to man , how powerful , transforming , transporting , this great mystery of God may be . We can wish the reader nothing more beatific in this life than to have found and fully brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , which we call the Christian Trinity . Nowhere else do the bonds of limitation burst away as here . Nowhere else does the soul launch upon immensity as here ; nowhere fill her burning censer with the eternal fires of God , as when she sings , - One inexplicably three , One in simplest unity . // Who that has been able , in some frame of holy longing after God , to clear the petty shackles of logic , and the paltry quibbles of a world-wise speculation , committing his soul up freely to the inspiring impulse of this divine Inystery as it is celebrated in some grand doxology of Christian worship , and has so been lifted into conscious fellowship with the great celestial minds , in their higher ranges of beatitude , and their shining tiers of glory , has not known it as being , at once , the deepest , highest , widest , most enkindling , and most practical of all practical truths ! Regarding it then as such , it is only a part of the argument by which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we indicate , in a few brief suggestions , the manner in which its advantages may be most fully received , and with fewest drawbacks of hindrance and perplexity . First of all , then , we must hold fast the strict unity of God . Let there be no doubt , or even admitted question , of that . Take it by assumption that God is as truly one being , as if he were a finite person like ourselves , and let nothing ever be suffered to qualify the assumption ; for the moment we begin to let in any such thought , as that the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost are three beings , we shall be thrown out of all rest , confused , distressed , questioning what and whom to worship , consulting our prejudices and preferences , and suffering all the distractions of idolators . Holding firm the unity in this manner , use the plurality with the utmost unconcern , as a form of thought or instrumental verity , by which you are to be assisted in receiving the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the One . We must have no jealousy of the three , as if they were going to drift us away from the unity , or from reason ; being perfectly assured of this , that in using the triune formula , in the limberest , least constrained way possible , and allowing the plurality to blend , in the freest manner possible , with all our acts of worship , preaching , praying , singing and adoring , we are only doing with three persons , just what we do with one-making no infringement of the unity , with the three , more than of the infinity , with the one . Let God be three persons forever , just as lie is one person forever , and as this latter is a truth accepted without difficulty , and held as the necessary - truth of religion , so let it be our joy that he is a being who needs for other purposes equally dear , to be and be thought as - three . Meantime we must avoid all practices of logic on the persons . We must take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will put // our logic on the ter:n , will immediately turn out to he only a finite being  --  a man . They are to be set before the mind at the outset as a holy paradox , that only gives the truth in greater power of expression that it defies all attempts at logic or definition . Seizing thus upon the living symbols , we are to chaunt our response with the Church and say- " God of God , Light of Light , very God of very God ; " and if we can not reason out the paradox , to like it the better that it stops the clatter of our speculative mill-work , and speaks to us as God 's great mystery should , leaving us to adore in silence . Not that we are here to disown our reason ; God is no absurdity as three persons more than as one . Fully satisfied of this , we are only to love the grand abyss of God 's majesty thus set before us , and rejoice to fall into it , there to bathe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is greater than we knew , taller than our reach can measure , wider than our finite thought can comprehend . Neither will it do for us to suffer any impatience , or he hurried into any act of presumption , because the Trinity of God costs us some struggles of thought , and because we can not find immediately how to hold it without some feeling of distni*bauce or distraction . That is one of the merits of the Trinity , that it does not fool us in the confidence that we can perfectly know and comprehend God by our first thought . Simply , because God is too great for our extempore and merely childish comprehension , he ought to be given us in forms that cost us labor , and put us on a stretch of endeavor . So it is with all great themes . The mind labors and wrestles after them , and comes into their secret slowly . Let no shallow presumption turn us away then from this glorious mystery , till we have given it time enough , and opened to it windows enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation of its glory . Let it also be an argument of modesty with us , and , a welcome commendation to our reverence , that so many friends of God and righteous men of the past ages , such as bore a greater fight than we , and grew to greater ripeness in their saintly walk , bowed themselves adoringly before this holy mystery , and sung it with hallelujahs in the worship of their temples , in their desert fastings , and their fires of testimony . And as their Gloria Patri , the sublimest of their doxologies , is , in form , a hymn for the framed to be continuously chanted by the ages , long procession of times , till times are lapsed in eternity , what can we better do than let the wave lift us that lifted them , and bid it still roll on ! Glory be to the Father , and to the Son , and to the Holy Ghost , as it was in the beginning , is now , and ever shall be , world without end . Amen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
