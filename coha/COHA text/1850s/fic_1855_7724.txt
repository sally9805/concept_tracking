Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : VI . Original Hymn .  --  By Rev. Charles T. Brooks . from Original Hymn ( 1855 ) 1 . Great God ! within these temple gates To-day a reverent people waits To hear Thy voice , to see Thy face , And feel Thine all-enlivening grace . 2 . For here , of old , Thy name was named , Thy truth , of old , was here proclaimed , Here swelled the song of praise and trust From lips now mouldering in the dust . 3 . What sainted forms , this hour draw near , To calm , to strengthen and to cheer ! Their words of counsel and of prayer Still haunt the hushed and hallowed air . 4 . Where once they stood , Thy servant stands With girded loins and waiting hands ; O , give him strength , Almighty Lord ! To do Thy will and speak Thy word . 5 . Give him the burning love of truth And wisdom 's ever-blooming youth ; The tender heart , the faithful tongue , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! on this ancient church of Thine Still let Thy face benignant shine , And more and more , as years roll by , May souls be ripening for the sky !
