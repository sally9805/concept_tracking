trade between Africa and other nations , and fill that great continent not with harbingers of peace and good will to men , but with armed desperadoes in pursuit of their human prey ; and all this in virtue of the curse which Noah pronounced on Canaan , not one of whose posterity is known to exist among all the tribes of that vast and populous , but cruelly oppressed quarter of the globe ! That these views and the course of conduct naturally growing out of them are clearly and flagrantly wrong , nnj u*tifiable , and pernicious , we can not doubt . But whether a really good man may not fall into such dreadful errors , and yet have some good thing in him , which will , after all , work out repentance and salvation , we leave for the Great Searcher of hearts and Judge of all to decide . But those who hold such errors , and practice such sins , especially if they occupy stations of honor and extensive influence , should be firmly resisted , that they may , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , their dangerous influence may be counteracted and restrained . If their good characters and Christian conduct in times past , and the generally good spirit which they now exhibit , constrain us to feel that they rnu8t be good men , after all , then , though our hearts are burdened with grief and our countenances filled with blushing , let us , in imitation of the reverent sons of Noah , with averted faces , step softly backwards , cast a broad mantle of charity over them , and leave them to repose quietly under it , until they awake to a due sense of their present humiliating condition , and come to themselves again . " Charity suffereth long and is kind . " ART . VIII. - TIIE CHRISTIAN CITIZEN . SucH was Paul . His conduct on several occasions makes him a worthy example for Christians of this nation to observe and imitate . In his estimation the rights of citizenship were of value . They were not to be despised , or surrendered , without a vindication . On one occasion we hear him preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfdefense , when an excited populace were bent upon his destruction . The chief captain , under the influence of unfounded prejudice , charged him with // being a vagabond and a seditious leader of a band of renegades . To this Paul replied with the dignity of one who is conscious of standing upon a solid foundation- " I am a man , a JEW of Tarsus in Cilicia ; a CITIZEN of no mean city . " Observe , here , how he advances in his argument for a hearing . It was something to be considered that he was a man . This , of itselS gave him rights . It was more , to be considered , that lie was a JEW . This should disarm them of prej udice , especially in the Temple . But another and a still higher claim upon their consideration was found in the fact that he was a CITIZEN . This gave him rights , which it were not safe for even the great captain to despise . This is not the only instance in the history of Paul in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense against the violence of his enemies . It was upon this that he . rested his claim for indemnity from the hot-headed magistrates at Phillippi , for their unwarrantable severity towards himself and Silas . And we are led to infer from his conduct and language on other occasions , that , in his estimation , the rights of citizenship were of no little value and importance to him as a Christian . If these rights were worth asserting in the days of Paul , surely they are worth asserting now . If they were of value in the iRoman Empire , much more are they of value in the American IRepublic . If a Christian Missionary under the government of C*sar , might find protection and security under the " Imperial Eagle , " surely a Christian Missionary under our government should find protection and security in the presence of " The Stars and Stripes . " But citizenship now , and in this nation , should not be regarded merely in the light of a privilege . It should not be looked upon only with reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also obligations . And it should be written in letters of light over against the door of every Christian in this land , that though he may forego the rio'hts of citizenship , he can not thus remove its obligations . As t*1e servant of God in the work of reclaiming , elevating , and blessing mankind , he is in duty bound to use all available helps in that work which do not conflict with the spirit of the Gospel . That great pattern and example , set before all Christians for their imitation , the Than Christ Jesus , brought his influence , in every way possible in His day and in His circumstances , to bear upon the laws and rulers of His nation . We have reason to believe that , if lie were now among us , His discharge of obligations , as a Christian citizen , would be as punctilious and a // conscientious as was His conformity to the regulations of the civil government under which He lived . Sure we may be that He who so pointedly cencured some of the laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in making either , would not hesitate to do as well as cay , in the matter of laws and rulers , were He under a government like ours . And the same would undoubtedly be found true of Paul . Were he now a citizen of this nation , his character and history warrant the inference , that he would be found rigidly faithful to the obligations of citizenship . For we can not suppose that he who so often and so boldly claimed its rights , when it consisted chiefly of rights , would shrink from a full discharge of its obligations when these were actually imposed by it . To suppose that if he were now living among us , he would be entirely silent respecting iniquitous laws , arid wicked rulers , and stupendous national crimes  --  to suppose that lie would fail to do all that he could legitimately to set things right , and keep them right  --  to suppose that he would see iniquity abound , oppression and violence legalized , and desolating vice encouraged hy the government , without lifting his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be that Paul who reasoned with the tyrannic and adulterous Felix upon righteousness , chastity , and a coming judgment , until the royal transgressor trembled under the lashings of conscience , and hid away from his presence the fearless and fdithfuL preacher of truth . THE CHRISTIAN CITIzEN . A careful and conscientious study of this theme is demanded by the times in which we live , and the great interests of humanity which are involved in the destiny of our natfon . The nature of our government and institutiomis imposes upon Christians who live under them a very much greater measure of obligation than has ever before , or by any other government , been set to their account . The responsibility thus laid upon Christians in this land can not be shuffled by them without betraying a sacred trust , conferred by Him who has said- " To whomsoever much is given , of him will much be required . " There is an essential difference between a citizen , in the merely political sense of the term , and a Christian citizen . Citizenship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution and laws of the country guarantee to individuals , and the obligation to allow to other citizens of the country the same immunities . A citizen , politically considered , // is under no obligation to look beyond himself and his fellowcitizens , in his motives and endeavors . To get what benefits he can from the government , and give what benefits he must at the dictation of the government , are the two great commandments which , merely as a citizen  --  a member of a particular State or body politic-man is obliged to regard . hence , merely as a citizen , man may be as selfish , politically , as he is naturally . And as supreme selfishness is a natural characteristic of man , it should not surprise us that the politics of past ages have uniformly been selfish . This has been one of the greatest barriers to human progress in all past time . Selfishness is the bane of mankind . Political selfishness is the bane of the nation . Each nation , by its laws and regulations , calls for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers it lawful and rio'ht to do that which tends to their advantage , whatever effec*it may have upon the citizens of other nations , or upon those within its own limits who are not citizens . We should not look far along the records of our own government , ( which , without boasting , we may say is as unselfish as any of the present governments of earth , ) without falling upon instances in which the characteristic of which we are speaking has left its dark signature . The advantage of citizens has been consulted by mere politicians among us , to the deep and lasting injury of the red man , the black man , and the white man not yet naturalized among us . And all this is right , according to the political standard of right , which very generally obtains among the nations of Christendom . Indeed , the more selfish a policy is , the more acceptable it is , and the more highly it is applauded by politicians , and citizens who look no further than politics for their principles of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this purely selfish creed . As a Christian , he is bound to respect the rights and labor for the good of all men , whether they are recognized by our government as citizens of this country or not ; and he is no more at liberty to take advantage of the weakness of a red man than of a white man-he can no more rightly neglect the interests of a German than those of an American . Every Christian , who takes for his law in matters of feeling and obligation , the comprehensive and sublime rule - whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them-will feel himself bound to seek , in every possible way , the good of man as man , of whatev*r complexion or nation . He can not consult the good of one man to the injury of another , even though the former be of his own color and country , and the latter a foreigner of darker or of lighter line . And // just here lies an essential difference between the mere*politi*al citizen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the " highest law , " and feels that he is by such a law bound to use all the ability given him by his citizenship , to promote the welfare of all men everywhere ; and is not at liberty to allow his humanity to dwindle to the dimensions of a contracted patriotism . No doubt there are services due from the citizen to his country , and the individual citizens of his own country , such as he does not owe to other countries , or the citizens of other countries ; but &amp;ieu in these services there may not be allowed any such selfish partiaiity , as shall do wrong to the meanest and most helpless of all our race . A Christian citizen , then , is one who takes the law of God and the Spirit of the Gospel as the rule of his conduct in all his words and works , carrying his religion into all his political as well as social and moral duties , and employing every advantage given him by his civil immunities to promote the virtue and happiness of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a ruler , he rules in the fear of God . If he is appointed to make laws , it is a first question with him , whether they are right and equal in their application to men as men , and to all who are effected by them . His patriotism is world-wide in its range , and therefore his activity is directed to the good of mankind . All this will be true of him *who is in fact a ( hristian citizen of . a country like ours . And in this connection it ought to be observed , that no other country on the earth gives such free range to the sympathies and efforts of Christian men , as this . If we will , we may speak and act through our government , and with the force of its voice , in favor of liberty , morality , and true religion , throughout the whole earth . It all Christian men by profession in this land , were Christian citizens in the true and highest sense of the term , their voice would certainly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful , legitimate , amid controlling element in the character of our government , as it has 1on* been in the character of our people . Ever since the formation of our government , there have been causes at work to prevent the legitimate development ot Christian sentiment as its motive power . Hence , as * we have among us comparatively few Christian citizens , although there are many Christians who are citizens . Christian men among us have not yet come to realize their obligations to God and to humanity , as invested with the rights , amid bound in the duties of a citizenship , of which Paul . would have made mention with boasting . What we need especially , in order to // our rapid advancement as a nation in all that is truly noble and elevating , is the prevalence  --  the wide diffusion among us - of a just sense of the position and obligations of Christian men under a government like ours . Let all such realize what God requires of them , in the use of their citizenship ; let them act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their religion ; and our legislators , judges , and rulers , who condemn the innocent among us , and frame mischief by a law-who decree unrighteous decrees , and write grievousness which they have prescribed-who turn aside the needy from judgment , and take away the right from the poor - will receive a rebuke such as many of them now deserve . Let Christian men in every part of this land , at once take upon themselves and fully develop before the world the character in question , by consulting conscience and God in every matter of policy or principle which comes up , and a new aspect would soon come over the affairs of the nation . For a time in the early history of this country , this course was pursued , and by the men of that time , the idea of divorcing a man 's politics and his religion would have been ranked among the damnable heresies of the age . But that which our fathers would have deemed a heresy to be stoudly cried out against , passes among us for established orthodoxy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truthful index of their belief . For it is not to be concealed or denied , that Christian men among us , often do that in political movements , and for political purposes , which they could not do , if they carried with them the principles and the spirit of religion . Among the causes which have greatly contributed to bring about this depreciated moral tone in our State and National Governments , and in the general character of our politics , there are two which stand out so prominently , as to demand in this connection special notice . PARTISANSHIP has contributed immeasurably for many years past to prevent the consistent and appropriate action among us of Christian men . The question-What 's in a name ? is sometimes so asked as to imply that names are nothing . And mere names should be so regarded by us . But our political history discloses the humiliating fact , that with not a few Christian men among us , names are everything , instead of nothing . The simple name Whig or Democrat , has for the last thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political efforts of the mass of // Aug . Christian men in our land , than the law of God , or the wants tf the world . The machinery of our political system is so constructed , and so worked , as to bring not a few good men to feel more afraid to brcak through the trammels of party than to violate the law of God ; more ashamed to dishonor the name of Wliig or iDemocrat , than to dishonor the name of Christ . A shrewd and vigil ant policy , sustained by many secret wiles , has given unprincipled demagogues a strong hold upon the support of Christian men . *eckless operators at the political " Stock Board , " have set up a mere name-something less substantial even than the image of the Ephesian goddess  --  and then have moved the people to cry , not for the space of three hours merely , but year after year , with wild enthusiasm , " Great is Diana , - great is Diana ; " until in the wildness and confusion of this tumultuous outcry , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of unspeakably greater im c'rtance than to n be a firm Whig or a steadfast Democrat . * these party names have called out from men who ought to be ashamed of it , a measure of enthusiasm and an energy of effort , sublimely ridiculous . We might smile at them , if their effects were not so productive of evil . Under the discipline and the charm of mere party tactics , some of the most flagrant violations of moral obligation have been perpetrated , and Christian men have given their direct influence in favor of that which is utterly at variance with the spirit of Christ , and wholly incompatible with the dignity and the integrity of Christian citizenship . This beguiling influence of partisanship is seen , whenever a question involving the morals of society is brought before the people . It *s said by some , and has been often said of late , that moral questions should be kept out of politics . We see painful evidence that this is admitted as an article in the creed of not a few men of proiuinenc* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe without inhaling oxygen , or to find water without hydrogen . Moral questions are necessarily and inseparably connected with the politics of a country . What is meant by reckless demagogues , when they raise such a line and cry against mixing up moral and political questions , is simply that Christian men , and men of moral principle , should put themselves entirely beyond the influence of conscience , in their political relations and movements . This done , and of course these unprincipled party leaders , like a frisky horse with a loose rein , can caper whithersoever they list . C inristian men will dismiss all conscientious scruples , lay aside all sense of responsibility to God as the only legitimate sovereign , amid fall into file with the party , observing with rigid exactness all their // sinuous movements , and asking no questions for conscience ' sake , they are just the nicest sort of men in the world . Of course they are . Flattering encoiniums are lavished upon them , by those who are fond of using pliaut tools . But if Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of God with them to the  |p0118-es|pecially  , if they have ventured through that door which the constitution says shall always he kept wide open , into the halls of Cono'ress and there said , as in the presence of God , just what they think-it is a danining shame , in the e*tiination of those who see that the hopes of their gain are gone . To break away thus from the dictation of party leaders , is to loose cast in the scale of political honor , and fall below the rank of those who are lightly esteemed . It is quite apparent , that the fear of being called a political renegade , has for years deterred man y good and Christian men in our country from being true to the character of a Christian citizen . By the aid of this fear , politicians have found it easy to make merchandise of the conscience and religion of multitudes among us . This very tyranny of partisanship prevented for years the enactment of that salutary law , which has already brought relief and joy to thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with this matter , as to induce great numbers to oppose that , which , if each man had acted as he knew that God , and cons ' *ience , and the spirit of the gospel required , they never would . or could have opposed . Nor is this true of our State only . Wherever this measure has been as yet urged , its chief hindrance-that which more than all things else put together , has stood in its wayhas been found in that partisanship which has prevented sober men , and moral men , and too often , alas ! even Christian men , from speaking and voting as they would have done if untrammeled by party ties . It must be conceded that no other question in State politics for many years has been of equal importance with this , or of an importance worthy to be compared with this ; and yet by party drilling , good men have been induce4 to leave it out of the account at the ballot-box , while questions , upon which actually nothing of importance except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been pushed in , and like mole ii Is magnified to mountains , have claimed and received the first attention . We find in all this , evidence that partisanship is one of the chief obstacles to the proper development among us of the Christian citizen . Many other sad illustrations of the same fact might easily be gathered from our political history during the // Aug. last few years . Whenever questions involving great morM principles , or bearing upon the morals of the people , have been started , instantly the whole country , like the city of Ephesus , has been filled with the outcry- " The party ; the party-great is Diana ! " And after the flurry was over , it was found that some Demetrius , in league with the craftsmen and with an eye upon the spoils , started the cry and kept it resounding . Thus , time and again , have good men been befooled , and led to disregard their own consistency , and the welfare of society , and too often , the voice of conscience and of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true and legitimate sense of the term , must utterly break away from this blind adherence to party , merely for the party 's sake . Undoubtedly there will arise many questions within the province of political economy , for the answer to which , some may better look to those deeply versed in this science , than to their own scanty knowledge . But whenever , and wherever , and on whatsoever subject , a question of good or evil-of right or wrong-of liberty or oppression , is to be settled , no Christian is at liberty to follow the lead of any luau , or set of men , unless conscience and the gospel approve . What we need , therefore , and what we must have , before the character of the Christian citizen will be developed among us in all its completeness and its coinmanding excellence , is the emancipation of Christian men from the tyranny of that partisanship which demands a surrender of conscience , and a disregard of moral obligation in its service . The motto of the Christian ought to be , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my conscience first ; my party as their servant . " Let this be adopted by all the Christian men of this nation , and our Ship of State would soon ride upon calmer seas , and our very name become the praise of all nations . LOCAL AFFIANCE is and has been a great obstacle to the perfect development among us of the character in question . lie who would be a Christian citizen , in very deed , may not lend his sympathies , or direct his endeavors towards the exclusive or unequal benefits of any one State or section of his country-mnust not be more ready to secure immunities to , or impose burdens upon , one section , than another . lie should not love the North as the North , or the South as the South ; he should not boast himself in the East as the Ea8t , or the West as the lFeet ; but should delight himself with whatsoever is of good report , as pertaining to the honor and strength of the whole country ; // and should feel , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land , mars the beauty , and diminishes the efficacy and strength of the nation as a whole . Still further , he should feel personally responsible , to the extent of his possible influence , to in itigate or remove it , for every evil that exists in the land , and for every wrong that is committed by the people or their rulers . All questions of rights , privileges , immunities and obligations , so far as he has to do with them , should be settled with an impartial eye upon the whole country as politically a unit . It is only when he takes this position , and adheres with conscientious fidelity to these rules of action , that lie can with any propriety be called a citizen of the country , much more a ( Jhristian citizen . Yet he who watches the working of that machinery by which the government of this great nation is administered , can not fail to see that local affiance  --  a pledged adherence to the interests of particular sections of the country-has become so general in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand remains unbiassed by it . This is a great evil  --  a prolific source of evils . The States of the Union , as States , may and must have their representatives in the general government ; and these representatives may , and ought to , so far as the case allows , look after the particular rights and obligations of their respective States . This is perfectly compatible with Christian citizenship , and against it we have nothing to say . But in matters pertaining to the country as a whole-when questions of general interest and of national importance are to be decided , no man has a right to be swayed or influenced by local affinities or local prejudices of any kind . Whenever the interests of man , as man , are to be affected , the Christian citizen can not properly ask whether the East will be more . benefitted by his action , or the West  --  the North or the South . His duty in the premises is clear . It is to do that which is right-that which God , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the great fountain , will approve . Let this course be pursued by all the Christian men in our country , and we should be at once set forth a century in true political . progress . Ambitious politicians would be like Samson shorn of his locks . Their strength would be gone . That distracting question which has been settled , and re-settled , and which has sprung up again and again where it was not expected ; producing angry and bitter controversy , alienation , jealousy , and wrath ; would be settled in fact-never more to perplex or disgrace us as a nation . The real question with the Christian citizen , when he looks at things in the light of conscience and // religion , and in the true spirit of the Gospel , must be a very simple one-must be simply this : are black men , men . * And since the question carries in itself , its only true answer , the only right action in reference to it is as obvious , as that all men are by nature equally entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grand difficulty which has thus far stood in the way of the final settlement of this question , lies in the fact that attempts have been made to settle it so as to satisfy or propitiate the South  --  to settle it in accordance with the demands of local affiance , rather than according to the spirit of our Constitution , and the interests and honor of the whole counti'y . By an obsequious deference to this local influence , some men have purchased for themselves a brief residence in the White House , and others-have stooped in vain . That this has long been a most corrupt and corrupting element in our national politics , all very well know . As the effect of its working , other kindred influences , more or less antagonistic in their aims , have come into play , until there is a degree of friction produced in the machinery of our Government which well nigh defeats the great end for which it was established . The creaking of this machinery has been , of late and many times , truly stai tling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself before the nation , and must sooner or later be answered upon its own n*erits . But the dif . ficulty thus far has been , to get this question before the l ) eopIe fairly and fully , without the pressure and corrupting influences of local affiance . Once fairly before the people upon its own merits simply , and all know how it will be settled . It is in fact , though not exactly in the same form , the very question which our fathers settled b* a seven years ' war with their oppressors . The question is this and no other : Shall a fi'ee country become a country of slaves ? Side issues may be madeoutpost skirmishes , and dexterous feints may be resorted to , for the purpose of concealing the naked ribs of the monster , but through all these , one with half an eye can see that the extension of the area of slavery , for the 6eneft of the South , is the real thing sought . That there are Christian men at the South , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquity , or openly rebuke it , we do not expect . Arid this because by political management-in which the attachments and proj udices of local affiance are made to play a conspicuous l ) al'tChristian men are kept from that honest , frank , and earnest defense of truth and righteousness , liberty and justice , which is at once the crown and the power of the Christian citizen . // The same influence is found to operate in other sections of our country , to prevent the development among us of the Christiaii element in the character of our citizens . The North and the West are as selfish , in whatever affects their pecuniary interests or their relative power , as the South . This is not an evil in a corner . It is not confined to any one section . It prevails throughout the land , and therefore all Christian men in every part of the country are alike called upon to rise above the influence of this contracted spirit , and speak and act with reference to the good of the whole country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the face of these opposing influences and deep seated prejudices , it is not without some care and effort , that Christian men can carry themselves so as to maintain true consistency and strict integrity amid the whirl of State and National politics . And this has operated of late to keep not a few from the faithful discharge of those obligations , which in a land like this , and under a government like ours , can no more properly be disregarded by the Christian , than his more direct and immediate obligations to God . Christian men among us have a clear duty and a solemn responsibility in the matter of righting whatsoever is wrong in the laws , the usages and the institutions of the country . owever repulsive to their religious or in oral susceptibilities designing politicians may make the duties of citizenship , no measure of discomfort should be allowed to prevent them from speaking and voting as they believe will niost conduce to the good of society , and the glory of God . This is the conviction we desire to have fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the reader of this Article finds this conviction at all quickened or strengthened by what we say upon the subject in hand , our end will be gained . Reader , we would take you from the sordid and groveling views which are too generally entertained respecting citizenship in this great nation , and transfer you to a higher and more noble stand-point . We would have yon feel that your obligations to God , to humanity and to conscience , are such as will not admit of a blind or thoughtless adherence to the opinions or time projects of political mountebanks . Admit this , and you will at once see the necessity of a measure of intelligence commensurate within the dignity and responsibility ot your position . The Russian serf may discharge his accredited political obligations and never know more about his country or the world than is implied in a timid amid emitire subjection to his hord . Not so with an American citizen . His position demands a larger intelligence and his obligations require him to cultivate a more extensive acquaintance // with principles , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian virtue are the great safeguards of this nation . Let these be greatly wanting , and our strength is gone . It is therefore the duty of every citizen to promote , in every practicable way , general intelligence and public virtue . It is equally the duty of every citizen to become personally informed respecting the nature and operations of the government he helps to administer . Nor is it less a duty to know the character of the men who ask to be elevated to the rank of legislators or rulers . And if they have not character enough to command confidence , without being sworn upon a political catechism , then it is not unlikely , that in the oath they take , there will be such mental reservation as can not well be calculated upon . Finally , it is. the duty of every C*kri8tian citizen , to let all political p*trties and all sections of the country know , that lie is to such an extent , under the control of conscience , and subject to the bidding of religions principle , as not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no man whose intelligence , virtue , and capacity are not equal to the station he seeks to fill  --  and to favor no measure or project which will not bear the ordeal of a free and open discussion by an enlightened public . how important that Christian men in our country should come under a more just and impressive sense of the high moral obligations imposed upon them by their citizenship . When we see , as we do not unfrequently see , Christian men of sterling worth , positively refusing to stand in places of trust and authority among us , because it brings them into contact with so much that is offensive to an elevated character  --  or denied the merited honor of holding such stations , because their integrity and virtue will not allow them to stoop to the vile means which too often ensure success in the competition ; when we hear good men say , that they will have nothing to do with the elections , because there is so much corruption and contemptible intrigue practiced there ; we feel strongly inclined to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Help , Lord ; for the godly man ceaseth ; for the faithful fail from among the children o ( men . It is with no little of this feeling , coupled with a desire to throw our mite of strength against the rude current that is bearing down upon us , that we say , in conclusion , to all the readers of this Magazine , and wish we might say to all the people of this land , to whom it can apply-Neglect no duty ; shrink from no sacrifice ; withhold no efforts , which promise to advance the true interests , to elevate the character , and perpetnate // the benign influence of this country , for which we are in duty bound to thank God daily . Even regard it as one of the most noble of all human attainments , to realize in your own character , in a country like this , the integrity , the virtue , the dignity and the enduring worth of the Christian Citizen .               @ @ @ @ @ @
