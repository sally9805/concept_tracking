THE stirring London Evangelist , whose name we have placed at the head of this Article , has now been long enongh before the public mind to warrant some settled and reliable estimate of his merits . Three successive volumes of his discourses have been published in this country , followed by still another treatise under the title of the Saint and his Saviour . ' We do not propose any formal analysis of his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that have been suggested to us by the singular impression he has made abroad , and to avail ourselves of the occasion for calling the attention of ministers anew to the subject of extemporaneous preaching . First of all , that Spurgeon has achieved a wonderful success in arousing and attracting the public mind , is a plain fact that deserves to be considered . There has been nothing like it since the days of Whitefleld and Wesley . Born in England , in June , 1834 , a son and grandson of Independent ministers , with no extraordinary aids of education or of introduction , for more than three years he has been so preaching from day to day that the people of London have crowded to hear him , ten thousand at a time , even at the risk of personal safety . Wherever he has gone , the masses have felt the same attraction . // And his power , like that of all other genuine orators , has been felt by all sorts and conditions of men , ' statesmen and nobles and authors being found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church-building enterprise . By this time the process has been repeated , with the same effects , often enough , with the publication of these three volumes , containing seventy-one sermons , and more than twelve hundred pages , to furnish settled data for inquiry and inference , and we are sure also , for instruction . Now in the face of this phenomenon , no thoughtful man will content himself with flaunting forth such terms as claptrap , ' gammon , ' and the like . Superficial , conceited talkers may sneer at what they call the gullibility ' of such people as run after Spurgeon , and affect to despise the excitement he produces as the unreasonable , fickle rage of the season , ' though not one of them would fail to covet just such applause from such a source , or would fail to be intoxicated by it . But wise men remember that the common people , though not philosophers , are yet not fools , and that their verdict is the best that can be had in any instance as to the reality and extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether before a jury , or in the pulpit , or on the stump , ' gets his truest response from their instincts , and when they run after him and crowd about him continually , it is sheer nonsense to say there is no sufficient reason why they should . The fact of his success is an effect which demonstrates a cause too deep and solid to be questioned or despised . It is no more than a truism , though often remarked with solemn emphasis of all such instances , to say that much of this preacher 's power lies in hiA manner . Why should it not ? If we had room here , we should like to insist that it is an over refinement of modern criticism to make so much account of the difference between manner and matter in spoken eloquence . In the earliest ages , when a poet sung or recited his own ballads , or an orator uttered his speeches , this being the only mode of communicating either to the people , the distinction between what was said and the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our day , though the press has trained us to // discriminate between the same composition as written or spoken , yet , when a speaker is addressing ns , his matter and his manner  --  or what he says , as it might be read if printed , and his mode of saying it-are not in fact separated ; the two are joined , belonging together as soul and body ; they necessarily affect each other in reaching our minds ; and the effect of the one is just as natural and legitimate as that of the other . If the orator 's look and tone and gesture can express more of thought and feeling , in connection with his words , than the latter alone if only printed and read , as unquestionably they can , the enhanced expression is as just and proper as the other , both modes being at best only vehicles of thought and feeling , nor should the merit of the agency or of the result be esteemed the more or the less if dependent on the words employed , or on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled a vast assembly : - The lost soul ! the lost soul ! ' and it was not the less really nor the less nobly eloquent because , as printed here , it can not move the reader as it then moved all who heard it from his lips . Besides thus vindicating , in its proper connection and office , what is called manner , and maintaining that itis in no wise derogatory to an orator , if he moves us in part , and even in great part , by this means , we affirm that so far as our o*bservation and reasoning go , superior effectiveness in this department implies also some measure of excellence , or at least no deficiency , in the other kind of merit . If a speaker has nothing to say , or does not know how to say it , this fact is , first or last , the more sure to betray itself , and to stand out in unhappy prominence , if he happens to have remarkable physical advantages . his matter must be at least respectable , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparaged by his materials for superiority in manner ; as on the other hand , many a speaker has been commended by charitable hearers for the substance of what he said , chiefly because his way of saying it was intolerable . Poor sermons will not fare better in the long run for being well delivered . There must be some weight in the sling , or the strongest arm will umake bad work in discharging it . The charm of dress recjuires some sort of suitableness in the person . // In short , when we hear it said of an effective preacher , that his manner is attractive or impressive , we have learned to take it for granted that the body thus described is informed with soul too . As to Spurgeon in particular , it is only a matter of course that he is indebted to his personal advantages for some measure of his power , as all other orators have been and must be , each excelling in some attribute of this kind , even when remarkably deficient in others , the same man seldom indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications for addressing great assemblies , health and strength , ' the only wonderful physical advantage we have heard ascribed to him is his voice , which , as all accounts agree , is indeed wonderful for volume , compass , and flexibility . In this respect he may rival Whitefield , yet comes far short of him in other elements of histrionic power . No critic ascribes to him any such personal charm* as Summerfield had in the seraphic glow and sweetness of his countenance , the grace of his action , and the lute-like melody of his tones . Nor does he seem to be chiefly distinguished for the dramatic vivacity of his address . Allowing him prodigious physical energy , and a voice capable of answering all demands , we are left to account for the effect of his preaching by qualities that we are at no loss to discover in his printed sermons , and which , as we conceive , need only a corresponding manner in order to sway the largest crowd that ever filled Exeter Hall or broke down in Surrey Garden . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have in print , contain so little to justify , or even be reconciled with , his traditional repute as a preacher . Not only they come short , as of course they must , of the living orator , who commanded all the passions of as many as could hear a human voice in the open air , and excited Chesterfield and ilume , and emptied Franklin 's pockets ; but they give no such hint of his power as his printed words might be * The portraits of Spurgeon are unmistakably Indian . Yet on the whole the face has an English robustness , and an English heaviness too , with some vivacity and a dash of conceit also about the eye and slightly open mouth . It might represent a good humored man of business , crossed with Indian blood . // expected to convey or suggest . Probably , as has been supposed , they were badly or scantily reported ; or , if the words transmitted to us were all he uttered , yet , as we have said , we hold him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so utter them as to pour forth his fiery soul through action ' that could not be transcribed . Be this as it may , Spurgeon 's sermons , printed as they have been under his own eye , give us a far better measure of his power . We do not wonder at all that if only delivered as they naturally must be by their author , with the aid of his executive ability , they have moved the masses of London as no others have done since Whitefield 's lips were sealed in death . Every reader may see at ouce that these discourses embody a great amount of evangelical truth . Their substance is not merely some sort of religious doctrine , but the distinctive doctrines of Christianity . Scripture truth is as the sap in each trunk , and runs into all its branches ; and it is not cant , ' but a fact of which we are more and more convinced , that this has always been the life-blood of that preaching which has deeply and permanently moved the public mind . Moral and scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliques of hearers , but when it can be recorded of a minister , as of his Master , that the common people heard him gladly , ' it appears also that he has dealt largely in those words of truth aud soberness ' which he has learned from Christ and his apostles . It is the water from Jacob 's well , and then the water given by Him who rested there , that still draws and refreshes many an obscure woman of Samaria , ' and after her many of the Samaritans . ' God 's most . successful champions in the warfare against the hosts of evil , have always taken their best weapons from that ancient armory whose stores are not only heaven-tempered , ' but inexhaustible . Besides the distinctive common faith ' of evangelical Christians , Spurgeon preaches Calvinism too , sometimes ultra Calvinism , as it will be called , with all its edges and points , but in his use it has so much vitality that it may be accepted for the theology of the feelings ' by many who would question it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make it his business to rattle the dry // bones of orthodoxy , ' in imitation of some master , or for his own credit , or that of a clique of heresy-hunters . Moreover , he preaches what our Methodist brethren call a free salvation , ' with all the zest they can desire . He has no special merit of analysis or metaphysical discrimination , but delights in the forms and connections of truth as he finds them in the Scriptures , without the ambition of constructing a system , or explaining all their alleged discrepancies . This scriptural quality of his sermons is connected , we think , with the kind of method he uses , which is always textual , ' rather than topical . ' He has his plan and sticks to it , but it is drawn from the passage he handles , rather than from an analysis of some one subject which he finds there . And we note here this feature of his sermonizing , because , though not the only desirable mode of constructing sermons , we think it generally more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Biblical shapes and relations , and because , as compared with the topical method , we believe it tobe too little used by most New England preachers . Our sermonizers , as a class , may excel others in the discriminating analysis of a doctrine or duty , and of course we would not disparage this merit ; but , with this principal aim , the young preacher is too apt to spin about one point during the whole of one of the few seasons allowed him for declaring all the counsel of God , ' and to form the habit of expending all his time and effort on too small a segment of the vast circle of truth , and he is likely to lose many of the numberless suggestions and bearings which belong to his texts in their place ' ( as a geologist might call it ) in the Scriptures . So much for the substance of these sermons . All this material could never indeed alone make Spurgeon the preacher that he is ; but then he could never have been such a preacher without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is remarkable enough for vivacity of imagery and aptness of illustration . We might complain of a redundance of ornament in some passages , and in others of an ambitious air . Some of his metaphors are bold enough to arrest the most heedless hearer . He shuns abstractions , and depicts the forms and colors of his sub // ject . He descrilires a character by personifying it with dramatic distinctness , and his examples are such as to show the application of the truth to various classes of his hearers . His occasional allusions prove that he has turned to good account , for the service of the pulpit , those opportunities of acquiring knowledge which a young man who keeps his senses open may find in what we call only a common education . Most of all , we have been struck with his affluence of language . Without pretending to the severe taste of a classical essayist , he has a wonderful command of his mother tongue . Many a scholar might covet his store off Saxon English . We are tempted to ask , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a loss for strong , delicate , or even beautiful expressions . Supposing him to have had no special educational advantages , we reckon him a good instance of the native power which some minds have in this direction , or what the phrenologists call language , ' whether they are right or wrong in assigning it an external organ . And this certainly is an important qualification of a popular speaker . But Spurgeon 's principal qualification for the work he is doing , the chief element of his power in the pulpit , lies in his overwhelming earnestness . There can be no mistake as to the sincerity or fervor of his appeal to the unconverted . It is the voice of one cryiiig Fire ! If he saw them asleep while the flames broke out of their roof and shouted in their ears , and shook them , he could not be more in earnest than these printed sermons show him to be in warning them of the wrath to come ; ' and with his personal endowments , the man who writes thus can not fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invites and urges inquirers to a present acceptance of Christ and His Gospel , evidently he longs to persuade them , and can not bear to let them leave the sanctuary irupenitent . His appeals to Christian hearts are full of tenderness and sympathy . He addresses himself with every opportunity to the experience of his hearers , speaking as evidently from his own ,  --  the human and the Christian experience of wants , hopes , and aims . As a part of this earnestness , he addresses himself to those who hear him , directly , and often familiarly , // instead of discoursing about them or about the truth . Besides meaning what he says , in the sense of general sincerity , he means it for them at the very time he utters it . As the inesmerizers say , he is in communication ' with them . lie gets , and can not fail to get , their attention by the life and intensity with which he seeks it . I'Ience , too , the style of these sermons-and the same must be true of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has described him , in a good sense of the phrase , as a great talker , ' and this seems to us a good description of one of the best kinds of preachers . It has been said of good composition generally , that it is so much the better as it more nearly approaches the language of good conversation ; and this must be true especially of what is spoken to an assembly , instead of being only studied by the eye . What is the idea of a sermon , or concio , but that of a minister talking to the people ? The fact that he is conferring with them , though the speech is all on his side ought to determine the matter of his discourse , including its subject , structure , and language , and the manner of its delivery . He ought to preach as he talks , or as he ought to talk , and the more earnest he is in preaching , the nearer he will come to this standard by so much more of naturalness , freedom , ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in complaining that it has been sadly overlooked , by the sense generally attached to the epithet sermonizing , when applied to composition or utterance , as denoting whatever is formal , stiff and dull , in contrast to the more natural and lively address common enough in conversation . It is a chief excellence of Spurgeon , as it has been of all the most successful evangelists , that he talks from the pulpit , and he is eagerly listened to by vast congregations because , as we have said , he talks to them on the greatest subjects with overwhelming earnestness . Impressed as we have been , by these sermons and their reported effects , with Spurgeon 's good qualities as a preacher , we might expect to be asked by a class of readers , Would you then have him adopted as a model by young ministers ? No : and we are yet to be told of any preacher who should be . But we believe that young ministers , and older // ones too , may learn something from every good preacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , in which respect , as in other things , some men , whatever age they may have come to , were , as Prof. Park has it , born old . ' We make much account of the diversities of gifts , ' administrations , ' and operations , ' under the same Spirit . ' There are all sorts of greatness in the world , if they can only be found out as there are all sorts of beauty . Our judgment of eloquence and of genius , in all its forms , should be like the Pantheon , that had a niche for every god and a god for every niche . Every pulpit that is entitled to be one has a minister , and every minister who is entitled to be one has a pulpit , if the two can only be brought together . God is wiser than many theological critics would be , in making so many different kinds of preachers , good preachers too . Let every man preach , as he looks , and walks , and is , aiter his kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , but it is foolish for him to complain that his kind is not like another 's which he reckons better , and , whatever it may be , he hurts it if he tries to make it so , as if either Macaulay or Carlyle should try to convert himself into the other . Spurgeon was fashioned and furnished for that work of an evangelist ' which he is doing among the masses in London  --  and a great work it is too-as really as Whitefiekl for a like purpose in his day , and , for aught that yet appears , as signally . We do not think the less of Whitefield , nor of Edwards , because neither of the two had all the qualifications or could do the work of the other ; and the same thing is to be said of Spurgeon , and more than one eminent pastor or theologian , whom it might be invidious to name , of our times . A century has canonized the earlier revivalist , yet the new preacher , especially if we consider his inferior education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in print , is fairly earning for himself the honors of the modern Whitefield , ' though it was not well for his American editor to claim as much for him outright in the very title of his volume . Of course , all sorts of exceptions have been taken to these sermons by as many sorts of readers . They are indeed easy to be found fault with , and the floating criticisms in the public // journals evidently have some foundation . We could add more specific charges of our own . In seeking stated ministrations for ourselves , we should certainly ask , and even require , more precision of statement , more theological discrimination , more care in the interpretation of the Scriptures , a wider , though not warmer sympathy , and in general , more refinement and reserve . But we have no right to determine his qualifications for his London mission , by such a standard . There has been enough criticism in this direction already . *either do we propose to vindicate the sermons or their author . Theological opponents will of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . That contest will go on , for all we have to say here . On the score of taste we admit these discourses to be often exceptionable , though less offensive in this respect than the Introduction by the American editor of the first series . Spurgeon says some things which a classical writer or speaker could not say . Such a man might as well be supposed to commit any other sin against himself : he would as soon die any other violent death . Nor would we ever defend these things on the old plea of de gust Thus , &amp;c. for we maintain the reality and obligation of what is called good taste , even more in the pulpit than out of it . But certainly this is to be said : that class of preachers who have addressed multitudes of people with the most immediate and decisive effect , seem always to have been carried beyond any rules that would have been prescribed to them ; the necessary freedom and boldness requiring greater latitude , or the nature of such men prompting it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as we learn , in his manner also , offends far less in this way than most of his class in every denomination , even of those in past times whom the churches have delighted to honor . ' We have made up our mind to a kind of necessity in such instances , whatever the fastidious may say , and we can overlook more and greater improprieties than we find in Spurgeon , though we would not and could not run into them ourselves , for the sake of his great aim and great work . // He has been charged with egotism and self-conceit , and there is some reason for the charge . When he substitutes 1 ' for lYe , ' in speaking of himself , he is right every way , for happily that formality , which was once a clerical as well as royal and editorial nsage , has gone by . He sometimes betrays an excessive consciousness of his own popularity , which is not strange in so young a man listened to and run after as he has been . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , he is a good deal of a dogmatist , as are many clergymen who never had the clance of being made so by popularity . As to his frequent references to his own religious experience , we will not call them egotistic . It is a question of some delicacy how far a preacher may properly speak of himself , his spiritual struggles and attainments . It has always been encouraged , and in a sense required , in the practice of our Methodist and Baptist brethren , to an extent unknown in other evangelical communions . Perhaps it has been too jealously shunned in our pulpits . Nothing is more offensive or deplorable than for a minister to indulge his vanity or magnify his importance by parading his inner life before the public eye , or by insisting on his former wickedness in contrast to his present sentiments , as some of the reformed drunkards at one time gloried in depicting the evil courses they had renounced . We have not found such habits in these discourses . But if his religious history is marked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings will allow it-in illustrating or enforcing a truth or a scripture , we see no reason why he should not avail himself of the allusion for the advantage of others as well as for his own . Such questions must be determined in part by his own instincts , just as we would say on the question of a minister 's preaching a sermon on the death of his wife ; he may do so properly enough *f he can . There are occasions on which he will naturally recur to his individual experiences , in his ministrations as well as in his silent thoughts , provided he can sufficiently command himself ; and we might even wonder if he should avoid the reference . Thus we have no scruple as to either the propriety or the happy effect of the following introduction to a sermon in the first of these volumes , from Isaiah xlv , 22 , Look unto me , and be ye saved , ' &amp;c. // " Six years ago to-day , as near as possible at this very hour of the day , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iniquity , ' but had yet , by divine grace , been led to feel the bitterness of that bondage , and to cry out by reason of the soreness of its slavery . Seeking rest , and finding none , I stepped within the house of God , and sat there , afraid to look upward , lest I should be utterly cut off , and lest his fierce wrath should consume me . The minister rose in his pulpit , and , as I have done this morning , read this text , Look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth , for I am God and there is none else . ' I looked that moment ; the grace of faith was vouchsafed to me in the self-same instant ; and now I think I can say with truth , Ere since by faith I saw the stream , His flowing wounds supply , Redeeming love has been my theme , And shall be till I die . ' " I shall never forget that day , while memory holds its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember that hour when first I knew the Lord . How strangely gracious ! How wonderfully and marvelously kind , that he who heard these words so little time ago for his own soul 's profit , should now address you this morning as his hearers from the same text , in the full and confident hope that some poor sinner within these walls may hear the glad tidings of salvation for himself also , and may to-day , on this 6th of January , be turned from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God ! " But Spurgeon has been still more complained of , especially by a hostile critic in Fraser 's magazine-who , however , commends his earnestness , and makes his success the occasion of a smart rebuke to the drones of the established church-for irreverence , or excessive familiarity , in his treatment of sacred themes ; and the alleged instances relate chiefly to future retribution . We admit that he is a bold , startling preacher , sometimes violent , or it may be coarse , and he treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plainest words and figures , SO that his congregation may well be excited . And we have observed that whenever a preacher is able to speak thus , a class of hearers are sure to be shocked in their notions of propriety . Without openly rejecting the severer doctrines of religion , they keep them out of sight , or at a distance , as possible fictions , reckoning them disagreeable topics at the best , and holding them to be sacredly treated when let alone or touched vaguely or gently . But Spurgeon , and other successful revivalists , ' compel them to confront eternal things as real and fearful ; treat of death , judgment , and perdition , // as subjects indeed familiar to their own minds and requiring attention from their hearers ; make the darkness of final despair seem to be blackness of darkness , ' and the unquenchable fire to give forth instant flashes ; and of course scruple not to use such harsh words as hell ' and damnation . ' No wonder all this is uncomfortable to such persons as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass is to call it irreverent . They *ay it violates their taste , when the principal fact to be considered is that it violates their repose . When the same preachers speak too in glowing terms of Christ and his love to believers , and their future blessedness , as objects of their own frequent and affectionate contemplation , it is not surprising if the same class of hearers , to whom these themes are uncongenial or strange , find fault again , on the plea of their sacredness , with such presentations as excessively familiar . We do not say this is all the reason for the charge in such instances , but we believe it is often the principal real ground of the complaint . We have refrained from citations , which might exemplify all that we have said of Spurgeon 's effective qualities , partly for want of room , and partly because the best illustration must be found in the tenor of his discourses . But we will quote one instance of a most earnest and solemn appeal , in which certainly he aims at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' no extravagance of statement , no aid from the startling imagery which is so much at his command , and none of the so-called arts of speech . ' We select it for this unpretending character ; yet so direct and earnest is it , that if only uttered by the man who could compose it , and as he means to have it taken , it must compel any congregation to listen breathlessly as if awed by a thunder-clap , or as if to hear the secret of their destiny . It has a quality which we can not help calling tremendous straightforwardness . The passage is the concluding paragraph of his sermon on the Personality of the Holy Ghost . " Then , to the ungodly , I have this one closing word to say . Ever be careful how you speak of the Holy Ghost . I do not know what the unpardonable sin is , and I do not think any man understands it ; but it is something like this , He that speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost it shall never be forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , but tread carefully ! There is danger ; there is a pit which our ignorance has covered by sand ; tread carefully ! you may be in it before the next hour . If there is any strife in your heart to-day , perhaps you will go to the ale-house and forget it . Perhaps there is some voice speaking in your soul , and you will put it away . I do not tell you , you will be resisting the Holy Ghost , and committing the unpardonable sin ; but it is somewhere there . Be very careful . 0 there is no crime on earth so black as the crime against the Holy Spirit ! Ye may blaspheme the Father , and ye shall be dammed for it unless ye repent ; ye may blaspheme the Son , and hell shall be your portion unless ye are forgiven ; but blaspheme the Holy Ghost , and thus saith the Lord : There is no forgiveness , either in this woild nor in the world which is to come . ' I can not tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there it is . It is the danger signal ; stop ! man , stop ! If thou hast despised the Holy Spirit-if thou hast laughed at his revelations , and scorned what Christians call his influence , I beseech thee , stop ! This morning seriously deliberate . Perhaps some of you have actually committed the unpardonable sin : let fear stop you ; sit down . Do not drive on so rashly as you have done , Jehu ! 0 slacken your reins ! Thou who art such a profligate in sin-thou who hast uttered such hard words against the Trinity , stop ! Ah , it makes us all stop . It makes us all draw up , and say , Have I not perhaps so done ! ' Let us think of this ; and let us not at any time trifle either with the words or with the acts of God the Holy Ghost . " We have taken in hand this subj ect partly to set forth one lesson to be drawn from the sensation Spnrgeon has produced and the elements we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why does not evangelical doctrine excite the same attention now as in the days of Whitefield and Wesley , Edwards and the Tennents ? And one answer has been , that before their time there had been a dearth of such preaching , and it came to the people with the freshness and power of novelty : whereas since then , as is said , it has become the staple material in orthodox pulpits ; with the help of the press , the popular mind has been saturated with at least the elements of a pure Christianity ; and the same food no longer stimulates a gener* ation that have been nurtured on it from childhood . Hence many a minister , being sure of the orthodoxy of his sermons , without stopping to ask whether it is living or dead , accepts this view as the solution of their inefficiency and dulness . Hence too there are ministers who shun or slight the distinctive truths of the gospel , and try to stimulate both their hearers and themselves with literary or political topics . But here we have a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multitude , as the earlier evangelists // did in their youth , and with the same old weapons . It could not be learned from the matter of his discourses whether they belong to the last century or the present . The human soul , its depravity , condemnation , and immortality ; God 's providence and law ; Christ in the gospel , His atonement , and promises ; the Bible histories ; death , judgment , heaven and hell these are his constant themes . To these things from his lips the common people listen as in the olden time , and cry out in anguish , and rejoice aloud . And in his preaching they are not subjects ' for theological dissection ; dry bones , very dry , strung together , and labeled and numbered ; but as of old , the sinews and the flesh are on them , and God 's breath of life in them . The same truth , with the same earnestness , is fitted to move mankind in this age as it moved them in the last . Not thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hear from him , or any other man , literary essays , or political declamations , or the most righteous invectives against intemperance or slavery . We thank him , we thank God rather , for this new demonstration of a fact which too many preachers had well nigh denied or forgotten . We ask attention to another bearing of this subject . Spurgeon is perhaps the most noted in the series of those popular preachers in Great Britain , who have been distinguished within the memory of the present generation for their power over the largest mixed assemblies ; and these men have attained this power in their youth . As we have said , he is scarcely yet of age . McCheyne died young , and so did Spencer . Edward Irving gained his power before he came to maturity . Summerfield , who probably surpassed all these in the fascinations of oratory , was but twenty-three years old when he arrived in New York , and only twenty-seven when he died . Almost a century earlier , Whitefield was ordained in the church of England at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was said to have driven fifteen hearers mad . Hall and Chalmers , whose ripe age and reputation are still fresh in general esteem , showed their power , which , if not so universally felt , has been reckoned of a higher order , while they were young men . The same is true of Jay , scarcely inferior // as a preacher to either . It would seem as if youth itself were an element of that kind of eloquence which most intensely moves a miscellaneous religious assembly ; as if the steeds that are to hurl these chariots of fire must be trained in their mettlesome youth . Let it be observed too that these are British examples . Young men , like the most of these , springing fnm humble life , with inferior culture , yet making their mark on the time before others even enter on their profession ,  --  *-the'se , one would have said , must be the growth of American institutions . The freedom and pervading activity of our people are supposed to furnish a hot-bed growth for hastening forward self-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here have these men been produced , but in the mother country , with all its stubborn conservatism , its tenacity of forms and deference to age , under the shadow of an imposing ecclesiastical establishment . Perhaps we have had no preachers-we do not say theologians , nor writers , but preackers-of any age as eminent as these for impassioned eloquence ; but certainly , if we except Sylvester Lamed , no such young preachers . The pulpit orators that strangers run to hear in our cities , are not thus known till middle life . Why this difference ? It is worth while to know why , if it is for the interest of truth and piety in this country that eloquent youthful evangelists should be raised up in our cities like those whom God has so signally honored in the spread of his gospel abroad . We have in mind two reasons for this difference . One is the earlier exercise in preaching which is common among candidates for the ministry in the dissenting churches in England . The men we speak of , as their memoirs show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposition and the gifts . In the smaller assemblages of the Christian brotherhoods to which they belonged , or at outside stations where such services might be useful , with the first impulses of their ardent piety , they began to speak in public for a practical purpose , to exhort , to explain and enforce texts of scripture . Not as an exercise in elocution , but as a means of doing all the good in their power , they learned to think on their feet , to face an audience // with self-possession , to catch an inspiriting influence from their attention and sympathy , to complete in their own persons the electric circuit of religious emotion through an assembly , in fine to encounter all the difficulties and avail themselves of all the aids of oratory in the position of an orator . This was a part of their training from the outset of their academical and theological course . Thus Jay is reported to have preached a thousand sermons before he was twenty-one years old . What a contrast in the habits of the most pious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We refer especially to Congregational and Presbyterian institutions ; the Methodist and Baptist are said to differ from them in this respect . With the exception of teaching a Sunday School class , or taking some part in a prayer meeting , a student is carefully guarded against this exercise in preaching . Sometimes it is solemnly forbidden , for the first two years at least , in the Seminary , lest it should interfere with his recitations and lectures . He is taught the science of swimming , but kept out of the water till he shall learn the art . We verily believe that such a discipline , carried through four years in college and two in a seminary , would have dimmed or even quenched some of the flames that have warmed and illuminated the English churches . Some of our theological guardians are mistaken in this matter , and we care not how soon or how far their more earnest pupils revolt . Their business is to train not scholars , nor writers , but preachers . And one of the best preparations for preaching is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind for the difference here pointed out , is the prevalence of extemporaneous or unwritten preaching in the mother country as compared with our own . Spurgeon 's discourses were never committed to paper by him , and then read or recited from the pulpit . We were sure of this fact from their structure and style , which are those of a spoken address , and not of a written essay ; and his preface to the third series informs us that they have come to be printed by being reported from his lips , and afterward revised by himself . The same is true of the other noted preachers we have named , with a single exception , and of others still who muight be classed // 1858 . Extemporaneom* Prectcldng. 45 with them as to popular effect . The exception is Chalmers , who has been said to be the only preacher ( or the only orator of any kind ) who ever swayed large miscellaneous audiences by reading his discourses . And it deserves to be considered that the style of Chalmers ' writings generally is essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impairs their value in the library , while it even aided the effect of his addresses from the pulpit. * Robert Hall 's most elaborate and finished sermons , as for example that on Modern Infidelity , ' were never written till after they were delivered , and then , at least in that instance , by another hand at his dictation . It is believed too that whatever they may have gained in exquisite composition by this latter process , their style may have been still more adapted for immediate effect as they first fell from his lips . It may be confidently asserted of the class of preachers here in view-with the single exception named , and that exception qualified as we have seen - that they would never have done their good work in the pulpit if they had only read their sermons to the people , or if they had begun their nministry in that practice . One condition of their power was that from the first their preaching was mainly extemporaneous . Xow their practice in this particular naturally depended on that of their brethren generally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belonged , in the evangelical dissenting churches of England , and in the churches of Scotland , including the establishment , this mode of preaching has been well nigh universal , and the reading of sermons scarcely tolerated . It was a thing of course for a young man , if he would preach at all , to address the congregation directly , either extempore or memoriter . William Jay , while yet a beardless boy , could venture into the pulpit with- * It has been said that Chalmers did not speak with the correctness that might be expected from such a man , when he spoke extempore . flut in his memoirs , the reason given by him for writing his sermons , is that when he preached without notes his intense desire to be perfectly understood by all his hearers , on every point , made him dwell so long on the first part of his subject , that he always exhausted his time before he could complete his proposed train of thought . This tendency , of which he was thus conscious , is seen operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow and impetuosity of a true popular eloquence. // out his manuscript , because this was the usage of his seniors and associates , and he regarded it as one of the conditions of his calling , a qualification for success , that with due preparation and effort he should be able to discourse without depending on such aid . And thus , in this department of effort , as in others , ordinary young men are found to overcome the difficulties in their way and gain the mastery , because it is expected and required of them , when otherwise they would despair of it as impossible . We need not insist on the contrast in this respect in our own country among the Congregational and Presbyterian ministers , at least in the Northern and Middle States . The clergy of New England , as a class , are not inferior , to say the least , in theological training and general culture , to any other , yet their common usage has been to read their sermons in the pulpit , scarcely attempting any other method except informally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their capabilities , follow the precedent , and are followed in turn . Indeed one who has just entered the ministry , may naturally fear the imputation of presumption or eccentricity if he should deviate from the practice , as if he thought himself capable of doing what his older brethren dare not undertake . Instead of being compelled or encouraged to task all his powers and resources in the pulpit , to attain in the only possible way the utmost freedom of thought and address before a large assembly , to come to them , or we may say at them , in all the activity of his mind and the urgency of his fresh impulses , he is silently repressed and forbidden . Yet he may be one who has the gift , ' if it were only stirred up , ' to move the churches and the masses as they never can be moved by written sermons alone . ' We may be sure that in these circumstances , under such influences , young men like the British preachers we have referred to , would not have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their names memorable here as well as in their own land . In spite of the activity and haste that characterize Young America ' in other departments , it need not surprise us that such youthful orators are not raised up in our pulpits as in old England , since our candidates for the ministry are not set forward but rather hindered in the // most effective mode , as well as at the most favorable time , of doing ' the work of an evangelist . ' And this brings us to the principal nse we have wished to make of Spurgeon 's example , in drawing the attention of young ministers , and especially of theological students , to the general subject of extemporaneous or unwritten preaching . We are pleased to observe , e yen among older pastors who still depend on their manuscript as before , a growing conviction of the advantage of this freer method , and new attention paid to it at least in some of our Seminaries . Yet it calls for more discussion . An excellent little book on this subj ect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. Henry Ware , of Cambridge , which was full of good sense and useful suggestions , and deserves to be reprinted . The hints we can offer in our limited space , we hope may be of some service to younger students . The common , indeed almost universal practice of the Congregational and Presbyterian clergy , in our Northern States , in their pulpit ministrations oii the Sabbath , has been and still is , to read fully written sermons , reserving any greater liberty of speech for the less responsible services of the lecture-room or the school-house . We would not persuade them entirely to abandon their manuscripts , if we could . There are kinds of sermons , and they tire good sermons too , which for their best effect require to be written , and being once written , are more naturally and conveniently read than recited from memory . There is in some places a stupid and pernicious prejudice against reading , ' as it is called in distinction from preaching , ' which we hope will never find countenance in our churches . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while they are learning from us in one direction , we may well learn from them in another . Pehaps no better course can be prescribed to a young pastor , than to preach his written sermon on one part of the day , and his unwritten one the other . Each of the two methods will be the better in his practice for this succession and comparison . And most certainly he ought not to dispense entirely with the writing of sermons . Writing , ' says Bacon , makes an exact // man , ' as well as speaking a ready man . ' Even if he should not carry his paper into the pulpit , let him not by any means disuse his pen . We would have him be its master , not its slave , and at the same time in full command of his tongue . Yet , of the two modes of preaching , as compared with one another , we are persuaded that to talk to the people without a manuscript is the true way , ' the best way , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers who regretted , as President Edwards did in his later days , that they had not accustomed themselves to it in their own early practice . We can see no advantage to be gained , but rather a further incumbrance added , in the use of writtemi sermons , by delivering them from memory rather than from the manuscript . This practice prevails extensively in Scotland , and we believe in the continental churches , and is meant to combine careful composition with the manner of an extemporaneous speaker . We confess that in general we prefer any other mode of preparation . It must have the essential disadvantage of formal composition , both in the language and in the delivery . It is an imitation , intended to pass with the audience , at least at the time , for extemporaneous address , and hence more out of place in the pulpit than in mere literary performances . Besides the task it imposes on the memory , which we know is lightened by habit , it almost inevitably gives the speaker the air of remembering rather than of active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impairs the effect . With one or two eminent exceptions , * we have always felt a disturbing influence of this sort in hearing such discourses . If they are written , we like to hear them honestly read . There is no need of trying to make them appear as if they were the fresh product of the hour , and the effort is in general labor lost . But in recommending extemporaneous preaching , we shall not be understood to mean that which is unpremeditated . A * Edward Everett , it is said , always speaks menzoriter , and certainly is a master in the art . His oratory , as a whole , is admirably suited , by its rare beauty and finish , to those literary and patriotic occasions on which he has chiefly employed it . Still it has a certain artificial cast or coloring , which may be ascribed to the cause we have named above , and which would be felt more palpably in the pulpit . // speaker of good general resources and self-possessed , happening to be in good condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon necessity or fair occasion , extemporize in this literal sense with a success that offers a dangerous temptation to indolence . But in ordinary circumstances , to neglect opportunities of preparation , dispense with investigation and study , and defer the arrangement of arguments and illustrations , and even the selection of the topic , to the hour of service , and then depend on what is called the inspiration of the moment , ' is to tempt God and provoke man . Sermons thus produced , are like the poetry which an ancient critic says neither the gods nor men allow . Nor are they the more tolerable if brought forth , as in some quarters even at the present day , under the pretense of a divine aid obtained by thus dispensing with human forethought . On the contrary , the unwritten sermon may be and should be , in . sub8tance , prepared beforehand as really as any other , only instead of bending hour after hour over his table* constructing every sentence and adjusting all the minuti of expression with a jaded hand , the preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andj ury , informally employs the best time at his command wherever he may be , broods over his subject , arranges his points , ' and goes to his post with his mind and heart full of the impression he has to make and the best way of making it . He prepares himself to convince and persuade his hearers by his public address , as he would prepare himself to affect one of them in the same way by his private conversation . There is a great variety among good extemporaneous preachers as to the details of their preparation for the pulpit , and every man 's judgment , with the help of experience , must determine the best method for himself . The common practice is to put on paper an outline or analysis , what ministers call a *keleton , ' and lawyers a brief , ' in order to preserve the train of thought , or also to be referred to in the delivery ; and this may be full and exact enough to be readable by itself ; or no more than a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often the subordinate points , with great care , and his notes were sometimes the ample sketches // published in his works , and sometimes too scanty to be thus preserved . He described himself , if we remember rightly , as digging the channels for his thoughts to flow in . Jay made full memoranda , and we have supposed that many of his admirable Exercises ' may have been sketches of sermons thus prepared . Such papers are indeed more likely to be useful in print than if expanded into whole discourses . But Jay , and we believe Hall also , took no notes into the pulpit . A speaker inferior to these , after due preparation , and being ( as we said before ) in good condition , may often find himself most successful in thus relying wholly on his self-possession . There can be no objection , however , to such a use of notes as a lawyer makes of his brief . The paper is no more than a reasonable security against temporary forgetfulness or infirmity , and especially for the accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted from memory , and too numerous to be turned to in the Bible . Indeed , as hearers , we have found a sort of variety and hence relief , rather than interruption , in seeing an extemporaneous speaker advert occasionally to his notes . But there is another kind of preparation in which Hall wonderfully excelled . Without the help of memoranda he could not only premeditate but pre*ompose the greater part of a discourse , forecasting not merely its plan and points , but the structure and arrangement of sentences ; and this was not a rare occasional effort , but more or less the habit of his mind . The pain which it cost him to write led him to cultivate this art to an unusual degree , and though he was aided in such a process by his singular power of abstraction , yet the same art has been oftener used by eminent orators , and is more easily attained by practice , than is generally supposed . Some of the most admired passages in celebrated speeches , that were once thought to be wholly extemporaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard of at least one of the most successful preachers in our country who used this method chiefly if not wholly . One of the most eminent American statesmen strongly recommended it , as compared either with full writing or a mere brief , to a young clergyman of our acquaintance , as the best preparation for the principal parts // of a discourse , while the rest should be left , as far as language is concerned , to the resources of the moment ; adding from his own knowledge , that the most effective speeches in Congress were produced in this manner . We are disposed to think that at least to a considerable extent , this was Webster 's method . And this precomposition will be found to be a very different thing , both in the process and the effect , from the practice which we have spoken of before , of first committing words to paper , and then committing them to memory . It is more sunple and homogeneous , the mind at once generating the thought and its verbal body or form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering itself of the language , not as of so much material taken in charge from a manuscript , but as of its own present product ; and hence the impression made on the hearer is not unlike that of the happiest extemporaneous utterance . Kotwithstanding sentences or paragraphs , here and there , thus composed but not written beforehand , the sermon is yet extemporaneous in the common understanding of the term . If just this process should not be thought requisite on common occasions , we would yet advise any young man , who aims to do justice to his subjects and to himself , in his unwritten sermons , either by this means or by memoranda before him , to carry his preparation into the careful arrangement of his words in those passages that depend most on accuracy or felicity of expression , such as the chief doctrinal or argumentative statements , narrative or descriptive strokes , delicate allusions or imagery , and the concluding appeal . And , by the way , if anything more is intended to be kept of a sermon than a meagre outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes will be all the better if written after preaching rather than before , the mind having then ascertained under the urgency of trial the most effective arrangements of thought and modes of expression . This is reported to have been John Wesley 's practice , and his printed sermons show a corresponding advantage , as if they not only might be delivered , but had been proved fit for delivery . After what we have here said of the preparation proper for unwritten preaching , we shall not be accused of any wish to // lower the standard or relax the effort of our ministers . A few words then as to the reasons for our preference . The best mode of performing any work is to be determined by recurring distinctly to its specific use and end . The same amount of care and effort being expended , the best form of it is that which best fits the occasion in view , or which is most adapted to the purpose to be answered . Now the business of addressing a public assembly on any subject , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character or conduct , which is the distinctive work of a preacher in the pulpit , or of an advocate . at the bar ,  --  is not merely the communication of truth , of fact or argument or feeling . It is this to be sure , but it is this by one means which is materially different from any other . It is by speech , with its natural accompaniments heard for the time being , and then ceasing . As a lesson to the ear rather than the eye , and only temporary , it can not be held , recurred to , and studied by the learners , as the same truth may be in a book or tract . And then it is not only brought before them or put within their reach , but addressed to thema difference like that between a newspaper or a circular and a letter , or between a band playing for the public entertainment and their own , and a reveille or trumpet-call to an encampment of soldiers . It has a character of personality , being not a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to a listening assembly . These things enter into the idea of a sermon , a proper sermo . Recurring to a thought we have hinted before , it is properly the same thing , both in matter and manner , that it might be if there were no writing or reading , like the discourse of an ancient orator in times when printing was unknown and the hearers had no conception of the performance except as something spoken and heard . We present this view in contrast with that ideal of a sermon which is too common among young ministers , and which virtually confounds it with a dissertation or essay , as if , so far as language is concerned , both were to produce their appropriate effect by acting on the mind through deliberate reading , and hence were subject to the same laws , and excellenc* in the one were of course equal excellence in the other , so that the // best composition for the press must needs be the best composition for the pulpit . The preacher 's address may indeed be afterwards read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always secondary , and must be held as inferior to that other of being heard . To lose sight of the difference is a misconception of its office , and one that no doubt injuriously affects many laborious preparations for the pulpit . The candidate for the ministry whose chief aim is to become a writer , is un.just to his more distinctive calling as a preacher . On this difference * the distinction which critics have not failed to recognize between the written and the 8yolcen style , this term describing the whole expression of thought , including the structure of sentences and the choice and arrangement of words . The latter is that which is best fitted for ready utterance and instant impression . It is more simple , flexible and easy . Like conversation , it adopts the natural , rather than the inverted or other artificial forms of expressions and may be occasionally familiar and abrupt . It is more direct not merely by substituting you ' for he ' and I ' for we , ' but by so shaping the thought that it shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of being only heard . And because it must be understood if at all while it is spoken , and can not be reviewed or recalled for second thought , it allows and even requires comparative diffuseness , a freer use of synonyms , and occasional repetition , to ensure perspicuity or to clinch the effect . So different in its demands is composition for the ear from composition for the eye , that the highest excellence in either is seldom or never equal excellence in the other . It is said of Charles James Fox , that on hearing a speech in Parliament commended , he asked if it read well in print , adding , If it reads well it was not a good speech . ' The inference was certainly extravagant , yet had a foundation in truth . Certainly his own style was wonderfully effective in debate , yet makes no corresponding impression from the printed page , while Burke 's magnificent rhetoric , which has since been so much admired , sometimes even wearied and repelled his hearers . A similar comparison holds good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apart from the // aids of voice and action , a discourse is found to be the more effective in delivery the more it has of the quality we have assigned to the spoken style . With this distinction in view , it will appear that those persons are unreasonably fastidious , and indeed mistaken in their judgment , who refuse so much as to attempt extemporaneous speaking on any important occasion , because they can not thus produce a composition as satisfactory , if submitted to a critical reading , as they are accustomed to write ; They refer themselves to a wrong standard , as if they were required to *extemporize an article in a review or a prize-essay . They would preach without notes if they could command such language as they can elaborate with the pen at the study-table , forgetting that even if they could command such language it would not be the best for this purpose . Even those inaccuracies of structure or phraseology to which they may be liable , and which of course should be avoided as far as possible , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to detect them on a printed page , and often when perceived are of much less consequence than the speaker might suppose . More than this : there may be defects or blemishes in what we read , which are not such in what we hear ; and there are peculiarities of thought and language which a classical judgment would condemn in an essay , yet approve in a speech as enhancing the instant effect intended , especially in connection with the manner of the speaker ; for the fitness of a phrase or word must be estimated in this connection and with reference to that effect . In such a view , what would appear to be imperfections or obtrusive faults if spread out on a page , may be even auxiliaries to the impression on a listener , as the force of a picture depends on touches which if seen too near or in a wrong light are but ugly blotches . We remem , ber a story of two rival sculptors competing for a prize in statues to be erected on a lofty column ; the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stood on the ground , while they only marveled at the rude unfinished workmanship presented by the other ; but as the two forms were elevated to their intended site , that which was so nicely // chiseled lost its charm , and the homelier lineaments grew imposing to every eye : upon which the judgment was reversed , and he was rewarded as the successful artist who adapted his work to its distinctive design . The story shall apply itself . But the contrast is still more palpable between the extemporaneous and the written sermon as to manner in delivery . Everybody knows the difference between conversation and reading at the fireside . The first stimulates and fixes attention , as the other can not . When one friend spontaneously addresses another , framing language on the occasion and for the purpose , the natural modulation of the voice , with its variety of intonation , inflection and time , and accompaniment of look and gesture , makes the proper words the most perfect expression of thought and feeling . On the contrary , even good reading , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is the same difference between reading and speaking in public discourse . The orator 's manner is admitted to be the more perfect the more nearly it approaches to that of the best conversation , though of course his utterance must be more continuous and careful . He speaks naturally when he talks to the people , and then naturally they listen . Such a manner is the proper outgrowth of his mind in communication with their minds , and hence is understood and felt . Thus when a preacher is borne away from his manuscript into a paragraph or sentence dictated by present impulse , the most attentive hearers are refreshed and the drowsy are waked up . For this reason chiefly , of two sermons equally good in their kinds , the unwritten one will bear to be , longer , so that an eminent English clergyman who prescribes forty-five minutes for the one , allows but half an hour for the other . But we need not insist that a free and natural address is more appropriate than mere reading to the work of the pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the corresponding delivery are born of the occasion , and hence naturally and easily acquired ( though of course with various degrees of ability and success ) by an extemporaneous speaker , they can not be as satisfactorily imitated in writing and reading // sermons . Among well known authors we might name examples of a style much more nearly approaching this idea than others of equal or greater ability ; such as William Cobbett , and , in some respects a very different writer , Carlyle , who moreover are known as powerful talkers ' also ; and no doubt care and skill may in this way do much toward the effectiveness of a composition which is to be spoken . Still it can not be expected that the solitary student writing at his table will express himself as he would to a listening assembly , by reminding himself now and then that he is writing for such a purpose . And even if the very language could be thus committed to paper , there remains the still more difficult task of reading it as if it were spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private , requires the utmost skill of a good reader , and an actor is apt to overdo the work . We have never heard a discourse pronounced from manuscript in such a way that if our eyes had been shut we could have supposed it to be unwritten . Happily the eyes of the hearers generally are not shut , and the difference is betrayed in the preacher 's looks as well as in his tones . Hence arises an incongruity , when with evident pains his manner is partly of the one sort and partly of the other . It approaches the ludicrous when he addresses a special warning or invitation to the people with his voice and gesture , while his eye slants down to his paper , as if , ' as somebody once said , his sermon were an impenitent sinner . ' We remember being reminded on such an occasion of a cross-eyed butcher who had raised his axe to strike down an ox , when his assistant , who held the horns of the animal , exclaimed , Pray tell me if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall be off ! ' So much indeed does any studied attempt of this kind detract from the naturalness of address , that when the manuscript is before the speaker we choose to have it read rather than declaimed , and we recall a feeling of complacency in the open , sincere air of one who occasionally raised up the paper as he would do at his table . We would not recommend any affectation of freedom , which after all , like the practice of putting the manuscript between the leaves of the Bible instead of laying it on the desk , is but // the ineffectual attempt to make the performance appear to be what it is not . Neither the composition nor the delivery , whatever other merit it may possess , can have the quality of an extemporaneous address , because it is not produced under the same influences. * And this brings us to a principal argument for the preaching which we recommend , in the stimulus to thought and feeling derived from the presence of the congregation . Analyze it as we may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker and his hearers , an action and reaction , most favorable to the mental activity and outward expression on his part which the service demands ; and the current deepens as it flows . The eyes fixed upon him , the hearts beating around him , their instant claim on his effort , and the concurrence of their sympathies , add an external force to the motive that he brings in himself , like the breeze to a ship in aid of its own enginery . Being fairly in possession of his faculties , he is driven forward on his track by the same influence that disturbs instead of stimulating a beginner , driving him off instead of onward . A necessity is laid upon him , ' other than that which the apostle mentions , to think and speak , and hence his mind acts with a rapidity and directness that in the time then passing may do the work on which he would spend hours in his study . He would sink to the floor rather than stop or falter on some nice question of phraseology which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in suspense . The motion of the fingers in playing the flute , as implying so many successive volitions , has been referred to as an instance of the rapidity of mental action , but here , it has seemed to us , is often a more wonderful example , when the processes of composition , the bodying forth of thought , and the comparison , rejection , and selection of words , are performed in quite inappreciable intervals , so that sometimes the speaker , judging * For one instance : - extemporaneous speak*g is always deliberate , even slow , in the outset , as compared with reading ; and such a beginning is natural , and every way the best . It reserves the speaker 's strengLh , and allows the later more rapid movements to have their full effect . No reader successfully imitates it in this respect . // by his conscious effort , may accuse himself of undue hesitation when no hearer can detect the slightest pause . This tension of his faculties gives him a power beyond that of his more deliberate moods . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses that would find no place if he were relying on his calmer preparations . The effect of every stroke adds vigor to the succeeding blow . And then such present activity of mind , when once produced by the occasion , imparts to his face a living varying expression not to be had in the , passive utterance of what was written before . We remember coming suddenly upon one of the most brilliant thinkers while in his study ill the heat of composition , and observing an illumination in his countenance as he looked up , that we never saw while he read his sermons to the people , and it occurred to us how much their effect might be enhanced if that intellectual activity were carried into the pulpit , under the accessories of the place and time . Certainly the manner of a speaker is the more impressive for being thus expressive of present thought and emotiou. * Ministers will feel the force of another consideration relating to their own convenience and relief . The manual toil expended on sermons fully written from week to week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the difficulty of securing the unbroken time required , the undue pressure toward the end of the week , the irksome details of composition when begun , as it so often is , too late , and then goaded forward by necessity , perhaps late into the night , and the weariness instead of fresh vigor brought to its delivery : these are certainly disadvantages which at least ought not to be unnecessarily imposed on all preparation for the pulpit . The best preparation for extemporaneous preaching is more natural and healthful . Except in the mere consultation of books , and more or less noting of memoranda , it may he done on the feet as well as at * We remember a near sighted clerical friend telling us that having observed in others the animated expression of the eyes fixed upon the congregation , he once made the experiment of dispensing with his spectacles , but found that as he could not then see the people , however he might be seen , he was not in the way of getting the animation , and there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street or the field , even in favorable intervals snatched from other engagements , on a journey , sometimes even in company or conversation . And this is the secret of the marvel told of some successful preachers , who are said not to go to work on their Sunday morning sermon till Sunday morning comes , when in truth they may have been at work on it all the week , and half a sheet suffices for all the writing they require . Why should preachers add to their more intellectual tasks so much drudgery of the pen ? But apart from their ordinary ministrations , there are occasions on which a manuscript is out of place , even out of the question , and they must speak extempore , if at all ; yet they can do it with comfort and success only as it is their habit . And then in times of unusual religious excitement , besides having to preach oftener , a pastor finds the advantage , even the necessity , of preaching in this way . A familiar talk , ' he owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse , and if obliged from habit to depend on his notes , ' he would give worlds , ' as some have expressed it , if he could preach without them . ' Should he not be at least equipped for such emergencies ? That unwritten sermons are felt to be especially suitable at those seasons when the people are most susceptible of impression , and the most decisive results are expected , is to us an argument for the superiority of this method . May it not be true , also , that the delivery of a sermon is the more likely to be attempted under a due sense of dependence on divine aid , when the details of thought and language have not been all adj usted beforehand ? Of course , as we have shown already , we would give no quarter to the neglect of needful preparation on the plea of thus leaving room for present inspiration ; certainly dependence may be felt and aid invoked in more deliberate composition ; but in the act of addressing a congregation on the momentous themes of the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion for the suggestions and impulses that shall prompt or modify his utterance , may be supposed then , if ever , to be mindful of the higher influence that is needful for his purpose . Even after ion g experience , a devout man approaches such a service with // misgivings , sometimes with a tremulous distrust of his own powers , that would prompt the cry , 0 Lord , open thou my lips ! To the same extent he is alive to the best spiritual impressions in furtherance of his aim . Hence , often when he enters the pulpit oppressed by an unwonted conviction of his insufficiency , he meets with the more signal success . Our conclusion is confirmed by examples . Those preachers who attract and affect large masses of the people , like Whitefield in his day , and Spurgeon now , certainly have a mission ' in behalf of Christianity and of the world , and their work , as we have said , has always been done in this manner . Nor can it be objected that such a practice is suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stated ministrations of pastors . Spurgeon is a pastor , and so were most of the popular preachers we have named . In England the most successful and eminent pastors of dissenting churches , and not a few within the Establishment , use no other method . We are led to believe that they have a stronger hold on the common people than the ministers of a corresponding rank among ourselves , and that this advantage is owing to their greater freedom of address . A similar reference may be made to the best preachers in the Methodist connection , both there and here , and in all the evangelical denominations in our Southern and Western States . As far as the experiment has been tried among Congregational and Presbyterian ministers at the North , the results have been no less favorable . The reader will recall the name of one of the most eminent New England divines now living , whose preaching has always been mainly extemporaneous ; and another well known example also among the few Episcopal ministers who adopt this method . Dr. Payson preached extempore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written sermons are said to have been made the u4ore effective in delivery by the introduction of passages of this character . This was the common practice of Dr. John M. Mason . Dr. Emmons , as one of his students told us , in the afternoon of the Sabbath , extemporized what he called the Improvement ' of his morning discourse , coming down on the people like shot . ' If we go further back , the Puritan pastors in New // England , for example Shepard of Cambridge , did not general - ly read their sermons in the pulpit ; neither did the great preachers in the Protestant Reformation . The same is true of the Christian orators in the early ages of the Church . As to the still earlier examples of those who were more than orators , we need not say there is no tradition of Paul or Apollos taking manuscripts with them into the synagogues , when they argued , from the manuscripts always to be found there , that Jesus was the Christ . Does any one imagine that the well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day , could have been produced by the reading of sermons ? Or we may argue from the practice in other professions , as far as the occasions are parallel . Orations , ' as they are technically called , or formal addresses on literary or patriotic anniversaries , may well enough be read , as they usually are ; but such performances are essentially entertaining or didactic in their design , while sermons are meant to reach further ends in human character and life . The same may be said of the Lectures ' before Lyceums or Associations , which have come to be reckoned institutions ; yet one lecturer , as accomplished and successful as any other , we mean Wendell Phillips , makes no use of writing for such purposes , even in his exquisite account of ' the Lost Arts , ' where the subject would seem most to require it and we have never heard addresses , whether on such occasions or in excited debate , more nearly perfect than his . Sermons are more properly conipared with speeches in a deliberative assembly , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince and persuade the hearers with a view to their action . The reading of a speech we suppose was never known in Parliament , and is an anomaly in Congress . Be fore a jury it would seem ludicrous . The uniform practice at the bar , except on purely legal questions before the higher courts , where no appeal could be had to emotion , is the more pertinent because j urors represent such minds as are addressed mainly in the preaching of the gospel . A lawyer speaks extempore not only because he must often handle new testimony , or an unexpected difficulty , but from the common conviction that by the other method he would lose more in effect than he would gain // in the rhetorical merit of his language to a fastidious reader . The same reference being had to present effect on the congregation , why is there not the same loss in reading from the pul-pit ? We anticipate the objection that a young minister who does not fully write his sermons is in danger of yielding to indolence , slighting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we maintain that this is just one of those cases in which a temptation is not to be avoided , but resisted . If the mode of preaching that we recommend is a good mode , even the best , then it devolves on a minister to do it properly according to the best of his ability , by a timely and diligent use of his powers , as an instructed scribe ' bringing out of his treasure things new and old , ' and this on his responsibility to his people and to God . Whatever is proper to be done , if he will not worthily attempt it , his fault is not an apology for himself , nor for others . But we reverse the point of this objection , and maintain that the same young minister , if he confines himself to written sermons , is in danger of writing extemyore , with all time haste and none of the impulse of unpremeditated address , taking up his subj ect only when he takes up his pen , and then only because he must , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the stipulated quantity of paper . Sermons thus prepared could be no worse for being unwritten . A candidate for the ministry has to be warned against such writing ; there is danger oJ it , and danger in it ; he is taught better . So let him not be dissuaded from unwritten preaching , because it has its own perils , but being forewarned against pernicious habits , let him learn a more excellent way. * The opinions we have here expressed will be assented to , we think , by many who are mature and honored in the ministry , but who have so long and so far depended on their manuscripts in the public services of the Sabbath , that they can not be expected to attempt any considerable change in their own practice . Younger men , however , often express the same preference , and still maintain that it would be of no use for them to attempt extemporaneous preaching , while yet they make no // persevering experiment . They do something in this way , ' to be sure , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulpit ; they can not do it well enough for that . ' They take it for granted they could not be sufficiently ready , or consecutive , or even grammatical , in the face of'the great congregation . ' Now this is the very way to remain ignorant of their own powers , and to impair the efforts they already make in this direction . They keep down their standard of extemporaneons address ; thrust this work into an obscure time and place , so that it shall be no great matter ' if they do ill ; brand it as necessarily an inferior article among their intellectual wares ; and virtually discourage themselves from ever attempting the highest excellence in this kind . Can any man thus do any sort of work as well as he is capable of doing it ? Whatever he has in hand , he will do it the better for requiring himself to do his best , and taking a position that makes success or failure important enough to stimulate his endeavors . In general , his unwritten sermons will be as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts them on the same level as to the occasion and end , holding himself no less responsible for their effectiveness , and expending his strength on them accordingly . And even at this disadvantage , a pastor often finds judicious hearers more interested in one of his familiar evening lectures than in some of his statelier discourses , from which he may learn that the former , by reason of its simplicity and freedom , excelled the latter in th' best qualities of a sermon . Certainly many of our ministers underrate their own ability in this respect . What so many faithful men have done well before them , they also can do well encaigh to make it worthyofbeingdone . A third rate lawyer , having only a brief before him , addresses a court and jury for an hour or more , without discredit to himself , as far as self-possession , orderly thought , and correct language are concerned , and with success to his client ; and why should a minister , of more talent and education , and with more ample materials , presume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that time in the same manner ? Let him at least try the experiment ; and though the first result should be failure and // chagrin , let him not desist , for some of the best extemporaneous preachers are known to have fared the worst in their earliest attempts , sinking to the seat and weeping at their dicomfiture , yet persevering till they made full proof ' of their ministry . Of conrse the earlier the practice is begun with right aims and efforts , the better . Youthful zeal and discipline may do as much in this direction as in any other . As has been asked , Why should not a young man be trained to think at his tongue 's end as well as at his linger 's end ? ' He may as well be educated to preach without writing , as to write and read . The self-possession , readiness , methodical habit , and command of language , which it especially requires , are most easily and perfectly obtained at the time most favorable to every other part of education . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , when our pastors are exercised and equipped for it , not only in the first stages of their ministry but in their preparatory course . Hence the improvement we desire is to be expected chiefly from our Theological Seminaries , and especially from the students themselves . If any theological student has been so patient as to follow us thus far in what we have said of Spurgeon and of unwritten sermons , we would like to detain him still longer , if we had more space , with hints that might aid his future efforts in this direction ; but we shall have accomplished a chief part of our purpose if he here derives or confirms this impression-that if faithful to his calling , he will aim to be not so much a man of letters , as a minister of the Gospel , and his principal business will be , not to write , but to preach .
