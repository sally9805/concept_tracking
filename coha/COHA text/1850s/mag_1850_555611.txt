ART . X. - Histoire Pidlosophique du Regne de Louis XV . Par le COMPTE DE TOC*UEVILLE . Paris : D'Amyot. 1847. 2 vols . Svo . THE Count de Tocqueville is , we believe , the father of M. de Tocqueville , the distinguished writer on Democracy in America , and recently the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the French Republic . We learn from the preface to this history , that it is written by one in the decline of life , whose sympathies are with the principles and institutions of a former age , with an order of things that has almost wholly passed away . The history itself is an epitaph engraved on the tomb of monarchy in France , - an epitaph written , not indeed to eulogize the departed , but to point out the errors and the crimes which dimmed the glory of royalty , and finally brought down its grandeur and power to the dust . The author has evidently formed his style and sentiments upon those of Tacitus , and labors effectually to give a gloomy and tragic interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his task is to describe sin and its consequences . He deplores the fall of the monarchy , but he shows that it was the inevitable result of the dissoluteness , corruption , and impiety , the wasteful and inglorious character of the reign of Louis XV . The results were slow in unfolding themselves ; but few of them were visible during the lifetime of the depraved monarch . Still there was a general foreboding that such a state of things could not last , that a crisis was at hand , when so rotten a social edifice could no longer sustain itself , but with a fearful crash would plunge into ruin . It is reported that Louis himself said , " this thing will last as long as I shall ; my successor may get out of it as he can . " He did " get out of it " by the way of the scaffold . Voltaire was still more explicit : - " All around me , they are sowing the seeds of a revolution , which will inevitably happen , though I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are late in coming to their object , but they arrive at last . The light has gradually diffused itself so far , that an explosion will take place on the first opportunity , and then there will be a fine hubbub . The young folks are lucky ; they will see great things . " The // remark was characteristic ; the old mocking infidel hugs himself at the prospect of the completion of his work . The National Convention did well to install his image with all the honors in their pantheon , just as they were beginning the excesses of the Reign of Terror . The Count de Tocqueville calls his work a philosophical history , as his object is to traoe the connection of cause and effect between the errors and the crimes of the period which he describes , and the fearful scenes of the revolution which followed it . He reflects the light of subsequent events upon the reign of Louis XV. , and thus determines its true character and influence . The contemporary historian is a mere chronicler , who can only describe scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their consequences . Posterity alone can read the whole lesson , for in their eyes alone the tree is known hy its fruits . This is the true idea of the philosophy of history , - to develop the consequences of actions , and to point out the hearings of events upon each other ; for in this manner , the great laws of political economy and morality are shown to be exemplified in history , and the ways of God with man are justified . There is a spurious philosophy of the subject , much in vogue with historians of the present day , which is a mere development of the doctrine of fatalism ; it teaches , that men are not responsible for their conduct , as they act only under an overruling necessity , which controls the whole course of events , the human agents in them being merely unconscious puppets , and the issues of things being determined by fate without regard either to their strivings , their merits , or their crimes . Philosophers of this school waste no words upon the moral character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unmerited sufferings of a Louis XVJ. , and the crimes of his murderers . The actors in history are estimated by the quantity , not the quality , of the effects produced by them ; the power which they exercised , instead of the moral or immoral use which they made of it , is the standard by which they are judged . Viewed in this manner , Mirabean towers over Lafayette , and Bailly appears insignificant hy the side of Danton . Carlyle is almost the only English historian of this class ; while Thiers , Michelet , Mignet , Lamartine , and a host of others , are its representatives // in France . Picturesque narrative , exaggerated description , startling contrasts , and a pointed and epigrainmatic style are the qualities upon which such writers depend for success . They aim only at immediate effect , and care nothing about tracing actions to their causes and consequences , if they can only hurry the reader away by the brilliancy of their coloring , and by the absorbing interest of their narrative . History is thus degraded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labors only to astonish or amuse . It borrows the vivid colors of romance , and the imacrination is invoked to supply 0 the deficiencies of the story , and to *ll up the picture . By thus gradually losing a strict regard for truth , it ceases to be trustworthy as a whole , and no longer affords even the materials for instruction . Lamartine 's History of the Girondists , apart from its moral taint , its affected and sentimental style , and its utter disregard of the requisitions of humanity and justice , is a mere historical romance ; minute particulars and long conversations are reported in it which could not by any possibility have come to the knowledge of the narrator . No authorities are cited , and no credit can be given to the writer 's blank assertion , that he has h*id access to unpublished documents and original sources of information , of which he may perhaps give some account at a future day . We can not allow the evidence of historical events to depend upon M. Larnartine 's reputation for carefulness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citations of proof . The shortest method of characterizing the Count de Tocqueville 's work is to say , that in style and sentiment , in the opinions avowed , and the mode of narrating the facts , in all the essential qualities of a history , it is the very opposite of the class of books just described . It is addressed to a different class of readers ; it is an appeal to the thoughtful , cultivated , and religious student of human affairs ; to the philosophical statesman and the earnest and patient seeker after truth . He has none of the artifices of style , the affected smartness and exaggerated manner , or the appeals to national vanity and the flattery of popular prejudices , by which such writers as Michelet and Lamartine have sought to gain the applause of the multitude . His manner is rather formed upon that of Tacitus and Montesquieu ; it is concise , sententious , sometimes abrupt , and shows more of the spirit of the philosophical moralist // than of the suitor for popular favor . Far from pandering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most salient trait of French character , he labors to reprove and subdue it , by exhibiting the decline of monarchy in France as leading to the extinction of the political influence of the country and the loss of its power and renown . In his eyes , the glory of France culminated under Louis XIV. , and then passed rapidly through all the stages of decay , till it was lost in the horrors of the first Revolution . The saturnalia which then prevailed , the destruction of the monarchy , the nobility , and the church , and the triumph of irrelibion and Jacobinism , was the just punishment of the disorders and wickedness of the court and the people under Louis XV . This is the grand but gloomy moral of his work , which the writer inculcates with the fervid indignation of an ancient prophet . He appears sincerely attached to the Roman Catholic church and to the cause of royalty ; and he regards the decayed condition of religion in France and the extinction of the sentiment of by .. alty as the greatest misfortunes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence of his opinions against the democratic spirit of his age ; he merely narrates the facts from his own point of view , and leaves it for others to view them under a different aspect , if they can . The lesson that he draws from them is a stern and sad one , like that which was uttered by the miserable Phlegyas from the darkness of his place of punishment - " Discite justiliam moniti , et non temnere divos . " It is a little singular that , while the son has gained so much distinction as the philosophical observer and analyst of the spirit of democracy and the progress of democratic institutions , the father should have occupied himself with tracing the last lines of the history of royalty , and expounding the causes of its decay . Both are men of marked abilities and cultivated tastes ; they are quick and accurate observers , and their speculations are both original and profound . Their writings are addressed to thinkers , and are not designed to please the multitude . They come nearer to the English than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows something of the fondness for rapid and sweeping generalizations which has usually characterized the speculations of his // countrymen . But neither of them indulges in the vague and sentimental declamations , the tinsel ornaments , the appeals to popular prejudices , and the shallow profundity of such wri-* ters as Lamartine and Cousin . With them , rhetoric never assumes the place of logic , and their weight of thought seeks no aid from brilliancy of expression . If affectation is ever visible in their writings , it is when they attempt to philosophize on too slight occasions , and seek to render some very profound reason for that the cause of which lies upon the surface . The son , we believe , has , never attempted to write history ; and the father certainly does not excel as a narrator of events or a delineator of characters , though he gives a very clear , neat , and concise summary of facts , and arranges his materials with admirable method . His work will he a classic in French history long after the more showy productions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract from the preface , that shows with great clearness the purpose which the writer has had in view , and the general character of his work . " When the tomb received the remains of Louis XV. , the old French monarchy was interred in it along with him . The acts of this king , his faults and his vices , gave a great impulse to the movement which was urging the nation forward to a new order of things . The principles both of religious belief and political opinion underwent a severe investigation ; and when , guided by false lights , men strove eagerly to annihilate all religious faith , did they not thereby exalt human pride beyond all limit ? " The philosophical inquiry into the causes , which , during a great part of the eighteenth century , prepared the minds of peo. ple for the great revolution which marked the end of it , is worthy of our serious attention . I have undertaken it with the more ardor , because it appears to me that hitherto it has been hardly commenced . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken place in our day , it is a useful , I may say almost a necessary , condition to have seen something of the old regime , and thus to be able to compare the causes with the effects which they have produced . After a revolution which has reversed so many fortunes , and kindled so many passions , old age is not a bad period in which to write the history of the times that are not yet remote from our own ; the years , as they accumulate , complete our knowledge of the human heart . Having become a stranger to the affairs that agitate the world , the writer looks upon them dispassionately ; the rude shock of events has // worn away his prejudices ; and in taking the pen , he has no other attraction than the truth , no other object than to instruct mankind . " The book which I offer to the public is not a metaphysical work . In it the facts are narrated in detail ; but I have endeavored to group them in such a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seemed more firmly established than it was in France at the death of Louis XIV . In spite of the reverses which clouded the later days of the Great Monarch 's career , the people had been dazzled by the factitious splendors of his reign , and by his absorption of all the powers of government into himself . He had scattered all obstacles to the unlimited domination of the crown ; he had exiled the Huguenots , had forced the great nobles to become supple courtiers , had compelled the parliaments to be merely the declaratory organs of his will and pleasure , and had caused nearly every country in Europe to tremble at the success of his arms . His noted boast , l ' *tat , c'est moi , was a truth which his people were as proud to acknowledge , as he was to utter ; they had learned to identify the national glory with the absolute dominion and personal renown of the king . They were as proud of the despotism of the monarch as the English were of the freedom of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , and had gilded it over with foreign conquests and alliances , with the glory of letters and the arts , and with every form and attribute of splendor at home . The national vanity was satisfied , and the French people have never asked for any thing more . Unfortunately , the crown passed from the head of Louis to that of an infant ; and the dying monarch himself , as if a long minority were not fraught with hazards enough for royalty , increased the danger by attempting to extend his power beyond the limits of his own life , and to regulate the manner in which France should be governed till his great grandson should come of age . His will directed that a council of regency should be established , of which the Duke of Orleans should be the head , though he should have but one vote in it , and of which two of his natural children , whom he had legitimated , were to be members . This delegation of royal power to a numerous committee , instead of an individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , and was consequently so unpopular , that the Duke of Orleans easily persuaded the parliament to set the will aside , and to appoint him sole regent . This step was perhaps necessary for the tranquillity of the kingdom ; but it had the effect to persuade the people , that there existed in the state a power which was above the throne , and which had authority to annul the expressed wish of the king . It was so far unfavorable to royalty . lEt had a similar , though not an equal , effect with the act of the British parliament which , after the revolution of 1688 , altered the succession to the throne . The Regent Duke of Orleans was an fibler statesman than Charles II . of England , whom in other respects he greatly resembled . He was a good-natured , indolent debauchee , riotous and extravagant in his pleasures , but having sense enough to prevent his boon companions and his mistresses from exercising any influence over him in matters of state . He was attached to peace , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loved to see France quiet and prosperous , both because he was naturally amiable and kindhearted , and because the tranquillity of the kingdom allowed him more leisure for his private amusements . But he was careless and prodigal , and his facile disposition yielded to the importunity of suitors what his better judgment denied . The finances consequently fell into great disorder , and as the Regent had an inquiring and speculative turn of mind , and was fond of experiments , chemistry or alchemy being one of his private amusements , he naturally lent a ready ear to the wild financial projects of John Law . This was the age of commercial bubbles and stockjobbing ; the temporary success of the Mississippi scheme in France favored the inflation of the South Sea bubble in England , and The explosion which soon followed spread almost universal bankruptcy through the two kingdoms , and ruined the reputations as well as the fortunes of many of their leading statesmen and nobles . And the governments did not escape ; the impoverished and exasperated people imputed all the blame to their rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusion with themselves . The practical talents and financial sagacity of Sir Robert Walpole broke the force of the blow in England ; warned by him , the ministry did not get // deeply implicated in the affair , and the Bank of England stood entirely aloof . But in France , Law 's schemes were adopted at an early day by the Regent , and the whole force of the government was exerted to carry them through . The sufferers , consequently , had a right to impute their ruin in some degree to the state , and to look to it for indemnification and for the punishment of the guilty . The Duke was both too good-natured and too just to punish when he had himself been an accomplice in the crime , if it was one ; for the more lenient will call it nothing but insanity . He protected Law , or allowed him to escape , and bore with his usual thoughtless indifference the reproaches which were showered upon his administration . The lustre of the crown which he represented had been stained by his meddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst , his refusal or inability to relieve the sufferers covered it with ignominy . The thirst for gain , when it rises to fever height , levels all distinctions of rank ; during the prevalence of the mania , princes of the blood , nobles , ladies of rank , ministers of state and the church , had mingled with the crowd in the Rue Quincampoix , and chaffered eagerly with stockjobbers and swindlers . The material advantages of wealth came to be prized more highly than the factitious differences resting on prescription , or created by the favor of the crown . Hereditary rank and inherited honors lost ground in public estimation ; opulent bankers began to vie with the proudest nobles , not only in the sumptuousness of their style of living , but in direct influence at court . As the power of the aristocracy declined , that of the crown , which was dependent upon it , was also diminished ; the people ceased to respect their rulers , and the prestige of the monarchy in their eyes was gradually effaced . The gross and dissolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did much to wean the affections of the nation from the constituted authorities of the state , and to prepare the way for the fall of royalty . Every form of vice and impiety was practised by them without restraint and without concealment . The libertinism of Louis XIV . and his courtiers was veiled by the strictness of etiquette and by a decent regard for the forms of morality and religion , even after their spirit had departed . Under this covering , it might truly be said that " vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its gross-21* // ness . " The Duke of Orleans rudely tore down this veil , for he was by nature no hypocrite , and his frank and affable disl ) Osition was impatient of the restraints of etiquette . He threw open to the public gaze the penetralia of royalty , and exposed every act of debauchery and excess by which they were profaned . The gross and shameless violation of all the laws of morals and decency soon created weariness and disgust ; ordinary pleasures , common vices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stimulating the jaded appetites were eagerly sought in the refinements and extravagancies of debauch . Those who had ceased to respect themselves had no fear of the judgment of others , and the *publicity of their wickedness increased their enjoyment of it , and inspired them with an ambition to startle the multitude by fresh enormities. the orgies of the Regent and his low companions , his mistresses and his daughters , were so frequent and shameless that men ceased to wonder at them ; and the habit of regarding vice with callous indifference was soon established even among those whose tempe , raments did not incline to licentiousness , or who were shielded by avarice or ambition from other and more degrading vices . As is usual when the debasing influences proceed from a licentious court , the upper classes of society were the first corrupted ; the middle ranks as yet preserved their purity of life , and therefore could not fail to regard with disgust and abhorrence the practices of their superiors . Foremost in these licentious courses and most abandoned in his profligacy was the instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubois . This wretch , of low origin , being the son of a poor apothecary , was endowed with consummate tact , activity , shrewdness , and matchless effrontery . Hypocrisy was the only vice that could not be imputed to him ; he paraded the scandals of his life with as much pride as other men show in displaying their virtues . Having first corrupted the mind of his princely pupil by instruction in every species of wickedness , and made himself necessary to him both in the conduct of state affairs and in the procurement of pleasures , he demanded as the price of his services to be elevated to the highest honors of the church . While he had yet a wife , before he had taken priest 's orders , or made any effort to conceal the turpitude of his life , he was nomi // nated by his shameless master to be the successor of the saintly Fenelon in the archbishopric of Cambrai . This was an insult to religion , and the archbishop of Paris , resenting it as such , nobly refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieve to find the illustrious Massilion , were persuaded to assist at the ceremony ; and the newly constituted archbishop immediately began his intrigues to obtain a cardinal 's hat . The diplomacy of France , as he was now minister of foreign affairs , was conducted by him for some years solely with a view to this end ; and he at length succeeded , though the life of Pope Innocent III . is said to have been shortened by the remorse which lie felt for having elevated Dubois to this dignity . But the French clergy were not ashamed to prostrate themselves before the new cardinal , who was now prime minister of the kingdom . In one of their assemblies , which took place in 1723 , he was unanimously chosen their president ; and thus the " severity of Christianity bowed down before the splendor of the dignities with which successful vice had clothed itself . " Religion itself received a fatal blow through the dishonor of its ministers ; and the people were encouraged to doubt or despise all that they had hitherto held most sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infi .. delity began to distinguish themselves by the boldness and rancor with which they assailed the faith of the common people . Their doctrines were no longer insinuated with some reserve , but were openly avowed , and defended with all the arms of sophistry and ridicule . Impiety became the fashion ; it was vulgar to preserve any respect either for morality or Christianity . To undermine the doctrines of natural religion and to mock at revelation was the shortest and easiest mode of obtaining the appellation of a philosopher . But the glory of emancipating one 's own mind from the prejudices of the age would be imperfect if the freedom were not shared with others , as the teacher 's fame is often measured by the number of his disciples . Hence the free thinkers and free livers showed themselves as eager to make proselytes to their opinions , and converts to their mode of life , as if they had been partisans of opposing sects in religion . The clergy , who should have resisted their attacks , were wholly occupied with the miserable disputes between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed the efforts of Catholicism in France for more than a century . The powers of the civil magistrate , the terrors of the law , were directed rather against heretics than unbelievers ; the writings of Voltaire and the earlier productions of Montesquieu remained unanswered , while the press teemed with confutations of Arnaud and Quesnel . Cardinal Noailles was persecuted , while Cardinal Dubois held the highest office in the kingdom . The Regency foreshadowed the character of the reign which it introduced ; it was the evening that ushered in the night . Louis XV . had all the faults of the Duke of Orleans without any of his virtues . He was an indolent , feeble , and selfish voluptuary , without energy enough to become a tyrant , and without the firmness of purpose and belief which is the only redeeming quality of the bigot . His vices were of that mean and scandalous character on which indignation seems wasted ; the meanest of his subjects could only despise them . No thought for the honor of his throne or the happiness of his people seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debaucheries . He was incapable of real attachment even to the companions and ministers of his pleasures ; he tolerated them only because they catered skilfully to his appetites , and surrendered into their hands the reins of government only because he had not spirit and energy enough to retain them in his own grasp . His listless temperament and feeble intellect sought nothing but repose and sensual gratification . During the whole of his long reign , the destinies of France were swayed entirely by the abandoned females who were successively raised to the post of the king 's mistress . Most of these women came from so low a condition in life , that they did not represent any party or interest in the state , and never became connected with one ; their influence , consequently , was not exerted with a steady purpose of raisinb or depressing one of the dominant factions at court , or of favoring one line of policy in preference to another . It was directed exclusively by the caprice of the moment , a view to the favorite 's immediate advantage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared behind his mistress . The history of Louis XV . is a history of the successive reigns of Madame de Mailly , the Duchess de Chateauroux , Madame de Pompadour , and Madame du Barn . // An administration so conducted could not but be productive of tumult and disorder at home , and of defeat and disgrace in its foreign relations . The policy of the Regent , as we have seen , had been pacific ; a cordial understanding existed between him and the English ministry , represented successively by Stanbope and Walpole , both of whom were eager to preserve peace in Europe , as the surest means of strengthening the house of Hanover in its yet insecure possession of the British throne . A short and unnatural war with Spain , that grew out of the frantic projects of Alberoni and the foolish conspiracy of Cellamare , was the only contest in which France was engaged under the Duke of Orleans . The influence of Fleury , bishop of Fr*jus , then became predominant in the kingdom , and fortunately he was like his predecessor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tutor during the minority , and was accused of favoring the natural timidity , irresolution , and indolence of Louis , in order to keep him in a state of perpetual tutelage . However this may be , the king seemed to think it was quite right that his sagacious old instructor should become his first minister , and in fact should govern France without interference or control for the remainder of his life , which was prolonged far beyond the period usually allotted to man . He made a wise and temperate use of his power , almost the only charges brought against him being the artifices through which he acquired and retained his station . Thus , he chose a mistress for the king with the same coolness with which he had just before selected a wife for him , his only object being to find one whose gentle and unambitious character promised to give no trouble to the administration . i*laria Leczinska was a mild and uncomplaining wife , and Madame de Mailly , the king 's first mistress , was probably the only one who loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share his affection without grasping at his power . Fleury was prudent , shrewd , simple in his tastes , and economical in the management of the finances ; and his administration , on the whole , was the most prosperous portion of his sovereign 's reign . But he had no generous impulses , no regard for the honor of the king , or the glory of the kingdom . He did nothing to retrieve the reputation of the monarchy , which had been tarnished by the excesses of the Regency and by the virtual bankruptcy of the government . Despising // all pomp and show for himself he forgot to secure the affections of his countrymen through their vanity by increasing the magnificence of the court , adding to the personal reputation of the king , or pursuing a brilliant and aggressive foreign policy . He was pleased rather to reduce monarch and courtiers , generals and statesmen , into comparative insignificance by the side of his own quiet and unobtrusive , but all-including and resistless influence . At the age of eighty-seven , to prevent his star from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose rash hut chivalrous schemes had awakened the martial spirit of France , he allowed his country to be drawn into the unnecessary and disastrous war of the Austrian Succession ; and three years afterwards , he died , chief minister to the last , as he had wished , but leaving the kingdom with disordered finances , defeated armies , and a feeble and debauched sovereign , tottering upon the brink of the precipice over which it was soon to fall . Soon after the death of Fleury , Madame de Pompadour became in fact prime minister of France ; wars were made , generals and ambassadors appointed , and treaties signed , only to gratify her jealousy and caprice . Even the haughty Maria Theresa , at other times so punctilious in her notions of female propriety and imperial etiquette , stooped to write letters with her own hand to this worthless courtesan , in which she addressed her as " my sister . " And the other powers of Europe soon came to understand that , in negotiating with France , every thing might be gained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's subjects were doubly mortified by the loss of all the advantages which had fairly been won for them through the splendid military talents of Marshal Saxe , and by the ignominy which covered the private character of Louis . The peace of Aix la Chapelle was in every respect inglorious for the French ; having engaged in the war without any motive of sound policy , they came out of it with the loss of national honor , as they were compelled by the secret articles to destroy the fortifications of Dunkirk , and to banish the Pretender from their territory , to which he had been welcomed by the magnanimity of Louis XIV . They came out of it , also , with burdened finances , a ruined navy , and an enfeebled and dispirited population . One other such war , it was apparent , would destroy whatever // influence France might yet possess among the powers of Europe ; and unfortunately another was near at hand , the Seven Years ' war , the most disastrous and humiliating contest in which the country was ever engaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it destroyed the last hold which royalty had over the affections of the people . " A desire for liberty began to get possession of the minds of men . The French with difficulty adapt themselves to free institutions , but they will not long endure despotism , especially when it is not attended by national glory . The royal authority had been surrounded with splendor , under Louis XLV. ; the people saw the whole state concentrated in the king , who gave to it magnificence and renown . But under Louis XV. , arbitrary power showed symptoms of decline ; and when the English form of government was compared with our own , the advantages of the former excited a sort of passionate admiration . " The state of society in France already announced that the crisis would be a violent one . A perfect contrast existed between the two extremes of this society . At the summit was civilization carried to excess , and the improvidence and 9ffeminacy which are the necessary consequences of such excess ; at the bottom was barbarism and its fierce instincts ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enervated by excessive civilization . " One other cause of dissolution was added to that which we have just described . The vast conspiracy against Christianity , of which Voltaire was the chief , acquired fresh strength every day . Men who pretended to be reformers of the human race called themselves philosophers , - that is , lovers of wisdom , foes to prejudices . These men are constantly repeating the words of humanity and philanthropy ; they wish , they say , to elevate the dignity of human nature , and to this end they substitute arbitrary and conventional virtues for Christian duties . They preach up toleration , and soon become themselves intolerant . Misfortune excites their pity ; they will even undertake its defence , if they should be able by so doing to create an excitement and to acquire celebrity ; for thus they obtain a great influence . Philosophy is a word continually in their mouths and in their writings ; for to philosophize is to brave received opinions , and to crush them , if possible , under the weight of public contempt ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not perceive that the fury which is directed against religion becomes itself a species of fanaticism. " // infidelity , which prevailed during the period to which his book relates . The first was the licentious impiety , founded upon the general corruption of morals which existed under the Regency ; the second was the mocking and scoffing spirit that was introduced by Voltaire ; the third was the sentimental deism of Rousseau ; and the last was the fierce and sanguinary impiety , which prevailed at the first establishment of a French republic . The Count de Tocqueville has supplied some valuable materials for the history of these several forms of unbelief , and has speculated with much acumen upon their causes and consequences . We can not follow him through the whole of this discussion , hut we translate his lucid and concise account of the effect of Rousseau 's writings upon the religious and political opinions of his contemporaries . " The philosophers had injured their own cause by their universal skepticism , by outraging the inmost and surest convictions of the soul through their denial even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conscience . Rousseau came to their support by advocating the spiritualism which Diderot and his school , Llelvetius , and sometimes Voltaire himself had affected to despise . As Vol. taire had succeeded in rendering religion ridiculous , any belief in it was out of the question ; but materialism was repugnant to the understandings of men , and so a compromise was made on the ground of the spiritualism of Rousseau . He admitted a belief in God , conscience , the immortality of the soul , and natural religion , but rej*pcted all positive doctrines , all worship , all observances . The Emile was published in 1759 . This book was in itself a revolution . In it , all the usages of society were attacked by par . adoxes , but with that ravishing eloquence which has placed the author at the head of the writers of the eighteenth century . He taught fathers of families that they ought not to speak of religion to their children till they had reached that age when the passions begin to render its yoke a heavy one . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Gospel ; and a few lines farther down , he states the most captious arguments against the doctrines of the religion of Jesus Christ . This tissue of sophistries and contradictions had the honor of being burnt by the hand of the executioner , - a condemnation rather useful than injurious to the success of the work . Who could suppose that the barbarous spite evinced by this sentence would cause the eloquent pages of Rousseau to create nothing but disgust ? " In 1762 , the Social Contract was published , in which Rousseau compares all religions with each other , and gives polytheism // the preference over catholicism . The latter is incompatible , as he thinks , with the unity which is essential to every form of government . But he becomes ashamed of this doctrine , and returns from it to natural religion , which he covers up with the name of the Gospel . Religion , ' he says , considered in relation to society , may also be divided into two kinds ; namely , the religion of the man and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altars , without rites , confined altogether to internal worship of the Supreme Being and to the eternal duties of morality , is the pure and holy religion of the Gospel . ' " But what he says upon this subject is only the complement of his political systen3 , which was the boldest that had yet been developed . In the Emile , he had already proclaimed the uselessness of kings , and combated the institution of privileged classes . Remember that the human race is essentially composed of bodies of private individuals ; and even if all the kings should be taken away , the loss would not be a sensible one , and things would go on just as well as ever The multitude will always be sacrificed to the few , and public interests to private interests . The specious names of justice and subordination will always serve as means of violence and arms to iniquity ; whence it follows , that the higher orders , which pretend to be useful to those which are beneath them , are in truth useful only to themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still farther in the Social Contract . The forms of government of the republics of antiquity are the models proposed to modern nations . Rousseau lays down in an absolute manner the principle of the sovereignty of the people , and that of the dependence of its chiefs . The sovereignty of the people is anterior to the institutions which regulate it , and these institutions are not obligatory till they have been established by the people 's own choice . Thus the people choose the government which pleases them , and change it when they please . ' " The principle of the sovereignty of the people , laid down peremptorily , in the hearing of a vain , frivolous , and discontented nation , could not but seduce many .
