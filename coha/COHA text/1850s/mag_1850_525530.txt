CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY . WE present , as a summary of this month 's proceedings in Congress , the speeches of Messrs . CALHOUN , *WEB5TER , and SEWARD . These , with the speech of Mr. CLAY , given in our last number , are a complete exposition of the present great social , moral , and political question before the nation . Avoiding , with the exception of Mr. SEWARD 'S speech , the wide range of abstract discussion the subject presents , they are comprehensive statements of the various phases of public opinion . On Tuesday , March 5th , the Senate , having proceeded to the consideration of the resolutions submitted by Mr. CLAY , Mr. CALHOUN , having the floor , spoke as follows : From the very first , he commenced , it had been his belief that the agitation of this question of slavery would ultimately lead to disunion . Agitation has been suffered to proceed , and the anticipated result is at last before us ; and the great and grave question is now forced on this body-by what means can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must learn the causes that have bred disease in the once healthful frame of our Federal system . To save the Union , we must first know what has endangered the Union . To this question there is but one insxver  --  the all-pervading discontent of the Southern section of States . Whence , then , springs this discontent 3 Is it from the arts of demagogues 3 he asks . Is it the working of faction and party spirit 3 Not so ; here , as elsewhere , all regular political influences have been arrayed against exciting local questions , as weakening the strength of party ties ; and that spirit , with all its immense weight , has , in reality , held in check the course of public opinion . The real source of this discontent , the Senator continued , lies deeper . It is found in the settled belief of the people of the South that they can no longer , with honor and safety , remain in the Union . Again ; what has caused this belief 3 It has sprung from the continued ac*itation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressions on the rights of the South , and from the fact , which gives to these aggressions their practical significance , that the original equilibrium between the two sections no longer exTOL . V. NO . IV . NEW SERIES . ists . Mr. CALHOUN went on to show , from statistics , that the balance between these elementary divisions of the body politic , existing at the census of 1790 , was entirely destroyed at the time of the last census of 1840 . This inequality will be increased by the approaching census of the present decade . Two new territories are in progress to strengthen the Northern faction in the Senate , and strenuous efforts are making to bring in three additional free States from the territory recently acquired from Mexico . This destruction of an equilibrium , which , he argued , was the fundamental basis of the confederacy , and of the Constitution , was not the result of time or natural causes . In that case , the South had no reason of complaint . It was brought about by the partial legislation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and security of all . This legislation , territorial , financial , political , will , first and last , have given to the North , if New Mexico and California be suffered to pass into her hands , full threefourths of all the territory the United States ever possessed . Added to this , systems of revenue collected by duties on imports , and falling heavily on those , who , by their exports , paid for these imports ; unequal disbursements ; stringent tariffs , drawing direct contribution from the producing States , have all aided , in swelling to their present height , the wealth and prosperity , and consequent inducements to emigration , of the North . " These causes , " the Senator proceeded , " amply explain why the North has acquired a preponderance over every department of the Government , by its disproportionate increase of population and States . The former has increased , in fifty years , 2,400,000 over that of the South . This increase of population , during so long a period , is satisfactorily accounted for by the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been attracted to the Northern section from Europe and the South , in consequence of the advantages derived from the causes assigned . If they had not existed ; if the South had retained all the capital which has been extracted from her by the fiscal action of the Government ; and if it had not been excluded by the 28 1850. 427 // ordinance of 87 , and the Missouri compromise , from the region lying between the Ohio and Mississippi rivers , and between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains , north of 370 , 39 ' ; it scarcely admits of a doubt that it would have divided the emigration with the North , and , by retaining her own people , would have , at least , equalled the North in population , under the census of 1840 , and , probably , under that about to be taken . She would also , if she had retained her equal rights in those territories , have maintained equality in the number of States with the North , and have preserved the equilibrium between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loss , then , of the equilihiium is to be attributed to the action of this Government . This territory , Mr. CALHOUN continued , thus wrested from the hands of the South , thus enriched and peopled at the expense of the South , is now , by the political tendency of the day , to be used to overwhelm them . Centralization has converted this confederacy of independent powers into a consolidated democracy , and sectional interests , and political rights , are now mere questions of majorities . The whole State at last rests in the lap of the North ; and wherever rival interests clash , the South falls a helpless minority at the feet of the powerful majority of the North . This might he well acquiesced in , he thought , for the great good of union , so long as ordinary interests only were at stake . But the greatest of all interests , to a people , are those of social life and social institutions ; and these the South see now attacked . Diametrically opposite are the views of these sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as a crime and an evil , and the only question tha*there divides the fanatic and the man of moderate views is the how and when of its extinctions . In the South , the relation is regarded as one which can not be destroyed without subjecting the two races to calamity , and the section to poverty and desolation ; and they , in consequence , feel bound , by every consideration of interest and safety , to uphold it . The Senator then alluded to the rise and progress of the anti-slavery sentiment . Originating , he said , in the small and almost contemptible beginning of Abolitionism , it has , through the strife of party , become firmly rooted in the public opinion of the whole North . In its infancy , slight exerion would have stifled it , had there been in in the breasts of the people of those States a genuine love of the Union . But it was founded on opinions and feelings that found more or less sympathy in the heart of every Northern man . By toleration it gained strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These factions have become tainted with its doctrines , and now1 he feared , the only choice left the South was abolition or secession . The Union , Mr. CALHOUN continued , was not to be severed at a single blow . But had it not trembled under many blows I Had not many a stroke been aimed at the cords that hound us together I These cords were not merely political . They are spiritual , social , and economical . The ties of religious feeling , the stoutest far of all , were already rent in twain , by the severance of the churches that once covered the Union , with a common interest and a common aim . When these have parted , embittered sectional feeling will soon do its worst on the rest . Nothing , then , he says , will be left to hold the Union together , except force . But , surely , that can , with no propriety of language , be called a Union , when the only means by which the weaker is held connected with the stronger portion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the connection will partake much more of the character of subjugation , on the part of the stronger , than the union of free , independent sovereign States in one confederation , as they stood in the early stages of the Government , and which only is worthy of the sacred name of Union . Mr. CALHOUN , having now traced the dangers that threaten the Union to the universal discontent of the South ; having found the source of that discontent in their teeling of insecurity and political weakness ; having traced that sense of insecurity to the aggressions and interferences of the North ; and having seen the secret of these aggressions in the destruction of political equilibrium , and the conscious strength of the North , then asked how were those dangers to be averted I Clearly in the renewal of the balance of power between the two sections . He intimated that for this purpose , an amendment of the Constitution might be necessary . To the plan proposed by the administration , he utterly objected . Incompetent to effect its object , the salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more exceptionable as regards the rights of the South , than even the Wilmot Proviso . That what the latter would effect by direct action of Congress , the former leaves to time and natural causes to bring about ; while its measures and propositions respecting the admission of California , he looked upon as subversive of the Constitution . He cited precedents of former incipient States , as shewing the direct and previous action of Congress to be necessary even where the applicant for admission had more than the required number of inhabitants . how much more necessary , then , where the applying territory had less than that *numb er , and its 428 // present population not even bona fide settlers , but bands of roving adventurers . Nothing that has as yet been offered , said Mr. CALHOUN , no plans of compromise , can save the Union . Nothing could save it but justice ; simple justice to the South . She had no concessions to make . She had already surrendered so mucb , that she had little left to surrender ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the North , since from their action it alone could come . The South , politically weak , were necessarily passive , and in case of refusal of justice , or indirect action involving a refusal , the South would plainly feel , that before them was submission or resistance . California , then , would become the test question . He declared emphatically , that her admission , under the attendant difficulties , would prove beyond doubt that the real object of the North was power ; and the South would be infatuated not to act accordingly . On the following day , the Senator from Mississippi , Mr. FOOTE , on the part of the South , protested against the ultra views of Mr. CALHOUN . He disclaimed , energetically , the position assumed by that gentleman , that the South demanded , as a sine qua non* , amendment of the Constitution . " I am quite satisfied , " he said , " with the existing provisions of the Constitution , if we can but secure their faithful enforcement . 1 am for the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor an amended Constitution , for which I have been all along contending . The strong ground of the South has been that we seek only what the Constitution entitles us to command ; we ask but justice under the Constitution , and that protection and safety which its provisions were intended to secure . And , Sir , I am not quite prepared to quit this strong ground , by asserting that we of the South will have no settlement of existing difficulties , unless we can effect a modification of the federal compact . " He protested against this requisition of a change in the Constitution , as at present impossible , and the demand for which would be almost equivalent to pronouncing the Union at an end . With regard to Mr. CALHOUN 'S Sweeping denunciations of the whole North as hostile to Southern institutions , he considered such censure as highly unjust to large portions of the free States . " Abolitionists , " he said , " are numerous in most of the States , where slavery does not exist . Free-soilers , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of bawling demagogues scattered through the North , some of whose monstrous voices are heard in the halls of Congress , who are constantly avowing the bitterest enmity to the South , and to Southern institutions . Yet still , Sir , there are many-yea , I doubt not , much the larger part of the Democratic por lion of the North , and many Whigs besideswho , tl*ough they are not the zealous advocates of slavery , and are unable to appreciate the manifold advantages , which we hold to belong to our system of domestic labor , are , notwithstanding , not hostile to it , in the sense in which the term has been obviously employed by the Senator from South Carolina . What , Sir ! shall we say that those who have constantly signalized themselves by defending our domestic institutions against all unjust assailment ; who are zealous upholders of the Constitution and all its guarantees ; who have denounced the Abolitionists from the first , and who still denounce them ; who have never affiliated with the free-soilers , and whose sturdy blows have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat and to disgrace ;  - -  - are these the enemies to our constitutional rights * Are these the persons justly accused o* being hostile to the institution which they have thus defended * No , Sir , no . There are statesmen in the North , to whom the South is as much indebted for the defence of our rights , as to any of her own sons . " Mr. FOOTE then alluded to the recent Union meetings at New York and Philadelphia , and the resolutions there adopted , which would have done no discredit , he said , to any city of the South , and which he , with the exception of a single one , should have voted for most enthusiastically . The letters , too , of the Senators of New York and INlichigan , ( Messrs . CAsS and DIcKENSON , ) read at those meetings , he predicted , would be received with enthusiasm and gratitude throughout the whole South . On the following Thursday , Mr. WEBSTER addressed the Senate as follows : He spoke to-day , he said , not as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a member of the Senate of the United States of a body whose value was shewn in periods like the present , and to which the nation looks with confidence for wisdom , moderation , and stability . The times were troubled . He did not affect to be fit to hold the helm in the.political storm ; but he had a duty before him , which he should perform truthfully , fearfully and hopefully . I speak to-doy , he said , for the preservation of the Union . Mr. WEBsTER then alluded to the sudden and extraordinary events that led to the present crisis : to the war declared against Mexico ; to the piercing of that country , and occupation of her capital by our troops , and of her sea-ports by our marine ; to the treaty thereupon negotiated , and the cession to the United States of a vast territory , reaching from the Pacific and the mountains of California to the frontiers of Texas . The opening of the sea-board of the Pacific to our citizens , he continued , created a 1850. 429 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , and adventurers poured forth in thousands . In a few short years this wilderness has received a population that makes it a subject of legislative consideration to provide for California a proper territorial government . This was not done , and the colonists found it necessary to form a local government for themselves . They have sent Senators and representatives who present the Constitution of the infant State of California , and desire its immediate recognition by the United States . This Constitution contains an express prohibition of slavery ; and it is this prohibition which has chiefly raised the present dispute as to the propriety of her admission . No one will deny , the Senator continued , that whatever were the reasons for the war with Mexico , its purpose was the acquisition of territory ; and no one will deny , that such territory was fully expected from its geographical position , to be the acquisition of the slaveholding'interest of this country . Events have turned out otherwise , and hence the agitation of the vexed question which has so frequently divided our councils . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rise in the earliest ages , to the present day . We find it , he said , among the earliest oriental nations . It existed among the Jews ; their theocratic government made at least no injunction against it . It existed among Greeks ; and the ingenious philosophy of that people justified it on precisely the same grounds assumed at this day , viz , the original inferiority of the black race to the white . The Senator thought the Greek logic faulty . The Romans , also , owned this in*titution , but by a higher philosophy , argue its ustification , and rightly too , from the conventional law of that day , which placed the life and labor of captives of war at the absolute disposal of the captor . Christianity found slavery in full vigor , and no word of reprobation is met in its teachings . It is , then , upon the general tendencies and abstract lawfulness of slavery , the Senator continued , that arises the wide difference of opinion between the two sections of our country . The North consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is , nevertheless , against its spirit ; that it is the offspring of might , not right , and conduces to oppression and selfishness . The Swith , accustomed to this relation from birth , see in it a development of the finest feelings of our nation . And thus , thousands of men of tender consciences , fully as sensitive in the South as in the North , are led to the most opposite conclusions . In this way the question of slavery has at last laid hold of the religious sentiments of mankind ; and wherever discussion arises as such sentiments , all history shews that undue warmth must be expected , In disputes of this kind , men are always to be found who believe that right and wrong can be demonstrated with mathematical clearness ; men who think what is plain to themselves , must be equally so to the moral perception of their neighbors ; men , too , who in the pursuit of one duty , will trample on every other duty in its way ; men who will not wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral disease . In this class , with its want of charity and narrowness of mind , do we find the leaventhat is now fermenting the Union . Partly , then , from the spread of this Pharisaical spirit in the North , and partly in the South from the uprising of a new element , namely , that of interest , public opinion has undergone a complete change ; changed North and changed South . At the time of the adoption of the Constitution , *there was little invective against slavery as a crime ; but all deplored it as an evil , None more so than the men of the South . With truth and with bitterness , they ascribed it to the selfish policy of the mother country , who , to favor the navigator , entailed this blight on the colony . They that dwelt in its midst , were strongest in its execration . A blight they called it , a curse , a mildew . In efforts to prevent its spread , none were more active than the statesmen of the South . The object*on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , was urged by a Southern man . Southern men objected to the great length of time ( twenty years ) to which the importation of slaves was limited by law ; and all , North and South , united in the hope , that with such limitation , slavery would at last die out , and the Constitution in reality , as well as in name , know no slave . Mr. WEBSTER then alluded to the position taken by Mr. CALHOUN , that the ordinance of 1787 , prohibiting slavery from all the territory then owned by the United States , was the first of a series of acts calculated to enfeeble the South . If to enfeeble the South , how , then , was it passed with the entire concurrence of the South * There it stands-the hand and seal of every Southern member of Congress , prohibiting slavery north-west of the Ohio ! the vote of every Southern member of Congress , limiting the importation of slaves in the expressed hope that slavery would thereby become extinct ! What , then , has produced this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blast a wholesome dew ! Mr. WEBSTER attributed it all to the magic influence of cotton . When the Constitution was adopted , this great staple was hardly known . The first ship-load sent to Great Britain was refused admission into her ports , under the treaty , because the United States , it 430 April , // was said , raised no cotton . And now that the South , from raising only ordinary agricultural products , has become the great producer of this staple , she naturally wishes to extend the area of production . Mr. WEBSTER attributed nothing dishonorable to his fellow-citizens of the South . Their motives were mixed . He then spoke of the charge of Mr. CALHOUND that not time and natural causes , but the act of man had increased , and at the expense of the South , the prosperity and rapid growth of the North . If this even were so , he asked , was it time , or the act of man that opened to that sectional interest , Alabama and Florida , the States of Louisiana , Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may have been out-generalled ; it is possible , also , that they were generous and fraternal ; but from whatever cause it arose , the direction of our government has from first to last been under Southern auspices . The event bears out what no one acquainted with the history of our legislation will deny , and as the last of these acts of men , not time , we have illimitable Texas added as a great slave-territory , pledged as such by the most ample guaranties of law  --  and now , he continued , this final act of Northern Legislation for Southern interests , has closed the whole chapter , and settled the whole account , for at this moment there is not a foot of territory belonging to the United States , that is not . stamped as slave or free territory by the law of the land , or by a law higher than that of the land . Texas , to her farthest boundary , has been , by the resolutions of annexation , admitted as a slave State , and her territory as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledged thereto , and that faith , he , for one , meant to uphold . " Those resolutions , " said Mr. WEBSTER , " stipulate and enact that all Texas south 360 30 ,  --  nearly all of it-shall be admitted into the Union as a slave State , and that new States shall be made out of it , and that such States as are formed out of that portion of Texas lying south of 360 30 , may come in as slave States to the number of four , in addition to the States then in existence , and admitted at that time by these resolutions . I know no mode of legislation which can strengthen that . I know no mode of recognition that can add a tittle of weight to it . I listened respectfully to the resolutions of my honorable friend from Tennessee , ( Mr. BELL . ) He proposed to recognize that stipulation with Texas . But any eadditional recognition would weaken the force of it ; because it stands here on the ground of a contract for consideration . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry that contract into effect . A recognition founded on any consideration and any contract would not be so strong as it now stands on the face of the resolution . And , therefore , I say again that , sojar as Texas was concerned-the whole of Texas south of 360 30 which I suppose embraces all the slave territorythere is no land , not an acre , the character of which is not established by law , a law which can not be repealed without the violation of a contract . " But how came the faith of the Government to be thus pledged * How came it that with - in this body , in spite of its preponderance of Northern votes , this Southern measure was carried * By the aid , by the votes of that very Northern Democracy that now are raising the hue and cry of free soil . The very men that fastened slavery on new and boundless regions are now agitating the country with the wrongs of the slave . The very faction that was handand-glove with the slaveholder , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have saddled upon us this unfortunate compact with slavery , and now leave to us the odium of carrying out its provisions ; and carried out they must be ; for I know , he said , of no way , by which this Government acting in good faith , can relieve itself of a stipulation and a pledge , by any honest course of legislation whatever . Texas then , he continued , being marked out by the law of the land , for the forced labor of the black man , a higher law , that of nature , destines California and New Mexico for the free labor of the white . Of Asiatic formation and character , the barren mountains and deserts of these countries possess no attractions for the slaveholder who seeks rich soil , and well-watered plains . If , then , all legislation to entail slavery on New Mexico would be useless , equally useless and ill-judged would be any legislation or Wilmot Proviso , for its prevention . Useless , for it can not strengthen the fiat of God ; illjudged , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an evidence of the conscious power of the North . He wished to inflict no gratuitous insult on Southern feelino's* and in that spirit should vote against the *Vilmot Proviso . Mr. WEBSTER then spoke of the growing exasperation between the free and slave States ; of their mutual reproaches and grievances , real and imaginary . One grievance the South complained of , and with justice : the unwillingness of individuals and legislatures at the North to perform their Constitutional duties in regard to the return of fugitive slaves . And he put to all the sober and sound minds of the North , as a question of morals and conscience , what right have they to embarrass the free exercise of rights secured by the Constitution to the slave owner * He referred *also to the frequent instructions of Northern Legislatures to members of Congress , on the means of abolishing slavery in the States . He thought State *Legislatures had 1850 . J 431 // nothing to do with that question , neither did he believe in the principle of instructions . Wherever the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , he should obey her instructions with gladness as a duty ; but wherever the question affected the interests of other parts of the Union , he should feel called upon to act , not as a citizen of any particular State , but as a member of the General Government . Another grievance complained of by the South , was ih e abolition societies of the North . He did not deny to these societies conscientious motives . He thought them composed of good and honest men , but with excited feelings and perverted views . Their philanthropy did harm to its objects . Their well-intentioned efforts drew tighter the bonds of the slave . The North* too , was not without its list of injuries , and sources of unkind feeling . The change of Southern sentiment and action since the adoption of the constitution ; the violent tirades against Northern character and institutions ; the scornful comparisons of slave labor , with all its abject ignorance , with the educated and independent white laborer . " Why , who are the laborers of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are the people who cultivate their own farms with their own hands ; freeholders , educated men , independent men . Let me say , sir , that fivesixths of the whole property of the North is in the hands of the laborers of the North ; they cultivate their farms , they educate their children , they provide the means of independence ; if they are not freeholders , they earn wages , these wages accumulate , are turned into capital , into new freeholds , and small capitalists are created . That is the case . And what can these people think , when even Senatis undertake to prove that the absolute ignorance and abject slavery of the South is more in conformity with the high purposes of immortal , rational , human beings , than the educated , the independent free laborers of the North 3 " So far as these mutual grievances are matters of law , they should and can be redressed . So far as they are matters of opinion , a more charitable and fraternal feeling is their only cure . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouted the idea of peaceable secession . Secession there might be , but it would be violent . It would be re*olution . The foundations of order and society would be overturned . And how was it to be done 3 Where was the line to be drawn 3 The States planted along the banks of the Mississippi and its tributaries , and made one nation by that great stream ,  --  how were they to be forced asunder 3 " What has the wildest enthusiast to say on the possibility of cutting off that river , and leaving free States at its source and its branches , and slave States d6wn near its mouth 3 Pray , sir ; pray , sir , let me say to the country that these things are worthy of their pondering and of their consideration . Here , sir , are five millions of freemen in the free States north of the river Ohio ; can any body suppose that this population can be severed by a line that divides them from the territory of a foreign and an alien government , down somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mississippi 3 What would become of Missouri 3 Will she join the arondissement of the slave States 3 Shall the man from the Yellowstone and the Mad River be connected in the new republic with the man who lives on the southern extremity of the Cape of Florida 3 Sir , I am ashamed to peruse this line of remark . I dislike it ; I have an utter disgust for it . I would rather hear of natural blasts and mildews , war , pestilence and famine , than to hear gentlemen talk of secession . To break up 3 to break up this great government ; to dismember this great country ; to astonish Europe by an act of folly , such as Europe for two centuries has never beheld in any government 3 No , sir ; no sir ! there will be no secession . Gentlemen are not serious when they talk of secession . " In conclusion , Mr. WEBSTER stated , that any scheme proposed by Southern gentlemen for the mitigation of the admitted evils of slavery , would meet with his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States , has yielded to its treasury eighty millions of dollars . Should the residue be sold at the same rate , the aggregate sum would exceed two hundred millions of dollars . Out of this sum of money could be defrayed the expenses of a large scheme of colonization , to he carried on by the Government , by which means the South could relieve itself of their free colored population . Any proposal of this sort would meet with his full co-operation . " And now , " said , he , " instead of speaking of the possibility or utility of secession , let us rather cherish those hopes that belong to us ; let us devote ourselves to those great objects that are fit for our consideration and our action ; let us raise our conceptions to the magnitude and the importance of the duties that devolve upon us ; let our comprehension be as broad as the country for which we act , our aspirations as high as its certain destiny ; let us not be pigmies in a case that calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , higher trusts than now devolve upon us for the preservation of this Constitution , and the harmony and peace of all who are destined to live under it . It is a great , popular Constitutional Government , guarded by legislation , by law , by judicature , and defended by the 432 April , // whole affections of the people . No monarchical throne presses these States together ; no iron chain of despotic power encircles them . They live and stand upon a Government popular in its form , representative in its character , founded upon principles of equality , and calculated , we hope , to last forever . In all its history it has been beneficent ; it has trodden down no man 's liberty ; it has crushed no State . It has been in all its influences , benevolent , beneficent ; promoting the general glory , the general renown , and , at last , it has received a vast addition of territory . Large before , it has now , by recent events , become vastly larger . This republic now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two great seas of the world wash the one and the other shore . On l'Ionday , March 11 , Mr. SEWARD having the floor , addressed the Senate . He commenced his remarks by reviewing the objections raised to the admission of California . First , California comes among us without previous consent of Congress , and , therefore , by usurpation . This allegation he thought not strictly true , for we tore her from among her sister Mexican States , and stipulated to admit her with due speed among the States of the Union . But still , by the letter , she does come without previous consent of Congress . So did Michigan ; and Congress waived the irregularity and sanctioned the precedent . This precedent is strengthened by the greater hardships in the case of California . With Michigan , Congress had merely neglected to take the census . With California , she neglected to act up to the treaty . Michigan had a civil government . California was under military rule ; and military governments are against We genius of our institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent State . Would those , he asked , who cite this objection , be better pleased with a territorial charter , which could in no ways be granted without an inhibition of Slavery * The second objection , pursued the Senator , is that California had marked her own boundaries . But none had been marked for her either by previous law or prescription . She was obliged to assume them , since without boundaries she must have remained unorganized . A third objection is raised to the great size of this new State . But there is already one State in the Union of greater rnagnitudt than California . She may be divided , too , with her own consent ; and this is all the security we have against the preponderance of Texas . Her only neighbor , Oreo*on , makes no complaint of encroachment , and t'i* e advantage , if any , proceeding from her vast area , will be with the rest of the Union ; for the larger the Pacific States , the less will be their relative power in the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural features of the country ; and the territory circumscribed , contiguous and compact . The fourth objection to her admission is , that no previous census had been taken , and no laws existed prescribing the suffrage and apportionment of representatives in convention . But she was left without a census , and without such laws . She was left to act ab initio . Some of the electors , too , it is said , may have been aliens . The Pilgrim Fathers commenced in like manner on board the May Flower ; and when they landed on Plymouth Rock were in like manner aliens . But this objection will surely fall , if her Constitution is satisfactory to herself and to the United States . Not a murmur of discontent has followed it from California ; and as regards ourselves , we find that her boundaries have been assigned with discretion , that the public domain has been secured to the General Government , that the representation is just and equal , and that the Constitution is thoroughly republican . In fact , it is this very republicanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the real objection with her opponents . The fifth objection is , that California comes in under executive influences ; first in her coming in as a free State ; and second , in her coming in at all . The first charge is unsupported by proofs , and is peremptorily denied . The second is true , and a venial fault it is for the Executive to wish to resign power and influence into the hands of regular legislative authority . These objections , the Senator continue d are all , it will he seen , technical ; not founded in the law of nature or of nations , surely not in the Constitution ; for the Constitution prescribes no form of proceeding in the admission of new States , but leaves the whole to the discretion of Concrress . " Congress may admit new States . " but it is said we should now establish new precedents for the future . This caution comes too late . It should have been exercised when we annexed Texas , when we hurried into the war with Mexico , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedents at pleasure , but our successors will use their pleasure in following them . States and nations certainly follow not precedent , either in the time or the circumstances of their birth . California sprang from the head of the nation , full-armed and fullgrown ; and ripe fot affiliation . Having now reviewed the objections , the Senator proceeded to give his reasons for the admission of California . Well-established calculations prove that , one hundred years hence , the aggregate population of this nation will be two hundred *llions , or one-fourth of 1850. 433. // the present population of the globe . This is based upon the present rate of increase . But the mountains of California contain gold and silver , and those of New England granite ; and we are safe in affirming , that long before that maximum of numbers shall be reached , our possessions on the Pacific , from their swifter advance of population , will be peopled , and politically and socially matured . Shall , then , this great people , one in origin , religion , interests , sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two conflicting and hostile republics 3 Shall this new world , containing all the elements of wealth and of empire , marked out by Providence for the development of man 's self-control and self-government , renovating Europe on the one hand . and the decreptitude of Asia on the other , shall it desert its duties , and cast away its magnificent destinies iii the dissensions of divided sway 3 On the decision of the present day , the present hour , hangs the perpetual unity of this empire . California is already a State , complete and fully appointed . She never can be less . She never can shrink back into a federal dependency . Shall she then be taken into the bosom of the Union , or shall she be driven from among us 3 Reject her now , and she will never return . Forced apart by our policy , would independence have no charms for her 3 Are not power and aggrandizement before her on the coast of the Pacific 3 Your armies can not pass the desert , nor over the remote and narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navies might reach her , but her mines would turn them to her own defence . Oregon would go with her , and thus the entire Pacific coast would drop from your grasp . And wher* the long line should be drawn , dividing the empires of the West and the East , would depend neither on California nor on ourselves . The interests and convenience of the agricultural masses , filling up this vast area , would decide that question . Trade is now the God of boundaries ; his decrees no man can foretell . But , it is said , let California be admitted , but attended by a compromise of questions arising out of slavery . All compromise , the Senator argued , was wrong and inconsistent with real virtue and sincerity of purpose-and what , too , are the equivalents such compromise offers 3 Power , freedom , weah* on the Pacific ; bondage in the rest of the new territory , and in the District of Columbia ; and stringent laws for the arrest of . fugitive slaves in the free States . Human freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. SEWARD pursued , to the compromise , on the score of the incongruity *of the interests to be compromised . California shoul* be admitted , being a free State ; she also should be received , had she been a slave State . This , the circumstances of her rise , and the inevitable dismemberment resulting from refusal , would render just and necessary . The questions connected with slavery , thus interposed , are consequently collateral , and present false issues . Morc over , said Mr. SEWARD , I can not consent to the compromise , because this compromise fails to meet the whole claims of the South . They demand the restoration of an equilibrium between the slave and free sections . Such equilibrium , he insisted , never did , and never can exist . Every political balance of power requires a physical basis . The basis , in the present case , must be an equality of territory , and a proximate equality in the number of slaves and freemen . These the South have irrecoverably lost . Were it even practicable , without this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple confederacy , in which the minority have a veto on the majority . Nor would success attend the details of this compromise . Mr. SEWARD went on to speak of the proposed alteration of the law concerning fugitives from labor . " I shall speak on this , " he said , " as on all subjects , with due respect , but yet frankly and without reservation . The Constitution contains only a compact which rests for its execution on the States . Not content with this , the slave States induced legislation by Congress ; and the Supreme Court of the United States have virtually decided that the whole subject is within the province of Congress , and exclusive of State authority . Nay , they have decided that slaves are to be regarded not merely as persons to be claimed , but as property and chattels to be seized without any legal authority or claim whatever . The compact is thus subverted by the procurement of the slave States . With what reason , then , can they expect the States , ex gracia , to reassume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharged . I say , then , to the slave States , you are entitled to no more stringent laws ; and such laws would be useless . The inefficiency of the present statute , he said , lay not in its leniency , hut in its violation of the primary laws of God . It made hospitality a crime , and the human being a chattel ; and it denied the citizen all the safeguards of personal freedom , to impede the escape of the bondsman . With respect to the other concession , proposed for the purchase of freedom in California , the bill of peace for slavery in the District of Columbia , Mr. SEWARD avowed himself uncompromisingly opposed to such peace . Congress had absolute power in the matter , and he could not see that any implied obligation ex 484 April , // isted not to use that power . He saw no reason to hope for such emancipation , but he should vote for the measure whenever proposed , and was willing to appropriate any means necessary to carry it into execution . Mr. SEWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery the fugitive , or against the inhibition of slavery in territorial charters . The temper of the people might be tried too far . The spring , if pressed too hard , would give a recoil that would not leave here one servant who knew his master 's will and did it not . He then spoke of the suggested compromise of boundary between Texas and New Mexico . This was a question of legal right and title , and it was due to national dignity and justice that it be kept separate from compromises of mere expediency , and should be settled by itself alone . In connexion with this question , he stated , he could not agree with the Senator from Massachusetts with regard to the obligation of Congress to admit four new slave States from Texas territory . When once formed , these States can come in as free or slave States at their own choice ; but such formation depends entirely on the will of Congress . He denied the Constitutionality of the annexation of Texas . He found no authority in the Constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution of Congress , and no power adequate to the purpose , but the treaty-making power of the President and Senate . Another objection to compromise , he continued , arises out of the principle on which the demand for compromise rests . That principle o*sumes the class fi cation of the States as Northern and Southern , as slave and free States. , Severally equal , the classes must be equal . To each of these classes , the new territory , being a common acquisition , falls in equal proportions . On what , then , does this argument for the equality of the States rest * On the syllogism that all men are by the law of nature and nations equal ; and States are aggregations of individual men , and thereby equal . But if all men are equal , slavery with its claims , falls to the ground . You answer , the Constitution recognizes property in slaves . But this Constitutional recognition must be void , for it is repugnant to the laws of nature and of nations , on which the Constitution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consttitution recognized slaves . It never mentions slaves as slaves , much less as chattels , but as persons . That this recognition of them as persons , was designed , is a historical fact . But granting the original equality of the States , and granting the recognition of slavery , still the argument fails . The Constitution is not the ConstitutiGn of the States , but of the people . of the United States . There is another aspect , he then said , in which this principle of compromise must be examined . These boundless Western domains are ours ; but ours only in trust for our fellow men . They are the birthright of mankind . Shall we who are founding institutions for future generations , shall we who know by experience the wise and just , and are free to choose them , and to rej*ct the erroneous and unjust , shall we fasten bondage on countless millions , or permit it by our sufferance to be established * Mr. SEWARD then commented on arguments founded on extraneous considerations . The first of these is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery within the territories . But Congress , he argued , may admit new States . It follows that Congress may reject new States . The greater includes the less ; and , therefore , Congress may impose conditions of admission . The right , too , to legislate and administer justice in regard to property is assumed in every territorial charter ; and if to legislate concerning property , why not concerning personal rights * and freedom is a personal right . But granting , it is said , the right , still legislation is unnecessary , for climate and sterility , the physical laws of God , lay a stronger injunction on slavery than any laws of man . Have climate and sterility , he asked , barred out slavery from arctic Russia * Did it not once brood over the length and breadth of Europe * and was not the enslaved race our own , and such as our own , the vigorous Anglo-Saxon , instead of the docile African * The laws of God may be transgressed . " Sir , " said he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , it is*less productive than free labor in many Northern countries . But so it is less productive than free white labor in even tropical climates . Labor is quick in demand in all new countries . Slave labor is cheaper than free labor , and will go first into new regions ; and wherever it goes , it brings labor into dishonor , and , therefore , free white labor avoids competition with it . Sir , I might rely on climate if I had not been born in a land where slavery existed ; and this land was all of it North of the fortieth parallel of latitude ; and , if I did not know the struggle it has cost , and which is yet going on to get complete relief from the institution and . its baleful consequences . I desire to propound this question to those who are now in favor of dispensing with the Wilmot Proviso-was the ordinance of 1787 necessary or not * Necessary , we all agree . It has received too many eulogiums to be now decried as an idle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended the inhibition of slavery from the 37th to the 40th parallel of north latitude , and now we are told that the inhibition named is unnecessary anywhere north of 36Q 30 . " We are told that we may rely upon the laws of God , which prohibit slavery north of that line and that it iA absurd to re-enact the laws of God . Sir , there is no human enactment , which is Just , that is not a re-enactment of the law of God . The Constitution of the United States , and the Constitution of every State are full of such re-enactments . Wherever 1 find a law of God , or a law of nature disregarded , or in danger of being disregarded , then I shall vote to reaffirm it with all the sanction of the civil authority . But I find no authority for the position that climate prevents slavery anywhere . It is to the indolence of mankind , and not the natural necessity , that introduces slavery in any climate . " Finally , Mr. SEWARD thought too much weight might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dissolution of the Union . Their violence , he said , was natural in a losing party who saw their side of the scales kick the beam . But there was a love of his country in the breast of every American citizen , which sectional feelings might dim , but never destroy . He knows no other country and no other sovereign . He has life , liberty , and property , precious affections and hopes for himself treasured up in the ark of the Union . Let those , then , he concluded , who distrust the Union , make com* romises to save it . He had no such fears imself , and consequently should vote for the admission of California , directly , without conditions , without qualifications , and without compromise . As * commentary on the above speeches , we give the following abstract of a letter published in a Mississippi paper . It shews that even peaceable secession will have its attendant dangers to the South ; and that forces are now at work to lead a Southern confederacy to subsequent disunion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ample for the proper protection of property 3 Are their individual interests sufficiently guarded , in case that direst of calamities , a separation of these United States , should occur in the pending contest on the Wilmot Proviso 3 Is the farther introduction of slaves from other States , politic or safe , and is not the prohibition of such farther introduction deftianded both on the score of individual and of State interest , and as concerns the permanent legitimate weal of the Southern domestic institution 3 The stability of property depends on its uniform value and proper protection hy law . Slave property above all others , is considered the most delicate and most , in need of such protection . To unsettle its stability , would be to destroy or depreciate its value . Any rash measure tending to destroy its domestic feature is to be deprecated ; and this can only be preserved by maintaining its value . On these depend its permanence . On its permanence , the destiny of the Southern States . Out of the fifteen slaveholding States , two , Delaware and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rest ; and , from the course taken by the Senators of Missouri and Kentucky , we are led to infer , that these States are distracted , and emancipation not distant . A proof and a consequence of this is found in the fact , that droves of slaves , by hundreds and thousands , are now on their way from the latter State , to this and others of the cotton and sugar growing States . Now , is it , this writer proceeds to say , the interest of Mississippians to encourage this state of things * Shall the domestic character of the institution be degraded , and its intrinsic value be suffered to depreciate by the sudden introduction of surplus slaves from other States 3 Shall our present effective and happy municipal regulations for the treatment and management of slaves b* uprooted , and Mississippi converted into a camp , paraded daily by Provost guards and patrols to prevent insurrection 3 Thousands of wretched , despairing human creatures , torn rudely from home , from family , and from cherished local associations , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon infect those now living here with their rancorous and seditious spirit . We can not at this day throw aside all considerations of humanity in the vain attempt to display an overwrought zeal in behalf of our cherished institution . Its worst enemies are they who abuse it . Its real friends are not dead to all sensations of sympathy as regards the family attachments *and social condition of our negroes . And what will be the result 3 The picture here contemplated , the writer continues , brings before the mind the frightful scenes of the British and French West India Islands . Daily apprehensions , hourly vigilance , jealous suspicions , groups of white men , shrinking with fear , hordes of sullen and desperate blacks-these are the ground-work of that wretched scenery . And shall such things be seen in Mississippi 3 Shall the horizon be darkened with a cloud charged with such pernicious elements 3 Shall her property be cut down to one-half its value , that speculators and traders only shall flourish 3 To this one fact , the writer attributed the apparent mystery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , annually , nigh twenty millions worth of products . It is notorious , he says , that in Mississippi there is 436 April , // less to captivate the eye of a visitor , less to ensure permanent local attachments , fewer proud associations , less to offer by way of emulous comparison , and less to invite available investments , than in any other Southern State . Nothing but the character of the people sustains her position , and commands respect . Nor must this state of things he attributed alone to financial derangement , or mismanagement . The cause is found in the source above suggested . Of the aggregate returns from the sale of her products , onehalf is disbursed on New Orleans , or Mobile , and the other half is carried off b* negro traders from Tennessee , Virginia , or North Carolina . This is destructive beyond compensation , and will , in the end , beggar the State and its citizens . But , apart from pecuniary considerations , the writer urges , is it politic , or safe , under present circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State 3 We are threatened with dissolution of the Union . Congress is convulsed , and a kind of demi-revolution seems preparing . Should not the aggrieved States , then , contemplating the possibility of secession , be ready , at all points , for the result 3 Should not Mississippi pause in her deceptive and profitless policy , to husband her resources , and expend her wealth at home 3 In revolutionary times , a sudden accession of inflammable materials is dangerous in the extreme . No material is so inflammable as a horde of slaves , fresh from the traders manacles , torn recently from family , and home , and early associations , discontented , corruptible , unreliable ,  --  thrust suddenly into our midst , ere yet system and familiarity have reconciled them to their new homes . These very domestic ties and feelings form the real value of our institution . The blacks have them , and every intelligentplanter sedulously cultivates them . In times like this , then , harshly and rudely to sever them , is there no danger in such a course 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , politically , of his own State , to hold those States , which now so strongly manifest a desire to emancipate , to the slave interest , by refusing them opportunities of sale and profit . They will certainly hesitate , before they resort to colonization or manumission , and he urges the enforcement of the laws against the importation of slaves , which have been suffered to become a dead letter . Disunion received the following severe rebuke at the hands of Governor BROWN of Florida . That gentleman had been invited by the Florida delegation in Congress , to use his official authority in organizing a plan of representation for that State in the proposed Nashville convention . Governor BRowN in reply , disclaimed all authority for that purpose . He considered such a convention asrevolutionary in its tendency , and directly against the spirit of the Constitution of the United States , and if the object of this convention be redress of grievances , would not , he asks , the expression of an opinion , or a determination by the States in their sovereign capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more respect than the proceedings of an irresponsible convention of delegates 3 But , it is answered , the States have already acted by reports and resolutions and addresses ; and the North remains unmoved . What more then can this convention effect , unless it is to be considered , and considers itself a revolutionary body 3 " If called for this end , " he says , " I most solemnly protest against it . The time has not arrived for such measures , and I pray God the time may never arrive . There are , however , restless spirits among us , who have calculated the value of the Union , and would sell it for a mess of pottage . Since the Southern convention has been projected , a Southern confeder .. ation has been more than dreamed of . " He questioned the expediency of getting up this convention , before any overt act of agression had been committed on Southern rights . He saw , as yet , nothing new or startling in the relation of the slave and free States ; at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than fifty years have abolition petitions heen presented in Congress . Thirty years ago , this identical Wilmot Proviso question convulsed the Government to its centre . From the time , he writes , that the slave question first made its appearance in the North , when it was a " little cloud like a man 's hand ; ' until the present moment , when it casts a deep gloom over the future , it has been one continual conflict of words between the abolitionists and agitators and politicians of the North , and the politicians of the South . Time has brought forth no wisdom-experience no knowledge . But in spite of mutual bluster and threats , he believed the Union would safely weather the storm . He found one assurance of safety in the fact , that the present chief magistrate of the Union , was from and of the South ; and he was confident that every encroachment on the bulwarks of the Constitution , would be by him met with native energy and resolution . In conclusion , Governor BROWN exhorted the people *of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their State Governments to guard and protect their rights and interests ; and the members in both halls of Congress , to meet and resist with prudence and firmness , every attempt to break down the guards and compromises of the Constitution , from whatever source it may come ; and when driven to the last trench , and beat down by brute 1850.
