HON. JAMES W. DENVER , OF CALIFORNIA . THE subject of this sketch was born in Frederick County , Virginia , on the 23d of October , 1817. lie is of Irish ancestry . His grandfather , Patrick Denver , took an active part in the Rebellion of 98 , and was forced to flee to this country , to avoid the penalty which his patriotism would have had to pay the British Government . He landed first at New York , and thence went to the Valley of Virginia . Here the father of our subject married Jane Campbell , the daughter of William Campbell , who was also a native of Ireland . His father served in the War of 1812 , and was stationed for some time at Norfolk . His uncle , Arthur Denver , was in the naval service during the last war , and wa* one of the men taken in the Chesapeake Bay , and confine&amp;at Halifax by British authority , to be sent to England on trial for treason , on the ground that his allegiance was due to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His uncle on his mother 's side , James Campbell , fell at the battle of North Point . Descended from such stock , it is not strange that his life , though not yet much advanced , has been an eventful one . Our subject is the oldest of eleven children . At thirteen years of age , he moved to Clinton Co. , Ohio , with his father and family , and there was brought up on a farm . Utterly prostrated by rheumatism , when he had just reached his majority , and incapacitated thereby for the avocation of a farmer , he , after teaching school one year in Missouri , the proceeds of which enabled him to turn his attention to the law , graduated at the Cincinnati Law School in 1844 . During the summer of that year he edited a Democratic campaign paper at Xenia in Ohio . The next spring he removed to Missouri and located at Plattsburg , and the year thereafter removed to Platte City in that state , where he remained until 1847 . During this year President Polk appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This regiment was constituted of companies from North Carolina , South Carolina , Texas , Arkansas , and Missouri . His company , though the farthest distant from the rendezvous at New Orleans , was the first to reach it . At Vera Cruz he had a severe attack of yellow f*ver , from // which he did not recover until his removal to California three years afterwards . Though reduced to a mere shadow by this disease , his ambition led him to keep lip and perform severe duties imposed upon him , which increased his prostration to such an extent as to prevent his taking part in the battles in the Valley of Mexico , at all of which he was present . This was the most mortifying event in the life of Gem . Denver . He had gone to the war in pursuit of that distinction which is the object of a true soldier 's ambition . Providence , however , was cruel to him , and would not permit his frail body to take him where his brave heart led him . After the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argus , pnblished at Platte City . Up to that time he had regarded Col. Benton as the synonyme of a perfect democrat . Being himself a democrat of the State Rights School , from which faith he has never swerved , he could not overlook Col. Benton 's refusal to obey the instructions of the Missouri Legislature in 184* , and he made , through the columns of his paper , a respectful but vigorous war against him . In 1850 he crossed the plains to California , stopping two weeks at Salt Lake City* Crossing the great desert from the Humboldt to Carson River , the cholera broke out and raged with such violence as to destroy eight of his party of thirtyfour . He himself was attacked by it , but was amongst the lucky survivors . He reached Sacramento in September , where the same epidemic was also making the most fearful ravages . He remained there until the first of March , 1851 , when he moved to the northern mines and engaged in trading between Humboldt Bay and the mines . Whilst in this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardships . The next summer , without consulting him , the people took him up and elected him State Senator . The counties which he was elected to represent were larger than the State of Massachusetts , and yet upon one week 's notice of his candidacy he was triumphantly returned . In 1852 , whilst the Legislature was in session , it was reported that a very large number of emigrants , crossino ' the plains to California , were poorly prepared for such a trip* and that great sufferings must necessarily ensue . Twenty-five thousand dollars was appropriated by the Legislature to furnish provisious to relieve them . Gen. Denver , then a senator , was appointed by Gov . Bigler to superintend the distribution of the fund , and act as head of the relief train . Mr. Edward Gilbert , an ex-member of Congress from California , at that time editor of the Alta Ualifornia , being then in Sacramento , wrote and published an article reflecting // 9 severely , and , as the parties belonging to the expedition believed , unjustly , upon Governor Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Denver and the other members of the relief train , vindicating the Governor from the aspersions of Mr. Gilbert , and themselves from the insinuation of a cognizant connexion with the venality attributed by him to the purposes of the expedition . Mr. Gilbert rejoined in an illtempered and abusive article , reflecting upon each member of the expedition , concluding with the significant suggestion that if anything was wanting , it was well known where he could be found . General Denver , having left the expedition temporarily at Carson Valley and returned to Sacramento , published a card in reply to Mr. Gilbert 's editorial , in which lie repelled its imputations in a proper and becoming manner , and suggested in reply to Mr. Gilbert 's threatening Ihim , as4o where he could be found , that it was Mr. Gilbert 's place to do the finding , and not that of any member of the expedition to look after him . Mr. Gilbert then addressed General Denver a note , demanding the withdrawal of the card , which the latter declined doing until the editorials were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Denver had always been ? ppos*d to duelling , and had accommodated every difficulty in which he had been called on to act as a friend . This was , however , one of those cases in which the invitation could not be declined by him . Mr. Gilbert had commenced the assault . Gen. Denver pointed out to him the way in which the card could be withdrawn-by the withdrawal of the editorials which had caused it . Instead of doing this , or at least leaving some room for further negotiation to lead to adjustment , Mr. Gilbert precluded all possibility of any settlement by inviting Gen. Denver peremptorily to the field . They fought on the 2nd of August , 1852 , at daylight , with rifles at forty yards . Mr. Gilbert had the choice of ground and the word . Gen. Denver threw away his first fire . This being evident , he supposed it would terminate the meeting . He did so upon the impression that Mr. Gilbert had no blood-thirsty object in view , and did not desire to push it to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Denver moved off from the ground , not deeming that it would be pressed further . He was attracted by his surgeon calling his attention to the fact that the seconds were reloading the pieces . Gen. Denver then returned to the ground , and was informed that Mr. Gilbert demanded another fire . His purpose now could not be mistaken . He was bound by all custom to have expressed himself satis // fled . Instead of this , after Gen. Denver threw away his fire , and a voided achance to take his life , he demanded another shot . They then resumed their position . Mr. Gilbert deliberately took aim . They fired almost simultaneously , Gen. Denver shooting Mr. Gilbert , killing him instantly . It was not his intention to have killed him . He desired to wound him so as to preclude injury to himself-Mr . Gilbert being bent upon a perseverance in shooting . Owing , however to the incorrectness of one of the sights , he was foiled , and the death of his antagonist was the result . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Gilbert was not . This is not so . The latter , on account of his profession as an editor subjecting him to the calls of the dueUo , was in constant prac* tice . On the contrary , Gen. Denver , though at one time accustomed to the use of the rifle , had not fired one for tWo years . He would not practise at all previous to the meeti4zg , and had not seen the rifle with which he fought until the night before . One of the sights was broken , and a gunsmith was that night employed to put it on . This he did not do very accurately , and to this Mr. Gilbert 's death is no doubt attributable . Mr. Gilbert was a much esteemed man , and his loss was deeply mourned ; but his death was due to his own improper course , and did not affect Gen. Denver 's popularity . After the duel , Gen. Denver went back to the relief train , and went out to aid the poor emigrants who were suffering on the plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meantime the expedition , travelling many hundreds of miles , and he with them , suffering the severest hardships , saving hundreds of emigrants who were in the greatest destitution , and enabling them to reach their destination , which they otherwise would not have been enabled to do . Upon his return from the expedition , it was discovered that the appropriation made for it had been overdrawn . Gen. Denver , to enable the Governor to settle his account , declined a cent for his services , and gave the state a receipt in full for the amount justly due him . He has never since received anything from the state of California on that account . The next spring he was appointed Secretary of State , an office originally of but little importance , but which by the action of the Legislature had swollen into one of vast magnitude . He discharged this position to the satisfaction of the people of the entire state . Whilst Secretary of State he was re-nominated by the Demo .. cratic party for a seat in Congress , and elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver . 97 General Denver entered the House of IRepresentatives at the beginning of the Thirty-fourth Congress . It will be recollected the condition of parties in the House prevented an organization for more than two months . It is needless to say that he stood with that Spartan band of Democrats , who for eight weeks , without the power to elect a Speaker of their own politics , presented a solid phalanx struggling to defeat the election of a IRepublican Speaker . Believing that such a result , no matter how accomplished , would be the severest blow ever struck at the country , he declined to unite in passing the plurality rule , which resulted in Mr. Banks ' election . During his term in Congress General Deuver was Chairman of the Select Committee on the Pacific Rail Road . He labored in that position to promote the construction of two roads to the Pacific . The bill which he reported provided for the construction of three roads , that number favoring the views of a majority of the Committee . He was unceasing in his efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory was , to so locate the initial point of each road as to interest the greatest amount of existing railroad capital in their construction , and his efforts having attracted the attention of that interest would have insured its construction ; but a majority of the House , at that session , were against any Pacific Railroad , and the bill did not get to a vote . General Denver also served as an efficient member of the Committee on Military Affairs , lending , by his experience , wise counsel in the moulding of the military legislation of the country . During his term in Congress , he struck a blow at a vast scheme of plunder , which deserves for him a lasting commemnoration . The Board of Land Commissioners in California had confirmed many of those gigantic claims , the recent exposure of which has developed to the public the facility with which the *nost fictitious array of evidence can be constructed to acquire in California title to vast amounts of landed property , making millionaires of its concoctors , and destroying good titles to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners of California land claims , assembled a large and influential lobby to pass a bill confirming the titles to all the grants which had been approved by the Board of Commissioners . The effect of this was to take from the Government the right of appeal to the United States Circuit and Supreme Courts , as provided for in the act creating the Board of Commissioners . Many of those corrupt schemes had eluded the vigilance of the Land Commissioners , and received a confirmation of their titles . Their pro-7 // 98 Biographical Sketches . April , jectors knew that the chances of their detection were great under the scrutiny of an investigation before the District Ceurt , and then , if they were affirmed there , before the Supreme Court of the United States . Under the delusive pretext that litigation was destroying California , and that , by passing a bill confirming in one swoop the action of the Land Coimnissioners , the title to lands in California would be settled , and the motive for investment , on account of its security , would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this measure to confirm fraud , came very nigh succeeding . A committee of the House , believing the measure to be a just one , reported a bill to that end , which was about being forced through under the operation of the previous question , when General Denver appealed to the body to desist until he , as one of the representatives of California , could be heard against it . His appeals prevailed . The bill was postponed . The subject caine up again on the 3O*h of July , 1856 , when General Denver addressed the Hobse with great force and effect for an hour . It was the first time that any public man in this country had announced and maintained the doctrine of the Spanish law , that the minerals constituted an attribute of the eminent domain , and were not covered by the title to the land beneath which they might be located . Upon this point he remarked : " The regulations of the crown of Spain embraced all minerals , of whatever character . They also constituted the mining laws of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the laws of the crown of Spain and the supreme government of iMexico , in order to protect those particular rights of the sovereign power , to make any reserve of the minerals which might exist within a grant made to an individual . Those grants were always made tortowns agricultural and grazing , or mining purposes . This was the known and established policy of the country . The lands of Mexico were always treated by the sovereign power with the view to a two-fold relation and intercst . The one was agricultural and grazing , the oilier mining . The latter was peculiarly considered as to revenue , and no fee-simple to it was ever made to an individual . The subject or citizen who obtained the land took that , and that only , subject to all these rights  --  the limitations and conditions of the mining regulations . All the lands which might prove to contain minerals were liable to be denounced and taken up by a stranger , if he were first to discover them . The same general principle applied to mines which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lands where minerals were found was entitled to an appraised value , to be fixed to them as agricultural or grazing lands , and no more and no less . The great object was to encourage mining . The policy was developed in the reign of Philip II. , when the power and mining resources of Spain were at their height . That policy has never been changed ; and no minerals have ever been passed in fee-simple to individuals by grants of land , unless by express declarations to that effect , none of which are found in grants for lands in California . They there remained in the sovereign . They passed in the cession of the Territory of Call . forimia to the supreme government of the United States , and can vest in no // 1859 . James W. Denver . individual to whom grants were made by the crown of Spain or by the supreme government of Mexico , without being first divested out of the United States in the specific form of release made and intended to operate as title conferred for minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no title to minerals , and hold none , except such as was held by them in common with every other citizen . The confirmation by the commissioners and courts of the United States conferred no new title . They could add nothing . Their judgment was as to the regularity and legality of the grants solely , and would go the extent , simply , and no further , of the laws of the crown of Spain an ( l of the supreme govcrnment of Mexico . There is nothing in the act of Congress b ' * which that commission was created which either does , or was intended to , change the laws of Mexico on this subject . The rule is , that they shall take by the laws of the crown of Spain , or of the supreme government of Mexico , and by their authority they hold , and by none other . They receive from them great benefits . If they do not , under the treaty , form the sole authority under which they hold , then the United States would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been granted to them down to a size suited to our institutions and our policy . But if they are protected by the laws of the crowmi of Spain and of the supreme government of Mexico agiinst that , then so are they likewise limited and restrained froni taking more than those laws allowed them . " Such has been , as I think , the sound and just policy of the crown of Spain , and of*he supreme government of Mexico , considering that it was the only limitation and restraint placed upon those vast grants to individuals , which , by a single stroke of the pen , transferred men from * ) overty to immense wealth , and created distinctions and benefits between theta and their fellow countrymen , which are established usually only by mnonarchies . " Under the policy of those laws , any citizen had a right to make discoveries of minerals on private lands , to denounce them , and to work them . If the mines were ever abandoned or forfeited by him , they did not , even then , revert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had no more interest in them than a stranger . They reverted to the possession of the supreme government , and might l ) *SS to him who would first denounce them afterwards . So , also , where mines were abandoned and not worked during a certain length of time in each year , they were liable to be denounccd and taken by others . And in all cases in which mines were denounced and taken , whetimer by discovery or forfeiture , they were subject to the regula* tions prescribed for the government of the mnines . " The mines were thus treated by the crown of Spain and by the supreme government of Mexico as the peculiar patrimnony of the State , which never had been and never was intended to be alienated . With the Territory recently acquired by the treaty of 1848 , they have so passed into the l ) possession of the government of the United States . It is known that they are valuable and numerous . Our sole ol*ject should be their development by private enterprise , by placing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found on time public lands as- free as possible , and giving vitality to the laws in force at the time the grants were made , and which were a part of the conditions . In this way they v* ill assist efficiently in the settlement of the country , and contribute , most largely , to the general welfare of the whole nation . " The importance of this doctrine to the sccurity* of the rights of miners who held no grants , can not be too highly estimated . The speech attained a great circnlation in California , and // planted hope in the hearts of the many thousand hard-working men who have developed the vast resources of that State , that there is a law to leave them in their rights against the iiinovations of the cormorants , who , by the fraudulent acquisition of grants , expected to prey and feast upon their hard earnings . General Denver , in this speech , boldly denounced the Bolton and Barron Claim , the Imantour Claim , and others of the same ilk , as absolute fraud . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agent of the Government sent out to California , has unveiled the scheme of corruption , and by irrefutable testimony , proves the character of many of these claims , asserted for them by General Denver , to be the *true one ; that they were manufactured by corrupt men , with fraudulent evidence , for the purpos* of amassing large fortunes at the expense of honesty and the rights of the people of California . It is needless to say this speech had its effect . The bill was defeated , and thus by the well-directed efforts of a single member , the eyes of the house were opened to the true object of a n*easure which , before that time , had appeared to be everything tAat was right . General Denver was not a candidate for re-election to Congress . During his term as representative , he was appointed one of the Commissioners to pay off the California War Debt , which duty he discharged to the satisfaction of the holders of the bonds and of the State . President Buchanan tendered him the important position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Indian Bureau in Washington , having the administrative charge of all the relations of the Unite d States and the Indian tribes . Whilst engaged in this position , the President determined to remove Frederick P. Stanton , the acting Governor of Kansas . Kansas had suffered too much from Executives who looked rather to the influence of their official course upon their own political future than upon the domestic quiet of the Territory ; in addition to this , the effect of Kansas affairs , outside of Kansas , instead of upon the Territory itself had had a great deal to do with directing the action of the preceding Exe8utives of Kansas . Mr. Buchanan determined to send a different man than any of the previous Governors ; a man who would not permit his vaulting ambition to overleap his official duty . Governor Deuver being out in Kansas , on business connected with the Indian Bureau , was written to , and pressed to abandon his position temporarily , as Commissioner of Indian Affairs , and accept the place of Secretary and acting Governor . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place in // Kansas being much less in salary , and his sojonrn there involving heavy private expenses . When he reached the Territory , he found it in the most unfavorable condition ; most of the people , through the influence of the Republican party of the country , had ceased to regard the obligations they owed to Government . They failed to al ) preciate the lines which marked the division between the Executive , Judicial , and Legislative departments of the Goveminent ; they cared nothing for either , where either interfered with the licentious practices of a most violent outlawry . The notorious Lane and Montgomery revelled in the commission of the greatest outrages . The latter , at the head of a band of marauders , roamed through Southern Kansas , levying tribute upon the population , destroying property , murdering many families , and bidding open defiance to all law To aggravate these troubles , the Free State Legislature , called by acting Governor Stanton , met , and in express violation of the agreement upon which he consented to call themthat they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for a new Convocation-proceeded to indulge in the most reckless and extravagant legislation . The Territorial Legislature , called by acting Governor Stanton , in extraordinary session , adjourned about the 18th of December , after manifesting a very bad disposition , and violating the pledges given to Mr. Stanton to induce him to call them together . One of their acts was , to make the civil power subordinate to the military , and place the latter entirely under the control of the notorious James II . Lane . On the 21st , General Denver assumed the duties of Secretary of the Territory , as the successor of Mr. Stanton , and Governor Walker being then absent* , he had also to discharge the duties of Governor . The whole country was in the greatest confusion , which the acts of the extra session of the Legislature served only to mere ase . The public mind was heated and influenced to the utmost ; an election was to be held on the 4th of January , 1858 , for officers , under the Lecompton Constitution , and the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people , on the 21st of December had again presented it iii another form . This was regarded as irregular by those who were in favor of the State organization under that Constitution , and they generally refused to vote under the Legislative enactments . Up to this time the United States troops had been freely used in the Kansas difficulties . Gen. Denver was satisfied that they ought to be withdrawn , and the people taught to rely on and govern themselves , but it was necessary to observe // great caution in bringing about such a result . So violent had been the feelings of hatred towards each other , that the different factions recognised the laws only when they would subserve their own purposes . In all else they were disregarded and trampled under foot . Charges were made against all parties that frauds were contemplated in the approaching elections , and Lane was said to be organizing an armed force to take possession of the polls at certain points , and deter the people from voting . To allay these apprehensions , the acting Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none but " inhabitants " of the Territory had a right to vote , and giving the legal definition of the word " inhabitant . " Tie also distributed the U. S. troops over the Territory , and posted them at every important point . These measures had the desired effect , and the election passed off quietly as a general thing . Lane , at the head of a body of armed men , went to Johnson County , but finding the troops there , he contented himself with arresting two or three gentlemen for being impudent to him , and returned to Lawrence . The election resulted in a drawn battle , many of the more violent and factious of the Free State men refusing to vote , and the whole subject was then transferred to the Halls of Congress . Of the angry discussions which followed on the distracting issues presented , it is not now our purpose to speak ; but it will suffice to say that no one deplored this state of affairs or strove harder to avert the disastrous consequences likely to result to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened at Lecompton on the 4th of January , and immediately adjourned to the town of Lawrence . The acting governor interposed no objection to this movement . Many of the members were among the most violent men in the country ,  --  a number of them were also members of the so called Topeka Legislature ,  --  with the exception of about three they were Free State men ,  --  several of them had formerly been charged with high crimes , arrested , and detamed as prisoners at Lecompton , which was the head-quarters of the Pro-Slavery men , and he believed that under all the circumstances it would be better for the public interests that they should be removed from scenes which were calculated to keep their minds in a state of constant irritation and excitement . As soon as this step was finally determined on , those members who belonged to the Topeka organization , proceeded at once to the town of Topeka , and that body adjourned to Lawrence also . The Topeka government , as it was called , had been started in opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed at Topeka without the color of law , had been submitted to Congress and rejected . Those who advocated it had , however , affected to organize a State government , and a body of men calling themselves the Legislature of the State of Kansas , had met at Topeka , and were dispersed by Col. Sumner under the orders of Wilson Shannon , then Governor of the Territory . They assembled again during the administration of Gov . Walker , when he succeeded in dispersing them partly by persuasion and partly by threats . Their whole conduct was revolutionary , and in defiance of the regularly constituted authorities . These were the men with whom Gen. Denver now had to deal . They had succeeded in carrying the Territorial Legislature , and many of them declared their intention now to be to supplant the Territorial government and put their Topeka scheme into operation . This state of affairs caused the acting governor great solicitude . To pursue the course adopted by his predecessors , and disperse them by force , would still further inflame the public mind ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object he most desired to avoid . After mature reflection he determined quietly to await further developments , and take no step in the premises until some overt act should be coinmitted which would justify him in proceeding to extremities ; but at the same time hoping that a just sense of their official obligations might induce them to forego their resolution and abandon such treasonable intentions . The result showed the correctness of his conclusions . Meeting with no resistance , the " Topeka Legislature , " after maintaining a vagrant existence for a short time , dissolved , and the very name became a reproach and a byword . Thus was this most dangerous difficulty avoided . Upon the resignation of Gov . Walker Gen. Denver was nominated and confirmed as Governor of the Territory . The members of the Legislative Assembly were almost totally without experience in legislation . They were , for the most part , men of strong passions and bitter prejudices . Nearly all of them had been in arms , at some time or other , agaiust the regularly constituted authorities . Yery fe*v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " bogus , " and they now sought to retaliate on their political opponents the wrongs which they conceived themselves to have suffered . Speculation , too , was rife ; and all sorts of charters were granted for banks , town companies , ferries , bridges , &amp;c. &amp;c . His desire to protect the public interests , and to prevent legislation from exceeding the limits prescribed by the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress , induced the acting // Governor to interpose the executive veto much oftener than he would have desired . In the exercise of the veto power so often , lie exhibited that firmness for which he is so noted . Every scheme of plunder or unconstitutionality received his disapproval . Many of them , owing to the utter recklessness of the Legislatui*e , passed , notwithstanding his disapproval . The following Message , vetoing the bank bill , can not fail to command the admiration of every friend to a sound constitutional currency . It is alike worthy the man and the important subject of which he treats : To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled " An act establishing certain Bank* in Kansas Territory . " In the investigation of the subject it may be as well first to inquire whether the legislature of this Territory has the power to charter banks and authorize them to issue notes or bills of credit for a circulating medium . After a struggle of more than forty years , Congress finally decided that they had not the power to establish a national bank , and there are very few at this day who do not endorse the wisdom of that decision . The power of Congress to legislate for the people of the Territories is not expressly given by any provision in the Constitution , but it springs from that obligation imposed on every government to afford protection to her own citizens . In order to carry out this obligation , Congress has the right , anywhere within the boundaries of the An*-2rican Union , and not within the limits of an organized State , to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the government of the people residing there , not inconsistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these powers , Congress delegated , with some reservations , their authority over such subjects to the legislative power of the Territory . The language of the organic act , section 24 , is very explicit , and reads as follows : " The legislative power of the Territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the provisions of this act . " The Constitution gives to Congress the right " to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever " over the District of Columbia , but even there it was limited by the deed of cession . The other places to which such right extends are " forts , magazines , arsenals , dock-yards , and other needful buildings . " In all else , the powers of Congress are expressly defined or grow out of some absolute necessity , and it has been determined that the power to charter a bank is neither a necessary nor incidental power . Did Congress , then , intend by the organic act to confer authority on the legislative power of this Territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend for a moment that such was the intention , for it is expressly declared otherwise . If this power can not be found to have been conferred on Congress by the Constitution , nor on the legislative power of this Territory by the Constitution and organic act , under what authority is it proposed to pass the hill before me ? The Constitution further declares that no state shall " coin money , emit bills of credit , make anything but gold or silver a tender in payment of debts ; " and can it be presumed that , when the States were debarred the right to exercise such powers , the Territories would be allowed to do so ? If there can be a doubt about it , a reference to the tenth article of the amendments to the Constitution would set that doubt at rest . It reads as follows : // " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively or to the people . " The powers now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Congress has decided that they have not been delegated to the United States . Under and by what authority , then , can the Territory assume such powers ? Passing by this question of power , I now proceed to examine the bill itself . It authorizes the banks proposed to be created " to purchase , possess , use , and sell any property the same as individuals . " ( See section 1 . ) It authorizes them , and declares that " they shall have power to use as specie all sight drafts or certificates of deposits made by responsible speciepaying banking-houses in this Territory , or in St. Louis , Chicago , Cincinnati , ' Philadelphia , Boston , or New York . ( See section 18 . ) Section 19 provides that " no bank shall at any time suspend or refuse the payment in specie of any of its notes , " &amp;c . By an examination of its provisions it will he seen that the proposed banks will be authorized to enter the lists in connexion with individuals for the buying and selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use bank notes , sight drafts , or certificates of deposit . If specie should be demanded , they could turn to their charter and show that they " have power to use as specie " all such paper evidences of debt . There would never be a necessity for them to suspend , for the Bank of Leavenworth would be authorized to redeem her notes in the notes of the Bank of Lawrence ; the Bank of Lawrence redeems hers in the notes of the Bank of Wyandott , and the Bank of Wyandott redeems hers in the notes of the Bank of Leavenworth ; thus making a continual circuit ; and if these banks should get tired of this circular motion , they could send the note-holder out of the Territory by giving him sight draftscertificates of deposit on eastern banks . As these operations might be found successful , their circulation could be extended to an unlimited amount , for , the capital stock being fixed first at one hundred thousand dollars for each bank , it can afterwards be increased indefinitely by the addition of fifty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the 27th section authorizes thema to establish in every town , hamlet , or neighborhood throughout the length and breadth of the Territory , they would be able to interfere in the business affairs of every citizen , and flood the country with an irredeemable and irresponsible paper currency , which they would be authorized to " use as specie , " but which could not be used by anybody else . The tenth section provides that " whenever the directors of either bank shall deposit with the Comptroller an amount of State bonds of any interestpaying State in the Union , or of the United States , equal to twenty-five thousand dollars ( $25,000 ) at the current rates of the New York Stock Exchange , " &amp;c. , making no provision against receiving State or United States stock at a premium , when it is well known that a sudden revulsion is sure to reduce the " current rates " of value attached to such evidence of indebtedness , and that in no event could more than the face of the bonds be collected . The twenty-sixth section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State which may be formed out of this Territory , by depriving the people at that time of the power to arrange their own affairs . I regard this bill before me as objectionable , therefore , for the following reasons : 1st . I do not think the " governor and legislative assembly " have power to charter banks . // 8d . It would be a bad policy to give any moneyed institution the power to interfere in the every-day affairs of the people , an ( l flood the country with paper currency which they could " use as specie , " bat which the people at large could not . With these objections , the bill is herewith returned to the house in which it originated . J. W. IDENYER , Governor . The Legislature , within three days of their adjournment , passed a bill calling a convention to form a new Constitution . The Governor had three days , under the organic act , to consider all bills . As there was not that time between its reception by him and its adoption , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a committee to him to get him to veto it , in order that they might pass it over his head : this he declined doing . Thus was a call of a convention defeated , and a precipitation of the Kansas question again upon Congress at the late session avoided . The Legislature , however , passed an order before the adjournment , that the bill was a law any way . Under it the notorious Leavenworth convention met and adopted what is known as the Leavenworth Constitution . So conclusive , however , was it that the act of the Legislature calling it was not law , as was afterwards decided by the Attorney General of the United States , that the bantling of the Leavenworth Convention excited no consideration , and it fell even into more utter contempt , if such a thing could be , than its Topeka precedent . So contemptible was it , that even the Kansas shriekers in Congress could not make it the pretext for the least agitation , for they have never made an effort to admit Kansas under it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having refused to commission the officers of the militia provided for in the bill passed over his veto , on the ground that it was in violation of the Constitution of the United States , as it proposed to make the civil subordinate to the military power , General James H. Lane attempted to carry the act into effect any how , and proceeded to enrol the militia . One of his captains came into the executive department to enrol the gentlemen there engaged . Governor Denver asked him for his authority ; he produced a paper purporting to be instructions to enrolling officers , signed by Lane . The Governor then asked him if that was all he had . He said No , and produced another paper , purporting to be a cominission , also signed by Lane . After examining them , the Governor told him it would be necessary for him ( the Governor ) to retain the papers . He remarked that if there was anything wrong about the papers , he did not want them . The Governor replied they were wrong ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Governor , and if Lane was attempting such a thing , these papers might be necessary to prove it on him . He then went away , and being laughed at by his companions outside , as a great captain to permit the Governor to keep his papers , he returned and aslied the latter to give them back to him . He said , if the Governor merely wanted to arrest him , and would give him his papers , he would go on the street and enrol somebody there , in order that evidence might be procured against him . This was declined by the Governor , who told him he was not after him , as he was a mere instrument in the hands of other 's . Lane 's captain then retired , and the Governor , upon these papers , issued a proclamation warning the people against Lane 's proceedings , which effectually broke them up . This so exasperated Lane that he made a violent assault , through the papers , on Governor Denver , which his friend IRedpath said was intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which it was intended that the Governor should be assassinated before the meeting . At that time Lane and Redpath were bosom friends ; but afterwards quarrelled , and hence the developement of the cowardly and murderous purpose of the gallant Lane . The difficulties in Southern Kansas were of the most perplexing character . The settlemer*t of these forms the most striking incident in Governor Denver 's executive career . They had been of comparatively short and rapid growth , originating about Land Claims , but were seized upon by designing men for the purpose of making political capital . Some of the incidents are as follows : In the latter part of August , 57 , James Curry , a Free State man , shot Lubbsman , a Pro-Slavery man , in a difficulty growing out of the latter 's refusal to answer whether he was a Free or Pro-Slavery man . About the 10th of Dec. 57 , a squatter 's court convened at Little Osage , presided over by a IRev . Jno E. Stewart , aided amongst others by the notorious Jas . Montgomery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's company of marauders , who arrested several Pro-Slavery settlers , amongst them a preacher , a post-master , and the preacher 's son and his daughter , the latter being compelled to cook for the court . They were fined by the Court , and disseized of their crops , hogs , horses , cattle , and claims . The notes of those whose property would not cover the fines were taken , and they bammished from the Territory . Many of them , for fear of their lives , went . Some of them made sworn complaints to the proper legal authorities , and the deputy Marshal went to arrest these extra-judicial usurpers . He was told by them that the laws were all repealed by the extra Legislative session called together by Acting Gov. // Stanton ; that an interregnum in the government had occurred ; that the " people " of Kansas had taken niatters into their own hands , and in the name of the Free State party , defied him . lie assembled a posse from other parts of the county , but the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his p ? see , kept them off during the day , and at night fled to their hiding places , breaking out again in the shape of Montgomery 's marauding guerillas , who stole the horses and robbed the honses generally , but not always , of about 300 Pro-Slavery settlers throughout the counties of Bourbon and Linn , taking beds , clothes , watches , everything portable ; and in one instance an old lady 's spectacles off her nose , and a ten cent piece from her pocket ; always winding up by ordering these families , thus stript of everything , in the dead of winter , to leave the territory forthwith-which , in most instances , they did . The next shooting affair occurred about the 28th of February , 1858 , when some of this same party called a Pro-Slavery man , named Van Zumalt , living on the Osage , to his door , shot him , robbed his house , and abused the fallen man before his family . The next difficulty was in the month of March , 1858 , when Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ np with the Montgomery guerillas , and declined to give up a claim belonging to a Pro-Slavery man , named Hardwicke , which Deuton was occupying by his sufferance . After some lawsuits , Denton and his gang visited Hardwicke 's cabin in the night , tore it down , and drove him and his family offi llardwicke lurked around , and it was supposed that it was he who called two of the parties who had injured him , to their door , shot them dead , and fired the house of another and shot him . Next an old man . named Travis , who had no politics , was tried by this squatter 's court for complicity with llardwicke in these murders , found not guilty , and released . He stopped at a house on his way home , was called to the door by a part of Montgomery 's band , and shot dead . The house was fired into , and two of its occupants , named Wassons , wounded . Montgomery and his band , about the middle of April , in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Fort Scott , where the troops were stationed . The parties robbed made a legal complaint , and the Deputy Marshal , with warrants and a posse of twenty soldiers , went to arrest the robbers , about twenty-seven in number , who fled on the approach of the troops to an advantageous position in a hollow among timber . On the troops coming up in pursuit , they fired upon them with Sharpe 's rifles , killing one . Th efire was returned with revolvers , and one of the gang wounded . The fearful conclusion of this scene of crime in these counties // was the Linn county massacre , on the Marias du Cygne , on the 19th of May , 1858 ; when Capt . Hamilton , an ultra Pro-Slavery man , and resident of that county , who had been threatened and annoyed by Montgomery 's band , at the head of about thirty desperate men , some of them Missourians , and others men whom Montgomery had driven from the Territory , took prisoners eleven Free State men living in his vicinity , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild beasts ; Ibur of them were killed , six wounded , and one escaped unhip't . This last bloody drama was but a revenge for the most unjustifiable outrages committed on the families of Capt . Hamnilton and his men . It is true that so bloody an act can not be defended ; but still , it was such as might have been expected , considering the course that Montgomery 's band was pursuing at that time . In the early part of June , 1858 , Gov . Denver determined to visit the country thus disturbed by these unparalleled outrages , and though warned that it would be at the sacrifice of his life , it did not deter him . He accordingly proceeded through the country froum Lawrence to Fort Scott , accompammied by four or five other gentlemen . At Moneka , on the way , Montgomem*y sought an interview with himu , which lie declined . At IRaysville he met a great many people in a high state of excitement , whom he addressed , counselling them to observe the law , and thence he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in the utmost confusion . The officers of the law were not recognised outside of the town of Fort Scott . Only a few days before the Sheriff of the county was caught , some three or four miles from town , and robbed of his mule and everything else he had by Montgomery and his men . The people of the entire county met at Fort Scott the day after his arrival . He addressed them on the state of affairs , after which they entered into an agreement to cease hostilities towards each other , organize the civil authorities , and obey the laws . The Sheriff , being inimical to some of them , resigmied , and Gov . Denver appointed a full set of officers to act until an election could be held . After leaving Fort Scott , Gov . Denver went up the Marias du Cygne and met a large number of the people of Liun county , all with arms in their hands , in the greatest consternation . He addressed themn as he had done those at Fort Scott - made arrangements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peace and quiet reigned after that in these disturbed sections of the territory as long as he remained the Executive of Kansas . Congress having passed , in the month of May , 1868 , the // English conference bill , witha provision to submit the land clause therein to the people , Gov . Denver made all necessary arrangemeats to insure a fair election on the subject , and left the*erritory for Washington City . Upon his arrival there , lie asked the President ( as he bad several times asked before , and as many times been refused ) to relieve him of the office . The President urged him to return , until he finally consented to do so . Ife returned to Kansas in July , in time to be present at the election on the Land Clause in the English bill , which proceeded quietly , resulting , as is well known , in the defeat of the Lecompton Constitution . After this , most of the members of the Legislature petitioned him to call that body together in extra session . The object was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Leavenworth Constitutions were treated with ridicule and contempt , to get up a new Constitution , and by submitting it to Congress , renew the agitation which had been of such pernicious effect upon the country . Gov . Denver seeing the object , in a written declaration , tart in style and telling in its every line , refused to call a body of such reckless Legislators together , who had shown by their course at their previous settings their utter unfitness for their places , and by their violation of the pledge given to acting Gov . Stanton , their utter want of integrity and loss of claim to regard . This reply of Gov . Denver 's was widely published , and had a crushing effect upon the subjects of its unsparing criticism . Gov . Denver finally determined peremptorily to resign the Governorship . When the news of General Denver 's peremptory resignation was heralded the New York TrThune , in an article in its issue of Sept. 20th , 1858 , charged that he had not resigned , but had been dismissed . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that he had s*howed " a direct yes*pect for the rights and wishes of the people of Kansas . He has failed altogether , so far as we are informed , to give any countenance to fraudulent voting , or false returns ; a course which hitherto has not failed to procure the removal of any Governor of Kansas who had the temerity to adopt it . We had begun to think , from Mr. Buchanan 's course in allowing Denver to continue in office , notwithstanding his total failure to discharge the duties hitherto expected of a Governor , that the people of Washington had given up the idea of delivering Kansas , bound hand and foot , to the slaveholders. * * * The removal of Denver , under whom things have gone on so quietly , gives grounds for suspicion that some new niove is to be attempted , " etc. , etc. // To this editorial , complimentary to him , but grossly unjust to the President , General Denver replied in a gentlemanly but scathing communication , bearing date at Lecompton , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Journal of 6Yommerce , having been refused an insertion in the Tribune , which paper , however , afterwards published it . He denied that he had been compelled to resign ; he had done so against the wishes of the administration ; he had resigned once before , but had been induced to withdraw it . His private afThirs compelled his attention , as soon as he could leave Kansas , and as he could then resign with safety to the public interests , he did so . He then went on , and said : " The President had always manifested the deepest concern for the peace and happiness of the country , and a determination that the people of the Territory should have a fair opportunity at the ballot-box , to settle the questions at issue before them , in their own way , and without any extraneous in fluences. * * * * * * * * " The frauds perpetuated at the elections in January last , were committed by the violent and unscrupulous men of all parties , and the investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forging of the returns from Delaware Crossing , were paraded before the public with great gusto , while the destruction of the ballot-box and ballots at Sugar Mound , by Capt . Montgomery , was passed by in silence . The actors in all these transactions , ought to have been severely punished ; but there were no laws . that would reach them , and the late Legislative Assembly , which was all Free State , made no sufficient laws to meet such cases in the future ; but endeavored to paralyse the powers of the Circuit Courts , and invest the Probate Courts with powers they could not exercise . " You admit that things have gone on here quietly under my administration . This is not exactly correct . There have been some disturbances in Doniphan , Leavenworth , Linn , and Bourbon counties , and in every case the disturbances have been produced by persons calling themselves Free State men . In Doniphan county an effort was made to assassinate the gentlemen who were elected to the Legislature on the first Monday in January last , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their property , and their houses burned . No steps have been taken to punish the perpetrators , and yet all the county officers were Free State men . The troubles in Leavenworth City continued nearly all winter , and if the Mayor and other city officers did not encourage them , they certainly took no measures to have them suppressed . " Here General Denver recited the difficulties in Southern // Kansas , alluded to in the preceding portion of this biography , and concluded as follows : " Such have been some of the troubles in this Territory , and yet the perpetrators are running at large , without an effort to arrest them , in counties where the Free State men have all the local officers , upheld by a portion of those calling themselves Free state men , among the most active of whom have been t'he* hired reporters of the eastern newspaper press . If any further disturbances occur in this Territory , these are the people who will be justly responsible for it . The ProSlavery party have abandoned the contest . The Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territory , and they have the Sheriff , and all other local officers , in all but two or three of the counties ; and there is no county in which the Sheriff can not p reserve the peace , if he desires to do so . " You make another complaint against the President : that he has twice postponed the sale of public lands . If I mistake not , last spring you complained because the sales were ordered for July . The first postponement was made at the urgent solicitation of the people in all parts of the Territory ; and so anxious were they to have it done , that they sent on a committee of three to see the President on the subject , and the result of their interview was published by you . The second postponement was more *iecessary than the first ; for money had become more scarce in the Territory , the rates of interest had gone up to five and ten per cent . per month , and there was a good deal of sickness throughout the whole country . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place in November , the settler would be placed at the mercy of the money lender-when to postpone it , the settler would have another year within which to obtain the means to secure a home , without having to give away one half of his land for the money with which to enter the other half No good government would knowingly impose such terms on its citizens , and hence the postponement of the land sales until July next . It was a measure demanded by the condition of affairs here , and of which 1 have heard no one complain , except such as were determined to be dissatisfied with any thing and every thing the administration might do , and a few money lenders , whose percentage has been greatly reduced by it . " By giving publicity to this , you will correct some erroneous impressions conveyed in the article alluded to , and oblige , " Yours respectfully , " J. W. DEKvER " // October , 1858 , and returning to Washington , resumed the position of Commissioner of Indian Affairs . The Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Denver 's resignation of the governorship of Kansas , pays a just tribute to his executive dualities-it says : " Governor J. W. Denver , having resigned the executive office of Kansas , much to the regret of the administration , and we doubt not of the whole country , has resumed his position as Commissioner of Jndian Affairs ; Mr. Mix yielding that office and reverting to his original post as chief clerk of the bureau . " Of all the persons who have successively filled the governorship of Kansas , Mr. Denver is the first one who has succeeded in giving general satisfaction to the people of the Territory and of the Union at large . He is probably the first governor , also , who has resigned the office with the regret of the whole country . His administration has been at once firm , decided , and peaceful . The law has been enforced , violence has been subdued , and order thoroughly established . His course has been firm , straight-forward , and upright , commanding the respect alike of Kansas and the Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith ; his measures having been just in themselves , and in accordance with the instructions of the federal administration , between whom and himself relations of the most perfect harmony and confidence have subsisted throughout . His administration has been as unambitious as it has been successful , and he has won the highest reputation for ability and capacity , of all the governors of Kansas , simply by a quiet , firm , and unostentatious discharge of the duties of his office . We do not recollect that Governor Denver has made a single stump-speech during his whole administration . The telegraph has had few of his formal progresses through the Territory to herald , and no " sensation " bulletins concerning him to retail to professional agitators in the East . He has addressed the people of Kansas with pertinence and effect ; but his address was , with rare good taste , valedictory , on resigning his office . The universal sentiment of the country in regard to Governor Denver , we dare say , is one of regret that he was not the governor of Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor while she continues to be a Territory . It will be difficult to fill Governor Denver 's place . " On his return from Kansas , he resumed the position of Commissioner of Indian Affairs , which office he has discharged with that ability which has characterized his administration of every official trust conferred on him . He resigned this office on the 11th of March , 1859 , and returned to his home in California , in the steamer of the 20th . President Buchanan regretted to sever the official connection between Governor Denver and himself and addressed him the following feeling and complimentary letter : " WAsHINGToN , 2lareh 13 , 1859 . " My DEAR Sin : " It is with sincere regret that I accept your resignation as Commissioner of Indian Affairs . Your conduct in that highly responsible office has received my cordial approbation , as well as that of the Secretary of the Interior . It will be difficult to supply your place . " But I can not consent to sever our official connection , without expressing 8 // 114 Hzstory of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able , discreet , firm and successful manner in which you performed your duties as governor of Kansas , under the most difficult and trying circumstances . " Wishing you health , prosperity , and success throughout life , I remain , " HON. J. W. DENVER . " Yours very respectfully , " JAMES BUCHANAN .
