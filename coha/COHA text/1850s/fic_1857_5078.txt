DOESTICKS , of No Hall , Nowhere ; No Castle , no Villa , no Place , Court , or Terrace ; Who did n't write " Junius , " or " Nothing to Wear , " Who never have visited London or Paris ; Who am not a phantom , a myth , or a mystery , But a " homo , " as solid as any of history ; As real as Antony , Caesar , or Brutus ,  --  A wide-awake Yankee , so " tarnation ' cute " as To always write Nothings , while Nothings will pay , Am the author of this Nothing  --  Nothing to Say . * * * * * I mention this fact in advance , that Miss P*** May not strive to embezzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to his Litany , And leave me my fame , if perchance I shall get any . I deemed it best , to set at rest , This question before it was started , lest Some terrible girl from the far countree , Without proper regard to veracitee , Should haste to town , to drag me down From my envied post of poetic renown . Miss P*** , I 've a favor to ask .  --  If ' t is true , That " Nothing to Wear , " and " Nothing to Do , " And " Nothing to Eat , " were all written by you ,  --  Let those three Nothings content you I pray , Say nothing yourself ; leave me " Nothing to Say . " * * * * * From time immemorial , people of fashion Have been the target of poets and penny wits , And been lampooned without stint or compassion , From Dan to Beersheba  --  from Dublin to Dennevitz ; And our now-a-day rhymsters , taking the cue , Have aimed all their shots at the Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fired his broadside at Madison Square . Now I do n't consider this sort of thing personal , I 'm not a bit of a dandy or fop ; But the seed it is constantly sowing , is worse than all Others , and bears a most plentiful crop ; For it all goes to strengthen the popular fallacy That , because a man lives in a " brown stone palace " he Must be a miser , a rogue and a knave , Without soul enough to condemn or to save  --  Illustration : Page 28 . That a broadcloth coat argues sin , if not felony ; If a man has the tact in the world to get well on , he Can not be else than a thorough-paced scamp ; That the " villanous rich " wear a cloak and a mask , all , And the greater the riches , the greater the rascal . That the cardinal virtues only endure , In the atmosphere with the " virtuous poor ; " That nowhere are found the true Christian graces , Save closely allied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition , But beg  --  No , I wo n't , I will take it  --  permission , To state , that I think there 's a word to be said , From a different text , on the opposite head . And so I 'll invent , as well as I 'm able , A new home-made , allegorical fable ; And my honest purpose shall be , to see If the scoundrel rich have not borne a part In those noble charities , which are The pride of this jolly old city 's heart . And if I shall find that the virtuous mob Have ever been known one farthing to pay , Without hoping a hundred-fold profit to make : Where the " rich man , " the " miser , " " aristocrat , " " snob , " Has poured out his thousands for Charity 's sake , I 'll lay down my pen , and have " Nothing to Say . " * * * * * I shall not describe the SPIRIT OF CANT , Of popular humbug , and vulgar rant , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the length of his horns and claws , The spread of his wings , the width of his jaws , And detail the other proportions grim , Which belong to a powerful demon like him . Go and look at the melodramatic stage , When a " spectacle " piece is all the rage ; And there , in the midst of some " property " storm , While the sheet-iron thunder is rattling its best , And the rosin lightning , and all the rest Of the elements are , for some tragedy-reason , Making the " awfullest gale of the season  --  " See , at the sound of the prompter 's tap , The fiend come up through the " Vampyre trap ; " Take a mental photograph then , and there , Of that imp , with his " fixins " all complete  --  The elfish grin , the tangled hair , The dragon wings and the scaly feet  --  And you 'll have a notion of him I mean , The demon of this , my opening scene . I might go to Milton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit my Spirit of Cant , A second-hand suit , but a " splendid fit , " As a Jew would assure me  --  but then I sha'nt . His work is to preach the humbug which passes For gospel among the " down-trodden masses ; " And to prate of the " wrongs and indignities , " which Are heaped on their heads by the " cold-hearted rich . " * * * * * This Spirit was busy at work one day , Amongst a crowd of Bowery boys , When CHARITY happened to come that way ; And she stopped to listen  --  though , sooth to say , She seldom is fond of clamor and noise . * * * * * " Now , pray , Mr. Author , wait just a minute , Stop ! Drop Illustration : Page 35 . Your subject , and do n't again begin it Till you tell us : What did Charity wear ? Was her dress of moire antique , or satin ; Or was it plain muslin  --  just like that in Which love-lorn maidens on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page ? Did she wear hoops ? and what sort of a bonnet ? And tell us , what kind of trimming was on it ? What  --  " Stop , stop , dear ladies , it is n't fair To question thus closely a modest young man . If I could tell the items , I would , I declare ; For I always oblige you whenever I can . I know that of dresses she has a variety , Though vanity 's not her predominant passion , She was costumed , no doubt , with the greatest propriety , In the very extreme of the reigning fashion . Well ! she stopped to listen , a minute or more , To the fellow 's mischievous harangue , before She resolved what to do ; then she stepped to the door Of an Astor Place car , and beckoned to him , And he followed at once , while his audience scattered ; To tell the truth , he felt quite flattered , And he smiled a smile most heavy and grim , For he thought he 'd awakened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady of fashion . And they sat side by side , this curious pair , While they rode up to Eighth street  --  and she paid the fare . * * * * * They stepped from the car , and stood before , The " COOPER INSTITUTE 'S " new-painted door  --  * * * * * " Who hath done this ? " asked Charity then ; " Who hath done this for his fellow-men ? Hath builded this house , that all may come  --  The poor most welcome  --  to Learning 's treasure , And drink their fill without stint or measure ? Who hath so nobly used his thrift , And bestowed on the world this priceless gift , Free to all , whoever may come ? Was this noble work built up by the ' masses , ' Or by one of the ' miserly , upper classes ' ? " * * * * * To the Spirit , this speech was quite unexpected , And he stood in a sort of stupid dismay ; And before his few scattered thoughts were collected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she lifted her skirts with a masterly hand , And out of the puddles and ruts kept them well up ,  --  Thus showed that she had the most perfect command Of the crinoline mysteries of her envelope , ' T was done with the daintiest grace all the while , And discovered the daintiest possible gaiter ,  --  Then she turned to her friend with a nod and a smile , And told him to follow  --  he straightway obeyed her . As they hurried along , she kept ever before him , And he kept his eye on the tempting prunella , Secretly hoping there 'd come such a shower As would make a new Flood in half-an-hour  --  That she , with a womanly care for her bonnet , Which would " spot , " with the least drop of water upon it , Illustration : Page 39 . Might become condescending , and humbly implore him To come along-side with his cotton umbrella . But the shower did n't come , and without a disaster , They reached the huge Library  --  christened of Astor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ahem 'd once or twice  --  struck out a nice attitude  --  And then she struck into this little oration , Though I 'm sure I do n't know where she learned declamation. * * * * * " Spirit , behold ! these bending shelves Are groaning ' neath the gathered store Of every nation 's varied lore . Most welcome are the poor themselves To freely turn these countless pages , And gather from the words of sages All the light of former ages . Whoever wills is here a guest , The poorest are the welcomest . Who hath done this ? your virtuous mob , Or a ' cold-hearted miser , ' a ' pampered snob ? ' " * * * * * Here her Companion began to perceive That her feminine tongue would have its own way ; That the cleverest thing he could do was to leave The talking to her , and have Nothing to Say . The lady had now been chattering so long , She felt that her voice was beginning to fail her ; A punch would , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical " thing with which to regale her , So they pushed their way through the gathering throng , And hurried away to Taylor 's Saloon . * * * * * They seated themselves at the table together ,  --  The customers " staring their eyes out , " to see Who this queer-looking couple could possibly be ,  --  Asking each other in whispers , whether , It was n't the likeliest thing that she , Was a Western Actress , and he an Editor ; And some were terribly frightened , because They could n't help thinking there certainly was , The Old Nick to pay , and that he was their creditor. * * * * * But the strangers composedly sat , never heeding These stupid remarks , or taking offence , And they quietly kept on their drinking and feeding , Without the slightest regard to expense . If an appetite sharp is a thing so delightful , Charity had no occasion to sigh at hers ; Boarding-house keepers would say it was frightful , And ruinous too , to the hotel proprietors . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned from the door ; He , wondering whither she now would go  --  And well he might  --  in an instant more He was over shoes in the frozen snow ; While she coolly remarked , with a Camille cough , That the North Pole was only a half a mile off . * * * * * How it was they got to their present location , I 'm sure I do n't know , and it 's not my vocation To give the details of their quick locomotion . Electricity may have done it , or steam ; Illustration : Page 46 . But motive powers are not my theme . My heroes were there , near the frozen ocean . * * * * * The man had too much of " cold without , " And the lady sighed for her tippet and muff ; For though they had come by a summary route , The weather , they found , was wintry enough . When they climbed an iceberg 's loftiest height , To the imminent danger of dresses and hoops , Of ribbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXPEDITION was in sight . * * * * * Now the lady had been prepared to preach , Or rather , to make a nice serious speech ; But it might as well have been written in Dutch for her , For the wind and the weather , conspiring together , Turned out to be , altogether too much for her ; One half she forgot , and she bungled the rest of it , Though I finally managed to pick out the best of it . She asked her companion , who stood in the lee of her , For the wind spread her skirts to the bigness of three of her , " Who sent these ships to the rescue of those , Who have perilled their lives in these Northern snows ? Did he spring from the mob , the benevolent ' masses , ' Or from the detestable ' upper classes ' ? " With a great deal more to the same effect , Which I could n't exactly make out the sense of , For I know that her sentences " failed to connect ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends off ; But ' t was very conclusive , whatever she said . He never disputed her ; never said nay , But only hung down his discomfited head ; And whatever he thought , he had Nothing to Say . * * * * * Chilled to the heart with the terrible cold , Both to get back were most truly-solicitous , Never before was the saying old , " As cold as charity , " half so felicitous . * * * * * They hastened back to Broadway , when she said , That one more journey that night she 'd lead him , Before she 'd let him go home to bed . And he , not caring to quibble or question , At once fell in with the lady 's suggestion , Not thinking she 'd " one more " lecture to read him . * * * * * This time they took a course rectilinear Southward , and landed in Norfolk , Virginia . * * * * * Pestilence there was doing its worst , Hundreds were dying , and hundreds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Had deserted their trust , and shamelessly fled . But men from the Northern cities were there , Nursing the sick with the tenderest care , Whose kindred had fled to less dangerous lands , Leaving the dying to strangers ' hands . Illustration : Page 52 . While the two stood quiet beside the bed Of a patient sufferer , Charity said : * * * * * " Who hath sent these strangers here , These dying men to soothe and cheer ? To do what mortal skill may do To lighten their burdens of grief and woe ; To shrive these dying souls of blame , To bid them hope in Heaven above . Who hath sent these in my dear name To do this holiest work of love ? Hath the treasure here given been paid by those Whose ' wrongs ' are so earnestly plead by you ? Or hath it been done by their ' natural foes , ' The wealthy , the rich , the opulent few Of Madison Square and the Fifth Avenue ? " * * * * * During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he waked himself up at the peroration , And most ungallantly turned up his nose , And turned on his heel , and turned him away ,  --  Sulkily saying , he 'd Nothing to Say . * * * * * Dear Readers , I 'll ask one question of you  --  Do n't you think it may possibly chance to be true , That Charity , really , not merely in fables , May apparel herself in satins and sables , And costliest ribbons , and fragilest laces , Like the daintiest beauties of Madison Square , And may take up a home in the loftiest places , With those who 've , satirically , Nothing to Wear ? * * * * * And in that blissful realm above , Where the poor and the rich meet in meekness and love : Where the works of each heart are unveiled to the light , And Humbug and Cant yield to Truth and to Right  --  Where the trickster lays off his mask of deceit , And the cloak of the hypocrite drops to his feet , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may see that some from the Fifth Avenue , Most nobly will speak in that great reckoning day , While their earthly detractors have NOTHING TO SAY .
