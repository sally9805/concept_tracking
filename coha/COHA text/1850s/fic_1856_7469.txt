Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : BETHANY. from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1856 The pale moon lingers on the hills O'erhanging peaceful Bethany  --  Her silent glance the valley fills , And follows one lone traveller ; he With dust upon his garment 's hem Slow walking from Jerusalem . ' T is moonlight silvering thus his hair , It is not age retards his tread ,  --  Acquainted well with grief and care , He hath not where to lay his head . A King , disguised and outcast , wends To rest among his lowly friends . They stay for him their evening meal ; And Mary lingers at the door To see his coming shadow steal Between the palms , along the floor , And anxious Martha wonders why The Master 's footfall draws not nigh . The shadow falls . The step is heard , Like dew descends his calm " All hail ! " The welcome accents of the Lord Float in upon the evening gale , And Lazarus and his sisters twain Forget their orphanage again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Than tenderest mother 's dearer far  --  " Lo ! ye who do my Father 's will My sisters and my brethren are  --  His glory shall ye shew with me , Your hearts our chosen house shall be . " He seats him by the open door , Beneath the palm-tree 's fan-like shade , While Martha guards the household store , Meek Mary will her hair unbraid To wipe the Master 's weary feet That she hath bathed with ointment sweet . While thus her lowly place she keeps , The Saviour talks of death at hand  --  And Mary bows her head , and weeps At words she can not understand . One gentle whisper soothes her pain , " Be sure the dead shall rise again . " Yet , as he speaks , within his eyes A sadness grows , of tears unshed ; Tears that shall fall where Lazarus lies , And not alone for Lazarus dead ; But pitying tears for unbelief  --  For promises forgot in grief . And Lazarus reads , in musings dim , His fate , foreshadowing the Lord 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him ! While all the listening air records ; The moonlight , thro ' the palms swept down , Rests on the Saviour like a crown . Love crowned Thee , Lord , at Bethany  --  Alas ! a heavier coronet Awaited in Gethsemane  --  There , blood-drops round thy brows were set ; Rubies from Sorrow 's deepest mine ; Mysterious crown of Love Divine . Affection 's meed we too would bring  --  Thou wilt our Friend , our Brother be , Who closer to each other cling , Because we closely cleave to Thee . By love o'ershone , by sorrow tried , Forever , Lord , with us abide . Behold , thy scattered family Of human souls , in Thee complete , Looks to the distant hills for Thee , And listens for Thy coming feet ,  --  Oh , bid our guilty discords cease , And let Thy Presence bring us peace ! Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : ELIJAH IN THE DESERT . from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1856 Lo ! it is twilight in the wilderness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whispering boughs , an aged man , Whose faltering footstep fails him in the gloom , Sinks wearily beneath a juniper . He is alone , and sorrowful . But hush ! The anguish of his heart o'erflows : " Enough ! I would not longer bear the load of life ! Alone , alone ! I have not craved the smile Of human sympathy . It has been mine To talk with God as friend communes with friend . And now , how terrible that word ' alone ! ' Through sunset clouds , the manes of winged steeds , And glancing wheels , and white-robed charioteers , Have flashed before me , while I caught a glimpse Of a bright , upward road I hoped to tread , A glorious outlet from the earth to God . Yet were it only that mine eyes grew dim , Holden to see what common mortals see , I would not murmur . But alas , to feel This heart , that scarce knew craven fear by name , Fluttering and cowering like a hunted bird ;  --  To know my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sun to other souls : Jehovah ! if Thou leave me , let me die ! " Now hath he laid his aching head to rest In the dark shadow of the juniper . The light winds gently move his silvery locks That stream , like moonbeams , o'er the sombre turf ; His lips yet tremble with a moaning prayer ; But God hath given his beloved sleep . Can this be he whose dauntless word withstood The boast of Baal 's prophets ? whom the pomp Of Ahab 's regal throne could not abash ? Whose prayer brought down the living fire from heaven , And made the blessed rain forsake the clouds ? What , he this pale old man who sighs for death ? ' T is even so . By sudden flight escaped The cruel fangs of fiendish Jezebel , It is the man of God ,  --  but yet a man . Is he alone ? Nay , listen to the rush Of angel wings ; and see the starry eyes That guard the slumberer , oh , how tenderly ! Sleep veils to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elijah , rise and eat ! " He wakes , and in the cake and water-cruse , He reads his Master 's answer , " Thou must live ! " Again he sleeps ; and lo , again the voice : " Rise , eat , Elijah , there is work to do . " And now , fresh vigor darting through his limbs , Strengthened , and glad of heart , the prophet goes To Horeb , to await Jehovah 's will . How it consoles the tempted one , to know That holy men of old , the men of God , Passed through the same dark conflicts , and were saved . The prayer of faith can never , never fail ; But the wild burst of mortal agony , The wish that heedlessly would thwart His plans , Our Father hears , refuses , and forgives . Say , pilgrim to the New Jerusalem , Into the darkness hast thou wandered far , And weeping , counted thy dark unbelief For God 's forgetfulness ? Ingrate and blind ! And yet thou hast a pitying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely chide . Behold his promise through the gloom descend , Like manna dropping in the wilderness : Receive into thy soul that bread from heaven , And thus grow strong to bear the journey home . Needful to thee , oh pilgrim , is the night , The trial-hour ; needful to test thy faith To quell thy pride , and teach thee where to lean . Our Father often lets his children stray In their own paths , that they may humbly come Back to the way He shows them . And ' t is thus , By bitter anguish and temptation strong , He fits them through the earthquake and the wind , Calmly to listen to the " still , small voice ; " And after , to go bravely through the world , Bearing the banner with a steadfast hand , Counting all shame and sorrow light , Since they have known the hiding of his face . Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : OUR FATHER 'S HOUSE . from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1856 There shall be no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth-road dreary , Oh , we are growing weary And homesick , till our Father His children all shall gather To that calm rest before us , And all our lost restore us , Then there will be no sighing In our dear Father 's house . There shall be no more sinning In our dear Father 's house . The earth-stains we inherit Defile the captive spirit . We 've heard the tempter 's wooing , And risked our soul 's undoing , Our birth-right guilt hath taken And left us crushed , forsaken ; But there will be no sinning In our dear Father 's house . There shall be no more darkness In our dear Father 's house . No sun will shine upon us ; But He whose love hath won us Will lead us to the fountain That flows from Zion 's mountain , And wash our robes to whiteness  --  His smile is heaven 's own brightness . Oh , there will be no darkness In our dear Father 's house . There shall be no more sorrow In our dear Father 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended ; No more of blinded straying ; No wordless anguish preying ; No partings , and no sadness , But peace , and sacred gladness . No , there will be no sorrow In our dear Father 's house . No more of slavish toiling In our dear Father 's house . We seek no slumberous bowers For these unwearying powers . Life is , to be a blessing . O'er sin the vantage pressing God 's own with glad endeavor Shall work his will forever , And find sweet rest in toiling In their dear Father 's house . Oh , for the many mansions Of our dear Father 's house ! For purity from soiling ! For peace from sin 's turmoiling ! Give , Saviour , faith untiring , Give steadfast hope aspiring , Give hearts that tried and proved Shall rest with Thee , Beloved , Rest in the many mansions Of our dear Father 's house .
