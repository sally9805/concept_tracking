ART . IL-IS THE SOUL IMMORTAL On the Scripture Doctrine of Future Punishment . An Argu .. ment . In two parts . By H. H. DOBNEY , Baptist Minister . First American , from the second London edition . New York : published by an Association of Gentlemen . 1849 . Bible Examiner . Edited and published by George Storrs . New York : May and June , 1852 . Contents : the Generations gathered and gathering ; or , the Scripture doctrine concerning Man in death . By J. PANTON , Home Missionary of Cooper 's hall Congregational Church , England . New York , 1852 . THE doctrine of these works is essentially the same . It may be denominated Christian materialism . They profess the profoundest regard for the instructions of the Bible , and claim that their sentiments are eminently promotive of evangelical piety ; but though propounding the same doctrine , they are very unlike in the style of argumentation with which they advocate that ( loctrine . The " Bible Examiner " reminds us of a spy examining the fortifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another to undermine and destroy . He seems to have decreed in his heart , that the Bible must and shall support his doctrine , however horrible the tortures he may inflict upon it to extort the confession he requires ; and when he meets with passages diametrically opposed to the sentiment he inculcates , it is even amusing to notice how valorously and pertinaciously he can bite a file . Mr. Dobney writes in a very different style . He reasons with ingenuity , with much seriousness and apparent candor , and in some of his positions with no contemptible degree of force . After weighing his criticisms , his readers will find it not so easy as some of then ) may have imacrined to vindicate the generally received interpretation of some of the quoted passages of the Bible ; and the air of devoutness and sincerity which pervades his whole work is fitted to win his way to the confidence of his readers , and prepare in the hearts of the incautious a hotbed for the seeds of poisonous errors which he is sowing . Nor is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consideration of their inherent unreasonableness and extravagance . At its first announcement this doctrine of materialism , // with its monstrous offspring , that of annihilation , # appears so manifestly unscriptural and absurd , that we are inclined to meet it with a smile rather than an argument , and to imagine that a grave attempt at refutation will be but drawing a broadsword upon some prodigy of monstrous birth , that will die of itself if we let it alone . But we are not to forget that all error is intrinsically absurd , and that the wildest crudities have often developed themselves into wide-spreading and pernicious systems of delusion . Since Millerism has slain its thousands , what marvel would it be if this improved English edition of Millerism should slay its tens of thousands ? Indeed we regard this form of error as fitted beyond almost any other to gain adherents . Its birthday was ruled by an auspicious star . Infidel materialism has carried its cloven foot uncovered , and can find a welcome only in infidel clubs . Avowed Universalism has assumed its proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion as near as possible to none . And yet the stern old doctrine of eternal retribution grates quite as harshly on the ears of this polite and liberal generation as it did on sturdier ears in the past age of iron . But now we have , advertised to the world , a Christian materialism , reverential in its speech , devotional in its spirit , fervent in its pious zeal , orthodox in ascribing salvation to the merits of a crucified Redeemer , and at the same time killing the worm that was never to die , and extinguishing the fire that was never to be quenched , and offering to unsanctified hearts their choice between the bliss of a holy paradise to be secured by an intensely-dreaded life of self-4enial , and the extinction of all consciousness in a sweet sleep that shall " know no waking . " It will i'equire but a slight semblance of truth to make this a most seductive form of religious error . The formal refutation of such an error is not therefore loading a cannon to shoot a fly , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aim of these writers is to prove that man in his creation was only the noblest of the animals , possessed of no inherent element of immortality ; that in case of transgression he was threatened with the extinction of his existence , such as other animals suffer at death ; that at the dissolution of the body , men are thus deprived of all conscious existence ; that redemption by Christ procures the restoration of such existence in the resurrection , to be continued to the saints in endless bliss , * The advocates of these doctrines scrupulously avoid the use of the term annihilation , but as it is amore convenient form of expression than " a return to blank nothingness , " and conveys the same import , we may be excused from copying their example . // while the wicked shall be sentenced to . a second death , which implies a final return to non-existence . We propose in as concise a manner as we are able to examine these their leading positions . The first question to be considered is this : " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast with other animals , indicate a higher destiny , and so afford presumptive proof of the soul 's immortality ? The fundamental position of these writers is revealed in the following inquiry propounded by Mr. Dobney with a tone of grave assurance : " Looking at the human and lower races together , or as ranged in concentric circles , do we not , so far as mind is concerned , discover something like a dim region where they meet , and almost intermingle ? " We answer pointedly , No , we discover no such dim region . On the contrary , both the history of the creation and our own observation point to a wide and impassable ocean , as lying between rational man and the irrational animals . We place no reliance on the expression , so frequently quoted , that " man became a living soul , " * for we are aware that the same epithet is applied to the inferior animals . But why is it written with so marked an emphasis , as if challenging the wondering attention of every reader , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of God created He him ? " Beasts , birds , stars , sun , were spoken into being by the almost sportive fiat of the Maker 's will . But when this nobler production of creative power was about to greet the ad miring vision of the morning stars , infinite wisdom is represented as pausing in grave deliberation : " And God said , Let us make man in our image after our likeness . " Here was another model , and a new style of workmanship . An element enters into the nature of man , which gives him in his measure a resemblance to the Deity . And are we to understand , that between the likeness of the Eternal Spirit and the likeness of the cattle and the creeping things , there is " something like a dim region , where they meet and almost intermingle ? " Let the naturalist , in his cool delineation of the faculties of the highest order of the animal creation , represent them as made in the image , and possessing the likeness of the eternal God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a use of ' language , as heathenish , and well nigh blasphemous ? The * It may be admitted , that by the word soul is sometimes meant creature , sometimes person , and sometimes a man possessed of animal life , in contrast with a dead body . But by what method of critical torture can it be made , in such passages as the following , to mean anything else than an intelligent , spiritual essence ? 1 Kings xvii , 21 ; Matt. x , 28 ; Heb. x , 39 ; 1 Peter i , 22 ; James v , 20 ; Rev. vi , 9. // 365 history of the creation points out no such near affinity between the lord of this lower world and his irrational subjects . And we discover an equally wide disparity between the human race , and the noblest of the inferior races , in the endowments which they actually exhibit to our observation . Which of the noblest of the animal races , quoted by Mr. D. , is capable of being educated to the use of articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the most industrious and skillful training has ever yet produced , was mere imitative repetition  --  a few senseless parrotings . The power of speech develops itself in the human family so spontaneously , that without an hour 's formal instruction the infant in its nursery becomes capable both of understanding and of employing all the ordinary forms of articulate language . Where is the something like a dim region , " where the parrot and the child can be said to meet and almost intermingle ? The noblest of the animal races display the most remarkable endowment of their nature in the mechanical structures which they rear . The comb of the honey-bee is said to be con structed upon the strictest mathematical principles . Js not here a proof of intellect , and intellect of a high order ? If it were so , why can not the honey-bee build its comb in the form of a prism or of a cylinder as well as in the form of a hexagon ? An automaton can make the movements of a chessboard , and a printing press can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But each of them is limited to one circumscribed form of movement , and acts with precision , according to the intention of an intelligent mind not resident in itself . Instinctive architecture is not the result of reasoning in the architect . Has the bee been instructed in the principles of mathematical science ? The knowledge of a reasoning mind admits of an adaptation to successive objects and in successive forms and an endless variety of applications , and having an intellectual life in itself , that mind is capable of a limitless progress in improvement . And herein consists its immeasurable superiority over the irrational creation . The silkworm spins its thread with admirable skill ; but who can teach it to weave that thread when spun into a beautiful web ? The bird constructs her nest of down , with nicest fitness for a summer dwelling ; but teach her if you can , when wintry storms approach , to frame a sheltering roof above it . The beaver builds a dam , that embodies in its structure the precisest rules of art ; but can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to become the architect of a water-wheel below his dam , or a suspension bridge above it ? The sagacity of animal instinct is not the sagacity of reason . It // 366 Is the Soul Immortal ? is an endowment , not merely inferior in degree , but inferior in its essential nature . There is nothing " like a dim region " to be discovered where they meet and almost intermingle . But the widest contrast is apparent , when we take account of the moral nature of man . We are told that " it is not the closest observer who will be the most startled by Coleridge 's remark about the dawning of a moral nature , which he observed in a dog , of which he says , " We not only value the faithful brute , we attribute worth to him . " Now there are , it is true , several animals that can be taught to exhibit a beautiful imitation of the social affections of the human heart . There can be also awakened in their nature , apparently , the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes obey their God , And bow their necks to men . " But a moral nature , appropriately so called , rises much higher than this , and implies the exercise of a conscience towards God . " Fear God and keep His commandments , for this is the whole of man . " This reaches the supreme purpose for which the Creator made him man . " For , " as is added , " God will bring every work into judgment , with every secret thing , whether it be good or whether it be evil . " In what creature , below the rank of man , has there ever been observed the dawning of the fear of God ? " Where is the religious animal , that has ever been taught to imitate in the slightest conceivable degree , the extasy of holy joy that beamed from the radiant countenance of the seraphic Payson , or the remorseful soul-writhings of the conscience-tortured Earl of Rochester ? We have witnessed those tokens of a moral nature often in men of a very low grade on the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the animal races we find an infinite intervening distance . And why all this wide disparity of endowments , if man was not designed by his Creator for a higher sphere of existence ? Why enriched with these high qualifications for immortality , if the soul was not designed to be immortal ? But did not man 's primeval sin unfit him for an endless existence , and doom him to an utter extinction of his existence ? Mr. Dobney teaches that " the sentence pronounced on Adam in case of transgression , conveyed the sole idea of a cessation of existence  --  a return to that blank nothingness , out of which he was brought ; " and the reason alledged is , that " Adam so understood the threatening , " and that " there is nothing in which it more behooves , or indeed so much behooves , that there // should be perfect and transparent explicitness , as in a sentence , denouncing evil , in case of transgression. ** Is it so indeed ? Does a wise father foretell , with transparent explicitness , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every degree of disobedience ? * Is not he a wise father , whose children understand this , and no more , that if they do that which is evil they are to receive correction such in kind and in degree as his unrevealed judgment shall determine to be proper ? The civil law , it is true , annexes specific penalties to specific crimes , but it does this only as a security against injustice from the hands of arbitrary and incompetent judges ; and even the civil law boasts of no transparent explicitness . The sentence of imprisonment answers to the forewarning of the law ; but the long , lone nights of weariness and of solitude , the chains , the stripes , the impotent agony of burning passion-what has the sufferer previously known of all these ? But the penalty of sin against God can not be foretold with transparent explicitness . Even if nothing were threatened beyond the mortal agony of a dissolving material nature , as Mr. I ) obney teaches , Adam in Eden would be incapable of comprehending even this . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if God has threatened the wicked with the retributions of the unseen world , as these writers admit in respect to those now living in possession of the Scriptures , then the execution of that threatening will undeniably involve the endurance of a l ) unishment , of which the sufferer had previously no adequate or accurate understanding . Mr. Dobney 's position is utterly untenable . When God said to Adam , " In the day thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die , " there was no necessity that Adam should comprehend its full import . He did not and could not comprehend it . If he interpreted it to mean the extinction of his being , which we by no means acknowledge , this interpretation would have no more authority than Mr. Dob ney 's . But that the death foretold to our first parents was not a return to non-existence , we offer this , as an unanswerable proof , that such a construction pointedly impugns the veracity of God . God said , " In the day thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blank nothingness , " he did not die that day . And if , as another writer of the same school asserts , " the term day is used to express a period of over two thousand years , " or if we even extend our generosity beyond that of the geologists , and assign to Adam a demiurgic day , supervening those of the creation , even that will hardly amount to a reprieve of Mr. D 's argument ; for he does not // suppose Adam to have experienced a final return to a condition of blank nothingness , even up to this time . But Adam exhibited no knowledge of demiurgic days . He betrayed his fears of meeting God , on the very evening of the literal day in which he sinned . He understood that the threatening of God was to take effect at once . And , in that respect , he could not mistake its import . He was to die that day , or the word of God would not prove true . Was , then , this word of God fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existence ? If penitent , as is generally believed , will he not , even according to Mr. Dobney 's own doctrine , enjoy an immortal existence ? Where , then , is the veracity of God ? Mr. D 's interpretation makes the word of God emphatically false , and the word of Satan marvelously true . Such a principle of interpretation , applied throughout the Bible , would change every ray of light in it into darkness . The declaration to Adam , " in the day thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die , " was fulfilled in its true intent . Any other doctrine than this implicates the veracity of God . He did die that day , as God 's word is true . But his death was not an obliteration of his existence , and that was not the death God had threatened . What was it ? It was the loss of the favor of God , and subjection to His displeasure . His favor is life , and the loss of His favor is death . The creature who by transgression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he lives and moves and has his being , and has become liable justly to suffer whatever of evil God shall see proper to inflict , has , in so doing , passed from life unto death . In the very day of his doing that iniquity , he dies . And that death , in effect , includes all the specific evils which , in the natural order of events , or by the direct operation of Divine justice , are to be endured by the transgressor , even as the cold , and the pain , and the dreariness , and the aching bitterness of spirit , in his midnight cell , though not specifically enumerated , are yet substantially included in the sentence which dooms a felon to his prison . The sin of the first man thus chained his whole being to the curse of heaven ; and when , subsequently God said to Adam , " Dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return , " it was but one of the bitter consequences of the death he had already experienced . Shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , are equally the concomitants of that same death of deaths , with which the creature is stricken , when he is cut off from the favor of his God . This was the death with which God threatened Adam . And that threatening is not falsified by redemption.4 It was // never declared , that death should place mankind beyond the possibility of a remedy . The word of God to Adam was fulfilled , as His word is always fulfilled , to the last iota of its import ; and Satan was proved to be a liar from the beginning . Adam ate of the forbidden fruit , and in the day that he ate of it , he did " surely die . " But his death was not the extinction of his existence . 1t affords no shadow of evidence against the doctrine of the immortality of the soul , as predicable of all mankind . It was*uch a death as they who fail of a share in redemption , will be dying for ever , the endurance of the wrath of God . The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dust thou art , to dust returnest , Was not spoken of the soul . " But if this was not spoken of the soul , if extinction of existence was not the purport of the threatening , is it nevertheless , actually comprehended in its execution ? Is the dissolution of the body accompanied by the loss of all conscious existence ? If it be so , a foundation is laid for the belief , that , at the last great day they who shall be cast into the lake of fire will speedily return to non-existence , body and soul together . But in opposition to this doctrine we proceed now to establish the proposition , that the soul is capable of existence , independently of a bodily organization , and therefore , whatever destruction may overtake the body , the soul will not be thereby annihilated . The position is confidently taken by Mr. Dobney , that the " scripture recognizes no perf*ctly disembodied state . " From this it would follow , that the termination of this mortal life implies an absolute cessation of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished . " If the scriptures nowhere represent any of the human race as consciously existent , in a perfectly disembodied state , as " naked spirits , " then where is Abraham , David , Isaiah ? Of their material nature there is nothing now in existence , except the elementary particles of which their bodies were composed , and those particles diffused over the earth , and intermingled with other material substances , in an endless die ; but , when Adam had transgressed , instead of fulfilling that threatening , God provided a remedy , and released Adam from the death denounced . So God threatens unbelievers with an endless future perdition : but , how do we know that He will not again cause the event to be as diverse from the dooo denounced , as in the case of Adam ? , We would like to know how they who hold that the threaten . ing was not fulfilled , in the case of Adam , will reply to that argument . // variety of combinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as absolutely as the tree which furnished the fuel to be consumed with his burnt offering . And it is no relief from this conclusion to alledge that in the resurrection God will replace those particles in the very form which originally constituted the body of Abraham , and reanimate that form with a living and conscious spirit . In respect to the existence of an intelligent moral agent , that would be nothing less than a new creation . What conceivable relation couki there be between the man thus brought into existence , and the man who had perished ? An hundred pounds weight of earth once possessed an organized form , and in that form put forth a number of moral actions . After an interval of several thousands of years , the same particles of matter , or perchance not the same , but other particles , are arranged by the Divine power into an animated , though dissimilar organization , a spiritual body , and then rewarded or punished for the deeds which the first organization had performed . Where is the identity between the man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which that retribution is rendered ? There is nothing in common pertaining to them , except the mere mass of earth of which the two bodies are successively composed , and even this , existing in two forms , possessing the greatest possible dissimilarity , the one a natural body and the other a spiritual body . All else that pertained to the first man is annihilated ; and all else pertaining to the other is created out of nothing . If the human race are not existent in a disembodied state as naked spirits , then the death of the body is an actual annihilation of the man , regarded as a responsible agent , and what is called the resurrection can be nothing else than the creation of another man to be held accountable for the moral conduct of the first . But do the Scriptures represent the soul as incapable of existence , independently of a material organization ? Of almost numberless passages bearing directly upon this question , let us direct our attention to a very few . We read of a certain man , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third heavens , and there having heard unspeakable words , but whether in the body or out of the body , he informs us he could not tell . Why could he not tell ? If the soul can have no conscious existence in a disembodied state , how could there be the possibility of a doubt of his having been in the body ? On that supposition , to be out of the body would be equivalent to being out of existence . The soul can exist in connection with a material tenement . It can exist independ // ently of a material tenement , and , in either condition , can see and hear , and know , and feel . And therefore , in the transporting vision of that hour , the Apostle could not tell whether he was in the body or out of the body . The penitent thief , forgetting the agonies of crucifixion in the intenser agony of a guilty conscience , aroused by the ap* proach of a dreadful retribution , appealed for mercy to the dying Saviour at his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to enter into His glory , listened to the suppliant malefactor and breathed peace into his anguished bosom , by saying unto him , " To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise . " IN PARADISE ! And what was the paradise so graciously promised to this penitent believer  --  the first one drawn to Him after he was lifted up from the earth ? " In the tomb , " says the Bible Examiner . And was this , then , the infinite love of Christ , manifested to the guilty , trembling creature that sought mercy at his hands ? Was this the promise of heaven s overflowing grace to a guilt-stricken suppliant ? " To-day thy dead body shall be in the grave with my dead body . " Is this the gift of paradise ? But he was not buried in the same tomb with Christ , for , though Christ " was numbered with the transgressors , " yet , " he was with the rich in his death . " In respect to the disposition made of his body , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his reviling and blaspheming companion . How frigid and spiritless this whole narrative , if you deny the separate existence of the soul ! If you acknowledge it , how beautiful and how touching , " To-day , thy departing soul shall be with me in paradise . " Our Saviour exhorts us to " fear not them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do , but , rather fear him , who , after he hath killed , hath power to cast into hell . " What is it that after he hath killed the body God hath power to cast into hell ? Persecutors have equally as great power over the dead body , as they had over the living man . Wherein consists the contrast between the extent of their power and the extent of God 's power ? Wherein , if not in this , that when the body has been killed there yet remains a living soul , and it is this which , after he hath killed the body , God hath power to cast into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this mortal life to a tabernacle , which is to be taken down , that the inhabitant may enter into a new abode . " I must shortly put off this my tabernacle , " writes the aged Peter . " For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved , " // writes Paul , " we have a building of God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens . " Now , when one is in a tabernacle , is he the tabernacle itself ? And when he puts off this tabernacle , does he thereby lose his own existence ? If the body is a tabernacle , is there not something other than the body , dwelling in it , and capable , when this is dissolved , of entering a building of God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens ? how palpably is this the purport of the Apostle 's own interpretation , " Whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , and to be present with the Lord . To the same purfiort are the Scriptures , which speak of " the spirits of just men made perfect , " " of the spirits in prison , " " of the spirit that returns to God who gave it , " and " of the souls under the altar of them that had been slain for the word of God . " Is not the proposition sustained by irresistible evidence , that the soul is capable of ' existence , independently of a bodily organization ? And if so , by what process of execution is this living soul to be quenched out of a conscious existence ? Disease can not waste it . Torture can not wear out the unearthly fibres of its being . Omnipotence has power indeed to crush it , but , unless quenched by the direct annihilating exercise of Omnipotence , the soul of man has , inherent in it , this fearfully sublime attribute of immortality . There remains to us one further question to be discussed . Has God intimated to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His rational creatures ? Can we learn from the *cril ) tures that the end of a life of sin is the extinction of exist-ence ? Our position touching this point , is , that the force of the representations of ' Scripture are not exhausted by the idea of the annihilation of the wicked . The Scriptures abundantly foretell the destruction of the wicked , and this term is interpreted by these writers to signil* the utter extinction of their whole conscious being . Is not this forcing into the word a meaning that it can not hold ? When a dwelling is burned to ashes , or a mirror is broken into fragments , there is an utter destruction of that object ; but there is nothing like an annihilation of ' its constituent particles . It is ruined in respect to the purpose for which it had been designed , and this is its destruction . And when the faculties of the soul have been debased and abandoned to utter perversion and defilement , and when , as an object of loathing , it is cast away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel dashed forth into the bottomless pit , // never more to have any place in its maker 's complacent regard , how can the fate of that soul be more fitly described , than as an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord ? This interpretation of the term we are able to justify by other examples of Scriptural representation . For many thousands of years past there have been legions of the creatures of God confined in chains under darkness ; receiving the result of their transgression in a condition of conscious , protracted , ceaseless suffering . The punishment of sinning angels was not the extinction of their being . It was a living death . It is and is to be a living death . They are still reserved unto the day of judgment , then to be sentenced to a still continued endurance of a living death . And the formal and explicit prediction of the doom of wicked men , identifies their doom with that of wicked angels- " Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one class is not an extinction of their existence , then , beyond all controversy , the destruction of the other class is not an extinction of their existence . It is an everlasting destruction. * It fulfills the exact purport of this form of expression . Burn a book , a billet of wood , a house-who , in the legitimate use of language , would describe such an event as an everlasting destruction . The destruction of a city might possibly be termed everlasting , as indicating the idea that it should never be rebuilt ; but the very idea of annihilation precludes all possibility of a return to existence , and renders the employment of such a term meaningless , and out of all propriety . It can be termed an utter , or an absolute destruction ; but to apply to it the epithet everlasting , would be a clear violation of the appropriate use of language . Extinction of existence is not everlasting destruction . it is momentary destruction . When existence is absolutely extinguished , the destruction is ended . instead of being everlasting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But an endless condition of ruin in the soul that is cast away and as it were dashed in pieces like a potter 's vessel , and yet retains the eternal consciousness of its abandonment and of its misery-this will be a precise fulfillment of the threatening of everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord . Accordingly , when the Bible speaks of the destruction of a man , or a city , or a nation , * This whole class of writers profess a rigid adherence to the literal sense of Scripture . They certainly have no right to object against the interpretation which makes the term everlasting mean , literally lasting forever . On all hands it must be understood to imply a long continued duration . It is an adjective , not of degree , but of time . // in this world , it is described as an utter destruction ; but the destruction of the wicked , in the world to come , is declared to be an everlasting destruction . There are other forms of expression which corroborate this interpretation* A portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A man led forth to an ignominious execution , may , for the time , suffer shame in his own bosom and the contempt of the observers ; but how can there be everlasting shame and contempt ?

Will he leave the blush of shame to reflect its crimson image upon the eyes of the living universe ages after the subject of that shame has himself ceased to be ; like the pencils of light which astronomers inform us come beaming upon our vision ages after the stars that sent them forth have been swept from the firmament ?

Are not the unjust and the holy assigned alike to a limitless existence , bearing each the ineffaceable stamp of their contrasted characters ? Here our argument reaches its conclusion . Neither of the four leading positions of this christianized materialism will bear examination . We shall still address men as possessed of immortal souls , and warn them against the death that never dies .
