THE VARIETY IN THE HUMAN SPECJES. * THE theory that all men are of one nature and one descent , finds in Rev. Dr. Smyth a very earnest , but not always a judicious advocate . A fraternal sympathy towards all men  --  a world-embracing charity-is alleged as a part motive for the preparation of this work  --  and the author does not forget to give his philanthropy a sufficient expression ; but the great object to which all his sympathies for man , and all his impatience to vindicate true science are made entirely subservient , is the d*fence of the Bi6le . Had not this watchful divine seen , or fancied he saw in the advancing idea of a multiplicity of distinct families of men , a corresponding Races " would ever have received birth . We must therefore regard him , not as the philosopher , or man of science , but as the spiritual champion , clad in the complete Christian mail , and going forth to assail the rebuilt walls of Doubting Castle , and to cut off the head of rejuvenant Infidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighter warfare of the lyceum and the public journals , which he had before waged , he now falls upon the enemies of the faith with the weight of a tome of four hundred pages , in which he seeks to turn all phases of the subject to one point , and combine such an overwhelming flood of evidence , that the authority of the Holy Book shall be rescued from all disrespect , and with it the incident of the infusion and propagation of but one blood in man made a demonstrated truth . But this very reach of his aim , has in part proved fatal to his object , ( so far as regards the incident , ) by causing the lack of unity in his arguments . The inconsistencies of Dr. Smyth 's reasoning and evidence will be noticed in the progress of this article . In our humble opinion , Dr. Smyth has greatly misjudged the nature of the case , in supposing there was any need of his championship of the Bible . We can not see how the truth of the Bible is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisibility of the race dispute its history . We know of no one of them , at present , who does not only fully acknowledge the authority of that history , but who does not even depend on it for a portion of the proof of his theory . The only occasion , then , that Dr. Smyth has for bringing the Bible so prominently into the discussion , is to vindicate his own private interpretation of the sacred writings . He supposes , indeed , that the constructions put upon certain texts by his opponents , if established , would be fatal to the consistency of the whole book , and would sap the whole foundation of the Christian faith ; but this is no more than an opinion , to be weighed against the opinions of those , some of them learned divines , like himself , who hold to the opposite theory . The assumption , therefore , of deftnding the Bible * THE UNiTY OF THE HUMAN RACES , Proved to be the Doctrine of Scripture , Reason , and Science , with a Review of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Thomas Smyth , D.D. , member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . vo*. xxviL-xo . In. 2 // doctrine , is purely gratuitous , and the ardor which the author manifests on this portion of his subject , is exactly that kind of zeal which prompted the church , centuries ago , to reject with horror the great truths relating to the order of the solar system , because they were totally at war with what they considered the doctrine of the Bible . The Bible did not then need such protection  --  and if it ever did , it has certainly long outgrown the necessity of that kind of guardianship . The Book was not sent into the world to limit and restrain men in the search for truth  --  to bind up their minds in ignorance , and perpetuate the reign of old errors ; its mission is the very opposite  --  to set free the human mind  --  to relieve it of the abuses which have clung around it , and clogged its path  --  to lead it in the search for truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago established the divinity of its own origin , while those who were laboring to accomplish that work , were honestly abusing its doctrines , misinterpreting its spirit , and pulling it backward with all their force . With the history of The Book befoxe us , we ought surely to feel very confident of its own ability to vindicate its own truths-very diffident of our capacity to perform for it that service . The effort to do it , betrays , often , not only a presumptuous spirit , but a doubting , hesitating belief-a sad want of the great virtue of faith . We ought certainly , now , to consider the Bible " firmly grounded and established . " With its light shining constantly on our way , we may launch out boldly in the investigations of nature-we may fearlessly acknowledge the truth of what.ever is wellproved , however it may seem for the moment to militate with Bible history or Bible doctrine . We have had sufficient experience to learn that our understandings can neither infallibly comprehend the teachings of the Bible , or the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these may appear to differ at first , eventually we shall find a perfect harmony between nature and the book which has been given us by nature 's God . But Dr. Smyth seems to lack this confident spirit , and to be impressed with the fear , that unless the Bible , or rather his private understanding of it , can be at once established by logical demonstration , it is in danger of falling into infinite discredit . lie repeatedly asserts , in different forms of expression , his continually present idea , that the truth of the Biblc depends on the establishment of his opinions . Thus , on page 337 , he says : " Now this theory is necessarily IIFIDEL . It is in open and direct opposition to the testimony of the Bible . It overthrows not only Moses , but the prophets and apostles also , and thus undermines the Scripture , as a divine record , both of doctrines and of duties ; " and he therefore argues , that " all who believe in it as the word of God , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writ to suit his notions of right and wrong , " says Dr. Nott , an advocate of the theory thus summarily branded Infidel , and as pious , Scripture-believing , and learned a divine , possibly , as Dr. Smyth , who quotes the sentence , but can not sce that it has any application except against the doctrines of its author . Dr. Sniyth 's hostility to our theory probably finds its origin in the fact , that Voltaire and other infidels , as he mentions , have used it to discredit the Bible . Yet we humbly conceive that Dr. Smyth 's opponents are doing more to baffle this infidelity , than he will accomplish , with whatever expense , in this direction , of his biblical zeal . On one point , in fact , he fully agrees with the infidel : viz. , the inconsistency of the theory with the Bible , and so far would satisfy the latter . We , on the // other hand , strike at the very root of the infidel 's argument , and explode his whole effort , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to refute . Of course , the effect of Dr. Smyth 's plan of controversy is to destroy all the value of his book as a scientific investigation , lie starts with his mind pre-occupied-his judgment is fully determined . He believes the Scriptures to assert positively the unity of the race , and he will therefore believe nothing that asserts the contrary . Putting the assumed Bible doctrine in advance , as he does , he can not do otherwise . Whatever evidence appears to controvert the doctrine of the Bible must be rejected- ( or what is the same thing , perverted from its true bearing , ) for the Bible is superior authority to all , and what does not agree with it , is either false in itself or is presented in a false view . What is The worth of the investigation after such an outstart ? But not only will Dr. Smyth not tolerate other understandings of the Bible beside his own , but he will not allow the right of private interpretation to those differing from him . Page 373 , he complains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations of this question , imputing to him , with other " scientific observers " " arrogance and intolerance " in presuming " to interpret and determine the nature of inspiration , and the actual teachings of the Bible . " " They transcend the limits of their sphere and functions , and dogmatize upon that with which they have , as men of science , no concern . " Now , we would charitably inquire , why it is not of the same " concern " to Professor Agassiz and other " men of science , " to sustain their scientific theories by the authority of the Bible , that it is to Dr. Smyth to support his scientific theory with that authority * and why it is not equally as proper for them to " interpret " and " dogmatize " upon the Bible , as it is for one of the clerical profession to enter the ranks of " scientific observers , " and dictate to them what theories they must believe , and what reject-assuming to " interpret and determine scientific truth ' by his understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thought to afford the strongest Biblical support to the theory in question , we shall not assume to prove our own opinion from the Bible , though the argument would bear turning to that point without violence . We shall merely attempt to show that the Bible affords no direct sanction to the theory we oppose ,  --  and shall thus merely rescue the question from a premature and improper decision , and place it on clear scientific ground , to be decided according to the evidence which legitimate inquiry may suborn and reason weigh . It is no part of our argument to put any class of men without the pale of humanity , or to draw any unnecessary distinction between their varieties . To begin with the first chapter of Genesis , the reading would seem plainly to indicate that Adam was the first created man , his creation immediately following the completion of the world , with its vegetable and animal population , and the heavenly bodies ; and in chapter ii. , verse 10 , we are distinctly told , that prior to his creation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But for the same reason that we should derive from the history of the creation the inference that Adam was the first and only created man , we should be obliged to accept many other things , equally derivable from the account , which we know can not be true . Thus , we should be obliged to believe the whole universe was made as an incident to // the birth of our globe , and for the accommodation or beautifying of this infinitesimal grain of the creation . But we have now every reason to believe that the different bodies of the universe were created at widely different periods of time-that in fact , through an eternity of ages , the work of creation has been in regular progression , and that this world was among the latest and most insignificant of the births of time . We understand now , that the inspiration of the sacred historian did not embrace an enlargement of his knowledge relating to the order of the great universe , and that God had no design in his revelation to man to acquaint him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his well-being , or that it came within the scope of his faculties to discover for himself . Beside the great intervals elapsing between the creation of the different bodies of the universe , thus seeming included within the space of four days , we know also that a long period must have elapsed between the creation of the world and that of Adam . That in fact , the world was not originally made by a single immediate act , but that , in conformity with that uniform law of progress , that pervades and has forever pervaded all God 's works , it advanced through a series of stages , in each of which it had a peculiar character , and supported a peculiar population , until it arrived at that high condition necessary for the support of a creature like man . If , then , the historian was ignorant of these things , or knowing them , deemed them extraneous to his narration , intending only to present the great truth that the heavens and the earth were created by the power of God , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects . As we follow the narrative , we shall find that it becomes more and more limited in scope , or rather that it had but the single object from the beginning , to reveal the character of the Almighty , and to trace the origin and history of that particular family of the human race known as his " chosen people . " The immediate family of Adam is noticed no further than it appears to have had connection with that particular branch from which came the tribes of Israel ; and the collaterals of that branch itself are dropped , with usually hut a very brief notice , when mentioned at all , and often spoken of in the manner of heathen and outcasts . There is no reason , therefore , to suppose , that if any others were created cotemporaneously with Adam , the historian must have known it ; and if he had , it would seem to have been foreign to his object to hring them within what is so evidently a national history . Chapter i. , verse 28- " And God blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and multiply , and replenish the earth and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowls of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth . " It is a sufficient explanation of this passage to say , that it does not conflict with either theory . The earth may mean the entire globe , and may mean as well only that part of it which might be needed for the use of Adam and his descendants . Certain it is , however , that the whole earth can never be subdued and replenished by man . The license either way could have referred only to the habitable parts of the earth . " Every living thing " may be properly explained to mean only such as he should meet . Adam could certainly himself have no practical sway over the animals of the polar regions , or of any region beyond his own immediate locality , and the last is true , also , of his descendants . // to Genesis , chapter xi. , verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men began multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them ; that the sons of God saw the daughters of men , that they were fair , and they took them wives of all which they chose . " Dr. Smyth explains that the " sons of God " are to be understood as the Sons of Seth , Enos , and other pious patriarchs , separated from the posterity of Cain , and who found the visible Church . The same , he says , are called by the name of the Lord , " ( Genesis iv. , 26 , ) while others are merely termed men , and their daughters , the " daughters of men . " In allusion to their cruelty , he supposes these men are called " giants , " ( Genesis , vi. , 4 , ) i. e. fallen or apostates . This is altogether a forced interpretation , and especially objectionable from one who insists so strenuously on the strict and literal interpretation of the other parts of this historical account . We have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so designated on account of great stature and enormous strength , making them the terror of other men . This accords with the early history and traditions of all nations , which are replete with stories of giants and terrible men , which , with all their fabric of exaggeration , are not doubted to have a groundwork of truth . The early existence of any nation , is a time peculiarly favorable to the production of such characters , and we know certainly that they have appeared at later times , and even in our own day . But if we deny they were real giants , we have precisely the same reason to deny the records of antediluvian longevity . The phrase " sons of God , " is understood by some to refer to the angels , or some superior beings , who were seduced to earth by the beauty of the " daughters of men , " but this is more fanciful than probable . As the whole species are assumed to have descended from Adam , it is again asserted that they also all came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case is , however , even less decisive than in the first . It is by no means clear that the whole face of the earth was swept by the deluge . Dr. John Pye Smyth has written a very able work to prove that the deluge was limited to a small part of the world , so that other families besides Noah 's escaped . Other writers have maintained the same opinion with much force and ingenuity . But we are not disposed to labor much on this point , as it is quite unnecessary . Whichever way it may be decided , this matter of the deluge , as we shall presently have occasion to show , will sweep down some at least of the pillars of our author 's superstructure . Thus we see there is nothing in the Bible , so far as that book is brought into the inquiry , that proves against us even the starting-point ,  --  the original unity . For all that the Bible decides to the contrary , there may have been ten pairs of human beings created directly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said , it is not our intention to press that point . We shall argue for no more than is necessary to our theory . We will draw no distinctions that can be avoided , being as anxious as Dr. Smyth himself to bring the races as far within a common brotherhood as the case admits . We have re-opened the question which it had been attempted to close by a false judgment , and we are now ready to pursue the inquiry in a proper spirit . If the unity of origin were necessarily connected with the unity of races , afterward , it would be important to bring this point fully forward ; but as such is not the case , we gladly waive any effort to prove that the races of the human kind are descended // September , The Variety in the Human Species . from more than one original man . Farther than this , we are willing , following the inclination of our sympathies , to concede that all the indecisive circumstances taken together , of the language of the sacred history ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the universal adaptation of the gospel  --  the assumed geological marks of the universality of the deluge  --  the traditions said to be found very generally among nations and tribes , of the leading events of the Mosaic historythe dignity of our nature ( here simply an aspiration of man 's ) above that of the animals , who are generally admitted to have proceeded from multiplied creations ,  --  and the non-necessity for any purposes of replenishing the earth , of the creation of more than one human pair-though these aggregately combine nothing like proof ; may . in the absence of positive proof on the other side , be admitted to give the weight of plausibility , or even probability to the theory , that all men descended primarily from Adam , and afterwards from Noah . The investigation comes , then , immediately to the Difference at present observable between the several races , ( or branches of the one race , if the term is preferred , ) and we are to decide whether the types created by these differences are radical and inconvertible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testimony before us gives clear and unequivocal proof that these differences are permanent as the race itself ; and that we are therefore inevitably forced to the belief , that at some period , during the progress of human propagation , constitutional and ineradical differences were introduced , by which the original family was as effectively severed into distinct races as if they had proceeded from different stocks . We shall prove this , by the nature of the distinctions , as they open to our understanding , and by at least the suggestive evidence of the Bible . The time of this division we must place far back in the early ages , as we have the positive testimony of history to the existence of the present varieties back to a very remote period-very nearly to the time of Noah . Now , if we refer to the Scripture for anything suggestive of such an event , at or near that time , we find , first , the curse of Canaan-Genesis , chap . ix . v. 25 ,  --  " And he said , cursed be Canaan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren . " It has been generally supposed that the black race is descended of Canaan , though the opinion is somewhat questioned at this day . Thus , much connection , at the least , may be established between the prediction of Noah and the condition and characteristics of the blacks : that the curse denounced slavery upon the children of Canaan , and implied an odious distinction between them and the descendants of Shem and Japheth . Now , as far as we have any certain history of the black race , it has always been held in slavery ; and the physical features which distinguish it from the white and other races , in the estimation of them all , and even of the negro himself ; positively degrade him below them . But we are not anxious to press this point . Genesis x. 25. - " And unto Eber were born two sons ; the name of the one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided . " What is the meaning of this division ? Does it mean more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us it must have meant much more than this . We must bear in mind , that these people had , like the men of this day , the faculty of acquisitiveness , or desire of isolated individual possession , and all the other selfish and vicious propensities which prompt men to commit injustice to each other , and create disorder in society . Indeed , their evil dispo // sitions are manifested in the next chapter , in a design so impious and daring , as to demand a special and most remarkable interposition of God . It can not , therefore , be supposed that Noah 's descendants had lived in common until this period , owning the land together , and dividing its yield fairly to their mutual support . Only an innocent and purely simple people might live in that manner , but such a system can never exist among a people of active evil propensities , or among one at all advanced in civilization and the arts of life , as the Bible shows us these people were , to a considerable extent , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust dealing among men to make them all anxious to have their own rightful substance separated from that of others , that they may have better guardianship over it . And as the progress of civilization not only stimulates , but is itself chiefly the result of growing acquisitiveness in the individuals of a nation , its tendency to a division of property is inevitable . The division of the land must have occurred quietly and continuously with the progress of the race and the acquirement of settled habits ; and until kings arose , and arrived at that degree of power , when they would claim the right of disposing of the land , each man would take according to his necessities , from unoccupied grounds , and there would be none who could pretend to arrange the " division . " The ownership of the kings or communities would grow up in the same gradual way , so that in any view , the division of the land must have been a gradual and quiet event , and could not have marked the era of any one man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , differs from all this ; its mention in the midst of a genealogical register , shows it to have been a memorable event . It took place at a period wholly within the life of one man , and seems to have been a sudden and remarkable change of the state of things , until then existing . But we have , in fact , positive evidence of the division of the land long previous to this time . Cain builded a city-Jabel was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of such as have cattle ( iv . 20 ) . This mention of a remarkable distinction in the mode of dwelling , joined with that of pursuit , is sufficient to show that they formed a distinct community , probably a more or less civilized one than the others . The " kingdom " of Nimrod , ( x. 10 , ) is also proof that the mere earth was long before parcelled , the limits of his domains being assigned and recognized by others . There can be little doubt , that the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tongues , of which the history is given in the next chapter . Let us now see what was comprehended in that event . Chap . xi . v. 7-9. - The confitsion of languages gives us positive testimony that God did at least , at or near the period in question , effect by a miracle one great change in the nature and condition of men . A change of language , producing a number of essentially different tongues where but one existed before , involves of necessity very material changes in other respects than the mere alteration of spoken sounds . To effect no more than that change , it was necessary that there should be radical changes of the mental action ,  --  the feelings , sympathies , desires , &amp;c . It is a fully established fact , known to all proficients in physiology , that the character of sounds made by any person , are the result of his peculiar organization . The prevalence of certain tastes , dispositions , propensities , feelings , &amp;c. , regulate the expression of the voice , and not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of words which that individual would combine , if he undertook to invent a language . We see this fact clearly illustrated in the comparison of the language of any nation with the characteristics of the people speaking it . The tongue of a barbarous and rough people is always harsh and dissonant ,  --  of a civilized and polished race always flowing and harmonious ; and all the various phases of character are represented by their exactly corresponding shades in the language . The mental change , then , necessary to produce this wtter confusion of languages , must have been very deep and strong  --  a modification of the whole current of feelings , emotions , desires , and opinions . The narration of the Bible shows conclusively that the whole purpose of the Almighty was effected by the simple act of confusing their tongues . The separation was then effected of their own spontaneous desires . Their sympathies had before led them to hold together as " one , " and to have great common objects to which their energies were unitedly applied . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned their common schemes , and felt averse to living together . A mere change in language , if such could have been made alone , would not have altered their social sympathies . On the contrary , we know that it is the disposition of men to congregate more closely under the pressure of sudden evils , especially if they be of an alarming character , and seek mutual aid . As when now , people of different languages , or those having no language , meet , they would have soon made themselves understood by each other ; and in a brief period would have learned their languages , interchangeably , as their descendants have done , and finally would have commingled and fabricated of the whole , a common language , as was done by the Normans and Saxons , our ancestors , and by ninny other nations . We can determine this point with certainty , as we know our progenitors were men like ourselves , having all our faculties ; we know , also , that the principle which produced the confusion of tongues remains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of our nature , to measurement and comprehension . Nothing can be better proved , than that the new disposition to separate , and not merely to part , but to scatter themselves " abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth , " was the effect of a deep and radical change of mental organization . So great a change of mental habit inevitably produced a corresponding change of the modes of action ; for it is clear to every one , that people will act just according to their mental processes . The habits of life were therefore changed  --  a variety of modes of living , pursuits and objects , corresponding to the variety of tongues , must have prevailed . The articles of food , the fashions and substance of dress , the modes of erecting houses , cultivating the earth-of performing all kinds of mechanism , must have changed . And , finally , there must have grown up as many varied forms of the social state-as many different kinds of government , and as many phases of civilization or barbarism . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , or of habits of life should occur , without producing as remarkable physical changes . This is so well understood , that we need not dwell much on this point . We have it , then , established , as we think , too plainly to admit of question , that the confusion of languages was accompanied by very remarkable changes of mental organization , habits of action and physical // characteristics ,  --  more remarkable than any that could be effected by climate , education , and all other causes combined . Now , if the differences before us for investigation are the most remarkable differences we know of in men ,  --  and if , beside , they have that partial distrihution to place and climate which induces the belief with some of these circumstances being their cause , while we see that the miracle of old was intended expressly to scatter them over all the earth , and as certainly as God is a provident being , and the race survived the dispersion , to adapt them to all the climates and circumstances of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the conclusion , that it was at this time and by this miracle , that those varieties , of the race , or a portion of them at least , were created , which we now see in the world ? It is about the time of this confusion of tongues , and the consequent dispersion of the race , that we hear first of the distinction of color in the race . The information is then given us of the existence of black men , by profane history ; and if we believe the distinctions of race to have been created at that time , we then add one more to the remarkable verifications of Scripture which are derived from uninspired history . But the entire absence of all mention of any such distinctions in the record preceding that of the confusion of languages , is good presumptive evidence of the Scripture itself in favor of our opinion , in addition to that derived from the account of that event . Had there been the present vamiety of men living together in the families of Adam and Noah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mentioned as a matter of interest by the historian , but it could hardly have been excluded by actual design , so as to have left a faithful and intelligible history . Moses has thought proper to inform us , that God made woman beautiful ; - that the " daughters of men** were so " fair " as to attract the love of the " sons of God ; " - that there were differences in physical stature and strength ; has explained to us the peculiarities of certain people ,  --  informed us of the mode of living , occupation and kind of property of some ,  --  and it seems to us now impossible that had distinctions existed , which of necessity must exercise such remarkable influences on the characters , social and civil relations , and pursuits of men , that he should have designed or forgotten its mention . And had he done so , still we are certain that the differences would have told their own story by their regular propagation into the family of Israel , or had a separation previously taken place , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may he said in reply , that had such a change as is mentioned occurred , it would have been mentioned by Moses , as being even more remarkable than the confusion of tongues . But we do not mean to assert that this change was effected at once . It is not the usual plan of God to effect important constitutional changes , either in men , animals or worlds , by immediate , single acts . We see changes , of a less magnitude , true , than the one in question , but indicating h*w great changes could be made , going on around us by a gradual progress of natural operations . We suppose , therefore , that the rudiments of the change , only , at first appeared , perhaps in no noticeable degree , and were gradually elaborated to their perfection along equally with the progress of the dispersion they were intended both to occasion and to fit men for . We do not incline at all to believe that the tired workers of Babel , after viewing the upward // extension of their tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , and awoke in the morning to astonish each other with a motley of black , yellow , and red faces , in place of the former universal white ; or that even after parting with an intelligible " good night , " they horrified each other by mutually bidding their morning salutations in an incomprehensible gibberish . It may be said there is , then , no miracle . We are not strenuous about the word , although we can not think the introduction of the principle by which the change was effected , which introduction could be made only by the direct power of God , is unworthy of the name . God performs miracles in all ages , and many that are unnoticed by man . Thus far the suggestive testimony of Scripture . The book before us labors very little to explain the origin of the particular varieties of the race , although it is so much its great aim to show that they all came out from a common source . The author seems aware of the weakness of the theory on that point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent fact , without reference to the cause of division . As a first step , he adduces the opinions of Dr. Prh5hard , Dr. Lawrence and others , " that all the varieties of men can be accounted for by natural causes . " We agree fully with the opinion , but as we shall show , the difference is not for that reason any the less wide and permanent . It is then stated , " that the differences of physical organization , and of moral and intellectual qualities , which characterize the several races of our species , are analogous in kind and degree to those which distinguish the breeds of the domestic animals ; and must , therefore , be accounted for on the same principles ; " and that the most powerful circumstance favoring this production of varieties , " is the state of domestication . " " That external or adventitious causes , such as climate , situation , food , or way of living , have considerable effect in altering the constitution of men and animals ; but that , " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of art or accident , is confined to the individual , not being transmitted by generation , and therefore not affecting the race . " Here the whole ground seems given up  --  and we can not understand how the inference is immediately drawn , " that the human species , therefore , like that of the cow , sheep , horse and pig , and others , is single ; and that all the di , ferences which it exhibits are to be regarded merely as varieties . " But we shall see , again , that Dr. Smyth does not , at other times , remember this concession , but asserts a very large , permanent , and transmissible effect for climate , food , &amp;c . Indeed , immediately following , he quotes Prichard , who , stating that the physical differences of color , form , &amp;c. , between the Arian race in Persia and Hindostan , says , " The cause which has given rise to this diversity can apparently he nothing else than the influence of the hot climate of Hindostan . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect that the variety of complexion in Africa is according to the temperature of its various regions , the " limits of Negroland " being assigned as the tropics on either side . The same circumstances are then traced to Asia and Oceanica , and it is here positively asserted , that " we perceive among them actual and undoubted TRANSFORMATION5 INTO THE MOST EXTREME VARIETIES , and that among the inhabitants of the same place are found also a great variety both of features and complexion , which can only be explained by the difference of food , exposure , and other peculiarities of condition . " He then goes on to quote from different authors , who attribute all the varieties to climate , food , &amp;c. ; and one of // them , Dr. Bachman , endeavors to show the analogy between the operation of these causes upon vegetables and animals , and their operation upon men . Dr. Carpenter is quoted as saying , " that none of the variations which have been pointed out as existing between the ' different races of mankind , have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being entirely destitute of that fixity which is requisite to entitle them to such a rank , " and that " there is a tendency to the fusion of all these varieties , and a return to a common type . " The last authority quoted is " a very curious traditionary legend " of the Tonga Islands , which we are willing , if Dr. Sm yth insists , to receive as having equal pretensions to a foundation in truth with the opinions of the writers he quotes . To refute the theory here laid down , we would really need but to place different parts of the book in juxtaposition : thus , before , it is asserted that the differences of climate , &amp;e. , affect only the individual , not being transmissible , while in another place he quotes approvingly the same author , Prichard , that all these effects are propagated , and " thus even the smallest varieties once produced are never again obliterated . " Which of the contradictory assertions is to be admitted ? If the latter , it admits all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can the larger ones ever be , and how is the alleged transition of race to occur ? Again , he quotes Dr. Wiseman , " that we can dnd sufficient proofs in the languages and in the characteristics of larger bodies , or entire nations , compared , of their transition from one race to another . " If the smallest varieties are not obliterated ever , how can a white be transformed to a black , or a black to a white , or either to a red or deep yellow tint ? Or can a man be both black and white , or red and white , or black and yellow ' at once . The next argument we notice , is the attempt to prove the black race the earliest race of men , and that man was at first created highly civilized , and fell away from that state . This argument is designed to enhance the dignity of black men  --  but so far as regards their superior age , it can be no more a proof of their dignity , either as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proved for all the lower orders of animals , who existed in regular scale of descent according to their distance in advance of the epoch of man 's creation . This idea also adds another to Dr. Smyth 's frequent ine6nsistencies , as we know man was created in the temperate regions of Asia , and for a long time remained there , gradually spreading abroad . If , therefore , the first men were negroes , and lived in that region , and came out from it over the rest of the world , the foundation of the theory relating to climate is wholly pulled away . Again , if ' the argument is true , the reluctant truth is forced upon us , that blaek men had a different origin from the white race-they did not derive their paternity from Adam . There can be no other result , all unconscious of it as our author appears . We have every proof that can exist in the nature of things , that Adam , the original of the white races , ( whether he was or was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n . The nation of Israel was white , and the patriarchs , through whom that family descended directly from Adam , were most certainly like their descendants on one hand , and their progenitor on the other . Had a change of color and features occurred at any time from Adam to Abra* ham , or from Abraham to Jacob or David , the sacred oracles , and oem ' - // tainly the Jewish traditions , so full , so zealously preserved , would have informed us of the remarkable event . These remarks apply with still greater force to the secondary head of the race , Noah , from whose time the period was less to the establishment of the house of Israel , and the records more full . We may be certain that neither Adam nor Noah were black men , and that the patriarchs , as they had one form of religion , one mode of life , one system of education and of opinions , and were of a selected blood , were men marked by common physical and mental characteristics . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged , coming fresh from the hand of his Creator , was physically the glory of his race  --  a perfect man-while to our senses , and in his own judgment , the negro is in this respect vastly the inferior of the white . The other condition assumed , the primeval civilization of the blacks , forces the same results again upon its authors , with equal certainty . Adam certainly was not created in a civilized state , nor did he attain it by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil . When he first became aware of his nakedness , the garment he invented gives no equivocal evidence of a totally undisciplined ingenuity ; and so poorly did his skill serve his convenience , that the Almighty himself made " coats of skins " for the clothing of the untutored pair . The gradual progress of invention to the construction of tents to dwell in  --  the gradual aggregation of power in the hands of a chief or ruler , the embryo of empires-these , and the whole history of which these instances are parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to civilization which other history everywhere records , and which is consistent with all our own observations of man as he is before us at this day . If , therefore , Dr. Smyth and his authorities succeed in proving the negro the earliest race , and civilized in its first state , they infallibly prove that it was created at another and far different time from the white , and is an entirely distinct species . We dislike to consider this argument , for the theory urged , beside not being entirely without support in the arguments offered , is very consistent with the observed order of progress in nature  --  a continual advance from lower to higher orders of being . If we assume that the negro race preceded the white , it will be difficult to avoid the inference that it is a distinct and permanently inferior order , doomed by the inviolable laws of progress , revealed to us by geology , to sink toward its utter extinction , as the powers of the white race expand toward their highest development .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
