LOUIS KOSSUTH AND HIS COUNTRY . THE expected visit of Kossuth to this country-and , perhaps , by the time this shall have been put into print , he will have arrived-renders it proper that we should give some particulars concerning a man who has already filled so large a portion of modern history . In connection with the subject it may be as well to glance at the nature of the struggle of which he was the chief hero , and which seems , on this side of the Atlantic , to be but little understood . Indeed little is known , except that the oldest constitutional monarchy in the world was that of Hungary . The Magyars are oriental in their origin . The exact country from which they came is a mystery , though a tribe in the north of China , now existing , and speaking a tongue very similar to the Magyar , may throw some light on the subject . All that we have in the way of history is an anonymous register of King Bela the Third , in 1170 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the modern Hungary , ) which had been conquered by their ancestors , the Huns , emigrants from the centre of Asia ; that the government at that time was not kingly , but conducted by seven rulers ( chief leaders ) chosen freely by the people . On their entrance into Pannonia , Arpad was chosen as sole ruler , and his descendants long after were elected by the people to tbe same dignity . Saint Stephen , the grandson of Arpad , introduced Christianity into the country in the year 1000 , and was formally crowned King-two crowns having been sent to him , one by the Greek Emperor , and the other by the Pope . These two diadems , united into one , make the crown of St. Stephen , with which , by the Hungarian law , it is necessary for each King to be crowned . With King Stephen came the first written articles of the constitution , containing a series of liberal propositions , voted by the national assembly , and confirmed by the monarch ; astonishing from the fact that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was utterly VOL . VIII . 1*O . V. 2*1EW SERIES . unknown . During the reign of this dynasty , which closed in the thirteenth century , the constitution received several very important additions ; amongst the rest the celebrated Bulla Aurea , which may be regarded as the Aliagna ( Jharta of Hungarian freedom . When the race of Arpad became extinct , the nation resumed the right to choose its rulers ; and among the elected monarchs were some of the most illustrious . Under Louis the Great , in 1300 , the frontiers of Hungary were washed by the Black , Baltic and Adriatic seas ; and under Matthias Corvinus , in 1460 , it became the most powerful of European nations . In 1445 , when Europe was threatened by the Ottoman , who had swallowed up the Greek empire ,  --  after Mohammed the Second , who respected his warlike neighbors , had offered in vain to divide with them the empire of Europe ,  - -  the Magyars entered the field as the champions of Christendom . Mohammed attacked Hungary with two hundred thousand men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a novel weapon . He was met at Belgrade by the celebrated John Hunyadi , the father of Matthias Corvinus , with thirty-five thousand Magyars , and , after three days ' hard fighting , utterly and irretrievably routed . For nearly a century the position of Hungary was a proud one , in spite of many reverses ; but the disastrous battle of Mohats , whereby the Turks were enabled to overrun Hungary , caused the nation to bestow the crown on Ferdinand of IUlapsburg , the then Emperor of Germany ; and with the accession of this monarch were sown the seeds of Hungarian ruin . From that time date all the misfortunes of the Hungarian nation . The most skilful intrigues were directed toward the entire annihilation of the constitution and national existence . To further the infamous purpose , deceit , treachery and violonce were freely employed . Thus it was that the first Hapsburg sat on the Hungarian throne . And it was by a continuance of the same policy , that the Hungarians were compelled to elect 26 // prince after prince of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert the calamity which their clear vision saw to be impending , but were unsuccessful ; and after the royalty was made hereditary in the family of llapsburg , in 1687 , these true-hearted men became objects of relentless persecution . Revolution after revolution was contrived , but invariably betrayed before each had arrived at a crisis , by some one of the foreigners introduced through policy . These plots were quenched by the blood of their projectors ; the executioner received full employment ; and the Zrinyi , Frangepan , Wesselenyl , Nadasdi , and other illustrious families of Hungary were rendered extinct . Another great misfortune which took place after the battle of Mohats , was the separation of Transylvania from Hungary . From the deep hatred and distrust entertained for the new dynasty , it was an easy task for Sigismond Ziipolya to cause Transylvania to revolt and form a distinct sovereignty . Thus it was that Transylvania for a century and a half existed as a separate State , ruled by its own Grand Dukes , who were elected under its constitution , and standing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these powers , and occasionally , under illustrious rulers , the most fearful enemy of both . During the seventeenth century , the Turk , having lost pachalie after pachalic , was , after the capture of Buda , driven forth from Hungarian soil . Transylvania being under the government of a weak chief , and admiring the energy then displayed by the house of llapsburg , submitted to the dominion of the latter . But , having been separated for some time from Hungary , her constitution was really more liberal than that of the latter . Therefore , though she accepted the same sovereign , she remained an independent State . Of these changes it must be observed , that , though Hungary and Transylvania accepted the Austrian Archduke as their sovereign , it was done by virtue of solemn treaty , and in pursuance of their powers as independent nations . In accepting the crown of Hungary , the Archduke of Austria was obliged to give all the necessary guarantees , and by the constitution it was necessary for each succeeding King to be crowned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swearing a solemn oath to uphold the constitution of the realm . In the year 1687 , the royalty was made hereditary in the house of Hapsburg ; and in 1723 , this arrangement was extended , in favor of Maria Theresa , to the descendants of King Charles the Third . This act is known in history as the Pragmatic Sanction . But this Pragmatic Sanction contains nothing but the acceptance and regulation of the law of succession , under the same conditions guaranteed by the coronation oath , and by all the laws preceding and following the compact itself . So far was Hungary from becoming a province of Austria , that to the very year of 1850 , not a single Austrian was allowed to hold office in Hungary . An Austrian was a foreigner in Hungarian law and practice . An Austrian subject was not a citizen of Hungary , and to achieve the privilege of citizenship , had to be naturalized by the same process of law as nn alien from any other foreign country . To uphold the constitution , and to insure its solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hapsburg , was at all times the unremitting care of the Hungarian nation . To possess Hungary without any condition ; to subject the Hungarian nobles and citizens to arbitrary measure* of government ; to reign over the land as though it were but one of their many conquered provinces ; and finally , to merge its nationality in the Austrian empire , made up at all times the fondest wish and highest object of ambition of the house of Hapsburg . Religion and policy were made subservient to this purpose by the Austrian Emperors ; religion and policy were invoked by its opponents to defeat the plans of the Court . Thus the Austrian Government was to be seen favoring ostensibly the cause of Catholicism in Uungary*.and attempting to hide its passion for political conquest under the cloak of a pretended religious zeal . Protestantism in Hungary stood always by the constitution , and would have preferred a league with the Turk to submission to the absolute tendencies of Austria . The attempts , covert and open , for the purpose of defeating the constitutional party , made successively by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend its liberties by force of arms . Attacked in its own bounds , formerly as now , it carried the war into the territories of the // monarch who attempted to impose his rule over it , in violation of his coronation oath . In this way the Hungarian nation was , for successive generations , exposed to all those artifices which ambitious monarchs and their wily counsellors employ to defeat a national opposition to their plans . Valuable rights were thus , by the cdntinual agitation , gradually taken away ; and had it not been for the general opposition , Hungary could not have escaped being conquered in the midst of profound peace . After various movements made by several Kings with the design of destroying Hungarian liberty , and repeated attempts to merge Hungary in Austria , followed by corresponding insurrections , the long struggle begun by Leopold the First was ended in 1 ' 71 1 , by Joseph the First , who by his solemn oath confirmed the ancient constitution . Joseph the Second , having united the most absolute tyranny with highly popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungarian municipalities , and to substitute the use of the German for the Magyar language . In order to further his designs , he raised the Wallachian people against the Magyar nobles in Transylvania , in 1784 ; and gave the example of a war of extermination so successfully imitated by his successor at the present time . This conduct kindled a revolt which was only pacified in 1790 by Leopold the Second , who withdrew his brother 's pretensions and abandoned his invasion of the constitution of the realm . The twenty articles of the diploma of inau*uration in 1790 , by virtue of which Leopold the Second ascended the Hungarian throne , after generally affirming the independence of the Crown , the laws and the privileges of Hungary , among other enactments proceed to decree triennial convocations of the Diet , exclusion of foreigners , viz. , Austrians , from the government , and the residence of the Emperor-King , during a portion of every year , in his Hungarian dominions . They declare that the King can neither make laws nor impose taxes without the consent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least of the Boards of the Hungarian Government , are null and void ; and in the tenth article of the same diploma it is distinctly avowed , that " Hungary , with her appanages , is a free kingdom ; and in regard to her whole legal form of government , including all the tribunals , independent , i. e. , entangled with no other people or kingdom , but having her own consistence and constitution , to be governed accordingly , by her legitimately crowned King , after her peculiar laws and customs . " It is evident then that , by both law and practice , the hereditary States of Austria and Hungary have been always politically separate , and that their only union existed in the identity of their sovereign . The monarch , who was prince by absolute right in his German States , was not King of Hungary until he had been crowned with the crown of St. Stephen , at Presburg , and he had bound himself by a solemn oath to govern the country , with the co-operation of the Diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Joseph the Second , not having given the required guarantees , nor having been crowned according to the prescribed form , was never recognized as sovereign ; his acts and ordinances are void and of no effect ; and his name does not appear upon the list of Hungarian Kings . This indisputable independence of Hungary was farther acknowledged and confirmed by Francis the First , who , when the German empire ceased and determined , assumed the title of Emperor of Austria . In the act drawn lip by him on that occasion , it is distinctly declared , that " the provinces of the Hungarian crown , in their quality as a separate kingdom , are quite distinct from the provinces of the Austrian realm , of which they are not , in any way , a constituent part . " These are the several compacts upon which is founded the rule of the house of Hapsburg over Hungary . Transylvania was acquired by the same house in 1690 , by a compact of several points , and entered not as a portion pf the imperial or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this compact , similar precautions to those previously used by Hungary were taken . But , as we have before said , no entire union took place between Transylvania and Hungary . The only connection between them was , that the King of Hungary , on having been crowned with the diadem of St. Stephen , and complied with the remaining necessary formalities , became ipso facto Grand Duke of Transylvania ; provided that the newlycrowned King dispatched a plenipotentiary to the Transylvanian Diet , who swore in the // name of his master to preserve the constitution . Every fresh accession was then farther ratified by a diploma of the Diet . The nobles and citizens of Hungary enjoyed the same rights in Transylvania as at home , and vice verst , while there was free trade between the two States . But Transylvania had her own legislature , her own government , separate and distinct from that of Hungary . The two countries , thus separated , continued to preserve their constitutional liberties against the machinations of the Court of Vienna , and in spite of intrigue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor , as independent States . It is of interest to the public and of importance to our design , that the peculiar features of the Hungarian and Transylvanian constitutions should be explained . The investigation becomes doubly important from the fact that these are the oldest guaranteed forms of government in Europe ; their origin lost in the forgotten past , and their provisions preserved through a lapse of ages , amidst violence , intrigues , and commotion . The Hungarian constitution was based upon principles of the most liberal character ; but its provisions , until the year 1848 , were confined solely to the nobility . Till then the nobility was the nation . The Hungarian noble was the freest man in the universe , having all possible liberties and benefits , being entirely the master of his own actions , and having his personal security guaranteed by the first article of the constitution . That instrument contains the initiatory words : " Nobilis , nisi legitim*i citatus atque convictus , aggravari potest. " - " The noble , unless justly arraigned and convicted , can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing except slaves to the most absolute tyranny . And it is to be noted that the privileges of nobility were not alone conferred upon the Magyars ; the nobles of the other races in Hungary enjoyed the same privileges . It may be remarked in connection with this , that the nobles of the different races , with the exception of a very few , joined the Magyar nobles and people during the recent struggle , and the Croatian Ban , Jellachich , was obliged to use martial force to repress the Croatian nobles of Turopolya . The legislative power was of course in the hands of these nobles ; and both in Hungary and Transylvania resided in bodies known as Diets . The Diet of Hungary consisted of two houses , the upper , or House of Magnates , and the lower , or House of Representatives . The upper house was presided over by the Palatine , who , as the chief executive officer , or governor of Hungary , was elected for life by the Hungarian Diet . The House of Magnates was composed of the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Baron , the Ban of Croatia , the Bishops and prelates of the Catholic Church , and the Mayors of the several departments or counties , each having a vote . The lower house was presided over by a person appointed by the King , and consisted of deputies elected by the counties . Hungary was divided into fifty-two departments or counties , each of which met quarterly under the presidency of its Mayor , or in his absence , the Vice-Mayor . We have given the name of Mayor to these functionaries for want of a better English synonyme . The words in Magyar are F6 Isp&amp;ny and At Isp&amp;ny ; or in Latin ,  --  supremus comes and vice comes . These , it is curious to note , are the Latin names of offices under the English common law , from whence arose the titles of Earl and Viscount . The duties of the Hung*trian officers are not exactly the same , though their powers are somewhat analogous . As chief of the county , supremus comes , the word Mayor is the best that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble residing or having property within their bounds was a member . Their duty at their meetings was to discuss and decide upon all matters of interest to the portion under their jurisdiction ; to watch over the domestic administration and policy ; and to amend , alter and abolish their own constitution , except when such action conflicted with the fundamental law of the realm . These local legislatures had also the power to elect the various officeholders , with the exception of the Mayors , who were nominated by the King . This election for officers was called a restoration , and was conducted by the Mayor . Of late years the Government , having aspired to virtually control the municipalities by electing the officers , caused a great disturbance by their intrigues and made the elections scenes of great excitement . Every county , without regard to its population or extent , was entitled // to send two deputies to the Diet . The National Assembly of Croatia possessed the right to send three deputies to the Diet . The capitals and convents of the Catholic Church sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deputies of the free royal towns had the same privilege . Some years since the lower house began to attain greater weight from the fact that its members were the representatives of the majority of the privileged class , and were provided with special instructions from their constituents , which they were sworn to obey . The attit*ude of the lower house assumed more importance at each succeeding session , and began to display an incontestable tendency to important reforms . In the lower house was deposited the right of initiating all measures . A bill introduced and passed by it was transmitted to the upper house ; and if there successful , was submitted to the King for confirmation . At the first submission the King had the right to send the bill back with his objections , but if it again passed both houses , the monarch was obliged to confirm it upon the last day of session ; appearing in person at that time to assent to the several bills and close the Diet . As provided in the diploma of inauguration of 1,790 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a special decree of the King , and opened by the latter or a plenipotentiary . Besides the business of ordinary legislation , the Diet voted such subsidies as they thought proper for the maintenance of the army during a space of three years , and the sum they appropriated was collected and paid over to the Austrian Minister of War . The financial affairs of the nation , after the amount required for the purpose was determined by the Diet , were regulated by the several counties . It was the duty of those bodies to raise the amount voted by the Diet for the civil and military expenses of the general government , as well as to obtain and control the necessary funds required in the civil government of their own jurisdictions . The constitution and political existence of Transylvania were based upon the very principle of absurdity ; and though somewhat tolerable under their own Dukes , were necessarily disastrous under the dominion of the house of llapsburg . The constitution seems to have been erected upon seven sins , namely , three races and four religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . The privileged three races were the Magyar , the Szekler , both of whom spoke the same language , and the Saxon . Each of these had its own designated territory . The Hungarian division was subdivided into thirteen counties , organized similarly to the counties in Hungary ; the territory of the Szeklers into five , and that of the Saxons into eleven subdivisions , with a special organization differing each from the other , and from the Magyar . The privileged four religions were the Catholic , the Calvinist , the Lutheran , and the Unitarian . All these different races were represented in the Diet ; and all the elective employments of state , from the governor of Transylvania down to the lowest counsellor , were divided equally between the four religions . According to law it made no matter if a competitor for office of another religion were better qualified , as the employments were distributed not according to the capacity of the candidates , but the nature of the religious belief they avowed . The consequence of this was an exceedingly creditable display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the needy office-hunters . The 7ransylvanian Diet consisted of but one house , and was composed ofFirstly , The deputies elected by the departments of the several races , every department sending two members . In the Hungarian counties the election was the same as in Hungary proper , the fundamental institution being based upon the nobility . The Szeklers being a tribe of nobles and enjoying special privileges , every Szekler was an elector . The Szekler counties had also the right to elect their own Mayors , a privilege enjoy*d by n* others . The Saxons were possessed of civil institutions different from the Magyars , somewhat tinged with the principles of the old Roman constitutions , and in theory based upon liberty and equality ; but in practice , through the intrigues of the Court and the influence of the bureaucratic league , they became instruments of tyranny . Secondly , The deputies from the privileged towns , two from each . Thirdly , The deputies from the single capital and convent of the Catholic Church . All these deputies had individually votes . // Fourthly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation by special letters of appointment , given by the Grand Duke , usually called littercs regales , royal letters , whence these deputies were called Regalists . Thus it was in Transylvania , that only such of the nobles as were friends to tbe monarch entered the Diet . Fifthly , The bishops of the Catholic and the united Greek Church . This Diet was presided over by an elective president , whose station was the most important in Transylvania . Besides exercising the law-making power , the Diet elected the principal office-holders , from the governor of Transylvania down . But in these elections the four religions we have before given were obliged to be respected ; and for every office three candidates of each religion were chosen and nominated to the sovereign , who selected from these . But the King was bound in his choice to respect the same principles , and divide his gift of life-offices among the favored beliefs . According to the compact made in 1690 with the house of Hapsburg , the Diet was to be convoked annually by a special minister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the King , who had a right to send them back with his objections , which were to be respectfully considered . Unfortunately , there was no limit as to the time in which a bill should be returned , and frequently very necessary bills of immediate importance were retained some half a century by the supreme power , in order to give proper consideration . The deputies from . the towns in Transylvania , and the meipbers of the lower house , were paid from the public treasury ; but the nobles and bishops , being supposed to represent their own interests , obtained no compensation . Such were the peculiarities of the two constitutions , at the incipiency of the struggle for reform and freedom ; and the formation of the legislative bodies was found to be the greatest bar to advancement . The members of the upper house in Hungary , and the regalists in Transylvania , were the principal tools employed by the Austrian Government to carry out their darling wish , and undermine the structure of Hungarian nationality . In Hungary , the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the progressive nobles . Though the lower house could initiate a bill , the upper could stop it of course ; and any measure displeasing to the Court of Vienna met with a prompt negative by her noble-born instruments . In Transylvania , the number of regalists not being determined by law , the monarch could at any time control the whole legislation by his creatures . Thus it was that there crept into the Transylvanian Diet a set of miserable conservatives , whose sole ambition was to pander to the views of the Court . And the regalists were farther assisted by the twenty-two representatives of the Saxons , who never hesitated to take any position they could , antagonistic to the welfare of the Hungarian constitution ; and the representatives of the Szekler and Magyar races , and of the free towns , were constantly in danger of being overwhelmed by the Saxons and an indefinite number of regalists . A constitution so illiberal as each of these , however well it might have answered in a darker time , was maniftstly out of keeping with the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to effect a reform . The constitution of Hungary had a tendency , though based upon aristocratic principles , to improvement ; but so active were the intrigues of the ruling house against the liberty of the nation , that the Diet for a long while had enough to do to ward off these blows of the Court . Francis the First , after having , as previously stated , accepted and sanctioned the conditions imposed on Leopold the Second , and re-affirmed his acceptance in the act by which he created himself Emperor of Austria , convoked the Diet regularly , according to law . But during that time the nation was too much occupied with wars and rumors of wars , to proceed regularly or zealously with constitutional or social reforms . The chivalrous nature of Hungary , *nd her loyalty to the crown of St. Stephen , led her to submit to repeated demands for men and money , without exacting in return an abatement of grievances . When the victories of Napoleon were shattering the unity of Austria , the Diet was reminded of its response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to their liberality was answered with devotion if not enthusiasm . Even when the Hungarians had grown weary of a war wherein they had performed the giant 's labor for the dwarf 's reward , the near approach of the invader made them firmer // qwq the privileges of the nobles , and these last continually endangered by the acts of absolutism . The pride and alarm of the noble Diet kept it aloof from the great idea of the nineteenth century , until a leader appeared in the person of Count Stephen Szech6nyi , to raise the banner of democracy and progress . Szech6nyi , a member of one of the most illustrious houses of Hungary , wealthy , well educated , with a mind improved by travel , and having natural talents of a high order , espoused the cause of liberalism with ardor , and soon roused the vast body of the nation to a sense of its wants , and an expression of its wishes . With him were soon found nobles , priests and people , and the popular tide began to flow with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoked the Court . Suddenly , in the midst of the war of parties , the active agitation of the progressives , and the steady resistance pf the Court party , there sprang , Minervalike , from the head of the revolutionary Jove , that man now known as Kossuth the Exile , but to be recorded in history as Kossuth the Great . Louis KossuTil was born of a noble Hungarian family , in the county of Zempleny . He received his education in the Protestant coilege at Sarospatak . As a boy he displayed every token of a strong intellect . After graduating with high honors , he commenced the study of law at Epeijes , and was finally admitted to the bar . As a young lawyer he went to Presburg to increase his knowledge of constitutional law . Arriving at or about the time when the publication of the debates and proceedings of the Diet was suppressed by a royal decree , he became an intimate acquaintance of Szech6nyi and Wesselenyi . By their assistance he began to prepare and disseminate , in writing , secret reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially so long as it escaped the knowledge of the Austrian Cabinet . He wrote with great facility and dispatch , and the patriots throughout the country received early and authentic information of every measure before the legislature . But the spies of the Court soon discovered this movement , and at once subjected the volunteer reporter to determined prosecutions . Numerous other liberal members were indicted at the same time , Wesselenyi for instance , and condemned . Kossuth fared no better than his associates , and was doomed to suffer two years ' imprisonment at Pest . During the time of his incarceration , he devoted himself earnestly to the study of the languages and mathematics . When the amnesty was proclaimed , he was released in common with other political prisoners , and came from the Austrian dungeon , weakened in health , but with a mind enlarged by study and reflection . His suffering in a good cause and the preeminence of his talents attracted public attention and achieved popular support ; so that not long after his enlargement he was enabled to stand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new character to Hungarian joumalism . The carefully-prepared lending articles in his paper were ardently read over the whole country , and gave a new impulse to political movements . The most important points of the reforms demanded were explained in that lucid , stirring and eloquent style which characterized every effusion from his pen . As a noble of Hungary , and consequently member of the county legislature , he took an active part in the general meetings of the Council at Pesth , where he began his career as a public speaker . His extraordinary oratorical efforts thrilled his auditors like an electrIc shock , and the whole assembly vibrated with his almost magical eloquence . His masterly speeches produced a similar effect in print . Sent by thousands to all parts of Hungary , they produced the same enthusiasm as at Pest , and won for him the love and confidence of the nation . It was at this part of his career that he met the opposition of Szech6nyi , and hence it was that the attacks of the latter were unjustly said to be dicta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely possible for us to give an idea of the oratory of Kossuth . A friend of ours who heard him says that his style is more like that of Canning , the once celebrated English Minister , than any other . The most engaging manners and fine features were combined with an evidently tender feeling for the whole human race , which displayed , itself in every gesture . On all occasions and on all subjects his reasoning was purely logical , and arrayed in the fittest words ; his sentences , pronounced in silvery tones , pierced the very souls of his hearers . His occasional touches of pathos would draw // tears from the most impenetrable , and his thrilling appeals excite the most impassive to the utmost of patriotic enthusiasm . When inveighing against tyranny and despotic innovations , his soft eyes changed their character , assumed a preternatural brightness , and shot forth indignant flashes ; his usually kind manner changed to a stern determination ; and his defiant position was that of a gladiator in the arena . Oratory such as this , combining mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its object ; and beneath the storm it produced , the whole country rocked and heaved like a tempestuous sea . This extraordinary effect , and the consequent popularity of Kossuth , were by no means to the taste of the Court ; but there was no mode to act , under the letter of law , against the zealous reformer . All his proceedings were confined within the strict limits of the constitution and laws , and would not have been dangerous were they not performed in an extraordinary manner , by an extraordinary man . The Court feared to take any grossly illegal step lest it might precipitate matters to a crisis ; but it neglected no means to stay the proceedings or weaken the influence of its great opponent . The first act of the Court was to silence his editorial voice  --  to remove him from the editorial control of his paper . The owner of this journal was a book-seller and publisher in Pest . Him the Court commenced to persecute , and after having exposed him to numerous assaults and vexations , threatened to suppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . The owner , to save his property and perhaps his liberty , acceded , and another person was obtained to attend to the editorial duties . Kossuth , thus removed from his vantage ground , demanded , as a free citizen , the authority to become proprietor and publisher of a new journal ; but this he could not obtain . All his political agitation was now concentrated in the county meetings , where he continued daily to display greater tact and talent than ever . The Court resolved to remove him from this stage , and urged its partisans to object to his admission to the meetings of the local legislature on the ground that he had no property in the bounds of the county , and consequently had no right of membership in the municipality . This objection , pitiful as it was , would have been sufficient ; but the patriotic party at once united , and soon disarmed that objection by conveying to him an estate . Thus the Court was foiled in that endeavor . Kossuth still continued his political labors . Having been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , his adherents increased their numbers immensely , and his influence augmented in proportion . He entered into all the progressive associations ; and if a society were formed for the development of any branch of industry , or the achievement of any particular or general public good , his name was to be seen among its earliest subscribers . His character at this period was as pure as it always continued to be ; and of that it is enough to say , that with the control of the whole treasury in his hands , he took from the country when he fled but five hundred ducats ; and his family , when in an Austrian dungeon , were absolutely exposed to want . During a number of years he continued an incessant agitation ; and when the Diet of 1 847 was convoked , he was elected a member of the lower house . From that time forth his biography is so intimately connected with the history of his country , that to resume our summary will readily satisfy the reader . In spite *of all the machinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day . The house of Hapsburg saw , with chagrin and mortification , that every step it had taken only served to alienate the confidence of its own partisans , and beheld its power becoming weaker every day through its own ill-judged perfidy . The common sense of the nation readily penetrated the ultimate aim of the dominant house , which was the extinction of Hungarian nationality . The bold advocacy of reform and emancipation by Kossuth. and tke liberalists arrayed on their side the young , the generous , and the patriotic ; while the ruin that must ensue if Hungary were made a mere appanage to Austria , aroused the faltering and alarmed the conservative . A gradual and firm union , for the sake of their fatherland , ensued among all classes ; and this token of a popular storm struck dismay into the hearts of the Camarilla . In 1845-6 the Court made its last constitutional efforts , by displacing all the county Mayors who were suspected of the least inclination to liberalism , and supplying their places with crea // tures of its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it , was complete , the salaries of the Mayors were considerably augmented , partly to render the office desirable to avaricious nobles , and partly to fortify their extraordinary purity with a golden armor , utterly impervious to the attacks of honor or patriotism . At the same time it made it obligatory upon these Mayors to reside constantly within the bounds of their jurisdictions , and forced them to assist and lead in all measures of legislation and administration in their several counties ; thus giving them a power to which they were not entitled either by law or custom . Nor did it stop here . Determined to organize if possible a strong conservative , or rather retrograde party , the Government convoked the Transylvanian Diet in 1846 for the purpose of regulating the existing feudal system . The Camarilla judged with correctness that this subject would excite the alarm of the timid nobles , and unite at once all the strong conservative elements . It was a shrewd view of things ; and the motion was proved , by its results , to have been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in such great numbers that the liberalists gave way ; the elections went by default , and the retrograde Diet was chosen . Elated at this success , the Court endeavored to succeed on a larger field , and proceeded , in 1847 , to convoke the Diet of Hungary . The proceedings of the Transylvanian Diet were so far satisfactory to the Court , and the hope of ultimately reducing the country to a provincial positi*on became so strong , that it suffered the Diet to vote a new feudal law . This , however , was one which could not be popular . It did not give a single material advantage to the laboring class  --  the broad substructure upon which every nation must rest , and without whose content and comfort no nation can prosper . It contained a number of fine flourisheswords of encouragement and praise-but did not lift a straw 's weight of burthen from the backs of the trodden serfs . Such a law could not satisfy the people . It was begotten by egotism and stupidity , and sanctioned by ignorance and inexperience-unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given through a cunning policy on the part of the Court , who had observed how much easier it is to invade nationality when one portion of a people is discontented with another . The true patriot beheld with pain these triumphs of tyranny , whether of the Court or the conservative nobles , and observed with mingled anger and alarm the state of affairs in Transylvania . The hopes of the truly liberal party were now concentrated on the action of Hungary , whose Diet was to open in 1847 . The county elections began , and the result was awaited by both parties with anxiety . Every measure was taken by the Court to arrest the progress of political freedom ; and all these plans were frustrated by the zealous and energetic efforts of Kossuth and his compatriots . The elections over , it was found that the progressive party had achieved a decided triumph . Louis Kossuth himself and his friends were elected ; and great reforms were under the circumstances to be expected . The Court saw its hopes and designs thwarted by the sound common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force upon the office of Palatine , in order to obtain it for a member of the reigning house . No individual could have been chosen for such a purpose with more judgment than he whom they offered as a candidate-the Archduke Stephen . He was the soil of the Archduke Joseph , who for more than half a century had exercised the office of Palatine ; he was born at Buda , in Hungary ; had been educated at a Hungarian university , and spoke with ease and fluency the Magyar language . The election of Palatine being fixed for the next Diet , the Archduke opened , the electioneering campaign some months before the session was to begin . In the conduct of this he showed himself an able tactician , and displayed a degree of finesse which would have done no discredit to the shm:ewdest .. *tump candidate that ever kissed all the ugly babies in his district , or inquired particularly and affectionately after the welfare of the wife and family of some till then unnoticed voter . He travelled around the country , visiting every place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air possible , and declaiming loudly and earnestly on the progress in prosperity and material reform which the country would soon be able to make . The bait took , and the people swallowed it , hook and all . Every one was delighted with the affability and patriotism of the Archduke ; // even the most mistrustful thought him to be " a marvellously proper man the Diet met , and he was elected to the office of Palatine . The Diet of 1847-8 , from the opening of its session , displayed a determination to effect by all peaceable and constitutional means the most decided and practical reforms . The lower house was composed of the most illustrious patriots and statesmen in the land . Among these Kossuth Laj6s , known in England as Louis Kossuth , stood at first conspicuous , and ultimately preeminent . Not long after the opening of the debates , by the fascination of his incomparable eloquence and that magical power which men of mark exercise over a deliberative body , he became recognized as the leader of the House of Representatives . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liberalism obtained a strong hold . The magnates began to discover that the true interest of the rich and noble was to better the condition of the poor and lowborn , since no society could thrive without it . The new generation of nobles were to a man reformers ; and the Court beheld with profound astonishment the whole tendency and character of the upper house , their once strong ally , entirely changed . The very nobles who had been supposed to be most firmly in the interest of the Camarilla now followed the lead of Count Louis Bathyani , and strove manfully for the honor , independence and prosperity of the country , and the emancipation and political regeneration of the people . This favorable condition of affairs was no little increased by the position assumed by the clergy , which was utterly unexpected by the liberals . This change in clerical action was owing to a gross blunder committed by the Court  --  a political error injurious to themselves , and advantageous to the friends of freedom . The Catholic clergy , being immensely rich in Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and clerical position combined are sure to confer . Regarding this body as one of the firmest props of absolutism , the house of Hapsburg treated it with every kindness and consideration ; and , in return , the clergy was careful to maintain the odious position of representative of arch-conservative doctrines . Some years since a decree was issued from the Vatican at Rome , which cornmanded the suppression of mixed marriages in the Catholic Church . The clergy of Hungary received the same order , and having been assured by the Court of its protection , boldly proceeded to the execution of their duty as priests and prelates . Their steps made the most lively impression upon the public mind ; the sessions of the county legislatures became scenes of a quite tumultuous discussion of the subject , and the warmest remonstrances were addressed to the Court ; but the latter remaining impassable , the clergy proceeded to stop , by all means in their power , the mixed marriages . By these proceedings the Catholic Church of Hungary lost thousands of members , who passed over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once assailed the Court with energetic demands for a prohibition of this wholesale apostasy ; but the Court feared to make the experiment . It rightly judged that in such a case its weakened influence would be utterly destroyed ; consequently , the change of religion on the part of all those who wished to marry in an opposite faith continued and increased daily . It was natural to suppose that the coming Diet would have a stormy session , and still more natural to expect that the course of the clergy would be vehemently attacked in that body . The clergy expected this , but having a promise of assistance and support from the Court , appeared boldly and proudly in the Diet . The attack , as expected , was made , with bitterness and freedom of invective . But , to the utter astonishment of the clerical members , not one of the Court party rose to defend the Church , but remained utterly unimpressed , and calm if not amused observers of the scene . For what reason did the Court abandon their allies ? or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of neglect ? Judging 1'rom other circumstances , or rather in connection with ' other circumstances , it might be considered one of those blunders which the house of Hapsburg is so liable to commit . Whatever might have been the cause , the effect was one of importance to the liberal movement . For the clergy felt itself abandoned by the Court , exposed to the continual assaults of its enemies , and abased in the public esteem . A blow had been struck at its influence which could not be forgotten ; and it only awaited an opportunity to repay the treatment of the Court , and regain its forfeited position . // The year 1*4 ' 7 approached ; the Diet was to be opened ; the signs of the times indicated that the proceedings of this Diet would possess as much interest as any that were recorded in the annals of Hungary , judging from the members elect of the lower house , and the increased number of the opposition in the upper ) under the leadership of Count Louis Bathyani ; but no one hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was an agreeable surprise for the patriotic , and a terrible shock to the Court party . The ancient constitution of Hungary is a very liberal one fer the time during which it was made . Perhaps its greatest defect was that it gave a too extravagant liberty to its citizens . But the privileges it conferred , the rights it defended , were those of a certain class alone  --  the nobility ; and even in that class it allowed distinctions . The common people  --  the life 's blood of a state-were excluded from a participation in the act of government , and from the full protection of the fundamental laws . It was not to be expected that such a constitution could remain in the nineteenth century . Its existence was a libel upon the intelligence of the people-a bar to the prosperity of the country . It needed , to render it of value , the most essential reforms . This the privileged class saw plainly enough , and they determined to confer upon the mass of the people the right of citizenship and political power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , were regarded as these : To lessen or utterly remove the distinction between the privileged and unprivileged classes ; to improve the principles of taxation and of land tenure ; to e'xtend perfect religious toleration to all religious sects and creeds ; to establish free trade with all nations-for the Austrian Government thought to confine Hungary to Austria for a market , while treating Hungarian produce as foreign ; to maintain a free press , and especially the right to publish the debates and proceedings of the Diet ; to develop the great resources of the country by means of railroads , bridges , and other plans of internal improvement ; and finally , but as important as any , and more so than most , to provide for a system of general education . These were the reforms demanded by all classes , and predetermined upon by the liberal party in both houses . One mode of resistance by Austria to liberal movements was to extinguish parliamentary bills by the veto of the crown ; the fear of which had paralyzed the upper house , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hungarians had no adequate constitutional weapon to use , since the Austrian Cabinet was not responsible to the Hungarian Diet . The often-repeated declaration of their independence of Austria by their sovereign , and in particular the distinct compact of Leopold the Second in 1790-91 , justified them in endeavoring by peaceable means to obtain an independent ministry , directly responsible to their own Diet . Such a ministry had been long talked of and claimed in the Diet . In fact , the conservative party and the opposition had differed little as to the objects at which they aimed , but chiefly in the degree of vehemence in which matters should be urged ; the conservatives pleading to give time to the Austrian Court . But in 1848 the conservatives as a separate party were destroyed , the great body of them going over to the opposition . Thus it was that Louis Kossuth carried , by a unanimous vote , the resolve that the constitution of hungary would never be free from the eternal machinations of the Austrian Cabinet until a constitutional government was established in the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalities as they were at the period when the Diet conferred the sovereignty on the house of Hapsburg . A series of reforms were now carried in quick succession after the termination of a discussion which had commenced with the advent of Szech6nyi into political life . Now , in looking at the events of the Hungarian struggle , the people of this country have been frequently led into gross errors , but to none more manifestly mischievous than the impression as to the nature of the commencement of the struggle . For not only was the contest no insurrection against established authority , but the reforms of 1848 were neither won by fraud nor violence . An assertion that the changes were made by force has been put forth by Austria as a sort of palliation for the commission of cruelties which have made her the detestation of the civilized world . On the contrary , every change was wrought in a constitutional manner , through legal forms , and by peaceful means . And this was the more striking // 38 ' 7 since there was every provocation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurp the powers lodged elsewhere by the compact to which it owes its right of rule ; when it invades that fundamental law upon which alone its own authority is based ; when it endeavors to debase an independent people to a provincial position , and to put their guaranteed rights at the mercy of absolute iiill ; then , indeed , we may hold , with Robespierre , that insurrection becomes the most sacred of rights , and the most indispensable of duties . The Hungarians took no advantage of these crimes on the part of the Court . Determined to emancipate the great mass of the people from fetters imposed by the ignorance and bigotry of past ages , and to place their country on the utmost pinnacle of civilization , they were content that the executive power should remain vested in the house of flapsburg . They had neither design nor desire to overthrow the reigning dynasty . There was no intention to depose Ferdinand . The purpose of the reformers was an honest one . They wished to emancipate the people ; to recreate the nation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasty . And that could be done without any infraction of the compact between prince and people . The nobles desired to curtail themselves of privileges which were in direct antagonism to the spirit of the century ; they proposed to raise the hitherto down-trodden serf to a political equality with themselves . But they felt it was consistent with the dignity of their purpose to do this remodelling of a constitution within the pale of the constitution . Every measure brought forward , every refo*m urged , was as strictly pressed and ultiinately achieved under the forms of jurisprudence , as the most conservative champion of law and order could desire . All was done with the apparent concurrence of the viceroy , the Archduke Stephen , who seemed to identify the cause of the country with his own . The Emperor-King , Ferdinand , displayed the greatest desire to comply with and complete the wishes of the people ; and the latter showed no inclination to abridge a reign which promised in its close to be so brilliant and glorious . During that memorable Diet of 1848-9 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culmination . The independence of the realm appeared to be assured ; all the reforms immediately necessary had passed the Diet and been confirmed by the sovereign . The constitution was extended to all classes , and civil equality announced . The ancient Diet , constituted of or elected by the nobility , was changed into a true House of Representatives , whose constituents were a class hitherto excluded from the privilege of suffiage . The feudal system was abolished , and millions of inhabitants , formerly serfs , became at once citizens and freeholders , receiving , on a promise to indemnify its former proprietors for feudal services , the land they cultivated in fee-simple . Every such freeholder had a vote in the election of those who were to levy taxes upon his property ; every thirty thousand inhabitants were entitled to a representative in the national Assembly ; every free town to one or more representatives , according to its size and population . Thus the lower house of the Diet became representatives of the people , and not of the nobility ; and to a seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diet was to be presided over by an elective chairman , and all the other officers of the Diet were chosen by itself. * The re-organization of the upper house , or House of Magnates , was postponed to a future time . It was thus far decided , however , that there should henceforth continue to be two houses in the Diet . As it was not proper in a representative government that one part of the legislature should consist of members qualified by birth , it was determined to re-organize the upper house ; but as it was a matter of grave importance , the assembly determined to make the change at a later time and after a careful deliberation . Thus the upper house was , for the time , preserved in its ancient form . Before the end of the mojith of March , 1848 , a deputation of members from both houses of the Diet appeared in Vienna , carrying with them the unanimous wish of the * Let it be here understood , however , that the Hungarian peasant was never bound to the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he could not hold real estate . There were , to be sure , certainly some cases where the peasants held estates ; but for this they were obliged to pay certain duties to the lord of the land . These duties , and the tenths , were abolished by the laws of March , 1848 , giving to the peasant the real property of the soil , which hitherto he had cultivated on the payment of feudal duties . // Diet that the King would consent to various bills . Among these the greatest constitutional change was the restoration of the old union between the Diets of Hungary and Transylvania , provided the Transylvanian Diet concurred , a bill to that effect having passed the Hungarian Diet . It was provided , in case Transylvania concurred , that the members of her Diet should enter that of Hungary  --  the regalists in the upper , and the elected deputies in the lower house . All reasonable pretensions of the Transylvanians were to be admitted , and all privileges guaranteed . But , socially , the most important laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble enactment which quit the peasant of feudal burthens , and converted him into a lord of the soil . This last bill had passed both houses , on February 4th , 1848 , before the French revolution had broken out , so that the emancipation of the peasants was no result of revolution elsewhere , but the homage of nobles to truth and justice  --  the free act of men who stripped themselves of the hereditary privileges of centuries from motives of enlarged philanthropy and devotion to the real interests of their country . All these reforms , without exception , were accepted by the King , who , at the invitation of the Diet , proceeded to Presburg , in Hungary , with the Court , to ratify them . There , to the highest satisfaction and amid the liveliest manifestations of joy and loyalty , he gave the royal sanction , and after having solemnly sworn to protect and defend them , returned to Yienna . Such is the true summary of the most important reforms adopted by the Hungarian Diet of 1848 ; such is the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were the result of peaceful , calm deliberation ; that they were commenced , carried on , and completed , in compliance with both the letter and spirit of law ; that they were the result of neither turbulence , fear , nor insurrection . They were justly regarded by all patriotic Hungarians as their charter of rights , opening the promise of a national career whose progress and brilliancy should emulate that of the most favored constitutional government . But by these laws both the royal oath and the rights of the people were made positive , and warranted against the absolute will of the Court . Hence it became the plan of the Court to render the reforms abortive . Oa the very day of signing the bills , the Croatian Ban , Jellachich , was admitted to a private council , and the overthrow of Hungarian nationality , by a war of races , deliberately planned . How that was carried out  --  the blood , the strife and struggles of a campaign , which would have succeeded triumphantly for Hungary , but for the treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - our readers well know . In the history of that strife Kossuth 's own life is inseparably interwoven . Some errors of public appreciation , in regard to it , we may at a future time correct ; but our paper has already reached an unusual length , and we must cease .
