4'T1 THOMAS JEFFERSON . ( Cotwluded* ) THE attention of the President was now , however , suddenly diverted from the domestic affairs of the nation , to more important matters relating to its intercourse and understanding with foreign governments . While the trial of Burr was in active progress at Richmond , an excitement of a character far different and more intense was raging at the neighboring city of Norfolk , and ere long it had spread its contagious fires from Maine to the Mississippi . It seemed as though some latent torch of the Revolution had recaught its expiring flames , and was again on the point of kindling* into a patriotic blaze that defied all extinction save in the blood of our ancient oppressor , now turned into a haughty and insulting enemy . The cause of such emphatic and unanimous hostile demonstratiom we shall now proceed to narrate , as prefatory to the most interesting epoch of the Jeffersonian administration , and which can not be justly passed over in a review intended to reach the whole of Jefferson 's public life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of aggression and outrage on the rights and honor of the nation , which , even at this distance of time , must excite a feeling of anger and mortification in all American bosoms . For some months previously to this date , a British squadron , under command of Admiral Berkeley , had been anchored near Norfolk , with the expressed intention of enforcing His Britannic . Majesty 's recent proclamation , requiring all subjects of Great Britain to be forcibly impressed , wherever found on the high seas , into British service . With this view , a demand had been made by the British Consul at Norfolk on Commodore Barron of the frigate Chesapeake , then lying at Norfolk , for four seamen on board his vessel , claimed as deserters from British ships . With the advice and privity of the Cabinet at WashvOL. vi . NO. v. NEW SERIES . ington , Coin . Barron peremptorily refused to comply , assigning as a reason that he had been cautious in making up his crew , and that he had no deserters on board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea on his destination to the coast of Barbary , unfit* and unprepared , as yet , for sustaining an action , and never dreaming that an attack would be made on him by an armed enemy lying within the jurisdiction of his own government , and in the very eyes of the whole American people . But such did , indeed , actually occur . The Chesapeake had scarcely got out of Hampton Roads , and was yet off Cape Henry , when the British vessel Leopard , of fifty-four guns , detached itself from the Admiral 's squadron , and put to sea in pursuit . The Chesapeake was soon overhauled , and the four sailors again formally demanded . The American commander again refused , when the Leopard cleared for action , and forthwith began a heavy fire on the American frigate . Strange to say , the Chesapeake offered not the slightest resistance ; but after having stood under the fire of the British guns for near half an hour , losing some thirty men in killed and wounded , besides sustaining heavy damage in her hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message was sent to the British commander that the Chesapeake was his prize . An officer from the Leopard came on board , mustered the crew , and having seized the four sailors in question , returned without offering the slightest apology . The Chesapeake was then released , and Commodore Barron , disabled and humiliated , put back into Hampton Roads . The news of this transaetion excited at once the deepest sensation . Indignation meetings were called , and resentful resolutions passed in every town and city , from Passamaquoddy Bay to the Gulf of Mexico ; and the whole Union rose as one man to 81 // demand the means of redress at the hands of the Executive . Nor was the administration at all behind the spirit of the nation . Jefferson acted with becoming promptitude , and turned the whole weight of his influence on the popular side . A proclamation was issued , setting forth succinctly and vividly our causes of aggrievance at the hands of the British Government , and peremptorily order ing all armed vessels bearing commission from that power , then within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depart immediately from the same ; also interdicting the entrance of all harbors or waters to all vessels , of every description , commissioned by the offending power . Warm responses came in from every quarter . Federalists and Democrats waived their party animosities , and rallied around the administration . The British Minister resident was called upon , but falling to give due satisfaction , dispatehes were forthwith sent across the waters , and an explanation demanded at the very doors of the royal palace . But while this was yet pending , and the American mind still festering and rankling under the atrocious outrage , the British Government rose to a still higher and more insolent piteh of arrogance , and ordered that even merchant vessels , trading peaceably under the guarantee of mutual good understanding , should be stopped and searched for British subjects . And , as if intending to push matters to the extremity , and so far from pausing to redress grievances already alleged , an order in council was adopted yet more destructive to American commerce , pretended as an answer to the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in order to proceed intelligibly we must retrace , and , crossing the Atlantic , survey the condition of Europe . The successes and bold schemes of Napoleon were , at this time , the source of absor.bing interest to the civilized world . His coronation as Emperor had been followed immediately by the great battle of Austerlitz , which had prostrated Austria at his feet , and reduced the Czar of Russia to so humiliating a condition as ended in the total disruption of his confraternity with the Germanic powers . The battle of Jena , fought in October of the succeeding year , demolished Prussia , and placed her capital in the conqueror 's hands . Elated with this important victory , Napoleon now meditated the most gigantic and startling ideas ever put forth . The whole continent of Europe was now under his influence ; and the world beheld the singular spectacle of a solitary island power , with a population of scarce twenty millions , and protected by the ocean alone , boldly struggling against a despotism which looked , and seemed likely to attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted in the month of May previous , had established what was derisively termed a paper blockade along the entire coast of France and Germany , from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe . As this order forbade all commerce to neutrals , in defiance of international law , and was aimed especially against France , Napoleon , seated in the royal palace of Berlin , burning with resentment against England , and filled with the idea of conquering the sea by the land , indited and promulged the famous decree of November 2lst  --  the first of that series of measures afterwards known as his continental system . It declared the British islands in a state of blockade , and prohibited all commerce and intercourse with them . But it is worthy of remark , that Gen. Armstrong , our Minister at Paris , was officially notified that the Berlin decree was not to be enforced against American commerce , which was still to be governed by the rules of the treaty established between France and the United States . This significant exception aroused the jealousy of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all avenues to a friendiy adjustment of the difficulties already existing between her Government and ours . The orders in council , adopted on the 11th of November , 1807 , as retaliatory of the Berlin decree , contained provisions which bore intolerably hard on American commerce . Among the most odious of these , was that which condemned all neutral vessels which had not first paid a transit duty in some English port before proceeding on their destinations ; thus bringing the merchandise of neutrals within the limits of the Berlin decree , as also of that of Milan , which soon followed , and in which Napoleon denationalized all vessels sailing from any English port , or which had submitted to be searched . From a calm consideration of these retaliatory documents , thus promulged by the two great belligerent powers , it is evident that had any American vessels put to sea // after December of 180* , or during the winter and spring of 1808 , they would inevitably have been sacrificed ; - those bound to France or her dependencies , to British , and those bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this leads us , having thus succinctly premised , to the consideration of the great measure of Jefferson 's second administration . It will be understood , of course , that we allude to the Embargo ,  --  a restrictive law of Congress , recommended by the Executive , withdrawing the whole American commerce from the ocean . Now that the excitement and evil passions of those eventfuL times have died away , or been absorbed in other questions more intensely interesting and momentous , we may calmly review the causes and the justification of this much abused measure . It must be remembered that the last war with England dates its origin to the disputes which began in 1804 . During this year , the Jay treaty with England , effected in 1794 , under the administration of Washington , and which had bred serious dissensions at the time of its adoption , between the friends and enemies of the then Executive , had expired by its own limitation . Jefferson had been one of its earliest and most inveterate opponents , had denounced it as crouching , submissive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , refused the overtures of the British ministry to renew it for the period of even two years . In consequence of this refusal , and in view of the serious inconveniences arising from the absence of any international compact , Mr. Monroe was dispatched to England as an adjunct with Mr. Pinckney in promoting satisfactory negotiations and adjustment . After many long conferences and tedious correspondence , these commissioners agreed on a treaty which contained satisfactory clauses as concerned the rights of commerce , and of free trade , and of paper blockades-all prominent grounds of discordance . But in regard to the all-engrossing subject of impressment , they had been enabled to obtain only a sort of bond or certificate from the British ministers , unengrafted on the treaty , and scarcely dignified even with the uncertain name of protocol , declaring that , although his Britannic Majesty could not disclaim or derogate from this right , yet that instructions should be given to all British commanders to be cautious , in its exercise , not to molest or injure the citizens of the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sustained . The treaty , with this appendage signed by the British negotiators , was concluded in December , 1806 . It Was sent over immediately to Mr. Erskine , the English minister resident in the United States , and by him submitted to Jefferson and his Cabinet . The omission of a special treaty stipulation concerning impressment was deemed a fatal error ; and taking the ground that any succeeding ministry might , at pleasure , withdraw the paper accompanying the treaty , Jefferson , on his own responsibility , and independent of any action on the part of the Senate , then in session , sent it back as rejected . We must believe that Jefferson*s interpretation of this paper ( a stranger , any way , to the diplomatic world ) was correct ; but at the same time we incline to the opinion that , in view of the magnitude of the subjects in issue , and of the momentous results involved , it was his duty to have sought the advice of the Senate , two thirds of which body , and the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The questions at issue , thus adjourned and unadjusted , added to the fact that no treaty existed between the two countries , led to many other disputatious differences . The treaty had scarcely been returned to the negotiators in London , thus black-marked by the American Executive , before the offensive proclamation of the British monarch , already alluded to , was widely promulged . The affair of the Leopard and the Chesapeake soon followed , and then came the orders in Council , and the Berm and Milan decrees , all widening the breach betwixt our own and the British Government , and throwing us in a state of quasi hostility with France . Under these circumstances only two courses were left for the American Government to adopt , viz. , war with both the great belligerent powers , or an embargo . The first of these , in our then enfeebled state , would have been a mad as well as a most ridiculous course . Besides , no adequate cause for war existed against France , who had actually gone far to show herself our friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe the Berlin and Milan decrees may have been in their effects on American commerce , they were yet allowable precautionary and retaliatory measures , the consequents // of England 's atrocious and unparalleled conduct . With regard to us , England was the only aggressive power ; and it was not until our interests clashed directly with the provisions *f the imperial decrees as they bore against England , that France gave us the least cause of complaint or offence . Then , indeed , in the plenitude of his power , Napoleon committed outrages on America which left us no alternative but unfriendliness . But to have submitted , as Jefferson himself justly argued , to pay England the tribute on our commerce demanded by her orders in council , would have been to aid her in the war against France , and given Napoleon just ground for declaring war against the United States . The state of this country , thus situated as to the two belligerent powers , was therefore exceedingly embarrassing . It required the skill of an unshrinking , but a discerning and discriminating pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eminently fulfilled in the person of Thomas Jefferson ; who , with a sagacity that rarely failed him , adopted promptly the only remaining alternative of an embargo . On the 18th of December , 180,7 , accordingly , Jefferson communicated the Berlin decree , the correspondence betwixt Gen. Armstrong and Champagny , the French Minister , and the proclamation of George the Third , to the two Houses of Congress , together with a message , as before intimated , recommending such measures as he deemed necessary for the protection of American commerce . The Embargo Act was immediately introduced , carried through both Houses by large and significant majorities , and took effect on the *3d of the same month . It had scarcely become a law , before it encountered the most factious , violent , and well-directed opposition ever before exhibited . The whole Federal press , from NewHampshire to Georgia , raised its hand to beat it down , and thundered forth volleys of abuse and vituperation . It was denounced as oppressive , tyrannical , and wicked ; as having been dictated by Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , and as unconstitutional . The clamor which had assaulted the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1q98 was nothing to that which now poured its indignant torrents on Congress and the Executive . The entire cordon of Eastern States were kindled into the most appalling and intense excitement . The columns and segments of mystic flame which irradiated their northern horizon , seemed to glow with increased lustre , as if doubly reflected from the fires which burned and roared beneath . The most monstrous and improbable cause was assigned as the justification of this ferocious and ruthless opposition . The embargo was reprobated as a measure intended to combine the South and West for the ruin of the East . The more that unprincipled demagogues and silly enthusiasts repeated the declaration , the more fervently it was believed by honest people , too mad or too ignorant to be pacified with reason or truth . Ships were angrily pointed to , rotting at the wharves of Boston and of Newport . Idle , drunken sailors , in reeling hordes , clamored for employment , swearing that they could exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for aught else but reefing sails or manning halyards . Wharfingers and shipbuilders united in a common chorus of discontent . Merchants , from behind their groaning counters , sent forth grumbling calls for relief ; and seemed willing to sell themselves , their piles of goods , and their country to the common enemy , could they only obtain release from the embargo , and fill the hostile seas with their commerce . At length , dark hints of meditated treason were whispered about , and stunned the ears of Jefferson and his Cabinet . The crime which had just been charged against Aaron Burr , and on the mere suspicion of which he had been placed by an angry Government on a trial for his life , was now openly advocated , and the opposition prints teemed with threats of dissolving the Union . Then it was that Jefferson 's own bad teachings and mischievous principles were hurled mercilessly at his own government . The pernicious ultraisms of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 98 rose scowlingly and warningly to his vision , and would not " down " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculed the means used by Washington to suppress the Whiskey Insurrection in 94 ; and it seemed now as though the " poisoned chalice " had been " commended to his own lips . " He had defended and justified the Shay Rebellion of 8,7 , declaring that " no country could preserve its liberties unless its rulers were warned from time to time that the people preserved the power of resistance , // and washed the tree of liberty in the blood of patriots and tyrants . " That resistance was now everywhere and undisguisedly preached ; the people were invited to join in a crusade against the rulers , and , in case of a rupture , it seemed not unlikely that the blood of the first apostle of Nullification and Secession would be first offered as a propitiatory sacrifice on the altars of dissolution . So sure it is , that the evil counsels of selfish and unrestrained ambition will recoil , in an unexpected hour , and cover their propagator with confusion and dismay ! But notwithstanding this factious clamor and insane opposition , a calm consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period in question , will lead us to the conclusion that the embargo was a wise , salutary , and prudent measure . It was the only available or practicable remedy against the withering poilcy of England and France , then engaged in a war of extinction . But at the same time it is not to be denied that , as a measure of coercion to obtain redress from foreign powers , and to be continued until such redress was obtained , it certainly was a most severe , and , we may add , bold experiment on the interests as well as on the patience of an active and enterprising people . if however , the embargo had not been adopted ; if American vessels had been suffered , as of yore , to put forth on the high seas , it as certainly is not to be denied but what they would have been universally seized and confiscated . This would have produced unprecedented bankruptcy . Insurance offices and mercantile houses would have been speedily engulfed in hopeless ruin ; and scenes of calamity and distress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble in the beginning of the eighteenth century , would have pervaded this Union from one extreme to the other . The plunder of our ships and the captivity of our seamen would have operated to augment the resources of the belligerents , and enfeeble ourselves . We should thus have suffered all the worst consequences of war , without the chance of obtaining any of its compensatory advantages . Under these circumstances , it was evidently more politic that our vessels should remain at our wharves , the property of our merchants , than that they should be carried to England or France , the prey of pirates and of privateers . Besides this , by unfettering Ameri can commerce at such a time , with the risk of having our ships seized and ruthlessly sequestered , we would have been pursuing a course eminently calculated to multiply the difficulties already existing as barriers to a good understanding and amicable relations with the hostile powers over the water . We should again , as in the case of the Chesapeake with England , and of the Horizon with France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . We should have been ultimately goaded into a fierce war , after having been defeated in our endeavors to escape it , and deprived of the most efficient means for its prosecution . The charge of French influence in connection with the embargo was confidently attributed to Jefferson at the time , and Federal writers continue to urge it to this day . But the charge has never been adequately proven , and can not , we think , be at all sustained . That Jefferson cordially despised England and its Government we do not doubt ; nor does he anywhere attempt to conceal his dislike . Nor do we doubt but that his sympathies were in favor of France , from the beginning of the struggle in L792 , to its melancholy close after the battle of Waterloo in 1815 . He retained , to his dying hour , lively and cherished recollections of his residence in that country . He had known and been intimately associated with all her leading statesmen and warriors . He had formed social attachments in the hospitable circles of Paris that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France during the opening scenes of her eventful strife with England , and while yet the memory of British outrages during the struggle for American independence was fresh and green . He had , therefore , imbibed the double hatred of American and of Frenchman against British arrogance and British pretensions . These feelings were rife within his bosom when he came home from his mission , and had been fanned and sedulously nurtured throughout the whole eight years of Washington 's administration . They were not smothered in his subsequent fierce conflicts with the Federal party , and his arduous competition for the Presidency with the elder Adams . And now that he was at last on that eminence which crowned his towering ambition , and had been long the // goal of his ardent aspirations , it was not likely that , as regarded the interesting attitudes which marked the two great hostile powers of Europe during his administrative career , he should forget his early prejudices against England , or his strong prepossessions in favor of France . But we have been unable to satisfy our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his foreign policy . The history ofhiswhole official conduct in connection with the Embargo , the Non-intercourse Act , and his diplomatic dealings with the belligerents , shows that he acted as became an American President , and lifts him triumphantly above all unworthy imputations . Throwing aside all other considerations , Jefferson was not a man to bear being dictated to , even by Napoleon . He felt the influence and power of his high official station , and showed that he felt them . It was rather his weakness to believe that he could coerce and dictate to France , knowing , as he did , the deep anxiety of Napoleon to enlist the United States as his ally against England . And , indeed , the French Emperor , even while committing outrages on American vessels , pleaded necessity as his apology ; and while throwing the whole blame on the British ministry , plied the American Executive with artful and flattering laudations . With this view , Napoleon , unconsciously playing into the hands of Jefferson 's Federal opponents at home , affected to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to aid his continental system ,  --  a system professedly devised to humble and weaken English ocean dominion . In the saloons and reception-rooms of the Tuilleries he made a show of boasting of the United States as his ally , and constantly and publicly assured Gen. Armstrong , our Minister , of his great respect and friendship for the American people and their Government . " The Americans , " said the French Minister , speaking for the Emperor , " a people who involve their fortunes , their prosperity , and almost their existence in commerce , have given the example of a great and courageous sacrifice . They have prohibited , by a general embargo , all commerce and navigation , rather than submit to that tribute which the English impose . The Emperor applauds the embargo as a wise measure . " ( Pitkin 's Statistics , p. 385 . ) This . speech was , of course , directly com municated to the President of the United States , and speedily finding its way into the newspapers , was seized upon and turned against Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collusion with the French Emperor . There is every case to believe , as well from his own letter in answer to the one communicating the above , as from other circumstances , that this commendation of Napoleon was exceedingly grateful and pleasant to Jefferson ; and there can be no doubt that , in his public communications relative to our foreign affairs , he sought to inculpate England far more than France . He regarded England as the first and principal aggressor on the rights of America , while France was reluctantly involved , and forced to retaliate that she might preserve her own integrity against the insidions and ruthless policy of the British ministry . The object of the President was , then , especially in view of his unquestioned predilections , to turn popular indignation mainly against the first power , and leave the conduct of the French Government palliated by the unanswerable plea of stern necessity . It must , therefore , have been deeply mortifying to Jefferson , when dispatches reached him of Napoleon 's sudden change of mind in regard to the operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer exempted , that she should be forced to become either his ally or his enemy ; that there should be no neutrals in the contest betwixt himself and the British ; and that all vessels belonging to American merchants then lying in the ports of France should be condemned and confiscated . It is said that this news had reached Jefferson in an authenticated form , anterior to the delivery of his embargo message ; and his enemies charge him with having wilfully kept back this important paper ( a letter from Gen. Armstrong ) solely with a view to relieve France from the storm of anger and indignation which was gathering against England . Jefferson has not explained this , and his friends have been silent aiso . If he had received such news , it was , undoubtedly , his duty to have communicated the same to Congress along with the offensive orders in council and the Berlin decree . It may have been , and most probably was his motive , to give Napoleon time to get over his passion and retrace his steps before throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4*l qwq time , however , ceased also Jefferson 's official connection with the government . He retired from the Presidency on the fourth day of March , 1809 , and was succeeded by Mr. Madison . It is not , therefore , legitimately within the objects of this review to pursue further a history of governmental affairs . We pause on the verge of the war , and must leave the interested reader to search the pages of his histories for further satisfaction , hoping that we have succeeded in pointing out to him a proper clew to the elicitation of hitherto neglected branches . After retiring from the Presidency , Monticello became the permanent residence of Jefferson . He never afterwards appeared on the stage of political action . His time was quietly spent in superintending the business of his farms , in the pursuit of literature and science , and in familiar correspondence with his numerous friends . The Virginia University , however , soon became a pampered hobby , and enlisted his ardent interest and sympathy . He lived to see it flourish under his fostering care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monument of his public spirit and laudable enterprise of character . One other subject now began to engage his reflections seriously and deeply . It was that of religion  --  the Christian religion . He never thought it worth while seriously to investigate the claims or merits of any other . Compared with the religion of Christ , that of the Jews or of Mahomet was , in his estimation , mere superstition or gross imposture . At the same time , it is quite apparent that he had studied closely both the ancient and modern systems , with a view to compare them with the religion of Jesus . For many long years , in the midst of political bustle as well as in the quiet of retirement , did Jefferson devote his thoughts to serious meditations and minute inquiries on this important subject . The fourth volume of his correspondence abounds with letters on Christianity , and unfolds beyond any question the religious opinions of its distinguished author . We hesitate not to say that his inquiries ended with a firm and total disbelief in the divine inspiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God of the Old Testament and the Supreme Being taug , ht by Jesus ; viewing the first as an angry , a bloodthirsty , and vindictive being  --  the last as merciful , forbearing , just , and paternally inclined . He denounces the doctrines of Moses , but extols those of Jesus . He looked on Jesus as a man only  --  the most excellent and pure that ever lived , but still no part or essence of Divinity . The doctrine of the Trinity was to him an incomprehensible and inexplicable mysticism-too refined , too inconsistent with the weakness of human understanding , and too subtle to have been inculcated by so plain and unsophisticated a teacher as Jesus Christ . He admits that it is more than probable that Jesus thought himself the subject of divine inspiration ; because it was a belief incident to his education , and common among the Jews , that men were often inspired by God . But he denies that Jesus anywhere attempts to impose himself on mankind as the Son of God . The four Gospels were regarded by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , whose conceptions were too towering for the " feeble minds of his **grovelling** companions . ( See p. 326 , vol . IV . ) " We find , " he says in the letter referred to , " in the wiitings of his biographers , matter of two distinct descriptions . First , a groundwork of vulgar ignorance , of things impossible , of superstitions , fanaticisms , and fabrications . Intermixed with these , again , are sublime ideas of the Supreme Being , aphorisms and precepts of the purest morality and benevolence , sanctioned by a life of humility , innocence , and simplicity of manners , neglect of riches , absence of worldly ambition and honors , with an eloquence and persuasiveness that have not been surpassed . ... Can we be at a loss in separating such materials , and ascribing each to its genuine author ? " In a letter to John Adams on the same subject , found on page 240 , volume fourth , our author says again : " The Christian priesthood , finding the doctrines of Jesus levelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw in the mysticisms of Plato materials with which they might build up an artificial system , which might , from its indistinctness , admit of everlasting controversy , give employment to their order , and introduce it to profit , power and pre-eminence . The doctrines which flowed from the lips of Jesus himself are within the comprehension of a child ; but thousands of volumes have not yet explained the Platonisms engrafted on them : and // for this obvious reason , that nonsense can never be explained . " And again , the letter to Dr. Rush , found in volume third , on page 506 , holds this language : " I am , indeed , opposed to the corruptions of Christianity , but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself . I am a Christian in the only sense in which he wished any one to be ; sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all others ; a.sci-ibing to himself every human excellence , and believing he never claimed any other . " The last extract we shall quote is found on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterhouse : " Had the doctrines of Jesus been preached always as pure as they came from his lips , the whole civilized world would now have been Christian . I rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief , which has surrendered its creed and its conscience to neither kings nor priests , the genuine doctrine of one only God is reviving ; and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die an Unitarian . But much I fear , that when this great truth shall be re-established , its votaries will fall into the fatal error of fabricating formulas of creed and confessions of faith , the engines which so soon destroyed the religion of Jesus , and made of Christendom a mere Aceldama ; that they will give up morals for mysteries , and Jesus for Plato . " These extracts fully confirm the analysis of Jefferson 's religious views we have given on a preceding page , and leave no doubt of their character or extent , He admired the morality of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of teacher . The apostles and their writings met with no favor from Jefferson . He speaks of them more than once " as a band of impostors , of whom Paul was the great Coryph*us ; " and we have abundant evidence to show that he doubted not only the genuineness of the Pentateuch and of the prophecies , but of the whole writings of the Old Testament . Still we can not consent that Jefferson shall be ranked as an infidel , as most of the orthodox world demand . He protests himself against such a sentence , and we have been unable to detect such tendency in his writings . He admired and adopted Christianity as an inimitable and unsurpassed system of morality , and inculcates and defends its principles . But he examined 4,79 its merits and viewed its transcendent teachings through the medium of reason and plain common sense . Where these stopped , and where the foggy empire of faith began , there he abruptly halted . His mind was so constituted as neither to be terrified by dogmas , nor seduced by imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded the tenets of Calvin with ineffable and undisguised abhorrence . The doctrine of one God , indivisible and indissoluble , made into three parts , and these three parts yet one only ,  --  a Unity made Trinity at pleasure , or to suit particular cases ; the doctrine of moral necessity ,  --  the necessity of the eternal perdition of one part for the salvation of another part of mankind , and for the perfect glory of God ; and the doctrines of the immaculate conception of the Virgin , and of the mystical incarnation of Jesus Christ , he had taught himself to regard as mere fanciful theories of a selfish priesthood , designed only to establish and support an independent " order " of clergy . A. theory that announced as its basis incomprehensibility and infinitude , yet attempting to explain and elucidate acknowledged mysteries ; which claimed reason in defence , and denounced it as unlawful in antagonists ; which shuts out free inquiry , and seeks shelter from human efforts within the untrodden precincts of an inexplicable and undefinable faith ; which proscribes doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and intrenches itself in dogmatism and prejudice ; which claims to be infallible , yet teaches the consistency of sectarianism ,  --  such a theory and such religion were totally rejected by one accustomed to such bold latitude of thought and severe mental discipline as Thomas Jefferson . It is no part of our task , nor is it our inclination , to examine the correctness or the fallacy of these views . But when reviewing so important a subject , and the character of so distinguished a personage , we feel bound , in candor , to give both the subject and the character the full advantage of undisguised array . Such were the private and well " digested " eligious opinions of Jefferson , and by such , fairly set forth , he must be judged . It would be unfair to expose him to censure , while smothering the grounds of his belief or disbelief . And ig in the perusal of these pages , any reader shall feel aggrieved on any point of conscience by this expose of our // author 's doubts and skepticisms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pause and reflect , that many as good and great , if not better and greater than Thomas Jefferson , have been honestly perplexed by like doubts , and mystified by like skepticisms . The volumes before us close with the celebrated " Ana . " As a material part of the memoirs of one of the leading representative men of America , it should not be passed over lightly or inadvertently . We view its character , contents , and objects as forming quite a suspicious feature in the public character of our distinguished subject . We shall not aver that it is unfair or unallowable to treasure what we may casually hear in the course of general conversation among distinguished personages , with a view to profit by the same in making up an estimate of character and principle . We believe that free conversation is the surest index to honestly conceived opinions . It is the apposite and quick expression of thoughts induced by reading , or by previous casual reflection  --  the more to be relied on , inasmuch as it is usually unprompted by cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to note down table talk at dinings , evening parties , and at cabinet consultations in difficult , novel , and trying times , as Jefferson has done in his Ana , is not only culpable , but is violative of all rules which govern free social and political intercourse . During the administrations of Washington , republicanism was in its infancy , and the government in its chrysalis state . The hopes of freemen were suspended on a thread . The capacity of the people for selfgovernment was an untried experiment . The best and the wisest were doubters ; and among these was Washington himself . Hamilton was an open and professed skeptic , and did not scruple to declare , as his firm opinion , that monarchy was the most reliable form of government . Old John Adams believed the same way , and even James Madison indulged apprehensions . But all of these had resolved that the experiment should have a fair trial . Hamilton was urgent and strenuous in his advocacy of the policy , and joined with Madison and Jay in producing a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a popular form of government , and of the Constitution . These papers were embodied into a volume which has attained to a worldwide celebrity under the name of the " Federalist . " And yet it is principally to defame Adams and Hamilton that Jefferson indited the Ana , although every memberof Washington 's administration came in for a full share of espionage . Indeed , if Jefferson is to be regarded as a credible and an unbiased witness , the fathers of the government , excepting Madison and himself , must have been the most corrupt and selfish cabal of politicians that ever disgraced the history of any country . He spares Washington , truly , but in a manner not very complimentary to the intellect of that illustrious and venerable personage . He represents him as having , indeed , a good heart , but a weak , vacillating head ; as being entirely under the influence of Federal advisers , and as indecisive and wavering in time of action . But it is altogether unfair to judge either Hamilton or his associates by opinions expressed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . The experiment , fairly tried under their auspices , was incontestably proven and demonstrated ; and , like all demonstrations , carried conviction . Its proof was unquestionable . Washington modified his original views so far as to admit its practicability , but died seriously doubting its permanency . Hamilton 's conduct evinced his satisfaction at the result , in the undeviating support he gave to the judicial and popular branches of the government . The election of Jefferson to the Presidency , a few years afterward , showed a general confidence in the success of the scheme , and the acquiescence of the Federalists , then one of the most formidable and powerful parties that ever existed , was the clearest evidence of the triumph of republicanism . Under these circumstances , and being cognizant of these facts , we can find no excuse for the author of the Ana in thus noting down and publishing conversations uttered at an unsettled and a trying period of political affairs ; and when opinions , far from being firmly fixed , were hastily formed , according to the ever shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to convince or persuade , than to elicit information . We confess to an instinctive distrust of talk-gatherers . When we find or hear of a politician mingling in social circles , or among his adversaries // around the festive board , listening attentively to conversation , while cautiously and rarely giving utterance to his own opinions , and then noting down or retailing the results of his observation , we feel an involuntary apprehension of mischief and are inclined strongly to suspect foul play . By this rule we are constrained to judge Jefferson in this instance . That he squared his conduct , in after days , from the notes and ; nformation thus suspiciously gleaned , is quite evident both from his unrelenting jeal*usy of Hamilton , and from his remorseless ) ersecution of Aaron Burr . In view of this , as well as of other cogent reasons , it might have been supposed that a dative , justly proud of his distinguished - ncestor 's fame , would have spared the readirs of his book the mortification of perusing lese unpleasant revelations  --  the evidences an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable and unworthy espioage in working out the overthrow of unwary - Iversaries . But the 6andor of Mr. T. Randolph was stern proof against all rudential suggestions or delicate considera ons . A very natural and pardonable unillingness to reduce the profits of his work , * to lop off the main value of his grandther 's bequest , may also have had some fluence in scotehing his candor against e invitations of delicacy and prudence . othing , however , is more certain than that e publication of the Ana has operated to *tract largely from the private character of 2ffcrson , and to tarnish his claims to fair ay and candid opposition in political war*e . We may , then , safely assert , that bile Mr. Randolph very prudently counted e cost of suppression as weighed against e profits of publication , the memory of his lstrious and venerable ancestor has expiA dearly the fruits of his speculation . Our task is completed . We have now lie else to do than briefly to sum up the ominent representative features in the character of our distinguished subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partial judgment of the reader . The influences of Jefferson 's character ye been sensibly impressed on the people this country from the dawn of the Revoion to the present hour ; and they have cm , and continue to be , secondary alone those of Washington . Our conclusion been that his influence has produced baneful and most deprecative effects on the moral tone of our political world . His opposition to all the essential features of the Constitution , and to our present form of government , was deep-rooted , insidious , and unceasing . His political and governmental theories were eminently and dangerously Jacobinical . Deeply tinctured with the ascetic and disorganizing principles of the French Revolution , he worshipped an ideal of democracy that bordered on downright Utopianism . On all points touching the practicability or durability of popular governments , he was almost fanatically radical and ultra . He advocated the largest reservations of power in favor of the people in their collective capacity , and the most unlimited right of sufl*age . He mistrusted and denounced the well-guarded prerogatives of our federal Executive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . And yet , during his own Presidency , his practice afforded a most singular contrast to his theories , as we think we have abundantly shown in the preceding pages . No President was ever so peremptory in demanding to be intrusted with hazardous and questionable powers , and none so arbitrary as regarded manifest infractions of the Constitution . He openly defied and overruled judicial authority ; suggested to his Congress the enactment of laws whose operation threatened a violent severance of the Union ; demanded and obtained a severe enforcing act ; invaded the Treasury at will to aid his policy or to gratify his caprices ; and boldly assumed a stretch of executive power , without precedent or parallel , by rejecting , at his single discretion , a treaty that ought to have been submitted to the Senate as required by the Constitution , and especially while that body was in session . As the founder and leader of the Democratic party , and the consequent promoter , originally , of the fierce party dissensions which have since distracted the country , we are forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We regard the influence and progress of that party as eminently deleterious to the political welfare of the Union , and as the incipient step and prime mover towards a severance of the States-if , indeed , that calamity shall ever befall us . Their disorganizing and pestilential teachlags // began with the very dawn of the government . The democratic members of the Convention which formed the Constitution maintained , during its session , an active correspondence with Jefferson on each and every element proposed as its basis . Their eabals and caucuses were as frequent as the meetings of the Convention . Their efforts were directed to the adoption and introduction of Jacobinical features calculated to countervail and to mar all that was practical , or that looked to durableness . Regarding society more as it ought to be , than it is , or ever has been , or is ever likely to be ; seduced by theories more plausible than solid ; applying to a free elective government , deriving all its powers and authorities from the voice of the people , maxims and precautions calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views Lnd directed all their influence towards depreciating and weakening the Federal Government . Against this , as the Hydraheaded monster of all their professed apprehensions , their combined batteries of talent and of national influence were solely directed . Had they prevailed , the General Government would have been completely shorn of all its efficiency ; and mankind would have been treated with the singular spectacle of a powerful and growing people , belonging in classes to thirteen separate and independent sovereignties , seeking a precarious union in an instrument allied with anarchy and founded in the grossest radicalism . But what they failed to obtain directly , they have contrived and managed to effect indirectly , with almost perfect success . The history of the country has clearly shown that the root of evil and the elements of destruction lie , not in the Federal Government , but in perverted construction of the rights and powers of the State Governments , and supposed reservations to the people . To secure the ascendency and popularity of this doctrine , the Democratic leaders have fallen on any and every species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resorted , alternately , to a latitudinous construction of the Federal Constitution , and to a strict construction ; first , they have contended for restriction , and then for unlimited extension of federal power ; first closing the door to all constitutional admission of foreign territory , and then abruptly breaking down every barrier to acquisition and conquest , and bringing in new States formed out of territory reaching from the tropic of Cancer to the fiftieth parallel of north latitude , washed severally by the waves of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans* With Jesuitical unscrupulousness , they have pursued their ambitious ends , little regardful of the means used for the accomplishment . Consistency has been reckoned a virtue only so long as it accorded with expediency . Principle has been made the handmaiden of policy . Party and power have been the watchwords through all phases of political or sectional differences , and among all the strifes of ambitious and aspiring rulers . And , as the crowning point of their incongruous system , it may be stated as a remarkable and an instructive fact , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political power to hang Burr for suspected designs against the Union , and while threatening the Nullifiers with the cannon of the General Government , has yet been the apologist for every popular outbreak and revolutionary movement , from the time of the Massacbusetts insurrection to the Dorr rebellion in Rhode Island . The connection of Thomas Jefferson with all these disorganizing principles has been sufficiently explained in the foregoing pages . We regard him as the master-spirit of former mischievous inculcations , and his influence as the main prompting cause of all succeeding political malversations of " the progressive Democracy . " In fact , and at the best , the impartial reviewer is constrained to measure the public character of Thomas Jefferson by a rule of selfishness that shone conspicuous through his whole political career , and which must ever detract materially from his claims to gratitude and veneration as a statesman . And while all unite in ascribing to him great powers of mind , vast cultivation and information , and much that elicits and merits thankfulness in connection with our Revolutionary history , his memory will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand him down , as the eldest Patriarch of radical Democracy . With all his budding honors in the political world , Jefferson had been through life , in another and tenderer connection , a man of afflictions and sorrows . Death had visited his family circle more than once . One by one its loved members had been snatched // 483 away . While yet at the starting point of I elevation , and while the halo of future honors gleamed but faintly in the distant political horizon , he beheld the grave close over all that had been affectionate and beautiful in her who had blessed his youth with her love , and made happy the earliest home of his manhood . She left him two little daughters , and the memory of her love ; and these were the sole pledge and token of their union . Her memory found its shrine in the warmest affections of his heart , and his love was never shared by another . The daughters , under his paternal care , survived the trials of youth , and grew to be accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fireside were left cheerless . In a few years , the elder of the two sickened and died , before the father had even grown familiar with her absence . This was in the meridian of his first Presidency ; but the pomp , and circumstance , and splendor of high office could not assuage the anguish of a wounded heart . The blow fell heavily and unexpectedly . Henceforth his earthly affections were absorbed in the love of his only remaining child and her children . And while yet the chastening rod of death was suspended , and he was bending beneath its trying inflictions , and when the ease and emolument of office were approximating to a close , a new source of anxiety and of misfortune was sprung . Forty years of his life , and more , had been abstracted from his own and given to the affairs of the country . As property possesses no self-preserving principle , that of Jefferson had suffered seriously and alarmingly under such long neglect . He left the Executive mansion deeply embarrassed , and returned to Monticello heavily oppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his literary and scientific pursuits Were all impotent to chase off these mortifying reflections , and the rich treasures of intellectual research were soiled by a commixture with the less welcome but necessary employment of lottery draughts and financial calculations . The generous interposition of Congress enabled him to keep his library and the forbearance and liberality of those he owed , added to other matters , helped him to avoid the sheriff 's clutches . His estate , however , was never relieved , and his principal bequest to those he left behind consisted of the papers which compose the volumes we have just closed . On the fourth of July , 1 826 , just fifty years from the memorable day which had witnessed the birth of American Independence , and simultaneously with that of John Adams , the spirit of Jefferson took its flight from earth . He died at Monticello , in the arms of his surviving daughter , at the ripe age of eighty-three years . His last conversations showed that the waning faculties of mind were busy with the long past eventful scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant personal collisions with old political friends which had blurred the latter years of his public career , and seemed to dwell amid the consecrated shades of Independence Hall , and the stirring scenes of the Reyolutionary era . His last wish was " that he might be permitted to inhale the refreshing breath of another Fourth of July . " And the wish was granted .
