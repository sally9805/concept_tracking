ILL-Philosophy of Sir IFillicne Hamilton , Bas*t* Arranged and Edited by 0 . XV . WIonT . For the use of schools and colleges . New-York . ID . Appleton &amp; Co. 1853 . SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON has been chiefly known hitherto by a couple of remarkable articles in The Edinburgh Review-one on the Philosophy of Cousin , and the other on the current Theories of Perception . Nothing can exceed the evidence of logical ability in these papers , nor the easy mastery they exhibit over all the erudition pertaining to their respective subjects . Yet we are inclined to think that these admirable qualities have passed with hasty or inconsiderate readers for more than their worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a philosophic prestige to which , as it am pears to us , he is by no means illdisputably entitled . Let us proceed to vindicate this judgment by a careful examination of these celebrated disputations . The drift of the article on Cousin was simply negatory of the pretension which modern Philosophy has put forth , to construct a science of the Absolute . And the method which Sir William pursues in order to lay this phantom pretension , is to prove that inasmuch as our knowledge is of the finite and conditioned , it is iinpossible that we should also know the infinite and the unconditioned . He reasons substantially after this manner : " All our knowledge is relative ; that is to say , we know unity only as defined by plurality . Now if it be true that we know the one as defined by the many , it is contradictory and therefore false to say , according to the doctrine of the Absolute , that we know it as undefined by the many ; that is as universal . And hence I insist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance of the irrelative . When we wish to indicate // something beyond the sphere of our knowledge , we call up the Absolute to represent that unknown something . For example , we have a relative knowledge of man , that is , of the good man as defined by the bad man , and vice versa , or of John as defined by Joseph , by Charles , by all the not-Johns . When , then , we wish to deny that we are speaking of the good man , or the bad man , or the John , we say we are speaking of man absolutely ; that is. not any man specifically defined , but man freed from definition , that is , the man universal . Our language has no positive force . We do not mean to say that we know this undefined or universal man , because in that case our knowledge would be contradictory . For , if it be true that we know the specific man , or the man limited by other men , it necessarily follows that the absolute man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man we do not know . I say necessarily , because knowledge is one , and can not contradict itself , if we know the specific man , the John , Joseph , and Charles , then the absolute man being negative of these , would require in order to his positive cognition by us , that we should unknow the spccific man-would require us , in fact , not only to extinguish every principle of our knowledge , and start afresh from the conceived identity of finite and infinite , specific and universal , but also to deny our own consciousness and to be the absolute or universal man himself . For the universal man denying all specific manhood monopolizes all man 's knowled6e . He must be the only knowing , because he is the only being . " Such , fairly stated , is the construction according to Sir William Hamilton , of the Absolute , and such the impossibility of knowing it without being it . We first conceive the absence of all our knowledge , or the destruction of the relative and finite , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we proclaim this term a positive cognition , 1brgettin* that it was only by postulating the destruction of the cognitive power , or the being of the relative , that the term was fabricated . It is clear that the force of this criticism turns wholly upon the quiet assumption that the Infinite or Absolute must be known precisely in the same way that we know the finite or relative ; or what is equivalent , that the Infinite differs from the finite not in kind but only in degree . SirWilliam Hamilton exhibits no positive conception of the Infinite . He regards it in fact as a mere negative conception to the finite , and does not hesitate to outrage every philosophic instinct by calling " the Infinite and Absolute merely the names of two jmnbecilities of the human mind . " Like the child who in a moment of summary rage and despair , demolishes the watch which he has taken apart but can not reconstruct , this irascible critic boldly denies the reality of ideas which he can not readily interpret to his sensuous perception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is merely the logical negation of the finite . It has no existence in Se , but only as the symbol of a certain imbecility , or infirmity of the human understanding , as the expression of muan 's ignorance . Knowing the finite , of course he must un-know , or ignore , the infinite . Thus , the Infinite is merely the logical contradiction of the finite . Now , finite existence means conditioned existence . Every finite existence is conditioned in space and time . The Infinite , therefore , considered as the logical opposite of the finite , must be unconditioned in space and time . One would therefore say that the apprehension of the Infinite demanded higher faculties in man than his senses , or those faculties whereby he apprehends the finite . And if Sir William had been content to say this , every one must have concurred , even his antagonists , who had said it over and over again previously . But he is not content to say this . Having disproved what no one ever claimed , that the Infinite has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacity of transcending the role of a critic or commentator , to deny it , also , any rational existence , and stamp it as a mere phantom and imbecility of the human mind . Having shown the infinite to be the " unconditioned in space and time , " one would say there was no possibility of going any further . The very definition of it excluded it from the category of sensible knowledge , and all that remained to be done was to relegate it to the exclusive cognizance of our supersensuous faculties , say our belief . But this does not satisfy Sir Williani. having brought the Infinite into the condition of a mere negation , having defined it to mean " existence unconditioned in time and space , " he determines forthwith to exalt it into a positive , and try it by the rules of time and space . For this purpose , the purpose of stifling this poor bloodless ghost of an Infinite , what does he do ? Why , he cogitates the " unconditioned hi time and space " as implying the totality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Infinite therefore because you can never get enough of finites to make it up ! The Infinite , instead of being what he just defined it , " the unconditioned in // space and time , " is suddenly converted into " the endless regress and progress** of both . That is to say , Sir William Hamilton , while defining the Infinite as the wholly unconditioned in space and time , treats it as identical with both , and while affirming it in words to be the logi-. cal opposite of the finite , makes it in fact the greatest possible potentialization of the finite . For if the finite be construed as " the conditioned in time and 5pace , ** then clearly whatsoever least largely involves this construction , whatsoever involves the least of time and space , is the least finite.existence , and whatsoever most largely involves this construction or involves the most of time and space , is the most finite existence . hence Sir William Hamilton 's Infinite , being the endless regress and endless progress of time and space , that is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own pretension , and confesses itself a very transparent mask of the Finite . Thus , in our estimation , Sir William Hamilton 's criticism upon modern philosophic tendencies , turns out to be simply declamatory , and falls to the ground . Sir William is a philosophic Materialist , or as he styles himself in more holiday phrase , a Natural Realist , who maintains that time and space are essential verities upon which all being is conditioned . Time and space , in his view , are not purely logical facts , inseparable from the constitution of the human understanding : they are ontological facts , which forbid , therefore , the possibility of a logical denial , or attempt to transcend them . Hence his effort to disprove the doctrine of the Infinite by the method of contradiction , or by showing that inasmuch as the Infinite is only a negation of the finite , and the finite is the conditioned in time and space , so consequently the Infinite can only be " the unconditioned in time and space ; " which being contradictory of the finite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time ontologically instead of logically , viewing them as conditions of being instead of conditions of thought , he is bound to construe infinitude as the literal intumescence of limited times and spaces into unlimited ones , as the endless imaginative prorogation of an end-in short , as the consummate accumulation of the Finite . It is doubtless very true that man has no sensible acquaintance with the Infinite , because the sphere of the Infinite is that of supersensuous Goodness and Truth , and if these writers had unwittingly confounded the two spheres , it appears to us that it behooved a critic of Sir William Hamilton 's penetration not merely to de nounce their error , but to correct it . So far , however , is he from contemplating this office , that he evinces no suspicion even of its practicability . His function with respect to Philosophy , appears to be wholly and contentedly negative . He is a subtle critic , a keen analyst of thought and language , a disputant of egregious stomach and skill , a plethoric and most exact vocabulary of logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of origination or suggestion . It is startling to find so prodigious an intellectual discipline reared upon so shallow a basis of ideas representing so meagre a stock of spontaneous force . He seems to have careered over the whole field of metaphysics , for the sole purpose of letting you know that it contains no hidden treasures , and that its wealth lies patent to the eye upon the surface . Thus , he strikes you as being wholly devoid of love for his vocation , being mainly moved to it by intellectual curiosity , and mainly qualified for it by an enormous faculty of memory . And the personal feeling you soon come to conceive for him , consequently , is very similar to that you would get to entertain for an accomplished and conscientious sheriff 's officer . It is doubtles very wrong , we repeat , to postulate for a man a knowledge of the Infinite , in any strict sense of the word knowledge : because knowlcd*e is properly conversant only with things , and the sphere of infinitude is identical with Life . or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is only belief which relates us to the Infinite . We know good only as limited by evil , that is , finite good . We know truth only as limited by falsity , that is , finite truth . We believe in good unlimited by evil , in truth unlimited by falsity , that is , in infinite goodness and truth . The just or perfect nian lives by faith not by knowledge . In our infancy or immaturity , whether as a race or as individuals we live from knowledge , and the result is misery . Instructed by our senses only , as Eve by the serpent , we pluck freely of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , and fondly deem its fruit capable of makin , us wise , and elevating us indeed to God . But in vain . Nature does not contain her own secret , and we may ransack her stores to all eternity before we shall master the spell whereby to conjure her allegiance . But when infancy is past , and the manhood whether of the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our judgments are no longer dictated by the senses , or an appreciation of things accordin , to their appearance , but by reason , or an appreciation of things according // to their substance . We have the idea of an infinite or perfect good . truth and beauty , as constituting the Divine nature , and to realize that infinitude or perfection in all our life and converse , becomes henceforth our aspiration . The savage man , and the uninstructed child , still acknowledge only a sensuous or finite good-the good which exists by the antagonism of evil ; and they persist therefore in craving from nature satisfactions which she is all incompetent to bestow . But the cultivated or regenerate man , he who is born from within or above , is weaned from this base and perishable nutriment and feeds upon invisible manna , or a goodness and beauty and truth which are infinite , as being wholly unconditioned upon evil and falsity and deformity . Whether he eats or drinks or whatsoever he does , he does all to the glory of that infinitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not show mercy , deal justly , or walk humbly , because he is thereby to procure reward ; nor does he refrain from theft , adultery , lying , covetousness , because he dreads any outward punishment . But he does good and avoids evil from simple love **26;66;TOOLONG , and this love and hatred make ontward reward and punishment puerile and inappropriate . He has no fear that if he should defraud his neighbor of his property , or betray his conjugal honor , he would incur any other outward penalty for those offences than those which society imposes . Yet never was his neighbor 's property so secure , nor his neighbor 's conjugal happiness so inviolable . For the simple reason that this man is enlightened from within , or above , and in all his relations , whether to nature or society , to his own body or his fellow-man , aspires to fulfil that spirit of infinite and eternal love which constitutes God 's living presence in his soul . It is the fear of injury to his own imperishable soul which emancipates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience to all the obligations of fellowship . But however it may fare with Sir Win . Hamilton 's criticism of the Transcendentalists , one thing becomes abundantly clear , which is the exact philosophic regimen of Sir William himself . For this we can not be too grateful . For Sir William resumes , as the French say , the entire history of philosophical Materialism in himself , purged of all latent spiritual dross ; and if we wish to know accordingly what orthodox Philosophy has achieved , up to the time of Kant , we have only to examine its net evolution and produc.t in Sir William . Thus , if you ould know the exact contents of the orthodox or Materialistic theory of Perception . he will show you how , voL. ii. - 31 starting from the premiss of the entire relativity of our knowledge , it immediately proceeds to betray that premiss by affirming the duality or antagonism of man and nature , thus rendering both parties absolute or independent , instead of reciprocally relative existences . No man has ever in words asserted more loudly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and yet , whenever he is called upon to define any specific fact of this experience , he invariably impeaches his assertion , by proving the experience to involve the irreconcilable antagonism of subject and object , or me and not-me . Thus , I see a rose . Here is fact of knowledge or perception . And the fact is doubtles purely relative ; that is to say , it would be impossible were it not for the relationship existing between my organs of sense and the various realms of nature . The color the dimensions , the fi*agranCe , etc. , of the rose relate it , or make it akin , to my organs of sight , smell , etc. , so that without the rose my senses would be destitute of power , and without these senses the rose would be destitute of color , fragrance , form . etc . Such is the case with all our knowledge . Every fact of knowledge or perception proceeds upon an affinity or relationship so intimate between our sensitive organization and nature , as completely to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness upon their equal coalition . Knowledge , perception , is always specific . We know or perceive things , the horse , the tree , the stone , the cloud , the fountain . Take these things away , and we should know or perceive no-thing : that is , we should not perceive or know at all . Knowledge or perception does not inhere in me , considered apart from nature . I know or perceive only by virtue of my solidarity with nature . We have no faculty of sensation or perception apart from the contents of our sensitive organization , apart from the various things included in the realm of sense . We are , indeed , self-conscious only by virtue of our natural organization , which organization again is valid or efficient only by virtue of its involving or enfolding within itself the universe of nature . Thus , the eye is empowered only by the realm of colors , the nose by that of odors , the ear by that of sounds . Suppose you apply the ear to the discrimination of colors , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess themselves instantly invalidated . Why ? Simply because they are not related to the pheimomena in question - because the phenomena of li , ght bear an exclusive relationship to the eye , and those // of ' sound to the ear . Hence in knowing , say in knowing a rose for example , the rose is just as vital and essential a constituent of the knowledge or perception as I myself am . In knowing or perceiving the rose I put forth no power-I am completely paselve in the process . I can not help knowing or perceiving it . It is a fact of my senses , deriving all its subsistence from them as they derive all their life from it and hence so long as I am in my senses I must know or perceive it . It is a fact of my organization , wholly inconceivable apart from my organization , and hence I know it in knowing my organization . I do not indeed identify my sensitive organization with the rose , or any specific fact of nature , because this would be to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountain , the horse , the fish , the bird , etc . But I identify it with the sum of my sensible experience , or with the total contents of my senses , and hence know myself as organically defined only by my various relationship to the universe of natj*re . In knowledge , therefore , or perception , the relation between me and nature is one of complete fusion , indistinction , or identification . The discrimination made by the reflective understanding between us disappears , and life unites what the senses divide . Knowledge does not indeed deny the sensible distinction , the distinction to our senses between me and the rose an more than water denies the sensible disUnction of oxygen and hydrogen . But knowledge denies our distinction within its own limits , or in so far forth as our fusion constitutes knowledge , just as water denies the distinction of oxygen and hydrogen within its own limits , or so far fbrth as their fusion constitutes water . Now , how does Sir William Hamilton , resuming the orthodox theory of Perception , proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , two distinct elements , an active and a passive one ; a me and a not-me ; a subject and an object . And yet he p*onounces the fact purely relative . But what sort of a relationship stands disclosed in this discrimination ? It is clearly no intrinsic or constitutional relation , but on the contrary a purely arbitrary and accidental one , growing out of the occasional determination of one party to the other , instead of their due and reciprocal proportion . On this hypothesis the relativity of our knowledge is a purely circumstantial fact , instead of a constitutional one . Man , being absolute in knowledge-that is to say , possessing in himself a faculty of knowledge , undetermined by the thing known-of course his ignorance of the Infinite implies no lack of faculty in himself but only the lack of an Infinite to know . The limitation of his knowledge is mechanical , not dynamic . lie fails to cognize the Infinite , only because the Infinite previously fails to be . I perceive the rose . " This perception , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptive subject , and a passive or perceived object . " But in this state of things what becomes of the perception itself ? Evidently it evaporates or goes into dissolution , leaving behind it the skeleton and dislocated residua of an agent here , and a patient there . It is literally swallowed up of its own constituents . It is in the same condition precisely with water , which has been resolved into its constituent gases . As water ceases to exist when resolved into its constituent elements , so perception ceases to exist when resolved into its constituent elements . Man is not perception , and nature is not perception ; just as oxygen is not water , and hydrogen is not water . Perception is thefusion of man and nature , just as water is thefusion of oxygen and hydrogen , and when , consequently , you omit this fact of fusion from your definition of either phenomenon , and present instead its disjected simples , you omit the whole reality of the phenomenon . Of course we do not object to Sir William Hamilton 's saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composite , nor to his making a mental discrimination of its simples . But we utterly object to his making these simples discernible in composition , any more than oxygen and hydrogen are discernible in water . It constitutes the very definition of knowledge and perception , that it fuses man and nature , or that which knows and that which is known : just as it constitutes the definition of water , that it is the fusion of oxygen and hydrogen . In both cases alike , no doubt , the fusion is operated in definite proportions ; but this fact only guarantees the perfection of the fusion . As the fact of fusion thus constitutes the integrity of both phenomena , it is at once obvious that when we simplify or decompose either water or perception , we really destroy it . As in the one case we have no longer water but only hydrogen and oxygen , so in the other we have no longcr perception , but only man and nature . The theory of Perception maintained by Sir William hamilton is stifled , therefore , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended in the defeat of its own parturition . It is not a case of suicide , but of simple miscarriage , or failure to come to the birth . Nor is the sophism which underlies the theory at all difficult to discover . It consists in confounding the realm of life or consciousness , with 4*l4 Novembez // that of nature or simple existence . Man exists sensibly as well as consciously , physically as well as metaphysically . On his physical or organic side he is as much a fact of sense as the rose and the strawberry , and of course , like every fact of sense , becomes cognizable only under conditions of difference with every other fact . But on his metaphysic or spiritual and functional side , he has no existence to sense hut only to consciousness . In so far forth as he feels , and knows , and loves , and chooses-in so far forth , in short , as he strictly lives or is conscious-he is invisible , and no visible difference is predicable accordingly between him and other existence . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or knowledge , nor can we estimate his loves and preferences by the dimensions of space .. Difference indeed , or separation in time and space , becomes denied throughout the realm of consciousness or life , and indistinction or fusion to that extent affirmed . Life fuses or marries what the senses disunite . Now the sophism in question consists in confounding these two realms , the physical with the metaphysical , or that of simple existence with that of life , and in consequently resolvin* a fact of purc consciousness and therefore of relation , into one of pure sense and therefore of difference . Perception or love or choice is not a fact of sense , is not a fact of simple existence like the rose or strawberry ; it is a fact exclusively of life or consciousness , and therefore of relation . It exhibits the fusion or indistinction of man and rose , or man and strawberry , and of course therefore pre-supposes their sensible diversity , or their discrimination as given in sense . But Sir William Hamilton carelessly converts this pre-supposition into a supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consciousness , into the sensible discrepancy of which it is the express obliteration . In other words , when asked to define a living child , he resolves it back into the disunited loins of its father and mother . Consciousness or life gives you only an associate , mixed or relative existence . To live is not to have a bodily organization merely . It is by means of this bodily organization to know , perceive , love , believe , and choose ; that is to say , to become consciously fused with other existence . hence every fact of life or Consciousness is strictly a relation between two or more things  --  a relation , of course , which pre-supposes the sensible difference of its elements , but which for that very reason supposes their conscious , vital , or supersensuous indifference . Take a fact of perception-say the perception of a rose . Can you tell what your part of the fact is , and what the rose 's part ? The question is preposterous . Discrimination is utterly impossible . The house in which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination of bricks and mortar , timber and nails . But if asked to define the house , no one would think of saying , " So many bricks and so much mortar ; so much timber and so many nails . " Because , however much the house presupposed the distinction of these materials , it decidedly supposes their indistinction ; that is to say , fuses them in a manner not to be discriminated in itself . To re-solve the materials of the house into their primal sensible differences , would be equivalent , of course , to the disintegration and consequent destruction of the house itself . But let us signalize our difference from Sir William Hamilton in a manner more fundamental . It will be perceived by every one who attends to the definition of experience given by Sir William , that he assigns the active , personal , or subjective element in every transaction , a prior , interior , or superior place to the passive , impersonal , or objective element . He holds the not-me , or object , to be in every case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , " I see a rose . " Here " I , " the reputed subject , occupies the first place , and the " rose , " or reputed object , occupies the second place . Or , " I love strawberries . " Here " I , " the reputed agent , holds a superior rank , and " strawberries , " the reputed patient , a secondary one . Hence , according to this doctrine , in every fact of experience , whether physical or moral , it is the subject which determines the object , the agent which d*-termines the patient , the me which determines the not-me : and never the contrary . It is abundantly clear from this bare statement of Sir William 's theory of human experience , that it affirms the absoluteness of man . No stronber affirmation of it is possible in fact . To say that the subject determines or governs the object , that the agent determines or governs the patient , that the me determines or governs the not-me is to affirm as effectually as words can affirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent and the me . How will Sir William then reconcile the absoluteness of man , as involved in this distribution of subject and object , with his theory of the relativity of all man 's experience ? If all our knowledge be relative , if in knowing the rose for example a close organic relation be implied between me and it , how is it possible that I should exert any determining or governing powe* over the rose ? How is it possible that I should be under any thing but // a strictly unitary relation with it , or a relation of strict association and accord ? Sir William is bound by the interests of his own logical consistency , to look into these questions , for they indicate a prodigious disproportion between his creed and its philosophical formulary . For our own part , we protest against Sir William 's entire position in the premises . We protest in the first place , against his distribution of object and subject , or against that fallacy of observation which makes the me , or subject , prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second place against the inferential fallacy consequent upon this , namely , that the subject determines the object , or the me the not-me . We have lou0 been convinced , indeed that it is this preposterous distribution ' of object and subject , which fatally vitiates all existing Philosophy . The obvious disqualification of the distribution in question is , that it makes the line of demarcation between subject and object , or between the me and the not-me , to fall within the plane of nature , or between fin'ite and finite , instead of without that plane , or between infinite and finite . We say the obvious disqualification , for it is evident to the least reflection that the plane of the me , and the plane of the finite are identical . We take for granted , *course , **25;94;TOOLONG consciousness , Sir William Hamilton would not be understood as giving it an historical application , or making it represent a merely private experience . In the case , for example , we have already cited , he would not be understood to describe any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , but only a universal fact of life or consciousness . Because otherwise of course the experience would drop out of the domain of life , or metaphysics , into that of fact , or pure physics . With this understanding , then , let us repeat that the plane of the me and that of the finite are identical . Self-consciousness , or the experience of the me , is a process of the strictest definition . I do not know myself i priori , that is intuitively , but &amp; posteriori , or experimentally . That is to say , I know myself only by means of my organic relations to other selves . I say me , and think me , only by virtue of this sensible organization which acts as a hyphen to separate and yet unite me with all other existence . And this fact is universal . It does not pertain to me , A B , peculiarly , but to all existence precisely in the measure of its external organization , that is to say , of its grasp upon nature . Consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every thing in nature according to the relative perfection of its organization , that is to say , according to the comparative hold it has upon other existence . Thus the mineral , inasmuch as it is the basis of all specific forms , inasmuch as it gives body , so to speak , to all individual organizations , must needs itself be almost wholly inorganic or formless , and hence exhibits the most diffuse , and therefore lowest possible form of consciousness or life that of simple gravity , implying inertia or complete subserviency to other existence . The plant being a higher form of organization-that is to say , involving the mineral in itself-boasts of course a higher form of life or consciousness , namely , growth , implying sensation . The plant feels the mineral sustenance and appropriates it to itself , and thereby grows . The animal being a still higher organization , as involving in itself both mineral and vegetable , claims , * of course , a still higher form of consciousness , that of volition or voluntary motion , implying knowledge . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selects the nourishment suitable to him , or goes in search of it . But man , being the hinhest form of organization ( that is to say , involving in himself all other existences , mineral , vegetable , and animal ) , exhibits the highest form of life or consciousness , that of actzon implying spontaneity or spiritual force . Thus the mineral , the vegetable , and the animal arc so many germs of the me , so many rudimental progressions of the finite experience , so many preparatory gymnasia of the consciousness , all destined finally to culminate and acquire a sovereign evolution in man . The mineral involves no other existence but is involved by all , and hence it is characterized by pure inertia , or a disposition to stay where it is put . The me is here exhibited in so universal a form , or one of so little concentration , as to be almost formless ab e tra , and so almost wholly unconscious . The vegetable subordinates the mineral , and hence modifies the latter 's inertia , or subserviency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion of sekhood or limited claim of sovereignty . Here the me is exhibited taking form , becoming pronounced , and aspiring to the dominion of the outward . The animal subordinates the vegetable to haimself and * It is the distance of the mineral from man in the scale of existence , or the total dis *reemcnt between Inertia and action , which makes man 's mineral experience or his experienes of pore inertia , say in falling from &amp; building or other height , the moose odiously repulsive experience known to him . // hence elevates the sensibility of the latter into knowledge , which is a more pregnant assertion of self hood . For the knowledge of what is pleasurably and painfully related to it in outward existence begets will in the animal , and will being always specific begets motion . Here the me is exhibited in greater concentration or in a form to compel from the outv*rard the homage which it claims . Finally , man appears upon the scene , resuming in himself all these lower existences , and hence elevating the animal will into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by so many ties to the finite , deriving inertia from the mineral , sensibility from the vegetable , volition from the animal , man yet transcends these ties , and becomes linked to God or the infinite , by spontaneity or the power of an inward life . It is this alone which constitutes the glory of man , and gives him the lordship of nature , that he lives from within , or acts from a purely spiritual and supernatural inspiration . Hence the me is exhibited in a man under a culminating aspect , or as imaging the Divine style of life . But man 's supremacy here does not disfranchise the lower existences . The perfection of the me in him does not invalidate its imperfection in the lower natures . It manifestly necessitates them as the embryonic conditions of its own development . We utterly deny , therefore , Sir William Hamilton 's claim to find the not-me within time and space , or the realm of the finite . He may find the not-John , the not-Charles , the not-Joseph , there ; or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facts are facts of sense , and therefore of diversity . Not one of them is a fact of consciousness . No John is conscious of his Johuship , no Joseph of his Josephship : nor is any lion conscious of his lionship , nor any elephant of his elephantship . These are all differential names imposed upon these animals and persons , by the necessities of our intelligence exclusively , which they themselves must always remain strictly unconscious of therefore , however accurately informed they may have been upon the subject . But if you proceed thereupon to affirm the not-me as well as the not-John of the Joseph , by taking away his property for example ; or if you proceed to affirm the not-me as well as the not-elephant of the tiger or lion , by taking away his food for example ; or giving him a sharp punch in the ribs ; they will very promptly discharge you of your hallucination according to their various instincts of the me , as higher or lower . For , as we have said before , the sentiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , so that you shall nowhere find a fact of organization without also finding some , however low , form of life or consciousness , were it that only of simple inertia . It is useless therefore to look into the realm of the fi*tite , or th' sphere of visible existence , for the abode of the not-me . Organization utterly disclaims it , confessing only the me . But allowing the contrary pretension for a moment ; allowing that the object , the patient , the not-me is formally exterior to the subject , the agent , or the me , and that when I eat a peach accordingly , the object of the transaction is not the gratification of my nature , but , as Sir William Hamilton holds , the peach itself , while I myself again am the subject of that object : allowing all this , we say , for the sake of the argument , then evidently it results that the logical reciprocity which Sir William affirms between subject and object , is by no means a practical reciprocity , but exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a purely consumptive or exterminating attitude toward the object or not-me , while the latter again is arrayed in a purely nutrimental or succulent attitude toward it . If , then , the function of the subject is to consume the object , of the agent to absorb the patient , of the me to exterminate the not-me , will Sir William hamilton be good enough to reveal to us the " correlation " he finds in that most unequal and inequitable connection ' ? Any relationship even is inconceivable , without the imputation of cannibalism to one of the parties ; and a co-relationship therefore becomes especially preposterous . Relatives in any transaction or experience mean , if words mean any thing , partners , and they divide the transaction between themselves according to the measure of their respective interests . Correlatives , consequently , in any phenomenon , are copartuers , dividing the phenomenon equally between themselves . Sir Wil-. ham Hamilton might , therefore , with exactly the same propriety , talk of the correlation between the cat and the mouse , the lion and the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and object nuder this distribution . In fact , the entire doctrine of the old Philosophy on this subject is an egregious blunder , which an intellect so acute as Sir William Ilamilton 's could have failed to penetrate only through an excessive reverence for learned tradition . But if the whole realm of organization repugns the allegation of the not-me , if every form of sensible existence witnesses in some degree or other only to the me , // where shall we find the residence of the not-me ' ? Where shall we discover the true abode of the object ? Evidently we find it only within the me , or as an interior fact to the subject . What constitutes self hood ? What constitutes that experience which we denominate the me ? In other words , what is universally involved in the fact of organization ? The accord of an object and a subject . Every fact of organization supposes , first , whatwe call a nature , and , second , a subject of that nature . Take , for instance , the organization called a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal , or that thing which he partakes in common with all horses , and which furnishes the object , end , or inspiration of all his motion ; and second , an individual or differential form , freely obedient to all the impulses of that nature . Or , take the organization called a peartree . This organization involves , first , the nature of the tree , or that thing which the tree possesses in common with all pear-trees , and which furnishes the object , end , or source of all its growth and fructification ; and , second , a specific or differential form , obedient , when not constrained ab extra , to all the impulses of that nature . Or , take the organization called a man . It involves , in the first place , what we call the human nature , or that thing which the man possesses in common with all men , and which furnishes the object , end or source of all his action ; and , second , a specific or individual form , obedient , when unconstrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly what is involved in all organization , the alliance of an objective and governing nature with a subjective and obedient form . This is precisely what is involved in every conception of the selfhood , or in every experience of the me , the accord of a dominant object with a freely submissive subject . Thus , when the plant grows by appropriating the nutriment of the soil and the atmosphere , it derives its power to do so wholly from within , or from what we call its nature . And when the animal moves about seeking his proper nourishment or the satisfaction of his natural appetites , his impulse , as the very phraseelogy of the statement proves comes from within or from his nature . The objectthe aim  --  the source-of his motion is purely the satisfaction of his nature , the gratification of a natural appetite . His motion is not determined by any thing in the field of his senses , by any thing without the limits of his organization , but solely by a feeling within those limits which craves to he satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely , he acts most spontaneously , that is to say , least from outward constraint , the constraint of hope or fear , and most from inward relish or taste . Here accordingly , and here alone , do we find the true objective , or sphere of the not-me , not in the realm of time and space , but exclusively within the subject , or in the realm of affection and thought . The not-me has no physical existence , but only a spiritual one . But if this be the case , if the not-me or object be thus interior to the me or subject , it becomes immediately obvious that it is also superior to the latter , and exerts in fact a determining influence over it . For the progress of life is always from within outwards , or from the centre to the circumference . It is the nature of the subject which governs his activity , which constitutes the true object of his action and the nature of the subject is always interior to the subject 's self . Take , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of green , or , I take it without really choosing it , from a good-natured desire not to give my hostess trouble . Now the actionwhich in one of these cases is an action of choice and in the other , of simple acquiescence , but which in either case is wholly identical with the fact of choice or acquiescence-involves like all action a subject and an object . I , who am differentially known to you as A B , am the subject of the action : the gratification of my palate , the necessities of my nervous system , the desire to conciliate my friend and hostess , or what not , is the object of it . The object of the action is not black tea as Sir William Ilamilton would allege ; for black tea is incorporate or consubstantiate with the action itself-is given in the actionand clearly no action incorporates or supplies its own object , any more than it does its own subject . To say that the action supplies its own object , would be to make itself its object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides in that case-in case you confound the action of taking black tea with the object of taking ityou bind yourself also to admit the ludicrous inference from that confusion , namely , that I , bearing as subject an inseparable correlation or proportion to the object , am the inseparable subject of black tea that is to say a subject of that which I nevertheless habitually and remorselessly consume Was ever any thing so preposterous , as to conceive of a subject consuming its own object ? The conception is contradictory and outrages the truth of things . The subject , on the contrary , derives its life from the object ; it is the object alone which animates the subject , and empowers him to subject again to himself all that // outlying universe of black tea with its associated delights , which affords him the materials of action , or a free stage of development . Surely all this is too plain for denial . No one can help perceiving that it is the object in every case which determines the subject , the patient which determines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And perceiving this , it is of course inevitable to perceive also that the objective realm is necessarily interior and prior to the subjective . Whence then the contrary persuasion under which Philosophy has so long labored ? Whence befalls it that a person of Sir William Hamilton 's signal ability should have so long overlooked a fallacy so momentous ? We doubt not that we shall be able to give a perfectly satisfactory answer to these questions , without unduly tasking the attention of our readers . The mistake originates in a purely sensuous or unscientific judgment m regard to the me . All the existing schools of Philosophy , whatever be their minor differences , whether orthodox or sceptical , materialist , or idealist , practically concur in making the me absolute . They all agree in mistaking conscious or composite existence for absolute or simple existence . Sir William Hamilton , for example , manifestly regards the me as having an existence in se , and apart from consciousness . He manifestly regards it as an independent entity , manifested indeed through organization or experience , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not complain that he regards the selfhood or me as uncreated by the sensible organization or experience , since the contrary judgment would be childish and contradictory . We only complain that in common with all philosophers he denies it to be wholly constituted by such organization or experience , practically allowing it a prior and superior constitution , a constitution in se . There blooms the rose . This rose is an absolute or simple existence ; that is to say it is given by my senses , and pronounced therefore to be quite independent of my consciousness . The senses declare it to exist in se or absolutely , and so free from all dependence upon myself . Its existence does not involve or necessitate mine . Now the me does not exist like the rose . It has no absolute or simple existence . It has no existence to sense . No fact of consciousness is appreciable to sense . We can not say , except to very youn0 children* that we love a bushel-full and to talk of a perception six feet high with octagonal sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very impenetrable , or of a choice which is fat and sonorous , is to talk nonsense , that is , what the senses do not recognize . Consciousness involves in itself the whole universe of sense . It pre-supposes sense , and consequently if you attempt to re-solve it into sense , you destroy it And so on the other hand , no fact of ciable to consciousness . sense is appreWe are utterly unconscious , for example , of sounds and colors , and odors and savors ; we are wholly unconscious of boiled and roast , of sunset and sunrise , of sloping lawns and flowing waters , of all in short that is irk the heavens above , and the earth beneath , and in the waters under the earth , because all these are things , or absolute and simple existences , as given in sense . But the me is not given in sense . It is not a simple or absolute existence , but a purely conscious and therefore composite one . It does not exist out of its own knowledge or experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In self-con .. sciousness , for example , I know myself not as a sensible and therefore absolute or simple existence-not in se. as I know the horse , the rose , and the mountain .. - .. but only as suffering pleasure and pain from outward things , that is to say as * purely relative existence . I do not know myself at first as an independent and uncommitted existence , as a bundle of facul ' ties and potencics , and then as putting forth these faculties to take hold of out .. lying things . Quite the contrary . I know myself first rather as a pure passivity than as a potency , rather as apprehended of external things than as apprehending them . In short , I know myself only as seeing , hearing , tasting , smelling , touching , knowing , remembering , perceiving , reflecting-that is , as intimately blent with earth and sky and the various things they embosom . Destroy these experiences , destroy these relations I am under to mountain and valley , to garden and vineyard , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you destroy my self-consciousness . Of course I do not mean to say that the universe of nature creates me or gives me being , but only that it constitutes me or gives me body . Whatsoever creates a thing , or gives it being , involves the thing , not the thing it . The Creator involves the creature ; the creature evolves the Creator , on the contrary . Thus what we are talking of is not the creation of the me but only its constitution . The rose is constituted of various properties appreciable to a sensible analysis ; but no one supposes that these properties give it being . They give it simply form or body . So my house is constituted of stone and lime , timber and iron ; but no one deems that these materials create the house . They // 480 Works of , S*ir William Hamilton . merely give it body or form . Both the rose and the house involve their several constituents ; these constituents only evolve them . In like manner the me as given in consciousness involves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And therefore we repeat that if you destroy the sensible universe , and so destroy my relations to it , or what is the same thing , destroy me as a seeing , smelling , tasting , touching , knowing , reflecting , remembering subject , you destroy me as defined by consciousness , and so resolve me into my creative source . Consciousness , or the knowledge of myself as a relative existence , alone separates me from my creative source . Take away my consciousness , or my knowledge of myself as related to the sensible universe , or the realm of the finite , and at the same time let me survive , and you make me God . For it constitutes the very infinitude of God that He knows Himself ab-intra exclusively and not ab-e tra , or that He is nuconscious of Himself in relation to others . Thus it is consciousness which allies me inseparably to the finite , and consequently stamps God or the Infinite to my apprehension as the exclusive not-me . Now Sir William Hamilton practically disregards this constitution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , instead of a purely conscious or composite one . He holds indeed that the me is manifested under relations or in consciousness , but it never occurs to him that it is exhausted or wholly contained in these relations . He evidently views these relations only as so many affections or accidents of the me , not as its inalienable constitution , and accordingly posits the me as an absolute or independent cntity spatially within the body . Hence his ineffectual pains to exorcise the problem of Perception of its difficulties , and hence moreover the questionable humility with which he so often seeks to convert the accidental fatuity of the private philosopher , into the essential infirmity of universal man . How the whole heart sickens , and the whole head faints , to think of the weary and delirious books that are written to show how the mind that dwells spatially within the body , manages to get a knowledge of the things that dwell spatially without the body . Some of these authors bridge the chasm , or rather deny the chasm and so dodge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external world , and resolving its phenomena into products of the senses . Others attempt the same dodge by admitting the reality of the external world , but at the same time denying the mind 's knowledge of it , substituting in place of that the knowledge of a representative or vicarious world . Others again-among whom our author claims the first place-insist both upon the reality of the external world , and upon the directness or immcdiateness of our knowledge of it . Whoever wishes to see the entire controversy elucidated , not indeed as to the true issue involved but as to the rank and importance of the various combatants , will find a boundless satisfaction in Sir William hamilton 's additions to Reid , and in the Edinburgh Review article onPerception , rcprinted in the Discussions . lie will there discover if he brings an unprejudiced understanding to the encounter , that the controversy has always been and always will be discreditable one to all the parties concerned , simply because there is literally nothing to contend about , literally no co'rpns delicti concerning which there exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for-which is the intercourse of the soul or mind or me , regarded as spatially included in the body , with nature or what is spatially without the body-has no existence in rerunt naturd . There is no such entity or thing as the mind , the soul , the me , having the dimensions of space and time , and capable either of physical inclusion or exclusion . There is in the universe no entity or thing - that is , simple or absolute existencewhich is not material , which does not fall within the cognizance of the senses . What is not entity or thing is Life , is Personality , and this is exclusively spiritual , being an or5anic form of Love and Wisdom , or Goodness and Truth . Consequently the me , the mind , does not exist spatially within the body , nor in spatial separation therefore from man and horse , from river and plain , from sky and valley . It exists only in intimate and indissoluble union with these things , a union which is strictly constitutional , and hence utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton alleges between them . here then lies the fundamental fallacy of the old Philosophy of Perception as reproduced and redintegrated by Sir William hamilton , namely , in confounding existence with life , or in making that which constitutes a thing external to the thing itself ; which is tantamount to the sowing irreconcilable diversity where perfect fusion or identification only should obtain . The realm of Perception , the whole realm of emotion strictly so called , excludes the discrimination of object and subject , because this realm gives you the me alone , the me as organically involving indeed the sensible universe , but by no means as subject also to the not-me . This // 1858 . The Crucifix. subjection stands disclosed only in the realm of Life or Action . The distinction of object and subject , of the not-me and the me , post-dates sensibility and intellinence , and accrues only when the me as thus constituted goes forth into action , or proceeds to modify external nature . To affirm the me without the implication of sensible nature , is as absurd as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the albumen ; and to affirm the distinction of object and subject within these constitutional limits , would be as utterly inadmissible in the one case as in the other . Perception and emotion of whatever sort express the constitution of the me and are thus simply pre-supposed in its subsequent life or action . Hence they totally ignore and exclude from their own area that ineffaceable antagonism of prior and posterior , superior and inferior , which is implied in the logical contrast of object and subject , or not-me and me . Perception uniformly supposes a seeing thing , ( as an eye , ) and a seen thing , ( as a rose . ) It is made up of these things equally , so that if you take either of them away you utterly destroy Perception . Hence , of course , all priority or superiority as attaching to either element in the transaction , is impossible . In fact all contrast between the elements is impossible , and only fusion or indistinction to be affirmed . Simple as all this is , it yet reveals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utterly disqualifies it as the basis of a rational philosophy . We should like to pursue the theme , but our space warns us to forbear . Especially we should like to examine Sir William Hamilton 's speculations on Causation ; but we must also postpone this pleasure to a future opportunity .
