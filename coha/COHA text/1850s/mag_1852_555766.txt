txt ART . ViJ. - The Past , Present , and Future of the Repub*. lic . Translated from the French of ALPHONSE DE LAMARTINE , author of " The History of the Girondists , " " Memoirs of my Youth , " &amp;c . New York : Harpers. 1850. l2mo. pp. 163 . IMPENETRABLE self-ignorance is undoubtedly the most salient feature of Lamartine 's character . This results in great part from an egoism too intense and engrossing to permit him ever to contemplate himself objectively . But , as he appears to us at certainly a sufficient distance for a just perspective , he possesses no great qualities . As a writer , he is sentimental rather than imaginative . He has few original conceptions , but is a skilful manipulator of the current language of feeling . He has a strong poetic susceptibility , yet lacks creative genius . The true poet can always be , if he will , a man of practical wisdom ; for his mission is not to disfigure or to derange 38* // the things that are , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into being by his fancy have a realm of their own , entirely distinct from the external world . The sentimentalist , on the other hand , looks at existing objects through colored and distorted media , and his conceptions are in one direction excessive , in another inadequate , in all grotesque . In the department of politics , there recur to our*cnemory two striking illustrations of this contrast , in Milton and Rousseau . Had Milton devoted himself wholly to the science of government , he would probably have had a less keen insight into the grounds , the limitations , and the safeguards of constitutional freedom ; for from beyond " the flaming bounds of space " he brought back to earthly things a vision purged and clarified by its conversance with things heavenly . Rousseau recognized no line of demarcation between the ideal and the actual . He lacked the creative power on which he prided himself , and had just enough of fancy , and just little enough of common sense , to paint in gross caricature alike the facts of experience and the subjects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " such stuff as dreams are made of . " Lamartine is a politician of the Rousseau school , and , in England or in this country , would sooner have been made a tinker than a statesman . His part in the revolution of 1848 , taken by itself , would authorize us in regarding him as a profligate adventurer , cloaking under the show of patriotism and philanthropy an ambition as reckless and sanguinary as Catihine 's . Yet , when we read his political writings , we are inclined to regard him as rather a fool than a knave . We can conceive of him as honest , so far as honesty can be affirmed of a man who intermeddles with affairs which neither native talent nor acquired wisdom has qualified him to handle . His histories are abortive epic poems . His speculations on government display equal ignorance of the actual , and unskilfulness in the treatment of the ideal . The man who could write thus can hardly be deemed morally responsible for the foolhardiness of the revolution , or for the details of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strange medley of inconsequent reasoning , declamatory radicalism , and mawkish sentimentality . The best portion of it is the Introduction , which we quote entire . // 4 447 The Future of Labor . " Under the monarchy , the two chambers every year prepared an address to the king , by way of response to the speech from the throne . In this address they exposed , with more or less sincerity , the general situation of the kingdom , and very briefly treated two or three of the principal affairs of the state . This was sufficient in a time and under a system in wh*ch the people had neither eye , nor will , nor hand in the public business ; in a time when the government of thirty-six million souls belonged alone to two hundred and sixty thousand political citizens called electors , to two hundred peers of France , to four hundred depu. ties , and to a dynasty . What concern , then , had the rest of the nation , that is to say , the thirty-five millions and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without political action , in being informed as to the real situation of things , of the general mind of Europe , of the government ? It was enough for them to read once a year the newly-enacted laws , in order to know what they must obey , and the amount of their taxes sent them by the collector , in order to know how much they had to pay . To obey and to pay then made up the man ; to know , to judge , to appreciate , to deliberate , to wish , to choose , to elect , to pay a voluntary obedience to the law , which is but the general will , such is now the duty of the citizen . " These two so different conditions of the subject of the law , not consulted in its enactment under the monarchy , and the citizen , the author and executor of the law in the Republic , require conditions equally different in the nature of the publicity given to affairs , and in the elements of the political notions to be disseminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of a nation which the republican state calls to the office of self-government . It is , then , to the people that we must now address those reports upon the true situation of the Republic , upon the whole , and the details of the public business , which in times past were prepared for the king . It is to the people that we must present the faithful mirror of all the ideas and all the facts visible on the horizon of the past and of the future year , saying , Behold thyself as thou art ! Behold things and men ! Behold the route on which thou art travelling ! Behold the events and the progress accomplished ! Behold the dangers which threaten thee ! Behold the evils with which factions afflict thee , the good with which Providence blesses ! And act , foresee , provide , choose ; govern thyself by this information , on which thou canst rely , because it is given aloud , in open day , and under the responsibility of men whose names are signed to their words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of recapitulating briefly , for the use of those who have not the time to read every // morning the innumerable swarm of public journals , the principal events since the foundation of the Republic ; of analyzing the ideas , the doctrines , the opinions , the illusions , the truths which dispute possession of the intelligence of the masses . My purpose is , therefore , to prepare a sort of general report on the situation of Europe , particularly of France , in the form of an Address to the People . Under the Republic , all is not done , - the principal thing , even , is not done , when we govern by the laws . We must also govern by convictions . What is it that governs convictions ? It is the truth . Here , then , follows the truth upon our situation , as far as a man may flatter himself that he sees it and speaks it . " pp. 5 , 6 . The chief object of the book is to demonstrate the inde. * structibility of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we might condense into a single sentence . There are so many mutually hostile parties in France , that , ( though the great majority are either attached to one or another form in which royalty might be restored , or else belong to the lower depths of communism or red republicanism , ) no one of the parties out of power is strong enough to gain supremacy for itself , or hates the existing regime less cordially than it hates each and all of its rival parties out of power . Consequently , the balanced repulsions of mutual hatred will insure perpetuity to the republic as now organized , as effectually as it would be secured by the loyal attachment of the entire nation . Strange to say , we were not convinced . We reached the rash conclusion , however , that the republic would last till April , and that an article written upon it would not become obsolete during its passage through the press . We read the book one evening , and extinguished our study lamp with the intention of commencing our article the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to market , we were told that the French republic was no more . We then became afraid to haziird our reputation by speculating on French affairs , apprehending that , while our lucubrations were passing through the slow press of the Quarterly , the Daily Gazette might chronicle a brace or two of revolutions which had not entered into our horoscope . We have there*. fore determined to change our hand , and , taking our text from the condition of France , to try our skill upon the problem , which the French are so blindly endeavoring to solve , THE FUTURE OF LABOR . // We may comprise the complaints made as to the condition of the laboring classes under two heads , namely , that they are overworked and underfed . The two desiderata claimed for them are more ample leisure and fuller remuneration , - demands which at first sight seem to clash with each other , but which , as we shall see in the sequel , must proceed toward realization pan passu . What constitutes wages ? It is a fundamental truth of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toil are reciprocal terms , that commodities have an average market price in precise proportion to the labor expended in their production and transportation , so that a day 's wages is the ultimate measure of all value . But behind this truth lies another , of equal interest to the economist and the moralist ; namely , that the wages of labor depend on the self-respect , the culture , and the social position of the laborer , which determine what remuneration he is competent to demand and society will deem it just to award to him . Thus , if wages are higher in New England than in any other part of the world , this fact is to be ascribed chiefly to the high standard of education on the part of the laboring classes , which places them in a condition in which they can claim , with the general consent of their employers , a corresponding measure of individual and domestic comfort and enjoyment . And , if wages are to be generally reduced among us by competition from abroad , it will not be by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lower standard of self-respect and of comfort , by their contented acquiescence in rags and squa .. lidness . The respective dividends of the earnings of labor , which shall accrue to the capitalist and the laborer , have no determinate measure , nor is it possible to fix upon any rule of proportion which should be applied to them independently of circumstances . Capital should , and always will , in the long run , repay itself with increase , else it would become fixed and non-productive ; and we can conceive of a rate of wages which should paralyze industry , and cause stagnation in the whole social system . But there is no intrinsic necessity , either economical or moral , for a state of things in which capitalists shall grow rapidly rich , while laborers remain permanently poor . It is necessary and right , that , in the common operations of industry , capital should he accumulated in // sufficient masses to furnish safety-funds against occasional loss , and movement-funds for extended operations . But the frequent opportunity for amassing great wealth is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society will always be diversified . But there is no need of Alpine scenery , of wealth piled mountain high , with sunless and barren ravines in the chasms . In this case , the summits will be barren also ; for of overgrown estates , an inordinately large proportion is invested or expended unpro* ductively , as in the immense pleasure-grounds , the splendid palaces , and the ancestral plate of the English nobility . Far better is it , that hill and valley should alike lie under the warm sunlight , and wave with harvest wealth . We can now perceive , that the laborer is most likely to be underpaid when he is overworked . If he toil unremittingly , and have no time for recreation , for home enjoyment , or for the culture of his higher nature , his wants will be few and cheap , his perception of his own rights will be vague , his ability to claim and defend them will be feeble , and his compensation , therefore , will be adjusted by the lowest standard of necessity . But so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobriety , he approaches the level of his employer , his visible and admitted needs are enhanced , his rightful claim to a generous remuneration is recognized , and his wages approxi .. mate more nearly to his due proportion of the value that he creates . The working of this principle has been attested by the establishment of the " ten hour system ' * in many departments of mechanical industry . This system met with strong opposition in the outset ; but it was urged by precisely those classes of mechanics whose avocations demanded sufficient skill to render them intelligent and respectable citizens , competent to confront their emp4oyers on equal terms . Wages have not fallen in consequence of this change , but have rather risen ; for greater leisure has placed mechanics of these classes in a more advantageous position , has increased their needs and their demands , and has constrained the reluct* ant assent of employers to their claims . There was , indeed , when this system was in its infancy , a feeling of injustice on the part of employers ; but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis , and subsides as the prescription fades from remembrance . // But there are many departments of labor , in which the available hours of the day , or the strength of the laborer , constitute the only limit of toil . In manufactures , which demand a large amount of fixed capital in buildings and machinery , it is deemed expedient , with little regard to the state of the market , to drive operations to the utmost limit of human endurance . There are seasons when the farm-laborer in New England must perform double the task of a Southern slave , and is prevented from sinking under excess of toil only by the salubrity of his workshop . In our cities , and yet more in all the great capitals of Europe , there are mechanical trades in which the journeymen must even abbreviate their hours of sleep , if they would keep soul and body together . The severest case of all is that of needlewomen , both in America and Europe , who must often toil eighteen hours out of the twenty-four , to win a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we take these and similar conditions of life into view , we can not but acknowledge that there is some show of reason and justice in the war-cry of the French proletaries for " the Emancipation of Labor . " But can labor be emancipated ? Do not the necessities of subsistence , and the demands of increasing wealth and luxury , require for their supply the incessant toil of an overwhelming majority of the civilized world ? Can any con* siderable abatement take place in the amount of manual industry as compared with population , without a decline in the arts , comforts , and refinements of social and domestic life ? We would first answer , that , if we suppose the amount of labor undiminished , still a large accession to the laboring classes is not only possible , but , in a better future , probable ; and that thus , if in no other way , individual burdens may be lightened and more abundant leisure secured . Multitudes of people , who , by capacity and education fairly belong to the ranks of productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . The learned professions , ( would that they could be so called otherwise than by courtesy , ) are over-crowded with technically*qualifled members , together with a still more numerous rear-guard of itinerants , pettifoggers , and quacks , who create a large proportion of the business on which those // of the several regular faculties depend for their subsistence . In commerce , the number of stages through which commodities pass from the producer to the consumer , is needlessly multiplied , and those who hinder , are hardly less numerous than those who expedite , their transfer . Hundreds of young men are every year pressing into mercantile life , without talent or education for business , or even standing-room in the crowd of competitors , whose destiny is to flounder through successive failures to an idle and beggarly old age . Of supernumeraries in the nominal service of the government , of office-seekers lazily waiting for the flow , and of ex-officials stranded by the ebb , of public patronage , the name is Legion . We have before us a list of twenty-two officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average collection of revenue is less than ten thousand dollars per annum ; and of these persons , no less than fourteen have been industrious mechanics , but will never be so again . The standing armies of the old world are confessedly of use only as a check upon each other ; and their general disbanding would leave the political relations of the sovereignties of Europe only the more secure , while several millions of unproductive consumers would in that case become producers . Moreover , in a thoroughly Christianized state of society , ( and we are now dealing with possibilities , not alone with such expectations as may be speedily realized , ) the military and naval armaments now regarded as essential to a peace establishment would be superseded , and their forces would be thrown into the various departments of manual industry . To all these descriptions of persons , we must add full as large a number for those who are disabled by destructive vices , and for those who gain a livelihood by the various forms of immoral agency . Now , all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings of industry , so that the joint income of capital and labor would be no more heavily taxed to support them as producers , than it is to feed and clothe them as non-producers . But if all worked who might work and ought to work , and if the needs of subsistence , comfort , and luxury remained unchanged , the amount of labor performed by the individual would be essentially diminished , while society could afford the same average amount of wages to the increased number of producers , which is now paid to producers and non-producers. // We would , in the next place , remind our readers of the vast amount of needless and wasteful production . We say nothing of commodities of taste and of legitimate luxury ; for they are the natural and fitting growth of civilization , and the philanthropist can only desire that they should be multiplied by inventive genius , and more and more generally diffused by summary and cheap processes of manufacture . We will only specify , under this head , the single item of spirituous liquors . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least half of the sugar and grain crops of the world finds its way to market in this form ; and it would be a large estimate were we to allow a tenth part of the product of this manufacture for medical and mechanical uses , or a fifth part for what , by the most liberal construction , might be termed its temperate consumption . But , notwithstanding the large force needlessly abstracted from the ranks of productive industry , and the great amount of worse than useless production , the hand-labor of Christendom , when in full employ , at no very distant intervals gluts every market , and heaps up vast quantities of unsalable goods on the shelves of dealers . When this takes place , prices become ruinously low , and by forced sales a stimulus is given to needless purchase and wasteful consumption . Meanwhile factories suspend their operations , breadstuffs remote from a market are left to rot on the farmer 's hands , laborers are thrown out of employment by the thousand , and the general industry suffers a paralysis , till the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises prices and stimulates enterprise anew . All this indicates that there is more work done than man needs to have done . If , when men work twelve or fourteen hours a day , a large proportion of the laborers must remain idle one year out of every four or five , in order that the supply of commodities may not utterly outstrip the demand , the same result could be more healthfully produced by their working but eight , nine , or ten hours a day , and receiving constant employment . The general reduction of the hours of labor is a result which must soon grow from motives of true economy and financial expediency . It can not be hastened by agitation and factious combinations , which only excite angry and contemptuous resistance , and array public opinion on the wrong // side . But with the diffusion of sound maxims of policy and an enlarged perception of reciprocal rights and obligations , this desired consummation must needs be gradually realized . The disastrous system of overworking and over-production must be permanently set aside ; and the hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supersede these spasms of consuming toil and these intervals of hungry idleness , which now alternate in the industrial history of the civilized world . We have seen reason to believe that it is a law of the Divine Providence , that much less than the incessant toil of the laboring classes will supply all that man needs for sustenance , comfort , and luxury . Provi4ence has therefore indicated for the laborer ample season for relaxation and improvement . In a state of society conformed to its essential laws , no day could pass for any member of the community in exhausting labor ; but every day would have its hours for rel ) 05e , for domestic enjoyment , for the culture of the mental powers , for the indulgence of refined tastes and pure affections . Thus , by the universal diffusion of the elevating influences which follow in the train of leisure and prosperity , the artificial distinctions of society would lose their basis , and would gradually fall away . All occupations would become , in a certain sense , liberal professions . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor upon it . All the menial offices of society would be discharged , without degrading associations being attached to them ; for those who performed the humblest functions , instead of being , as now , wholly merged in and identified with their callings , would have an intellectual , social , and moral existence entirely independent of them . By what means may this " future of labor " be accelerated ? Among these means , the institutions of popular education take the precedence . We have spdken of the growing competition of our immigrant with our home-born laborers . The only way of checking the disastrous consequences of this competition is to force education on the children of immigrants , and thus to create in them the artificial wants and the elevated standard of comfort which are inseparably connected with intelligence . We are not unaware of the increasing difficulty of satisfying the demands of our foreign population in this regard . The dread of Protestant influence threatens // to alienate the whole body of ' Romanists from our common school system ; and it has been openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they prefer the utter ignorance of the people under their charge to the Instruction of heretics and the contamination of heretical books . It is a perplexing question , how far concessions may be safely made to the genius of a church , which has done its utmost to demonstrate that " Ignorance is the mother of Devotion , " and which can always evade its promises on the plea that " no faith is to he kept with heretics . " As a Christian people , we can not without gross impiety exclude the Scriptures from our schools , though many doubt whether there can be any valid objection to the substitution of the Douay Bible for our Common Version , where the Romish element preponderates in a class or school . Beyond this , the expurgation of our reading-books , histories , and other manuals of education , of all that hears traces of Protestantism , is an absurd demand and an impossible achievement . It has , indeed , been strongly urged , ( and the claim has unfortunately been sustained by not a few tide-waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the education of the children of Romanists be wholly yielded up to the functionaries of their own church , or to school agents selected from their own body . Such an arrangement would be in express violation of the letter of ' some , and of the spirit of all , our State constitutions , which secure equal rights to the various denominations of Christians , and preclude the preference of one over another , in point of privilege or immunity . The Episcopalians , Quakers , or Universalists might , on precisely analogous grounds , claim the control of their respective portions of the public education funds ; for they might easily establish as plausible a case of grievance in their denominational sympathies as the Romanists plead . All that any sect can claim , with a shadow of justice , is , that its members shall be candidates , on the same footing with all other qualified persons , for offices of trust , discipline , and government , in connection with our public schools . But , even were it right , we should not deem it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly to the functionaries of the Romish church . They are , with few exceptions , men of foreign origin , attachments , and quasi // allegiance . Of our whole people , they are the least Amen .. can , and the least capable of becoming reliahly naturalized . It can hardly be doubted , that a system of education conducted under their sole auspices would tend to perpetuate international jealousies and animosities , to make our immigrant population an imperium in imperio , and to clog the process of healthful absorption and assimilation , by which our body politic converts foreign and heterogeneous elements into its own substance . In some portions of our country , large sections of the imported laboring population retain and transmit to their children " the tongue in which they were horn , " and thus forfeit for them the benefit to be derived from public education , and train them in a condition of ignorance and stupidity , which degrades labor , enhances its burdens , and cuts short its recompense . This blind attachment to the ancestral language is especially characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful attempt hws been made at once to humor and to neutralize this prejudice . In every public school-house there are both German and English schools , and the German childi*en have the privilege of instruction in their own language every other week , on condition of their spending the alternate week in an English school . In this way , thousands of children , who would otherwise be left in brutish ignorance , are trained to become citizens worthy of the name , and to dignify and liberalize the very forms of manual industry , which they would otherwise depress , both for themselves and for their competitors of Anglo-Saxon descent . Next to the children of foreigners , our manufacturing population , present and future , claims special regard in connection with our educational institutions . The minute subdivision of labor has a direct tendency to dwarf the intellect . A man is less of a man in intelligence , skill , range of ideas , and scope of activity , when he makes a twentieth part of a pin , than if he made the whole pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a web , than if he took the wool or cotton home , and brought the finished cloth to market . Improvements in machinery tend to make the operative less and less an intelligent agent , and more and more a machine , in which last capacity he will be fed and clothed at the cheapest rate // at which he can be kept in working order . To this beggarly standard are many classes of the operatives in the British islands reduced ; whereas , when corresponding descriptions of manufacture were performed without the agency of steam or water power , the manufacturers earned a generous subsistence . In this country , factory operatives are , at present , well paid ; and they are so , because they have not yet become a distinct and permanent class , but are constantly reinforced from the intelligent and self-respecting families of our yeomanry . But this can hardly be the case twenty years hence . They will become a separate estate in the community . Children will follow their parents into the mills , and will grow up with such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in the intervals of toil . If driven in the incessant round of labor , from day-dawn till nightfall , they must rapidly degenerate in intelligence , taste , and character , and must become a race of mere drudges and serfs . To obviate this tendency , the schoolmaster 's certificate ought to be an indispensable credential for the admission of the juvenile operative . There should be an age , beneath which no child should be furnished with employment . There should be libraries , public lectures , and evening schools , freely open to the operatives , at the slight cost which might be necessary to render such privileges an object of desire . Philanthropy should devise and employ every possible means of stimulating minds wearied and jaded by the monotony of the noisy routine within the factory walls . There should be the most jealous watchfulness for the moral purity of each separate community of laborers , and the prompt excision of all whose example or influence might prove contaminating . It is the pride of our New England mnanufactories , that these principles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose Christian benevolence and foresight transcended even their financial skill and industrial enterprise . Never was there devised a more thorough system of mental culture , moral guardianship , and religious influence , than in connection with the earliest manufactories in Waltham and Lowell . At the former place , under the patronage of the manufacturing company , the modern system of popular lectures had its birth , and the Rumford Institute of Waltham was the first Lyceum on this continent . Wherever the con-39* // trol of similar corporations has passed into the hands of those same capitalists , their associates or successors , a similar liberality has been exercised ; and numerous have been the instances , when , during years in which the machinery has been run at a loss , generous contributions have been made from the treasury , for the increase of libraries , the maintenance of lectures , the erection of churches , and the support of religious teachers . Let this policy be persevered in , and our manufacturing cities and villages will still be , as they have been , the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and will contribute largely toward the ultimate " emancipation of labor " from whatever can degrade it in the estimation of the community , or can render it crushingly burdensome to those whose destiny it is to eat their bread by the sweat of their brows . We have expressed our belief , that labor will ultimately vindicate its right to ample leisure and full remuneration . Meanwhile it enjoys , in the weekly Sabbath , a season of repose and improvement , the sacred observance and appropriate use of which will be among the surest means of securing for it larger immunities and more extended privileges . The law of the Sabbath is a law , not alone of revelation , but of nature . The institution may be desecrated , may be deformed ; but can be ahrogated by no power short of that which gave it birth . It stands written by the Creator 's hand on the sinews of man and beast , and on the inanimate agents and instruments of labor , as legibly as it was inscribed by the same hand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strength will not bear a perpetual strain . That periodical relief was afforded by primeval revelation , we have other proof , than that furnished by the Hebrew Scriptures . The division of time into weeks , and sacred associations with the number seven , may be traced back to the earliest ages , not only among the Arabs , ( offshoots , indeed , from the Hebrew stock , but separated from it four or five centuries before the promulgation of the Decalogue , ) not only among the Assyrians , Hindoos , and Persians , whose antiquity is sufficient to render their traditions very probably primeval , but also among the Egyptians , a nation flourishing in power , art , and learning , long before the birth of Abraham , and the mother of civilization for the whole // ancient world . A recent writer in the Westminster Review lays great stress on the fact , that no traces of the week or the Sabbath can be found among the nations of the Mongolian race , or among the nearly allied races of America , the extinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ septenary division of time had ever been universal , it must have left some vestiges of itself among those nations . Not necessarily , we would reply , when we consider the paucity of literary remains among those nations , and the narrow extent to which the investigation of their antiquities has been carried . Had Homer and Hesiod been lost , there would be no traces of the Sabbath in Greek literature ; but the reference of both these poets to the sacredness of the seventh day renders it certain , that the Greeks brought with them from the East the septenary institutions and habits common to the Oriental nations , and that they were obliterated by subsequent political arrangements that led to a different division of time , - all which may have been the case with the Mongolian and American races . The primeval and divine origin of the Sabbath becomes the more probable , when we consider that it is not a natural division of time , but that it is precisely adapted to confuse and derange the month , - the most obvious natural division longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full moon were prominently marked by all ancient nations . The average length of the month is twentynine days and a half , so that each successive festival of the new or the full moon must have recurred later in the week than the precedincr - a fact which shows that the week is much more likely to have been an arrangement of positive institution , than an awkward attempt to divide the month by a divisor which leaves , with regard to the month , an annoying and embarrassing remainder . But we have been drawn aside . from the main purpose , for which we made mention of sabbatical institutions . Our intention was not to argue for their antiquity , but to illustrate their necessity , - to show how utterly impossible it is to exact perpetual toil , and how entirely secure labor may be of sufficient leisure , ( if rightly used , ) to elevate the laborer to a position in which he can demand his daily , no less than his weekly Sabbath . Where the septenary division of time has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been awkwardly and imperfectly rendered by saturnalia , festivals , and public games , occasions of universal relaxation and license , in which the lowest menials were not excluded from their share . The very brutes , that work for man , need their Sabbath ; and the extension of its immunities to them in the Decalogue , in an age when neither humanity nor far-sighted selfishness could have had much place in their treatment , is one of the many internal evidences , that that simplest and sublimest compend of practical ethics emanated from the careful providence of Him who " despises nothing that he has made . " Before stage-coaches became subjects of history , there was found to be a most wasteful difference , in the persistency of animal strength , against those lines in which " Sunday shone no Sabbath day , " and in favor of those on which coaches ran but six days in seven . Chateaubriand says , that when , in France , the decade was substituted for the week , in many of the agricultural districts , after a short trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seventh day resumed , in deference to the superior religious wisdom of the cattle , who knew the Sabbath , and would have it . Even the inanimate agents of human industry , the fixtures of steam and water power , and the strongest and best adjusted machinery , need periodical rest and refitting hardly less than the limbs and sinews of the operative ; and , though we can not deem the cleansing of boilers and the repairing of watercourses among the sabbatical occupations peculiarly conducive to the religious welfare of a manufacturing village or city , yet the notorious fact that Sunday is thus employed , often from midnight to midnight , shows that cupidity , driven to desperation , can never obliterate the Sabbath . A seventh part of his time is thus insured for the laborer 's own disposal ; and the question is , How may it best be put at interest , with the promise of certain increase ? On this subject we have no ascetic notions . Where the body is exhausted by excessive toil , or enervated by close air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both rights and duties of the Sabbath . However severe theologians may regard the prolonged sleep or inaction of the Sabbath morning , or the free enjoyment of the outward world , for which the working days furnish no opportunity , // we feel assured that he who made the Sabbath for man has appointed these among its uses ; and those who think otherwise are sacredly bound to secure other breathing-spells for the toil-driven . But this concession need not impair the consecration of the hallowed hours to nobler purposes . The most laborious will find their repose none the less sweet , for the interlude of heavenly harmonies ; their home hours none the less pure and happy , because pervaded by higher themes of thought ; their communion with nature none the less refreshing and invigorating to the body , for the devout and grateful recognition of Him , whose smile glows in the sunlight , plays among the trees , and gleams from the waters . While the body rests , the mind may be awake and active , and the heart may be open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectual repose is found in the change of occupation , in the diversion of the thoughts to other channels , in the vigorous exercise of a new class of faculties , in the transfer of activity from the weary body to the untasked mind and unjaded affections . Toilsome recreation , active sports , convivial dissipation , on the other hand , wear upon the bodily powers already exhausted by the six days ' labor , and leave the higher nature dormant still . And it is these latter uses dr abuses of the day of rest , that make employers grudge the laborers ' Sabbaths , and spurn all thought of superfluous holidays . But let it be shown that the weekly rest is time not wasted for industrial , but saved for intellectual and moral , uses , and let the laborer , by means of it , ascend continually nearer the elevated standard of character which this institution is adapted to create , then will he be able to claim , with authority , and to receive , as his manifest right , the full amount of daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral progress . Believing this , we read the article in the Westminster Review already referred to , not only with dissent and displeasure , but with positive indignation . It was not wholly a severe argument addressed to the learned , but in part an inflammatory appeal to the revolutionary forces of society . It assumed that even the repose of the Sabbath was needless loss of wages to the laborer and of work to the whole community , and that the hedging it in with religious restraints was immeasurably oppressive to the laboring classes . We // have shown , as we think conclusively , that the sabbatical institution , so far from savoring of kingcraft or of priestcraft , is the palladium of the rights of labor , and that the casting off of its restraints is not a measure of emancipation , but a retrograde movement towards slavery . Our next specific , ( and the last which it falls within our present scope to name , ) for the elevation of labor , lies wholly under the control of the laboring classes . It is respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tb eyare , in a great measure , chargeable with whatever of disrespect or non-respect is attached to the various departments of manual industry . Every avocation that contributes to the general comfort and welfare is worthy of honor , in proportion to the diligence and faithfulness of those who fill it . But handlaborers of all descriptions seem to act on the opposite theory . They almost uniformly desert their callings , when they can . Many of them enter those lower walks of commerce , in which neither an extensive capital nor a business education is essential . And in doing so , they sink much more in actual respectability than they rise in their own esteem . When we see an able-bodied man standing from morning to night behind a counter , with a few handfuls of confectionery , a little decayed fruit , and ten or twenty dollars ' worth of groceries , his whole stock in trade not worth a month 's purchase of his bone and muscle , we feel that he has fallen from his place as a vital member of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this feeling with reference to those who forsake useful labor for petty government offices , to be borne at uncertain intervals , and with every change of administration to cast out their incumbents to idleness and starvation . Equally unfortunate in its tendency is the frequent reluctance of laborers and mechanics to educate their children in their own callings . If , through any form of patronage , or by the help of their own little savings , they can establish their sons within the outposts of the mercantile profession , they prefer for them the vague and doubtful prospect of success , and the imminent risk of utter failure , to the certainty of an honorable subsistence by the labor of their own bands . Now this state of things needs to be reversed . Laboring people must learn to regard themselves as honored by the very capacity of toil , and worthy to be honored for their actual services to a community which can in nowise dispense // with their aid . They must remain in their callings , where success , enhanced skill , and a well-won reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than in an altered , position . They must attest their respect for their avocations by training their children to succeed them . Thus will the laboring classes exert over the rest of the community the weight of influence represented by their most experienced and intelligent members , and will realize more speedily and with greater certainty the rights which will be slowly and grudgingly conceded to those who despise their own callings , and desert them whenever they can . It is perhaps asked - Is this all that is implied in the " emancipation of labor ? " What is implied by this phrase in the Utopia of red republicanism , we know not ; and probably the French agitators know as little . But this is all that can ever take place . Labor there must always he , and it must , for the most part , be performed by professional laborers . The requisite strength and skill can be acquired for each separate department only by making it a distinct avocation . To blend manual labor with the intellectual professions is to degrade both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial and ignorant . There is no hardship in manual industry beyon*l that endured in every occupation , into which man enters with a wakeful mind and a strong heart . The man , who hews our wood and digs our garden , has fewer periods of depressing weariness and many more hours of repose , than accrue to us in a profession , which crowds the mind with severe thought , the heart with sympathies almost daily lacerated , the conscience with responsibilities which never relax their pressure . He has as little reason to covet a share of our labor , as we have ability to discharge a portion of his labor . There must be , to the end of time , smiths , builders , ploughmnen , burden-bearers and they must always labor enough to make their fair dividend of their earnings adequate to their comfortable support . The roost that time and the progress of society can do for them , is to reduce the amount of their labor to the actual needs of the community , and to elevate its compensation to the standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have ample means of bodily comfort and enjoyment , and ample leisure to do and to become all that it is their duty to do and their interest to be .
