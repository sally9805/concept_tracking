Truth stranger than Fiction : a Narrative of Recent T " ansactions , involving Inquiries in Regard to the Principles of Honor , Truth , and Justice , which obtain in a Distinguished American Unzverszty .

IT is apparent to any one who will take the trouble to look over the books which make up the burden of a bookseller 's counter , that it has becotne a wonderfully common piece of temerity for a lady to make a book . Apart from the conslderation , that a female author puts much of her personal individuality into her book , being more prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in taking any public stand for praise or blame , a woman risks more than a man . From the time when the boy finds himself struggling among fifty or a hundred other boys , to find the level accorded to // his measure of strength , tact , and talent , till the day when the man must cope with men in the crowded avenues to fame and wealth , - he is sheltered by no prescriptive immunities . Whatever he may say , do , or indite , he knows he must he responsible for , and wince at no consequences ; for any extraordinary exhihition of sensitiveness on his part brings , in natural course , an uncommon exercise of any means of attrition in the power of his merciless fellows . As it was in urchinhood , so it is in graver and wiser years . If he will speak his honest mind on an exciting topic , be must have no fear of brickhat or more unsavory missile , ( we speak metaphorically , of course ) ; he must wrap himself in a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - between the spear-thrusts of ignorant prejudice on the one hand and hard common sense on the other , eternally contending for the verdict of public opinion . To prepare a woman for her peculiar sphere , none of these hardening influences are at work ; her sensibility is but too much protected , too fondly cultivated , in the shelter of home . To most women , therefore , even fame , except so far as it bears the character of sympathy and inoral approbation , is more an annoyance than a pleasure . Fame is hardly ever her object in taking up the pen ; and she is even surprised and wounded by criticism on mere literary defects , having expected from the world in general the indulgent sympathy which she has found among partial friends . She would fain be allowed to draw upon her imagination and her feelings without the chill fear of a sneer , and , addressing the heart , would be judged only by the heart . She writes her hook as she writes a letter , and expects a response in the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without some acquaintance with the humor of that cool and impartial personage , she may be grieved by an admonition to study logic , to cut off the nib of her pen and buy some blacker ink , if she would have anybody read her communications who has any thing else to do . If she does not hear some gruff remark upon misdirected talents , and the concocting of puddings being the appropriate sphere of feminine intellect , it will be because the time is gone by for that . The writings of the Sedgwicks , Bremers , Edgeworths , Howitts , &amp;c. - each having a much more practical and useful aim than the Bulwers , Jameses , and Coopers , - and even the cookerybooks // of Mrs. Child and Miss Leslie , triumphantly proclaim the possible union of the imaginative powers with the best household qualities and accomplishments . We trust the appetite for bookmaking notoriety is not so alarmingly on the increase among our fair friends , as from the mere number of names we might forebode . In many of these female authors we recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a petty love of display . We need not as yet surely deprecate this appetite as a new and higher form of the childish ( shall we be pardoned if we say , feminine ) desire for personal admiration . As we read , we feel that the desire of success , in many cases , must be the pure prayer for power to do good ; if it looks to earthly approbation , it is for encouragement , and a deeper conviction of truth than can be felt without sympathy . We can allow women to covet praise while they shrink from admiration . Some of these writers seem to seek a security from the penalties of notoriety in the lowliness of their pretensions . The " Trap to catch a Sunbeam , " ( would that it had a title which did not suggest ' a trap to catch the attention , ' ) has found readers and admirers enough to make Miss Planch6 a conspicuous person in the ranks of authorship , if she did not seem modestly to deprecate notice by the unpretending form and style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , the intrinsic weight of a book can not be determined by its specific gravity , unless by the rule of the contrary . Nobody reads heavy books now . An old-fashioned tome on the origin of evil and its remedy , however sagacious and practical , would be attacked by no reader but one who might have written it ; while this playful little fable , which solves the question quite satisfactorily for all practical purposes in a few pages , and stamps the lesson on the heart by its quaint story , flies everywhere , and finds a reader in everybody who can read . It is a perfect gem in its conception and execution , notwithstanding a lawless mingling of the literal and the allegorical . There is as much genius in the portraiture of poor David , sketched thus unheedfully in miniature , as appears in the full length delineation of Edie Ochiltree , the auld Bluegown . Both move our sympathy powerfully ; we are aware , as if by experience or foreboding , what loneliness and poverty in age must be . But David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transient and fruitless emotion . He bears a message to which every heart throbs a response with a quickened faith and love ; and to those who feel that the world goes hard with them , he brings comfort and hope and animation , to help them on , and awaken a cheerful industry and self rehance . The other stories are written in the same spirit , and with a similar practical bearing , but with less point , less vivacity , less naturalness . A little story by Miss Catherine M. A. Couper offers itself in the same form , written in a simple and easy style , and in it , if we miss the sparkle and glow peculiar to Miss Planch6 , we find a kindred excellence of purpose , and a quiet good sense , not straining after effect , and therefore never missing its aim . It makes its lesson of unselfish economy impressive and acceptable , by an example in humble life , easy of imitation , and likely to be remembered . Her Lucy is of the same type with the Lucy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader 's warm interest merely by her simplicity and disinterestedness . No one can think a woman quits her heaven-appointed province of blessing the home , by publishing books of the class of which these are a specimen . She is but extending the influence she is accustomed to exercise in the narrow sphere of the family . We hid her God speed in all such undertakings ; at least , when she thus allows a correct taste to reign over a lively imagination , and good sense to bridle strong feeling , thus recommending her philanthropic and religious principles alike to the coolest judgment and the warmest heart . To clothe moral and religious truths in an appropriate garb of fiction is not so simple a task as might seem from reading these graceful little tales , and observing the great numbers of books of the kind with which the press teems at Christmas and New-Year . Let any one read a quantity of these in order to make a selection for his children 's library , or for that of a Sunday School , and if he be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw aside nine books out of ten , with something like David Coombe 's exclamation of rueful ridicule . We think there are few children who would not understand Charles Lamb , when he said that he " could not fully enjoy any thing whatever for // thinking of its moral uses , " or who do not sometimes return to Gammer Grettel and iViother Goose with a sense of refreshment . Mere moralizing is futile ; an impression on the feelings must attend a moral lesson , for the feet oftener obey the heart than the head . We all know better than we do , and need to be moved and persuaded . But in the course taken to make this desirable impression on the affections , or , in other words , to make goodness palatable , a surprisingly general error prevails , both in the domestic discipline of children , and in the hooks intended to aid it . It is in offering a reward for goodness , and not in it , - all the good little gentry having bonbons , and all the perverse getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice is not what he has to expect in life , ( except in a highly spiritual sense , which he may , or may not , he capable of comprehending , ) any shrewd little rebel sees at once , with a secret infidelity in the interference of a higher providence than that of his parents in his daily discipline and experience . A Sabbath-breaking stripling is not convinced that the water is peculiarly eager to engulf the boat that should dare to float across it on Sunday , because instances of such tragedies have often been narrated to intimidate him . He has outgrown a fear which was not reverence , a love that was hut selfishness , and it may be late ere he is convinced that there is really a recompense of reward and punishment , even in the present life . To shock a child 's mind by working upon fear , a mean and spirit-crushing emotion , if the attempt succeed at all , gives him the spirit of a bondslave , a melancholy submission , not a cheerful obedience and trust ; and whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he may adopt , such is the power of early impressions , he will not be able to shake off the feeling of dread all his life . Other books there are , in which the author seems to have faith in good prose as a medicine for all moral ills , and to be trying the experiment how large a dose of didactic wisdom can be forced down the throat of a child without his making wry faces , by means of a dialogue form , and a little sprinkling of incident . But let one of these writers , sensible but not wise , watch any bright child reading his book ; we would say his own child , only that the children of such persons would // be taught the moral obligation of reading from cover to cover , and then have a burdened conscience because they skipped the advertisements . No squirrel can be more expert in extracting the kernel from his nut , than one of these little-great readers in picking his grains of amusement from their dry husks . Thus he learns a hop-skip-and-jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of attention , and , if he is not put on his guard , becomes a habit of mind . Any important thoubht , or matter of fact , any thing even of the narrative kind , that will not titillate his jaded curiosity , he regards as no affair of his . His mind will not take hold of any thing that does not hold up a brightly colored picture to his imagination , long after he has reached an age when he might throw the picture alphabet of truth aside , and grapple with books that require him to think . Novels and newspapers are his chosen literature ; and it is well for him if the drill of school or business give a portion of compulsory exercise to his enervated mental muscles . We have erred , probably , in ascribing the very common frivolity of taste in young people wholly to the endeavor to make them , in early childhood , attend to what is unsuitable to the age , thereby inspiring an incurable disgust to serious and solid occupation of the mind . Other influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarge upon . But the appetite for narrative has a solid foundation in the social nature , and must endure . Works of imagination will ever find hearts eager to be made to throb with sympathy for the joys and woes , the physical and moral struggles , of humanity . That it becomes a sickly craving , from much cramming with crude , unnatural food , is not the fault of such writers as Miss Sedgwick , and Miss Planch6 , Miss Couper , Miss Sewell , Grace Aguilar , and the like ; - the list might be a long one , did we not confine it to the books which happen to be lying within reach of our hand . The popularity of a pure and practically useful style of fiction , recommending itself to the moral sense as well as the sympathetic passions of the story-loving public , shows that the standard to which all beneath must strive to conform , is continually rising , It is encouraging to reflect that the obscene wit and vulgar scenes of the old romances and dramas would not now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales now so cheaply offered to the public , and so eagerly devoured . In many of the very humblest of these a good aim is apparent , and even the affectation of a moral purpose shows that the public taste demands it . There are those who maintain that the moral taste of the community is becoming corrupt , that the tree is already blighted at the top , worm-eaten at the root , and rotten at the heart ; and the ravens have even been heard dismally to croak that if we see not to it in this our day , the world will behold another great moral and religious , if not political crash , like the reign of terror in France . Let them sound an alarm , if they will , and let every Christian man rouse himself to look more heedfully that he lend not his countenance to aught which does not approve itself to his own best ideas of the useful and the pure . But we have little fear that a community which is advancing so rapidly in its temporal prosperity , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to ruin . We have faith in a moral Providence . David Coombe taught us that prosperity and moral improvement go hand in hand , having first shown us the crushing , deadening effect of abject poverty . The heart of this people is sound , and though , in the unexampled prosperity and activity of the times , it may dwell too much on the things of the external life , it dimly se*ks the true and beautiful through them , hoping much more than it attains ; for the onward march of the grand principles of religion and morality is siow and almost imperceptible . The individual example , even in fiction , does not fail to be recognized with enthusiasm . There is a hermit self in each individual of the great mass of humanity , that can only know its brother immortal through the outer life ; nor can it manifest to him its own kindred nature , but by coming out of its cell , where it is alone with its one friend , and bearing a part in the drama of social existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginary characters and situations are interesting to him ; and he is strongly moved by the common fears inseparable from a state of bodily and moral weakness , tile common hopes which the very emptiness of the world suggest , the desire to alleviate misery and uphold justice , to return or reward kindness , and all the other emotions and impulses , which , like wheels within wheels , actuate the moving figures offered to // his imagination . To play upon these mysterious springs to no other purpose than that with which a showman pulls the wires of a puppet-show , is a use of genius which can bring no joy to the possessor . Is not the melancholy proverbially attendant on genius the consequence of such an unsatisfactory aim , of an attempt to dazzle the intellect by a splendid phantasmagoria which must pass out of sight and leave nothing after it but darkness and emptiness ? How can admiration be otherwise than evanescent , since wonder is destroyed by familiarity ? To see his magic creations pass into the shadow of neglect and apparent forgetfulness before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a conscious right to fame ; but might he not have made a deeper impression , and have produced an effect which should but widen , and brighten , and grow , to cause his name to be loved as that of a benefactor to the world ? How might his heart glow and swell with the conscious power to call up elevating emotions in the universal heart of man , to send pure streams to thirsty lips , and to freshen and quicken the languishing impulses of the truest humanity ? The humblest talent which aims at usefulness , and even partially succeeds in its object , deserves more of the world 's favor than the inspiration which may well be called that of the Satanic school , dwelling only in the sensuous and external , and perverting love and truth and beauty in the soul . It requires more than the intention , even in a writer endued with genius , to embody truth in a form which shall exercise the imagination , touch the heart , and be wholly acceptable to the judgment . But how should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy drama , which we have never known to exist in the exemplification of moral and religious ideas in real life ? There must be every variety and degree of failure , according to the imperfect conceptions of the writer , who yet can not do justice to his own ideal . When we find a book that has done us good , and may bring aid to thousands unable or not inclined to criticize it , it is not our office to point out its errors in taste , or its short-comings in vigor and point . A critic 's office is a thankless one indeed , if it is merely faultfinding ; and surely nothing is so easy . Perhaps no man ever lived so unexceptionable through his whole career , that his neighbors , one and all , did not say , that // they could have often done better in his peculiar circumstances . Had each man felt at liberty to give him a pull , according to his own idea of the proper direction of his steps , he must have come to a stand-still altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light that is in him , so an author must write from the fulness of his own heart , and according to his mental and moral idiosyncrasy . We sometimes flatter ourselves we have done something to correct a vitiated taste , - at least to keep it from being , diffused ,  --  when we find an improved tone in certain writers , whose eyes have been opened by severe castigation to faults in their habits of thought and feeling , as seen in their works . However , we often detect , or imagine we detect , a want of keeping , an air of effort and grimace , which makes us conclude he is aiming to conform to a standard he does not heartily adopt or understand , and is continually in fear that his brain-coined sentiments will ring false upon the ear . The tendency towards a higher morality in works of fiction has had to contend with the old prejudice against a class of books which , for want of a better name , have been denominated religious novels . If they had a less doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the unreality of the personages seems strangely to cleave to their pious pretensions and professions . We seem to see a TartuiTh at every point , smilin0 at his own claims , admiring his own eloquence , taking the name of God in vain by often mingling prayers and solemn ejaculations with namby-pamby sentiment and lovesick nonsense . If we do not fall into such an extreme of suspicion , we at least rebelliously determine not to be instructed by these gentry who are making a parade of their devotion , of set purpose for us to admire , and who prate coolly of feelings which , with us , are held too sacred for any human confidence . Moreover , we are sure to find sectarian dogmas introduced , and made the grand object , - that for which all the machinery of the story is put in motion , which is like beginning to build a house at the cupola ; there is need enough of laying the broad foundation which is the basis of all creeds . Here there is room for all to work side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian , ( as who will not say who reads the stories of Grace Aguilar ? ) and well would it be for the world if men of all faiths would labor together for an // object common to them all , the moral , - the word is not coinprehensive enough , - the practically religious , improvement of society . The name of Grace Aguilar brings us back to the subject of female authorship . Formerly , if a woman published her writings , and thereby attained any enviable celebrity , she became almost as much unsexed as if she had shouldered the gun and knapsack , like Dehorah Sampson , and more recent armipotent heroines . She was even in danger of sacrificing forever her domestic felicity , at least so far as it depended upon the masterful sex , with whom it was a maxim that a clever woman inspired admiration at the expense of love , and that fame should be reflected upon her , or its scorching rays would wither those elements of happiness that were accustomed to shade and retirement . Marmontel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genius of many a tender Cottin . What woman , truly a woman , could write under the chilling dread that a father , consort , or brother , who had never gained distinction for himself , might feel that he was sunk deeper in obscurity because his name was made famous where he was not known to bear it ? Will not any affectionate and beloved woman shrink from being dubbed authoress , if it should be supposed likely to change her relation to her female associates , and make them look upon her with suspicion and envy , as taking notes of all their peculiarities and shades of character ? We translate a few paragraphs of Marmontel 's tale , without the hope of preserving the fine edge of the style in our blunt English phrases . " Natalie looked forward with the most eager impatience to the coming of Germeuil . She thought the glory she had won would augment his love for her ; she deceived herself . Ger . meuil was flattered by the brilliant success of one to whom he was the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ; but she became a different person to him , and of course lost much of her attractiveness . She was no longer for Germeuil the Natalie whose sallies , as innocent as piquante , had amused him , and whose gayety and naturalness he loved so much . She was not changed , but he saw her with different eyes . lie imagined in her secret thoughts a proud consciousness which could never exist there ; to him , therefore , even her // sweetness and simplicity savored of condescension . He felt that she had deserted him in elevating herself ; he remained at his customary level , while by a sudden and rapid flight she rose above hers . His imagination was disenchanted , since no one figures the Graces seated at a writing-desk , meditating and rubbing their eyes in the watches of the night . Beauty should be crowned with roses ; laurels make her look old . " Yes , " said Germeuil to Natalie ; " I am gratified by your success . Do you not , however , feel any remorse after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had greater reason to take pride in , when they were devoted to him solely ? How ! Must I brook that everybody shall know you as well as I , your dearest friend ? is not this a species of infidelity of which your lover has some right to complain ? What ! those sentiments of yours , so tender , so delicate , whose expression in your letters have given me so much happiness ,  --  do I find them repeated in your book ? These phrases , so touching because inspired by love , belong of right to me ! Could you revoke them , to publish them to the vulgar world , - to employ them in fictions " Natalie saw only a playful raillery in these reproaches , and did not disturb herself about them . She enjoyed the 6clat of her new position without anxiety . There are two or three months of enchantment for a young author , whose d*ut has been a brilliant one . The pleasure of seeing his work in print , and the favorable notices of it in the journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign tongue ; the reception of congratulatory letters , or flattering verses ; the compliments of all the people of his acquaintance , or those whom he meets , - each of these things has its value . In this intoxicating excitement , the purest feelings of the heart , as well as mere self-love , have a share . The happy enthusiast dreams that he has acquired a new right to be beloved ; he thinks to do honor to friendship and to justify love 's preference . If he have given his work a touching moral , he is confident of the esteem of all women of sensibility and worth , and he hopes for the goodwill , perhaps even the gratitude , of all those readers whose suffrage is desirable . Such are the charms and illusions of a budding fame . Let no one envy the author who is in the full enjoyment of them , if it be a Woman ; since she pays dearly for them in the end . " Natalie soon began to discover that a reputation as an author has its inconveniences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could encounter her without feeling called upon to make some allusion to her literary enterprises . On many faces there was an expression that seemed to her to give the lie to // their civilities ; she felt as if there was a less hearty goodwill felt for her than formerly , and that she carried with her a species of constraint into society where she had always been cordially welcomed as simply a charming person . Men of literary pretensions were continually aiming to engage her in a sort of conversation for which she had not the least relish , - learned discussions or sentimental disquisitions . Consciously ignorant people stood in awe of her , while each self-sufficient ignoramus was a thousand times more insupportably foolish and presumptuous towards her than towards people in general , because she inspired him with the desire to shine . " But what gave her greater vexation than any of these things , was the singular change in the manner and conduct of Germenil which now forced itself upon her attention . Up to this epoch , she had had a supreme ascendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now , far from paying deference to her opinions , he affected an obstinate opposition to every thing she said . He had had no reluctance to concede any point to a talent which he looked upon as , in a manner , his own by right of discovery ; he would not yield an inch of ground to the same talent in the shape of a reputation conferred by other people ; because he feared both to minister to vanity , and to play a subaltern part in the view of the world . The same man who had made it his glory to be led in chains by the graces of her mind , would have blushed to be subjugated by its superiority . By disputing its empire , Germeuil sought to reestablish that equality which no longer existed between them . He found a satisfaction in saying nawelcome things , and being disagreeable in various ways ; sometimes it was under the veil of pleasantry , now and then under pretence of sincere interest , but often with an ill-humor which he was unable to disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not looked upon with much favor by women , since the publication of her book . " It is not an action which can have done any injury to the sex , however , ' said Natalie . " On the contrary , it reflects an honor upon it , ' replied Gerrneuil . But there is no esprit de corps among women , nor should there be any . Fitted by their sensibility to have an existence less selfish and more dependent than ours , fame is for them less a personal possession than a relative good , at least with very rare exceptions . They take pride in the actions of a father , a son , or a husband ; it is for them to borrow , not lend , honors ; and so far law and nature are in harmony . Is it not just , that fame should belong properly only to him who can alone transmit his name , and its fame , as an inheritance ? ' " // Female authorship being quite too common in these latter days to strike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man must fill an exceedingly small space in his own opinion , who could not afford not to be jealous of the amount of approbation that follows the most successful effort of his wife 's pen , so long as her dabbling in ink does not involve his domestic comfort . Neither need he trouble himself about her temerity . Minerva 's helmet and sword are a joke , and her shield is only useful to lean upon . Her fair face softens all manly hearts . He who should put her arms to the proof : , even in a just cause , would cut but a sorry figure . Whoever it may be that she may have broken her reed lance upon , he can but shrug his shoulders , and leave her in possession of the field . It is the custom to praise lady authors , even those who suffer much under parlor criticism from their own sex . It must be a very uncommon merit or demerit , which receives any thing like discriminating retribution in the court of letters , if a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meed than the " Very well - exceedingly well , indeed , " bestowed by a smiling school-committee man upon a smart school-girl 's theme , after a whispered agreement , that with some pruning and a little more thought , it would be really a surprising achievement for a girl . The blushing smile of girlhood is a very pretty and pleasant thing to look upon ; and , under the circumstances , to throw a damper upon harmless vanity , by pointing out an exuberance to be restrained , or a more vigorous tone of thought to be wrought for , is hardly worth the while . And thus the enterprises of full-fledged ambition among the scribbling fair , are dealt with by goodnatured critics . If they have the good fortune to be brought under notice at all , they are the theme of neatly turned compliments and ingenious congratulations . But evils are likely to grow out of such a half contemptuous leniency ; and it may not be so easy to repair as it might have been to prevent them . A wholesome dread of satire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in the feminine character ; for why should a scolding pen find more toleration than a scolding tongue ? Indeed , if every vixenish impulse is to be allowed to seize upon the press , by way of speaking-trumpet , and when we stop our ears , hold // down our heads , and run , we must find home taunts upon our most defenceless follies and sins , mocking us in derisive echoes , before us and behind us and on every side ; if we are to be overtaken , and branded , and cruelly mauled , without judge or jury , or a chance for defence or deprecation ; if we must stand and take this clapper-clawing from fair , but not gentle , hands , under the eyes of the amused public , who , if they interfere at all , pelt either party at random , or both , to make justice sure and prevent brawls in the open thoroughfare in future , - is it not high time there was a police to come to the rescue ? Shall we be pilloried without authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual will , that there may be unbounded liberty in the republic of letters ? A despotism were better , unless public opinion be strong enough to keep the peace . Should we call on the Muses , tragic or comic , the only result would be the laughing and clapping of a vulgar audience , in some theatre where the roguish Thalia had made our misfortunes and blunders and oddities her theme . Having so many agreeable books upon our shelves , for which we have to thank and to love gentle authors , we have , perhaps , cherished too comfortable a confidence that the prevalence of good taste would bar the entrance of the Amazonian mania into literature , at least in any offensive form . With about as much of faith and of dread as was excited in our courageous hearts by the cry of epidemic hydrophobia , which , some time since , caused such a massacre of four-footed innocents , did we hear the rumors of a rage for public speech and action , and for turning the world inside out and upside down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted withal . We believed the hue and cry had arisen through a groundless panic . If there be such a mania , and it come hither also , we can only say , that for our own household we should much prefer the advent of the cholera . We should shudder if we observed any alarming symptoms in our immediate vicinity , or the presence of any exching cause . As we look abroad , we see only a chivalrous disposition , not merely to respect the rights , but to uphold the privileges , of the fair sex , which makes it , in our view , altogether unnecessary that they should advocate their own claims or be each other 's champions . For an instance of female privilege , and the indulgent // dealing of public opinion and authority where the interests of the weaker sex are in question , it is enough to observe the operation of the law regarding breach of promise of marriage . Attentions sufficiently marked to excite general notice compromise the gentleman , and it will go hard with him if the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , a lady may make flirtation her pastime , and to be tacitly despised by each modest woman and sensible man is her only penance . She may break hearts by the dozen , as any pretty woman can do , if she will descend to play upon the vanity of each admirer till she can turn his head and engage his affection . She may parade her conquests , apocryphal or otherwise , and boast the number of her offers of marriage , and yet reign in every gay circle with such meed of distinction as sbe covets . Let any disappointed and piqued suitor endeavor to deprive her of this glory , such as it is , by grave accusations of falsehood , the world only laughs at him . It makes him ridiculous to have been in earnest , where he should have known it was but a gai e of make-believe ; and to have been a dupe , when the hope of fixing a coquette would have appeared to him egregious folly in any other man . But let a gentleman undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avow it ; as a man of honor , he is obliged to disown any intention to trifle , and to conceal his coxcombical triumph when he perceives his success . Let him once boast , and he loses the title of 0entleman , which is inconsistent with false pretences of any sort . There is then no manly name he can answer to ; he must borrow a denomination from the other sex , with a humble adjective to distinguish him from the feminine gender . lie is the male flirt , the male coquette ; or he may descend yet lower , and take the generic appellation of pupjpy , possibly accompanied by the appropriate visitation of a caning , administered by some roistering champion of the aggrieved fair one . Of the two parties concerned in a flirtation , the world judges thus unequally , taking the part of the lady in every case , on the supposition that , as it is the gentleman 's part to offer attentions , and hers merely to receive or discourage them , she can not play the coquette till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirtation must in consequence begin on his side . // Whether this judgment be equitable , in so general an application , we judge not . We only ask what any stickler for woman 's rights could possibly suggest more available for her benefit and protection . On one side , she is shielded by the law regarding the breach of marriage promise as a perjury punishable by a heavy fine , under the form of damages . On the other hand , who does not know that there is a watchful public eager to spread a report of engagement on the slightest exhibition of a special interest in any female candidate for matrimony , on the part of a gentleman of suitable age and standing ? This surveillance may be provoking in many instances , and meets with no gratitude from either of the blushing subjects of it . But it effectually calls the trifler to account ; it holds up the rod of contempt before the eyes of the hypocrite who may be inclined to divert himself by drawing a lady into a tacit avowal of preference for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her part , which delicacy forbids , will induce him to explain his intentions , and put the event at her option instead of his own . When distinguishing attentions are long paid and received under the thousand eyes of this busy-tongued guardian , an engagement is always presurned ; if the gentleman denies that it has ever been a fact , or looked forward to on his part , he denies it at the expense of his character as an honorable and respectable man . If we add to this gratuitous guardianship the interference of a lady 's male friends , or other natural protectors , whenever she may permit it , to prevent a long continuance of unmeaning public attentions , what more can she need ? Simply that she may not be a traitor to herself , in the unwillingness of a romantic fancy , perchance of a confiding heart , to resign its illusions , and cast down its idol from an undeserved exaltation . Of wilful blindness she must be content to endure the consequence . The imprudence and want of feminine pride shown in sufferin* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period , is nearly an offset for the coxcomubry and fatuity of the other party to the affair . When at last compelled to perceive and acknowledge herself a dupe , she can not expect commiseration without a mixture of ridicule from any but the few who , from their own consciousness , are able to conceive that it is the noblest mind that is the slowest to be convinced of treachery . // A book entitled " Truth Stranger than Fiction , " which lies at our elhoxv among other books written by ladies , has in some measure influenced the direction of our remarks upon female privilege and authorship . But for the request of the writer , we should not feel called upon , as it is hardly a matter of literary concern , to allude to the volume more distinctly . We premise , before giving our view of its contents , that we read it without prejudice ; we know nothing whatever of the subject matter , nor of any one of the parties mentioned , from any source but the book itself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , we very probably should never have heard of the affair , as we do not incline our dignified ears to any sort of scandal or gossipry . The introductory chapter is apologetic . That the call for " unusual measures " appeared sufficiently imperative and imposin0 to the author 's own mind , one can not at all doubt . Nor have we any hesitation in giving the most unlimited credence to her professions of regard for " truth , honor , and justice , " in the abstract , and in her own intention . Neither are we in the least disposed to derogate from her pretensions to a lofty regard for " the rights of character , " " the influence and authority of the Protestant clergy , " and the " interests and prosperity of " the university which she pronounces " the most venerable and important institution of education in the country . " While we render all imaginable respect to broad principles of this kind , we must , at the risk of being classed with " unreflecting minds , " consider them somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as motives to specific acts. ** To our humble discernment , there is a strong tendency in " enlarged minds , accustomed to regard " only " comprehensive results , " to overlook and override all minor considerations and interests with cool unconcern or disdain . The remonstrances and active opposition of practical people to such a bee-line career , act upon them as an exhilarating stimulus . Having made selection of a creditable principle for a starting-point , and a sufficiently indefinite , or " comprehensive " result as a goal , they shut their eyes , as having no longer any use for them , and dash forward . Such a mode of proceeding , were it to become general , as these people of principle would have it , would make of society a mere hurly // burly . If it be each man 's prerogative to carry out his own fanciful or conscientious notions at any risk , law and order must go to the wall , of course ; a Mormon , or the leader of a mob , has as good a ri*hr to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any one else . On the ground of these formidable self-imposed " principles " of law , we must not be surprised to see an enthusiast take the affairs of other people out of their own hands , and manage them with a high hand according to his own ideas , against their imploring remonstrances . This is liberty with a witness . The second chapter gives us the portraits of the " parties concerned , " or victimized . Preserve us from the friend , no less than the enemy , who should thus present our mental , moral , and physical lineaments to the public eye , without asking , as is usual in paying that compliment to illustrious personages , whether we would consent to it ! Chapter third has for its subject the affair of the note of invitation , an exceedingly small piece of private puppyism , which the young gentleman , when he indulged himself in it , probably little anticipated seeing set forth in a book for the diversion of the public , and gravely established by testimony under oath . lie can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misrepresented wholly , which must have required a considerable stretch of imagination on the part of the author , - a quality in which we presume her to be remarkably deficient , from her inability to understand Miss D. 's true interest , and her objections to being " analyzed alive " for the instruction of the public , and the triumph of principles . The acquaintance and the " mysterious friendship " follow , and then comes what the book appropriately terms the d6nouement . This ten weeks siege is a most unaccountable phenomenon ; the hook places Mr. A. in the absurd attitude of annulling by a fiat denial every motive for such a public and long-continued assiduity which could be at all creditable to him , and leaves him to justify himself by declarin0 aloud his marvellous success in fixing the lady 's affections . Our favorite theory of the matter , which the " d*nouement " overturned , was founded on the many instances we have observed and heard og in which a green youth , unused to the most intelligent female society , is attracted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancies himself , in his exceeding surprise and admiration , to have found his belle ideal realized , and his destiny fixed beyond return . This exaltation de t*te , as a Frenchman would term it , subsides of itself , if the ridicule of the world or the lady 's disdain do not bring it to an untimely end ; and then we find a clear perception in the sentimental hero 's mind , that , while he used the language of romantic attachment , his heart had no concern in the matter , and had not yet in reality spoken , as the phrase goes . But we are to suppose , in this case , that iVir . A. knew very well what he was about , though the world and Miss D. did not , as it seems , understand the case . No wonder this affair puzzled to the last degree the wise and reverend heads , who , in the train of circumstances , found themselves called upon to investigate it . We feel some disposition to mirth at the idea of an ecclesiastical court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears to all the scandalous gossip connected with it . We are rebuked , however , by the serious tone of the book , and feel it to be indecorous , if not unfeeling , to smile as we write . We are not surprised that this novel subject of exegesis proved very perplexing . The manner in which the investigation was conducted seems to have been very confused and informal , if the account may be relied on as correct . A mutual charge of defamation , two plaintiffs and two defendants , rules of law now adhered to in order to gag a witness , now set aside to let in gossip as evidence , - if these things were so , surely neither party could be satisfied ; proceedings so odd and inconclusive could benefit neither . The association seems to have been of the same opinion with the public , that it was hardly a case for their jurisdiction ; * and that a clerical tribunal always fails to settle a case of slander to anybody 's satisfaction , past experience fully shows . The theological referees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least endeavored to do so . We think it would have been better for the subject of nearly three hundred pages of indignant defence , if the writer had left the matter where the association dropped it . If the lady thus dragged before * " Resolved , 1st , That action in this case by this body is deemed uneeces. sary ; by which we do not intend to imply that what the aforesaid licentiate has reported of the relative of the complainant is true . " // the public against her will appears a dignified and gentle character , it is rather in spite of her ferociously friendly defender , than through her . Every person of much delicacy of feeling is aware , that the female character is of so fine a texture that it is injured by any rough measures taken to remove an aspersion thrown upon it . If let alone , it will of itself cast off any thing that is foreign to it . Too much handling , even by friends , is to be deprecated for any reputation , as every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is enough to disgust one with social life , to reflect how much bitter vexation human beings unnecessarily occasion each other ; and it is hard to avoid a cynical spirit , as we contemplate the picture presented in this book , of a misunderstanding between two individuals , gradually widened by malicious or officious tongues , till it becomes a topic of discussion , " not only in New England and the Eastern cities , " but " in Kentucky , Ohio , Indiana , Missouri , Illinois , Wisconsin , and Iowa . " We are impatient of the weakness and folly of human nature ) and , especially , our own share of it ; even family harmony , the purest form of social life , is not without some interruptions from causes beyond control or anticipation . If we are not inclined to quarrel , there are some who will quarrel in our behalf and make us suffer remorse for being simply the occasion of strife . There is no escape for any mortal , from the causes , trifling it may be , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wound his spirit . If he have a generous heart , he makes all the petty chagrins , as well as the deep sorrows , of others his own , and his peace is disturbed by them ; if he is selfish , he is his own sufficient tormentor , and the more sacrifices he exacts , the less he enjoys the social condition on the whole . After the frolic season of youth , society becomes a serious discipline , be the position in life what it may ; and we sometimes xvonder that hermitages are so much out of vogue . There is ever some solicitude or regret " bearing upon the wheels of enjoyment , " in the gayest hours ; after some experience of life , all scenes have a tinge of melancholy in the retrospect , just as the most inspiriting music has a plaintive echo . There is nothing that so soon refreshes a world-harassed soul , and dissipates the misanthropical cloud that darkens // even the heavens above , as a lonely walk in the woods or fields . The spirit of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel the benevolence of the Creator in the exquisite delight which his inanimate works are adapted to j*our into all our bodily senses , and yet believe that his moral garden is left to itself , and his noblest work suffered to fall into deterioration and ruin . Jn our infirmity and discouragernent only do we feel the true spirit of children ; reading a father 's love in his rich gifts to us , we feel content with our imperfect and dependent condition , since it is one of eternal progress . The joy with which we study the beauty of nature is unalloyed and pure from any regret ; and we can not 1 ut feel it glow into gratitude and faith , when we reflect what 1ife would have been were we blind , deag senseless , or if the world offered no beauty of form , coloring , or motion , esi e cially adapted to our bodily senses and our mental perceptions . We have seldom met with a more charming book in its way than " Rural Hours , " by a lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the style , which only a private journal could possess ; and we are grateful for the privilege she has granted us , on another account , - that she not only revives our rural enjoyments and happy recollections of hours which leave no remorse behind them , but opens our eyes to much that escapes any less intelligent and minute observation than her own . To the ca*ual attention of many people in this hurrying and busy community , the changes made by the seasons have all the effect of surprises . It is a service that those who live only partially in the country , and see the face of nature by snatches , will greatly value , - this holding up a mirror , and daguerreotyping for our deliberate examination , its daily aspect in spring and autumn - " One hears a great deal about the sudden outburst of spring in America ; but in this part of the country the earlier stages of the season are assuredly very slow , and for many xveeks its pro . gress is gradual . It is only later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the floxvers ready to open , that we see the sudden gush of life and jcyousress , which is indeed , at that moment , almost magical in its beautiful effects . But this later period is a brief one ; we have scarcely time to enjoy the sudden affluence of spring , crc she leaves us to make way for summer ; and people // exclaim at the shortness of the season in America . Meanwhile , spring is with us in larch , when we are yet sitting by the firesidc , and few heed her steps ; now she betrays hcr presence in the sky , now in the waters , with the returning birds , upon some single tree , in a solitary plant , - nd each milder touch gives pleasLre to those who are content to await the natural order of things " pp. 2 , 23 . That part of the work which is devoted to this bleak and changeable season , in our climate the least agreeable portion of the year , is peculiarly rich in descriptions of birds and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and select the following sketch of a bird which we do not reckon among our feathered acquaintance , as a specimen of the author 's manner : Saturday , 5th. - Delightful day . A white-breasted nuthatch among the trees on the lawn ; these active , amusing birds are resident in the State ; but one can not vouch for their remaining all winter among our hills , as we have never yet observed them in cold weather . It is not a very common bird here , but may possibly he found in the woods by those who look for it through the year . We were mused by watching our little visitor this morning ; he never touched the spray , always alighting on the trunk , or on a principal limb , running nimbly up some distance , and then Piyin* off to another in ceaseless movement , without a momont 's intermission . This bird has other peculiar habits . He sleeps with his head downwards , and he is said to have one quality rare among his race ; he is a curious little rogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you are watching his ; then , he is a remarkably good husband , taking a vast deal of pains to feed and amuse his wife , and listening to all her remarks arid observations in the most meritorious manner . For several days we have observed this nut-hatch running over the same trees , probably in search of some particular insect or eggs , just now in season for them . " pp. 33 , 34 . There is an anmsin* chapter , or rather note , on weeds , which are thus distinguished from wild flowers : - " Upon the whole , it is not so much a natural defect that makes the weed , as a certain impertinent , intrusive character in these plants , - a want of modesty , a habit of shoving themselves forward upon ground where they are not needed , rooting themselves in soil intended for better things , for plants more useful , more fragrant , or more beautiful . " It seems , that all the more // common and inconvenient of these intruders have really no business here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every quarter of the globe . Even the dandelion , so impudently at home in all grounds , and hespangling the meadows on a sunny spring morning , as if all the starry constellations had fallen upon the grass in the night , is not one of the vegetable aborigines . The forest , which , like its early denizens the deer and the red man , vanishes as civilization advances , is the most interesting and important of the great variety of themes touched upon in the author 's note-hook during the summer . It makes one sad , if not angry , to think of the cold-blooded destruction of gigantic pines and elms by ephemeral and short-sighted man , to give himself treble the space he can improve or enjoy . Veneration has no part in the hardy constitution of a new settler ; he leaves it behind him , with other inconvenient , polite refinements , when he shoulders his axe and enters the wilderness . No wonder his imaginative red brother , with the deer and the wood-flowers , retire before him , and the stumpy soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ htshade , whiteweed , pigweed , stickseed , and tares . There is one excuse , however , for these Vandal tree-exterminators , - that it has been found that single trees , or groups left by the woodman , seldom survive bereavement of their fellows and protectors . Moreover , the fire , the swiftest engine in clearing land , makes no exception or distinction in its havoc . We have great sympathy with the author 's derisive indignation at the pedantic and uncouth names inflicted by scientific discoverers upon our unambitious native flowers , and her preference for the country appellatives , even where they have nothing of the poetical or picturesque . But for her minute delineations , however , we should sometimes fail to recognize our favorites , under the titles they rejoice in upon her flowerembroidered pages . Insects occasionally come into notice , for a page or two ; though our author , like most ladies of taste , has less fancy for the insect and reptile tribes than for any other subject of curious examination . To the spider , however , the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shuddering attention for a while , and gives us her deliberate opinion of his character in the following terms 15* // " No doubt these insects must have their merits and their uses , since none of God 's creatures are made in vain : all living things are endowed with instincts more or less admirable ; but the spider 's plotting , creeping ways , and a sort of wicked expression about him , lead one to dislike him as a near neighbor . In a battle between a spider and a fly , one always sides with the fly , and yet of the two , the last is certainly the most troublesome insect to man . But the fly is frank and free in all his doings ; he seeks his food openly , and he pursues his pastimes openly ; suspicions of others or covert designs against them are quite unknown to him , and there is something almost confiding in the way in which he sails around you , when a single stroke of your hand might destroy him . The spider , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time very designing and very suspicious , both cowardly and fierce ; he always moves stealthily , as though among enemies , retreating before the least appearance of danger , solitary and morose , holding no communion with his fellows . His whole appearance corresponds with this character , and it is not surprising , therefore , that while the fly is more mischievous to us than the spider , we yet look upon the first with more favor than the last ; for it is a natural impulse of the human heart to prefer that which is open and confiding to that which is wily and suspicious , even in the brute creation . The cunning and designing man himself will , at times , find a feeling of respect and regard for the guileless and generous stealing over him , his heart , as it were , giving the lie to his life . " Some two or three centuries since , when people came to this continent from the Old World in search of gold , oddly enough , it was considered a good sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to say why they cherished this fancy ; but according to that old worthy , Hakluyt , when Martin Frobisher and his party landed on Cumberland Island , in quest of gold , their expectations were much increased by finding there numbers of spiders , which , as many affirm , are signs of great store of gold . ' " She does not disdain to watch and relate a fierce skirmish between a black wasp and a spider , the battle ground being a web among the tendrils of a Virginia creeper . She seems to have been a very impartial spectator , but our own sympathies are decidedly on the side of the spider , who was carried off into captivity for defending his own threshold . " Sitting in the shade this afternoon , we watched a fierce skirmish between a black wasp and a large spider , who had spun its web among the tendrils of a Virginia creeper . The wasp // chanced to alight on the outskirts of the spider 's domain , where his legs became partially entangled ; he had scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash at him . The antagonists were placed face to face ; whether the wasp wounded his enemy one could not say , but after the first touch , the spider instantly retreated several inches , still keeping , however , a bold , undisguised position , her great fixed eyes staring fiercely at the intruder . The wasp was getting more and more entangled in the web ; he grew angry , moved his wings and legs rapidly , but to no purpose . Seeing his situation as clearly as the spectator , or probably more so , the spider made another attack , and the adversaries closed in a fierce struggle . The wasp seemed anxious to bring his sting to bear upon the enemy ; the spider equally determined to wound her long-legged foe on the head , probably by a bite with her poisonous fangs ; now the wasp seemed the sufferer ; now again the spider relaxed her hold a little . A fresh assault of the spider was followed by a violent struggle of the wasp , when , suddenly , whether by good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke , the wasp 's wings were free ; he rose from the leaf : , and he carried the spider with him , whether as a captive or a pertinacious enemy , one could not determine ; they were soon out of sight . Perhaps the wasp found , before he alighted , that he had caught a Tartar . ' About five minutes after the disappearance of the combatants , a wasp alighted on the very same spot where the joust had taken place , and he had a sort of agitated , eager flutter about him . It was either the same individual who had been engaged in the fray , or else a stranger , who , by scent or otherwise , discovered traces of the contest . If it was the hero of the fight , possession of the field of battle and the enemy 's country , established his claim as victor ; but if only an ally , the fortune of the day still remains in the dark , and , like many other great battles , may be claimed by both parties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiders , and then enclose them in the cell with their young , who feed upon them . But in the battle this afternoon the spider was clearly the aggressor . These battles between the two races are frequent ; but the bees and spiders seem to keep the peace . " Though we have far exceeded our limits , we can hardly forbear to make one more quotation , the " autumnal changes " being the glory of the book as well as of our year . " In those parts of this continent which answer to the medium climates of Europe , and where Autumn has a decided character // of her own , the season is indeed a noble one . Rich in bounty , ripening the blended fruits of two hemispheres , beauty is also her inalienable dower . Clear skies and cheerful breezes are more frequent throughout her course than storms or clouds . Fogs are rare indeed . Mild , balmy airs seem to delight in attending her steps , while the soft haze of the Indian summer is gathered like a choice veil about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every feature . The grain harvest has been given to Summer ; of all its treasures , she preserves alone the fragrant buckwheat and the golden maize . The nobler fruits are all hers - the finer peaches and plums , the choicest apples , pears , and grapes . The homely , but precious root-harvest belongs to her - winter stores for man and his herds . And now , when the year is drawing to a close , when the blessings of the earth have been gathered and stored , when every tree and plant has borne its fruits , when every field has yielded its produce , why should the sun shine brightly now ? What has he more to ripen for us at this late day ? " At this very period , when the annual labors of the husbandman are drawing to a close , when the first light frosts ripen the wild grapes in the woods , and open the husks of the hickory-nuts , bringing the latest fruits of the year to maturity , these are the days when , here and there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are touched with the gayest colors ; those are the heralds which announce the approach of a brilliant pageant - the moment chosen by Autumn to keep the great harvest-home of America is at hand . In a few days comes another and a sharper frost , and the whole face of the country is changed ; we enjoy , with wonder and delight , a natural spectacle , great and beautiful , beyond the reach of any human means . " We are naturally accustomed to associate the idea of verdure with foliage - leaves should surely he green ! But now we gaze in wonder as we behold colors so brilliant and so varied hung upon every tree . Tints that you have admired among the darker tulips and roses , the richer lilies and dahlias of the flower-garden - colors that have pleased your eye among the fine silks and wools of a lady 's delicate embroidery - dyes that the shopman shows off with complacency among his Cashmeres and velvets - hues reserved by the artist for his proudest works - these we now see fluttering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambers , chestnuts , and maples ! " We behold the green woods becoming one mass of rich and varied coloring . It would seem as though Autumn , in honor of this high holiday , had collected together all the past glories of the year , adding them to her own ; she borrows the gay colors that have been lying during the summer months among the flowers , in // the fruits , upon the plumage of the bird , on the wings of the butterfly , and working them together in broad and glowing masses , she throws them over the forest to grace her triumph . Like some great festival of an Italian city , where the people bring rich tapestries and hang them in their streets ; where they unlock chests of heir-looms , and bring to light brilliant draperies , which they suspend from their windows and balconies , to gleam in the sunshine . " The hanging woods of a mountainous country are especially beautiful at this season ; the trees throwing out their branches , one above another , in bright variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a fancy of his own to humor . The oak loves a deep , rich red , or a warm scarlet , though some of his family are partial to yellow . The chestnuts are all of one shadeless mass of gold-color , from the highest to the lowest branch . The bass-wood , or linden , is orange . The aspen , with its silvery stem and branches , flutters in a lighter shade , like the wrought gold of the jeweller . The sumach , with its long , pinnated leaf , is of a brilliant scarlet . The pepperidge is almost purple , and some of the ashes approach the same shade during certain seasons . Other ashes , with the birches and beach , hickory and elms , have their own tints of yellow . That beautiful and common vine , the Virginia creeper , is a vivid cherry-color . The sweet-gum is vermilion . The Viburnum tribe and dogwoods are dyed in lake . As for the maples , they always rank first among the show ; there is no other tree which contributes singly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unites more of brilliancy , with more of variety , than any of its companions ; with ns it is also more common than any other tree . Here you have a soft maple , vivid scarlet from the highest to the lowest leaf ; there is another , a sugar maple , a pure sheet of gold ; this is dark crimson like the oak , that is vermilion ; another is parti-colored , pink and yellow , green and red ; yonder is one of a deep purplish hue ; this is still green , that is mottled in patches , another is shaded ; still another blends all these colors on its own branches , in capricious confusion , the different limbs , the separate twigs , the single leaves , varying from each other in distinct colors , and shaded tints . And in every direction a repetition of this mnagnificent picture meets the eye : in the woods that skirt the dimpled meadows , in the thickets and copses of the fields , in the bushes which fringe the brook , in the trees which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawns and gardens - brilliant and vivid in the nearest groves , gradually lessening in tone upon the farther woods and successive knolls , until , in the distant background , the hills are colored by a mingled confusion of tints , which defy the eye to seize them .
