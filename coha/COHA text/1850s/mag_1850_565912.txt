txt ART . IX. - THE QUESTION ! ARE YOU READY FOR THE QUESTION ? Speech of the HON. HENRY CLAY , of Kentucky , on taking up his compromise resolutions on the subject of slavery . Delivered in Senate , Feb. 5th and 6th , 1850 . New York : Stringer &amp; Townsend . 1850 . Speeches of HON. JOHN C. CALHOUN and HON. DANIEL WEBSTER , Ofl the subject of slavery . Delivered in the Senate of the United States , March , 1850 . New York : Stringer &amp; Townsend . Speeches of HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD and HON. LEWIS CAss , on the subject of slavery . Delivered , &amp;c . New York : Stringer &amp; Townsend . WE have read these speeches with deep interest ; and now , with an occasional reference to them and perhaps to some others , we propose to make a shorter one ourselves . Until recently , the question which agitated the minds of the people of this country respecting slavery , was simply whether this system , on the soil it already occupies , should or should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its advocates was , to preserve and uphold it where it already exists ; while the mass of the people in the free States were generally convinced that it ought , in the moral aspect of the question , to be abolished even on the soil it now holds as its own . It is indeed universally admitted among us that slavery in the states can , legally , be abolished only by the states themselves ; and yet there are , in the North and in the West , but few we suppose , who do not rank themselves against slavery , and but few who would not rejoice to see it abolished in the District of Columbia by the action of the federal government . // As we just now said , the position which men have held in respect to slavery , has been simply a position on the one side or the other of this question of " abolition . " The question whether it should or should not be abolished , is not the main question now . A question , at this moment infinitely more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be decided . We fear indeed that the question may be put and carried , against God , and humanity too , before even these pages may be read , and indeed before we have laid down our pen . What is the question ? The question is whether this government , besides consenting not to hasten the death of slavery where it has its being , shall extend and perpetuate it , in order to maintain an equilibrium , an everlasting equilibrium of power between slave representation and free , on the floor of Con*ress ; whether , for every newly admitted state in which men are permitted to have a system of government based on the principles of our declaration of Independence , another state must be given up to slavery . That is the question . It is not , we think , so much a question in issue between political parties in the free states , as it is a question between a few hundred thousand slaveholders on the one hand , and the great body of freemen in the Northern and Western states , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a naked question between liberty and slavery , light and darkness , and as we hope to make it appear , between right and wrong . Shall slavery then be extended over any territory now free ? Shall we enlarge its scope ? Shall we give this vast pyramid of oppression a broader base to rest upon ? Shall we infuse new life into a system which we had begun to hope , might at some distant day dissolve and disappear before " the law and the prophets ? " Nay , that is not the question-.whether we are willing to do this  --  but it is , must we do it ? What is the language we hear in the citadel of the Union ? They tell us this government shall use its authority to extend* slavery and thus maintain if possible an equilibrium here between liberty and slavery , or ( have mercy on us ! ) the Union shall be dissolved ! Surely , if there was ever need of special prayer to the God of heaven , we need it now . And what shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the calamity which these men threaten ? - that he will , by all means , preserve the Union , whatever sacrifice of principle on our part may be needed to preserve it ? Shall we with an ungodly and unmanly timidity pray that the Union may be preserved by sacrificing " the law amid the prophets ? " We will offer no such prayer . We see no terror in such menaces , and if we did , we would pray first for the preservation of the law and the prophets , and secondly for the Union . We will pray that the representatives of our own and of every other free state may , in // this time of their peculiar temptation , have manliness enough , conscience enough , to resist a demand so monstrous and stand true  --  to the North ? No ! to humanity and to God . If thus the Union may be preserved , may God preserve it ! for we dread its dismemberment . But will these advocates of slavery dissolve this government unless it consent to cherish slavery as sacredly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuate the bondage of the future generations of three millions of people ? Will they tear down this structure unless we will consent that it shall be forever a heterogeneous and effervescing mass of liberty and oppression ? Let them be assured that God himself , if we undertake to build up and hold up such a structure as they demand , will ere long take this Union into his own hands and dissolve it in fiery indignation without any special aid from them or us . But Jet us come back to the question . Why can we not for the sake of peace and the Union yield to this new demand of slavery ? In answering this question we shall speak neither for nor against any political party in the free states , but for men in every state and of every complexion . Why can we not consent to do this thing ? Giants in intellect , men whose names have been known and honored here and throughout the world and who have spent their lives for the most part gloriously in our national councils , tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunction against " slaveholding " in the teachings by the Gospel of Christ or by any of his apostles . " And others are not wanting who affirm even that the Bible sanctions and sanctifies the system . If this system be not against the Gospel , if the Gospel , the law and the prophets are not against it , why then , for the sake of peace we may perhaps consent to extend and perpetuate it . But have ye never read , Senators , that great and comprehensive declaration made by Jesus Christ , in which he condensed into one simple and brief injunction , the very sum and substance of the whole of God 's revealed will in respect to the duties of the second table of the law ? Hear it ! Would to heaven it might be taken up by the millions of freemen in this broad land , and by three millions of bondmen , and uttered in a voice that might shake the foundations of the capitol , and reverberate in the dome of the senate chamber like the roaring of many waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO YOU , DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM . FOR THIS IS THE LAW ! " This is God 's law , revised , condensed and republished by his own Son . This is the constitution of the united states and tribes of mankind ! But how does it appear that this is an injunction against slavery , and what application has this principle to the great question before us . Let us see . It is demanded that this government // shall use its authority and influence to extend the territory of slavery and thus extend slave representation on the floor of Congress , so that an " equilibrium " may thus be maintained if possible to the end of time , between the slave interest and the interest of the free . The object is confessedly to put new life and power into this waning , dying system of oppression . What now is this slavery which we are called upon , not in the most courteous terms , to increase and perpetuate ? Let us meastire it by that great precept of Jesus Christ which he affirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without spending a moment in describing the multiplied enormities which slavery always carries with it , without describing any of those atrocities which must needs be occurring every day , here and there , on the soil of slavery , and which are almost enough to provoke an armed interference on the part of all the friends of humanity in creation , let us simply , in the coolest manner possible , try slavery in its naked abstract form , by the precept of Jesus Christ . To do this we need only to make a simple supposition . Let us suppose that those who hold slaves now , were themselves slaves , and that all the white men in the Union , with their sons and daughters , were in a state of bondage , and that the African race , or any other , held the supremacy over us . Suppose that our children at their birth became the absolute property of our masters . And suppose that our masters should come into the capitol and coolly propose , nay , demand , that the government shall give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased , and that our children and our children 's children to untold generations might be cut off from all hope of freedom  --  and this , to maintain an " equilibrium " between liberty and slavery in Congress . What should we , in slavery ourselves , think of the men who should make such a demand , or who should vote in compliance with it ? Should we coolly suppose that the law and the prophets contained nothing contrary to such a measure ? Should we be apt to suppose that Jesus Christ and his apostles were tacitly on the side of our masters in such a course ? " All things , then , whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them . " And what would you that these men should do to you , if they were masters and you their slaves ? Would you have them extend and perpetuate slavery for you and your children ? Or would you resist a demand so atrocious while breath should last ? Then do ye , Senators and Representatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grossest violations of the law and the prophets ; one of the most monstrous iniquities that can be framed by law . But hold ! we are mistaken ; the argument is unsound , for Christ only says , " whatsoever ye would that MEN should do to you , do ye even so to them : " and slaves are not recognized as // men , by the laws of the slave states . They are a distinct race , created to be slaves , intended by their Creator as beasts of burdefi , mere property . They are not men and not to be treated as men . Indeed ! But there happens to be in the law and the prophets a plain , unequivocal declaration of their manhood and of their right to a rank among men . Have ye never read that " God made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth ? " And are not the African race one of these " all nations ? " God made them men , God calls them men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and he claims for them the treatment due to men ; and in the day of judgment these men and their wrongs will not be overlooked , and somebody , yes , somebody must answer for their wicked oppression . If they are degraded men , their degradation is not of God , but of their brother-man . We know indeed , that in the laws of the slave states these Africans are regarded simply as chattels and not as men , but in the law which is higher than those laws , they are declared to be men . But at all events , say some , they are recognized as property and not as men in the constitution of the United States . Far from it . Unjustly as they are treated in this instrument , they are divested by it , as has been well said in your hearing , Senators , of only two-fifths of their manhood . This constitution recognizes full " three-fifths " of every slave as standing in the rank of manhood , and these three-fifths of him are represented in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , ) not as so much property , but as so much of humanity . In the only other instance in which they are alluded to , they are spoken of not as cattle or as chattels , but as " persons , ** " persons held to service , " and it is a matter of history that the framers of that instrument did positively refuse to employ any term which might seem to recognize on the part of the national government , any right of property in man . The broad precept of our Savior is as fully applicable to our treatment of the African race , as it is to our relations with men of our own color . And now if this be not God 's injunction against slavery , it is nevertheless God 's injunction , and it is against slavery , and every other wrong . It will finally overthrow it . But how long , 0 God , how long before that time shall come ? If the representatives of freedom in our national councils prove recreant now , how long must these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ! " Shall we then , can we agree to extend and perpetuate such a wrong as this , without renouncing our allegiance to the throne of God ? Shall we yield one jot or tittle in as plain and palpable a case of right and wrong as ever occurred . r can occur in humai* legislation ? // What are " the circumstances " in which this demand is made ? What pretext is presented ? Why , a new state has sprung into being on the Pacific , in which the people have ordained-heaven pardon the offense-that every man among them may remain a man . And they ask to be admitted to full communion with the states of this Union . These are the circumstances . Do they afford any pretext whatever for the demand that some new slave state or states shall come into the Senate to keep pace with liberty in her onward march ? Must we give our consent to a great wrong , a clear violation of natural justice- ( we will not use the more fashionable word , for it has too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians now ) - must we in the right use of lal ) guage , agree to " frame mischief by a law , " and so pay for the privilege of doing an act of simple justice to the people of California ? Must we consent to force the iron heel of oppression still more deeply into the neck of the enslaved race , because this new state has ordained to treat men of every color as men ? Oh , but can we not yield a little for this once for the sake of peace and the Union ? They do not demand our money ; it will not affect our property , it will do us no harm here in the free states to make a few more slave states in a far distant portion of the Republic ; it will not affect our peace and happiness ; we shall not hear the clanking of the new chains we impose and rivet ; our sensibilities will never be disturbed by the horrors of these new slave markets and prisons that we help to erect ; and then too the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the principal victims of this " extension , " and we shall all die and be out of the way before they appear , and it will come down upon them most mysteriously as a great " organic sin . And besides , if we will only consent to yield a little in this crisis , we shall double the value of " property " - personal property of course-in the Southern states , and slaveholders will be highly gratified and perhaps make some of us President of the United States . Certainly , gentlemen , this is a consideration to be thought of . Can we not then be so obliging for this once , especially as our refusal may tempt them to dissolve the Union and abolish the presidential office itself ? All that we are called upon on our part to sacrifice in this matter , as we have somewhere seen it asserted recently by somebody in Congress , is " only a sentiment , " only a sentiment that we are cherishing here about slavery . And what , pray , is a " sentiment ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , which we think will suit the present case , is , " a decision of the mind formed by deliberation or reasoning . " It is sometimes , as in the present case , a decision of the mind in relation to some great moral question , and a decision based on some great principle or precept in " the law and the prophets . " VOL . Viii . // All that we are required to do then , is simply to do violence to a deliberate decision of our minds , formed in the light of God 's revelation ! We are only called upon to perpetrate a new outrage upon the slaves and their posterity ! to perpetuate a system which , besides its intrinsic injustice , is ruinous to the real interests of the South itself , as many of the Southern people , if not a majority , know and feel . For our part we do verily fear the thing will somehow be brought about . But God forbid it ! Let it never become a part of the history of this Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to languish , and giving to the poor African some faint but cheering promise that it might , at some distant day , die and disappear , this government with its own hands tenderly nursed the gasping monster and would not even let it die ! Who has faith to ask that God would preserve and cherish a national government that could thus deliberately repeal and repudiate the law and the prophets ? On a certain occasion a man came to Jesus Christ in deep affliction , earnestly beseeching him to cast the devil out of his son . It was a very sad and alarming case . The possession was one that would not yield to the prayers and measures of the disciples . Jesus in the plenitude of his compassion and power instantly rebtiked the demon and he departed out of the child . And why , said the disciples , could not we cast him out ? Jesus in his reply gave them to understand that " this kind , " the kind of demon which had possessed that child , " went not out but by prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit which has taken possession of some of our national counsellors , and has caused them to give out some very strange utterances in these days , is exactly one of that genus or not-leaving it to the eye and ear-witnesses of these strange phenomena in Washington , to determine of what " kind " and of what degree of moral dignity the spirit is which possesses so many of the wise men there - we can not at all events but feel , in this latitude , that the case is indeed a sad one , and that it calls for much prayer if not for fasting , on the part of all the disciples of Christ in the Union . This lust of power , this thirst for political advancement , " the spirit " with which too many seem to be possessed , is one of " the kind " that can not reasonably be expected to depart out of them without the most earnest prayer on the part of all who know how to pray . But can we do nothing but pray ? Yes , verily ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can at least whisper a word of " courage " in the ear of our own immediate Representatives in Congress , and of all other Representatives of the free , by whom this great , this greatest question is soon to be determined . We can remind them at least that " the law and the prophets , " // 299 that God and all enlightened nations and even Mexico and Turkey , are on the one side , and on the other a dying , and we hope , doomed system of oppression , fearful as it still is in its power and influence over the destinies of the nation . God prosper the right and thus preserve the Union ; or , let him take it into his own hands and do with it what seemeth good in his sight . " If it be possible , let this cup , " this bitter cup , pass from us ! Nevertheless , if not-then " THY kingdom come and thy will be done . " The foregoing remarks relate only to the great question by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether slavery , shall be extended into our new territories either by the express legislation , or by the connivance or tacit consent of Congress . Our collaborator who has uttered his own feelings , and ours , on the preceding pages , has abstained from all critical examination of the speeches to which he has made reference . But since his remarks were written , a new edition of Mr. Webster 's speech has made its appearance , as revised , corrected and enlarged by the author , and dedicated by him to the people of Massachusetts. * A speech from that illustrious Senator on a great contested question of national policy  --  a speech reported under his own revision and with his finishing touches , arid solemnly dedicated " with the deepest sense of obligation " to the people of the state which has so long been proud of his renown-is such an event in our politics and in the history of our literature , as can not be unxvorthy of critical attention . We confess that we are the more moved to some strictures on Mr. Webster 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and its vicinity-some of them men of the highest standing-have been induced to subscribe , professing their unqualified approbation of what the great man has said , and lauding him as the savior of his country . Our first remark then is , that the speech , taken as a whole , is not , intellectually and rhetorically , such a speech as might have been expected of Mr. Webster at such a crisis . As an oration it seems to us quite inferior to that last Demosthenean effort of Mr. Calhoun , in which he gave his dying testimony in behalf of the great principles for which he had been so long and earnestly , and yet so preposterously contending . Still more is it unequal to some of the earlier speeches to which Mr. Webster owes so much of his celebrity as an orator . How far inferior is it , in the highest qualities of eloquence , to that memorable defense of New * Speech of Hon. DANIEL WEBSTER , on Mr. Clay 's Resolutions , &amp;c . Washington : Gideon &amp; Co. , 8vo , pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayne . And the reason is not that the powers of the orator are beginning to fail ; it is rather that his great powers had no free scope . If we mistake not , there is a lurking sense of embarrassment from beginfling to end  --  the conscious want of a heroic will  --  the painful feeling of having no great principle to stand for ; and it is this that makes him show more like Samson shorn than like him who bore away the gates of Gaza . The finest portion of the speech , and one well worthy of the author 's fame , is the part in which he speaks of the union , and shows , out of the fullness of a strong and glowing mind , the utter madness of those who threaten to dissolve the union . But in dealing with the speech we can not spend our time on matters of merely rhetorical criticism . We pass at once to graver work ; for the speech is to be considered not as the work of a literary artist merely , an exhibition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of a great statesman 's way of dealing with great questions of policy and duty . We come then to the examination of Mr. Webster 's position in regard to the question , the great question of the times , the question whether slavery shall be prohibited in the territories . On this question Mr. Webster 's position is not that of President Taylor*s , who proposes that the territories be left to the action of the existing Mexican laws , without any interference on the part of Congress , till the inhabitants of each territory shall do as the people of California have already done . It is not that of Mr. Clay , who proposes that Congress shall organize territorial governments in the usual form without the proviso of the ordinance of 1787 , but with a declaration that the Mexican law abolishing slavery is in force till repealed by some competent legislative authority . It is not that of the " free soil party " and of many others , who propose that territorial governments be established with a distinct and positive prohibition of slavery . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great slave-breeding and slavetrading interest demands . The illustrious Senator whom Massachusetts has so long delighted to honor , the great New Englander whose name and fame are spread through the civilized world , announces his definite determination to vote against the prohibition of slavery in any territory now ' under the jurisdiction of Congress . We do not think it important for us to inquire into the consistency of this with Mr. Webster 's past character and professions . Much less can we here concern ourselves with his motives in taking this position . Let others agitate if they will the question of his consistency . Let the people of Massachusetts judge whether he has violated the pledges which were implied in his character and history , and whether he has forsaken the principles which he was understood to profess when they last committed to // 301 him the trust of legislation for the Union . Of his motives let coming ages judge when his whole career-what is now fitture as well as what is passed-shall be reviewed at the tribunal of impartial history . Nay , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open , and who is no respecter of persons . Strong imputations of inconsistency and of dishonesty in such cases are efficient enough for the pi*rpose of annoyance and provocation , but ordinarily they contribute little to the advancement of truth and justice . We have to do only with Mr. Webster 's determination to vote against the prohibition of slavery in the territories . And what reason does he give for such a determination ? Does he hold , with the followers of Mr. Calhoun , that slavery , instead of being , wherever it exists , a merely local institution , created , defined , upheld , by the law or the prescription of the locality ,  --  is elevated by the Constitution of the United States into a national institution , and goes of course wherever the sovereignty of the union is extended ? Not at all . Does he hold with Mr. Cass that Congress has no constitutional right to legislate fo* the people of the territories ; no right to establish order and justice , and to protect the weak against the strong ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public lands , and to let the inhabitants of each territory set up their own laws and institutions as accident or their own discretion may determine , however barbarous , however inconsistent with liberty and the public welfare , however contrary to justice , those laws and institutions may happen to be ? Not at all . On the contrary he argues at great length , and most conclusively , that Congress has constitutional power to prohibit slavery in the territories . He shows that at the formation of the federal constitution there was no great diversity of opinion between the North and the South in regard to slavery ; that " both parts of the country held it equally an evil , a moral and political evil ; " that " the eminent men , the most eminent men , and nearly all the conspicuous politicians of the South held that slavery was an evil , a blight , a blast , a mildew , a scourge , and a curse . " He shows that in the Convention which framed the Constittition these were the predominant views and feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great men of the South " no less than with the great men of the North , not how to extend slavery , not how to guarantee its perpetuity , not how to nationalize it and to make it the cherished and darling institution of the national government , but " how to deal with it as an evil , " how to arrest its progress and to hasten its extinction . He shows that between the framers of the glorious ordinance of 1787 , in the Congress then sitting at New York , and the framers of the glorious Constitution , in the Convention then sitting at Philadelphia , there was a perfect mutual understanding ; and that the same views and feelings in regard // to slavery which in the one consecrated the whole national domain to freedom absolutely and forever , by a unanimous vote of all the ' states , and by a unanimous vote of every man from every southern state , dictated in the other all the provisions of the federal constitution . Thus he shows not only that the Constitution gives to Congress power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given with no jther expectation than that it would be exercised for the prohibition of slavery . We thank him for the lucid argument , and we pray it may sink deep into the hearts of those whose eyes this speech has opened so miraculously to his high merit and authority as an expounder of the Constitution . What then is Mr. Webster 's reason for his determination to vote against the prohibition of slavery ? Is it that slavery is in his eyes a desirable institution , such as a xvise lawgiver would incorporate with the very being of an infant commonwealth , to diffuse its influence through the whole structure of society from age to age , to determine with a potency superior to every other influence the laws , ideas , habits and manners of the people , the distribution of property , and the comparative dignity of labor and of idleness ? No ! He has no such thought . On the contrary there is one manly and glowing paragraph in which he utters himself , and speaks more like a statesman than like the counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replies to a Senator from Louisiana who had " taken pains to run a contrast between the slaves of the South and the laboring people of the North , giving the preference in all points of condition , and comfort , and happiness , to the slaves of the South . " The reply is worthy of the man . " Who are the laboring people of the North ? they are the North . They are the people who cultivate their own farms with their own hands ; freeholders , educated men , independent men . Let me say , sir , that five-sixths of the whole property of the North is in the hands of the laborers of the North ; they cultivate their farms , they educate their children , they provide the means of independence ; if they are not freeholders , they earn wages ; these wages accumulate , are turned into capital , into new freeholds , and small capitalists are created . That is the case , and such the course of things among the industrious and frugal . And what can these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member from Louisiana undertakes to prove that the absolute ignorance and the abject slavery of the South are more in conformity with the high purposes and destiny of immortal , rational , human beings , than the educated , the independent , free labor of the North ? " Words fitly spoken , " like apples of gold in pictures of silver ! " And yet this institution underlying the whole fabric of society-this worst form of socialism-. -. this " absolute ignorance and abject slavery " of the laboring people , is the institution which Mr. Webster is determined not to // prohibit in the territories , and for the licensing of which , over a domain that might be inhabited by millions of industrious freemen , he gives not only a silent vote , but all his personal influence and the sanction of his great name . Why , we ask again-why is this ? What is the reason of a determination so contrary to the line of an enlarged and enlightened statesmanship ? Does the orator hold that though slavery is disastrous to the commonwealth , hindering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a niildew , a scourge and a curse , " there is after all no intrinsic injustice in it ; and it may therefore be permitted by way of compromise , as a true patriot would consent to impoverish his country , and to bring a blight and a blast upon its productiveness , for the sake of some higher good ? No ! His opinion on the intrinsic justice or injustice of slavery as an institution is not indeed pronounced peremptorily as it might have been on such occasion ; but he does not attempt to disguise it nor could it be utterly suppressed . The Greeks , he says , with their " ingenious philosophy , " " found or sought to find a justification for slavery exactly upon the grounds which have been assumed for such a justification in this country ; that is , a natural and original difference among the races of mankind , and the inferiority of the black or colored race to the white . " And is there any force in the argument ? No , " they did not show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic , that if this were true , the more intelligent and the stronger had therefore a right to subjugate the weaker . " What better demonstration can there be than these well chosen words give , of the injustice and indefensibleness of slavery as an institution ? The more intelligent and the stronger assuming the right , not merely to protect and govern , but " to subjugate the weaker "  --  to lay a yoke upon them , to use them as cattle ! And where he represents the moral judgment of the North as to the intrinsic injustice of the institution , is there any reason to doubt that he utters the decision of his own moral sense ? The judgment of the North is " that slavery is a wrong ; that it is founded merely in the right of the strongest ; and that it is an oppression , like unjust wars , like all those conflicts by which a mighty nation subjects a weaker to its will ; and that slavery in its nature , whatever may be said of the modifications which have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the Gospel . " Nothing is plainer than that , in Mr. Webster 's personal judgment , slavery as an institution is simply and grossly a violation of natural right . And yet he declares his deliberate and determined purpose to vote against the prohibition of slavery in the territories . The question remains , then , Why ? Is there any explanation of the paradox ? Mr. Clay and Mr. Benton hold that the Mexican law abolishing slavery is still in force throughout the territories of // our conquest . This law , they say , till repealed by positive legislation , is a sufficient proviso ; inasmuch as every slave who treads that soil with his master 's consent . becomes immediately a freeman . Does Mr. Webster agree with them ? Is it on this ground that he is determined to vote against every additional security for liberty in those territories ? Is it thus that he justifies himself in opposing with his voice and vote every attempt to guard those territories with some stronger barrier against the invasion of a system which would make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrious , frugal , enlightened , but the breedingplaces of a barbarous population born only to toil in " absolute ignorance and abject slavery ? " Those veteran statesmen of the slaveholding southwest had exposed themselves to a storm of obloquy at home , by asserting in the capitol that the territories acquired from Mexico are already , by the force of their own municipal law , devoted to freedom . Boldly had they thrown themselves into the breach . Manfully had they made known their purpose not to vote for the establishment of slavery upon soil already free . Does the great statesman of the North come to their aid ? Not at all . In all this elaborate speech , there is not one word to confirm their position-not one word implying that in his opinion the Mexican laws against slavery are not abolished by the conquest-not one word to hinder him from appearing in the Supreme Court as counsel for the slaveholders , if ever the question shall come to that tribunal for a decision . His silence on this point has an ominous significance . The ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote for the prohibition of slavery in the territories , is not that Congress has not full jurisdiction in the case ; nor that slavery ought not to be prohibited for high reasons of patriotism and public policy ; nor that the institution of slavery is not intrinsically a violation of those natural rights , the protection of which is the only legitimate end of govern merit ; nor that the territories are already secured against the invasion of slavery by the municipal laws which they brought with them when they came under the sovereignty of the Union . What is it then ? Simply and exclusively this . Slavery is sufficiently excluded from those territories by " the law of nature , of physical geography , the law of the formation of the earth . " " California and New Mexico are Asiatic in their formation and scenery . " Asiatic , forsooth ; - if he wanted a highly suggestive word and redolent of freedom only , why did he not say African ? The structure of the country is such , arid the character of the soil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word , is just a " natural impossibility . " The prohibition of slavery in such a country " would be idle ; " and this great statesman , confiding in the relations of geography to slavery , " would not take pains to // re-affirm an ordinance of nature , nor to re-enact the *vil1 of God . " The prohibition of slavery in Oregon , for which Mr. Webster himself voted , was , in his opinion , " entirely useless " and " entirely senseless . " In like manner the prohibition of slavery in our newly conquered territories-conquered , as he himself shows , for the very end of extending and strengthening the institution of slavery-would be " for the mere purpose of a taunt or a reproach . " And therefore , because slavery in these territories is a natural impossibility , and because " gentlemen from the Southern states " have some " pride " that might be wounded by enacting that in those territories all men shall be equally under the protection of law and equally exempt from arbitrary power ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain a manner as possible , ' and declares with solemn iteration that he will not vote for the prohibition of slavery . We fully consent to the proposition that Congress , as representing the legislative sovereignty of the Union over the territories , ought not to prohibit slavery in any territory , " for the mere purpose of a taunt or a reproach , " or " for no purpose but to wound the pride " of the slaveholding states . But the question arises , instantaneously , whether any body in the Senate has proposed such a prohibition , or has argued for it , on the ground that it will answer such a purpose ; and whether it is becoming in such a man as Mr. Webster to insinuate , with whatever indirectness , that the millions of the American people who are demanding the prohibition , are demanding it for the sake of wounding the pride of the South . And the question also arises whether the opposition to this measure  --  the violent and desperate opposition which proceeds from the great slaveholding interest , is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a reproach ; and whether any senator or representative standing for that interest , has ever admitted for one moment that the legislative exclusion of slavery from these territories " must be entirely nugatory , " or that it is objectionable only on the ground of its implying that slavery is not a good thing . We confess that the conflict in which Mr. Webster is so ready to concede to the slaveholding interest all that it demands , has never seemed to us at all like a conflict on a mere point of honor . Nor can we get rid of the impression that the only potent reason for giving up that great measure of public policy and of justice , the prohibition of slavery in the territories , is one to which he has hardly alluded , and the potency of which over his own mind he would not willingly acknowledge even to himself . Mr. Webster is not so very unwilling to stigmatize slavery as a violation of justice and an undesirable and un*vholesome element in a commonwealth . He has done that quite distinctly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception which this speech has found , the praise which it // has won for him from so many who never admired him before is evidence enough that the slave-breeding and slave-trading interest , *o powerful over all our political and commercial affairs , can endure to have slavery stigmatized-for a consideration . The patrons and allies of that great interest are not moving heaven and earth for the sake of a mere sentiment ; and we can not persuade ourselves that Mr. Webster himself really regards the movement as so intended . No , the tone in which the prohibition of slavery is resisted by and in behalf of the parties interested in the extension of slavery , is not by any means the tone of men who are merely afraid that their self-respect , after having passed the ordeal unharmed so many times , will be damaged by one more reenactment of the ordinance of 1787 ; it is rather the tone of men who are contending with their utmost strength f2r what the Senator calls a " describable , estimable , weighable and tangible " interest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an effort that he himself has succeeded in ignoring the obvious fact , ) that this intense and desperate struggle against the prohibition of slavery is for the purpose of increasing the market value of slave property , and for the purpose of preventing that ruinous depression in the price of human flesh which must otherwise take place at no very distant period . There is an immense commercial interest at the bottom of this agitation for slavery-an interest which affects directly or indirectly the entire commerce of the Union . Hence comes the desperateness of the struggle against justice ; the Hotspur spirit is stimulated not merely by the sentiment of honor , but by the auri sacra fames . Hence come these projects , now for a Nashville Convention ; and now for an armed emigration of chivalrous adventurers , marching their slave coffles across the continent and forcing slavery into California . Hence come the threats of civil war and of the dissolution of the Union-threats uttered in Congress itself with great seriousness , and with great effect upon the nerves of ancient politicians . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or with any intentional apostasy from his principles . We disavow all partnership with the men who have denoui*ced him in Fanenil Hall-some of them men whose malediction will help him more than it will harm him in the state of Massachusetts . But we believe that under a bias not difficult to be explained , he has deceived himself in regard to the importance of the question , and has been led to take a position altogether discreditable to his character as a statesman . Forgetting that the deliberate and desperate earnestness with which the slaveholding interest demands the extension of slavery , is significant of the momentous results which that demand involves , he has permitted himself to be terrifled by it as if there were some imminent danger which must be averted at any sacrifice . He has been flattered with the sug // gestion that he is the man to mediate in this great conflict , and to save the Union and the country . And thus he has first convinced himself , and then has undertaken to convince the Senate arid the public , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . But has he riot made out his case ? Is there not , as he says , a " natural impossibility " which supersedes the necessity of any law against slavery in our new territories ? No ; he has proved nothing . His theory that there are certain countries where slavery should be prohibited by law , and certain other countries where slavery need not be prohibited by human legislation  --  the philosophy which teaches him that tinder certain conditions of physical geography it is quite a work o* ' supererogation to forbid the buying and selling of htirrian beings and the holding and using them as cattle-is the most transparent kind of sophistry . The same sort of " natural impossibility " on which Mr. Webster relies to exclude slavery from the newly conquered territories , exists in large portions of Virginia , of the Carolinas , and of Georgia . The state of Tennessee is half covered over with the same kind of " natural impossibility . " Less than a moiety of the soil of the slaveholding states admits of the profitable employment of slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the green slopes and the deep receding valleys of those Alpine ridges such a law as Mr. Webster will not give to our new territories ; proclaim that no tear of a bondrnan shall mingle with those bright streams , and that no shriek of a mother torn from her children shall wake those echoes ; " re-enact the will of God " there , excluding slavery as the climate and the soil have excluded the culture of cotton and the cane ;  --  and how soon would all those inland regions of the Sotith bloom with a beauty far beyond the beauty of our own New England ! Nay what is it that excludes slavery at this moment from Mr. Webster 's proud free state of Massachusetts ? It is law only-such law as the Senator will not give to these territories . Take away from Massachusetts the organic law in her declaration of rights , and in less than a twelvemonth , neither the mountains of Berkshire nor the sandy isle of Nantucket would remain unpolluted with slavery . Mr. Webster seems to think that slavery can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent employment . He ought to have remembered that in a new country , where labor ordinarily bears a high value in comparison with the means of subsistence , the great convenience of having slaves for domestic service may create a demand for them . He ought to have remembered too that where the clitnate and the soil forbid the culture of cotton and sugar , there may nevertheless be a valiiable growth of slaves to be employed on distant plantations under a more burning sky . Ships can not be built on the moun // tains of New Hampshire ; but the ship timber there has its value , every knee and spar , because it can be used in the shipyards of Massachusetts Bay . How notorious is it that the value of the slave crop , as it may be called , in Virginia and Maryland , fluictuates with the value of the cotton crop in Georgia and Alabama . How notorious is it that of every dollar paid by the consumer of American cotton and sugar , a certain portion goes to support the production of slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely as a certain other portion goes to support the conversion of slave labor into cotton in other regions where the raising of cotton is more lucrative than the raising of slaves . But the Honorable Senator places his argument on still higher ground , that of the alleged peculiarities in the physical geography of the territories in question . He entrenches himself impregnably , as he thinks , among the sky-piercing mountains , and in the wild gorges of New Mexico and Eastern California . He would have us believe that the whole realm about which we are contending , is simply worthless , incapable of sustaining any considerable population . How obvious the answer that he does not know whereof he affirms. this part of the speech reminds us of another speech made in the House of Representatives by a distinguished gentleman , since transferred to the Senate . In that very able speech , the materials of which were collected with great labor and put together with no slight skill , the whole territory from Texas to the Pacific was characterized precisely as Mr. Webster now characterizes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iwo years ago it was asserted in Congress with great confidence and on the highest authority , that what is now THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA could never be of any great *mportance ; that its population would not probably at any future time exceed two hundred thousand ; and that if acquired according to the treaty which was understood to have been concluded , but which had not then been ratified , it must be wholly secluded and cut off from all other parts of the tinited States , Oregon not excepted . Who can tell us that , five years hence , Mr. Webster 's opinion , now so confidently given , will not be equally ludicrous ? Indeed his opinion seems to us to be little else than a vague reminiscence of impressions derived from the now " obsolete idea " which was the policy of the *vhig party two years ago . But not to dwell upon the caution given by the experience of these last two years , let us look upon the map of New Mexico and Eastern California , imperfectly explored as that vast region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite certain that a country drained by such streams-rivers for length like the Rhine and the Danube , or like the Indus and the Ganges-is altogether worthless ? And besides , do not the same travelers on whose report is founded the belief that the country in question is not worth the // trouble which it will cost to give it free institutions , tell us also that all along their route , not only in the valley of the del Norte but in the valley of the Gila , there are the scattered traces of a once numerous population , and the mysterious monuments of a civilization that flourished and perhaps perished before the age of Columbus ? So the traveler in the valley of Upper Egypt , through the rocky passes of Edom , among the blasted hills of Palestine , over the broad parched plains of the Euphrates and the Tigris , finds himself standing amid the monuments of perished grandeur and upon the graves of buried empires , with miserable barbarism and desolation spread around him . If the high and awful trust of laying the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day committed to this great New England statesman-if to him it were entrusted to prescribe the organic laws under which a new race should begin to occupy with new sciences and arts , and with a new political order , that theater of the world 's earliest history-would he point to the Asphaltic lake of Sodom , to the peaks of Sinai and Horeb with the " waste and howling wilderness " around them , to the wild gorges of Idumea and of Lebanon , to the necessity of artificial irrigation on the banks of the Nile and the Euphrates , and tell us that in a country so barren and worthless there is no need of any law to protect the primary and universal rights of men , or to deliver the captive from the hand of power ? But look upon the map again . Involuntarily the eye runs along the line of the great water courses , and looks for openings in the ridges that divide the continent . Why ? Because the entire enterprise and energy of the American people is waiting , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing a railway that shall stretch from the bank of the Mississippi to the shore of the Pacific . That railway , when once it shall have been constructed , will not only be the principal line of communication between the Atlantic states and those of the Pacific , but one chief thoroughfare of the identical commerce between Western Europe and Eastern Asia , which has always been so potent in its influence on the destiny of the world . That railway will bear along its iron track , a commerce richer by far than that which freighted the navies and the caravans of Solomon ; richer than that which built up Tyre and Tadmor m the ages of old , and left the traces of its magnificence upon the precipitous cliffs of Petra ; richer than that which adorned with more than imperial splendor the Venice and Genoa of the middle ages ; nor less enriching than that which within the last century has poured into the lap of Britain " the wealth of Ormus and of md . " Who can forget that if such a railway is constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Webster pronounces too poor , too deficient in all capability of improvement , to deserve even so small a gift as that of a law to // protect it against the introduction of a barbarous , impoverishing , demoralizing , and intrinsically unrighteous structure of society ? Unhappily , there remains , at the moment at which we are writing , little reason to doubt that governments will be organized for the territories by act of Congress , without any provision against slavery . This being done , governors , judges , secretaries , marshals and other functionaries , must be appointed for the territories by the President and Senate . Of such territorial officers two out of three , according to all precedent , must be sent from the slaveholding states . Thus from Mr. Webster 's attempt to save the country , and to outdo the great compromiser , it will probably result that the first American slaves taken to New Mexico , will be taken thither by federal officers at the expense of the federal government . And this is called , " non-intervention , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery for themselves . The only non-intervention that is really such , is that which has been proposed by President Taylor . The question , however , will not be settled even then . Of course the organization of a territorial government will provide for a legislative body representing the people of the territory , but subject to the supreme legislative power of Congress . The people of New Mexico are said to be , at present , earnestly and with great unanimity opposed to the introduction of slavery . Suppose then that an act is passed by the territorial legislature , declaring that slavery does not exist upon the soil of New Mexico , and ordaining that every slave brought into that territory shall be free . Will not the agitation be instantly renewed on behalf of the great slave trading interest ? Will it not be demanded that Congress shall pronounce its veto upon such an act ? Or suppose on the other hand that the territorial legislation recognizes slaves as property , and invests the master with absolute power . Will not the agitation be renewed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now agitates the country is not so easily disposed of as some men think . The question whether New Mexico is to be a free state or a slave state , is not settled by the mere evasion which Mr. Webster proposes . Organize a government for it , according to the method of evasion , with no provision for or against the institution of slavery ; and the question whether slavery shall be lawful there , instead of being settled , is not even postponed . The slaveholding interest , in all its various ramifications and dependencies , is still struggling to open a new market there for slaves , and thus to obtain new securities for the indefinite extension and permanence of slavery ; and on the other hand , justice , humanity , and all enlightened and enlarged sentiments of patriotism , are still crying out against the consummation of the outrage . The adoption of the measure to which Mr. Webster has lent himself , will indeed be hailed as a victory on the one side ; and on the // other side it will produce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the end is not yet . The way to settle a question of right is not by compromise , nor by evasion , but by meeting the issue manfully and doing right . Mr. Webster 's new friends may crown him with new laurels , and kindle his waning ambition with new hopes ; but he may yet live long enough to repeat to himself with another application and a more bitter emphasis , those words which he once quoted so effectively , " Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown , And put a barren scepter in my gripe. - For Banquo 's issue have I filed my mind , - Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them . " Many other topics in this speech invite attention . But we can not pursue the discussion in its details . Only on three points will we express our mind in as few words as possible . As to the compact made with Texas at the time of her annexation to the Union , Mr. Webster is wholly right . True , the coinpact was not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole transaction of the annexation of Texas was unconstitutional and revolutionary , as was plainly enough demonstrated at the time . But it was a successful revolution , acquiesced in by the people . Factum valet . It stands on the same basis of legitimacy with the revolution of February in France . Texas is in the Union on the terms and conditions of that compact ; and there is no honest or straight forward way of getting rid of the compact but by turning Texas out of the Union . The only thing that surprises us is that any body should be surprised at Mr. Webster 's interpretation of the compact . Who did not know when Texas was admitted to the Union , that a whole litter of slave states was to proceed from her ? In regard to the rendition of fugitives from service , we are bound to believe that Mr. Webster has most inconceivably misrepresented himself . He pledges himself to support Mr. Mason 's bill " with all its provisions , to the fullest extent . " We do not believe he will redeem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he is-an admirer of the trial by jury and of the writ of habeas corpus-will support a bill which proposes to invest every village postmaster and every customhouse officer with the power of deciding judicially , and without a jury , not on such questions of book debt as might be submitted to a justice of the peace , but on the question of the liberty of a human being , found living on the soil of a free state . We do not believe that he will support a bill under which , if once enacted , he himself , traveling in any free state , might be seized as a runaway by a warrant from some villain of a postmaster ,  --  might be gagged , manacled , shipped for Texas , and no writ of habeas corpus should have power to deliver him .
