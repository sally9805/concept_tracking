txt NATIONAL CURRENCY . THE impossibility of effecting the minor exchanges of commerce by barter , creates a necessity for the establishment of a currency suited in kind and quantity to the activity of exchange . In France , where the population are roor , but , notwithstanding , possessed of small properties in land , the number of minute exchanges is proportionately large , each person having a little to buy and a little to sell . Those engaged in the larger exchanges are , on the contrary , a small fraction of the inhabitants ; and the quantity of small currency , or money , in France , is consequently larger than in any other part of Europe or America , in proportion to the number of inhabitants . In America , where the average intelligence and wealth of the people is very great , especially in New-England-where farms are measured by the hundred acres , and every village has its manufactory-the quantity of circulating medium is less in proportion than in any other part of the world . Itis necessary to attribute these differences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have done , but to a much simpler cause-namely , the mode in which property is created and distributed : a large , the demand for a circulating medium . A highly civilized , closely constituted , and well-ordered community , regulate their exchanges upon a system of credits , whose stability strengthens and is strengthened by the political and social structure . In newly established states , during the periods which immediately succeed revolutions , there is a tendency to extend the system Jf public and private credits to an embarrassing degree . The confidence of men is drawn toward a government which has established itself by force ; - that is to say , to a body of successful revolutionists , of whatever name , monarchic or republican . Each one of the new states of the northern and southern American continents has found it easy to effect loans in Europe , during the first few years after a successful revolution . A few only have been able to repay these loans in full . They are supposed to have forfeited the confidence of mankind . Should it come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back these governments intc* the monarchical form , they would be able a second time to effect other loans ; which would again , doubtless , like the former , remain unpaid . The mercantile world are affected , like the political world , by the appearance of strength and the enthusiasm of hope . The lenders and the borrowers are mutually deceived . So frequently has this cycle of credit and discredit been repeated and exhausted , not only with the minor states , but with great empires , like those of Austria , France , and Great Britain , we may at length affirm , that public loans repaid are an exception to a general law . They are a third method of taxation , by which it is contrived that the // evils of the present shall be thrust upon the future . Beyond a doubt , the solvency of the United States government is the most surprising fiscal phenomenon in history . The credit of the United States is perhaps the best the woild has ever known . It has a two-fold guaranty  --  the faith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people : the faith of the government resting upon an almost perfect con*titutional system , less variable and mutable than any other that has ever been established ; the spirit of the people , beyond all example , the most enterprising , active , and intelligent . The several States of this Union are prohibited by the Constitution from coining money , issuing bills of credit , or making any thing but gold and silver a tender in paymeat of debt : the power of the General Government over the currency of the nation is therefore absolute . Its credit being perfect , and its power constitutionally absolute over the currency of a nation of 2* , OOO , OOO , it would immediately appear as though the first attention of the cential government , and the highest exercise of its powers , would be given to a regulation of the currency ; such , however , is not the fact . The power of the central government has fallen back upon the States from whom it was taken by the Constitution , and they have divided it amongst them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency of the nation , more than might be done by any intelligent mintmaster , who , by contract , should engage to stamp and issue gold , silver and copper coin . The material of the currency is furnished by the State of California and by the merchants , the central government having no power over mines . Individual enterprise regulates the quantity of precious metals , as well as that of merchandise and manufacture . The currency of paper is furnished by individuals or companies , and , in general , guarantied , directly or indirectly , by the governments of States , who are themselves a species of incorporated companies . Thus it appears , that this primary and prescriptive right of imperial sovereignty is divided between citizens and the governments of States . The intention of the Constitution was , doubtless , to have established a mixed metallic and paper currency for the use of the people , upon the European system . The Constitution being ' ; itself a compromise between two parties , its provisions have not been carried into effect , and some completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was intended to place it out of the power of the States or of individuals to interfere , in any way , with the credit of commerce or of the people , or to invalidate or alter the terms of contracts , by tender , relief or bankrupt laws , direct or indirect . The media of credit were to have been placed under the guardianship of the national government . A bank treasury , whose issues should be founded on the revenue , convertible at pleasure into gold and silver , it was supposed , would furnish a perfect currency ; the government itself being pledged for the redemption of the notes . The first experiment was tried successfully with the Bank of North America , chartered in 1781 by the Continental Congress . This Bank afterwards accepted a charter from Pennsylvania , and lost its character as a national bank . This was also the memorable commencement of State banking . NewYork and Massachusetts , and after them all other States in the Union , assisted in the incorporation of banks . Many of these were established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper became a veritable circulating medium , relied upon by the people . Thus , says an excellent writer , " by the operation of causes more pow rful than legislative enactments , " a victory was finally obtained over the policy and spirit of the Constitution , and the promises of corporations took the place of a metallic medium . Debts began to be paid in the promises of these corporations ; receipts for these debts became good in law ; bank notes , excepting by the banks themselves , became a legal tender through the effect *f usage . In 1791 a bank was chartered by Congress , called the United States Bank . It exercised a powerful influence over the State banks , compelling them to make good their promises in great measure ; still , bankruptcies of State banks occasionally alarmed the community . The great discovery was now made , by banking speculators in the States , that a Bank of the United States necessarily exer* cised over their operations a power f inspection and supervision of which the effect was to make bankruptcy the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this just and natural consequence , fraudulent banking speculators began to form a powerful combination , which extended itself over the entire Union . They had discovered that the paper of a bank , condemned by the central banking power , was no longer respected by the people ; they consequently resolved to remove , or to destroy , the central banking power . Opinions of an abstract character began to be agitated , with which the more ignorant portion of the people were readily indoctrinated . In 1811 the charter of the United States Bank was withdrawn . Availing themselves , at this time , of the pecuniary distress of the Government , ( during the war of 1812-13 , ) the local banks , out of New-England , came to a determination t&amp;suspend specie payments , while they flooded the country with bank notes nominally good , but in reality at a discount of twenty per cent . If any person demandeQpayment in specie , it was represented that he was " draining the country of the precious metals , " when in fact he was endeavoring to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irredeemable bills , of no value in other countries , became the currency of all the States excepting those of New-England . In 1816 , after the war , it was found that the entire currency of the United States amounted to $110,000 ,  - -  000 , at a time when only $45,000,000 was needed , for all purposes of private and general trade . The consequence of such a state of things may be easily imagined . The real value of this paper was not one half of its professed value ; it occasioned a continual conflict between property and currency , producing utter confusion in all the business relations of life . The evil was increased by the different values of this currency in the different States . A debtor , paying a debt contracted previous to the depreciation , had twenty per cent . less to pay , but was not always the gainer thereby , as he had paid twenty per cent . more in goods for the money . Had the loss and gain been equally divided , by a general , and even , and acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our day , the evil would have been felt only in the foreign exchange ; but the actual effect was to break the force of enterprises and impair the credit of all incorporated companies . The evil consequently fell chiefly upon the wealthier classes of the community , and upon those who subsist by the more intelligent kinds of labor . Again , a dealer , moving from the Eastern to the Southern and Western States , could purchase twenty per cent . more with his specie or his Eastern money than he could at home . Thus the wealth of the East was augmented ; that of the West and South largely diminished . The manufacturers of the East were enabled to realize excessive profits . Nor was this all . It had been provided that all duties and excises should be uniform throughout the United States ; but while bank notes were taken by the revenue officers , the government received in some places one fifth , and in some one tenth , less than in others . This state of things demanded the immediate interference of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold* and silver coin was no longer a sufficient remedy , since these had ceased to be the currency of the people . It was deemed hazardous , however , to use a direct interference : it had been tried , whether " a discriminating power , " conferred upon the revenue officers , would correct the mischief ; allowing them to receive such notes as seeme4 to them good , and no others . The experiment failed : the brok*n banks were preferred by the revenue officers , as a matter of favor ; and the Government lost , almost immediately , about a million of dollars . The only mode remaining was to establish a Bank of the United States , with capital sufficient to control the local banks , compel them to reduce their issues by substituting good paper for bad , and thus , by a regular and legitimate competition , in the ordinary channels of business , bring the paper currency of the South and West to the par value of gold and silver . Accordingly , the Bank was chartered in 1816 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government subscribed one fifth . The notes of this I3auk were made receivable for any debt due to the United States . The effect of the establishment of this Bank was a reduction of the currency of the Union from $110,000,000 to 45,000,000 , equivalent to gold and silver . The local banks found their notes returned upon them , and were compelled to issue only a redeemable // currency . The effects upon the business of the country and its general credit may be surmised . A strong effort was made in a few of the Southern States , by pledging the public credit of the State , to force an unnatural quantity of paper into circulation ; from which ensued only bankruptcy and general distress . The business of the State of Kentucky , especially , was almost destroyed by these attempts at financial usurpation ; nor has that State since recovered from the effects of her own legislation . The entire country were now satisfied of the importance and benefit of a national bank , as a means of regulating the currency ; yet it may easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the general business of the community , and the check which it maintained over the financial legislation of the States , compelling them to keep within the precise limits of the Constitutionit may easily be imagined , that so great a power would raise an opposition against itself , that must eventually overthrow it . The fraudulent operators and banking speculators , whose plans had been defeated in all parts of the Union , by the vigilance and power of the central institution , were in the last degree impatient and hostile . The Bank was a principal organ of the central power ; its influence was more direct , and more severely felt by all classes in the community , and in all parts of the nation , than that of Congress itself . It was the regulator of the general business of* the nation . While it existed , State banks were institutions of no influence , and of moderate profit . The spirit especially of the Southern and Western sovereignties rebelled against a central financial power , which deprived them of all influ*nce over the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effectually than any other provision of the Constitution . For a time , however , the opjiosition did not make its appearance in full force . It was not until the year 1831 it assumed a powerful shape and made for itself a majority . It was admitted that a national bank ought to be established , and with a capital large enough to control the State banks and compel them to maintain a solvent condition . The eccentric doctrine of Jefferson , that banks were generally mischievous and oppressive in their very nature , had not yet been adopted and issued by Mr. Van Buren and his friends , as a portion of the Demoeratic creed ; it was still held to be necessary that the Bank ought to he maintained . Its enemies complained only of the provisions of its charter : they did not propose to abolish , but to modify . The National Bank , in which the Government of the United States was so large a stockholder , was nevertheless independent of the Government , and established a financial centre superior in influence and respectability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were naturally jealous of such an institution , which they found exercising a daily influence of far greater moment and importance to the community than their own , and over which they could not exert the smallest control . To regulate the currency , if not the first , is at - least the second duty of every government . In times of peace it is perhaps the first . General Jackson and his friends found themselves entirely deprived of this function ; the entire financial power being as it were farmed out to a company of skilful operators , who carried on the currency by charter and contract , independently of the Government and at a vast profit to themselves . Accordingly , in the first message of General Jackson to Congres , several years before the expiration of the charter , the President expressed hi* opinion against the constitutionality and expediency of the Bank , and asserted that it had failed in its great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency . Now , the uniformity and soundness of a currency is a relative idea : the Bank had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ; and that should have been sufficient to prevent the raising of such a groundless objection . The administration of the Bank had not indeed been without great faults . Its direction fell at first into the hands of a few speculators , who brought it to thee verge of bankruptcy , and made it incur the loss of a million of dollars . This circumstance alone was sufficient to prove the imperfection of the Bank , in feeble hands , as an institution for the maintenance of credit . It should not have been in the power of " a few speculators " to accomplish so great a mischief . The Bank had moreover shown a remarkable jealousy of the prosperity of Nexv-York ; a discreditable trait . It had indiscreetly enlarged its issues . Enough had been done to show the dangerous forn* of the institu // tion , and the impropriety of leaving so large a J ) ortion of the public power in the hands of a private corporation . In the year 1832 , a bill for re-chartering the Bank passed through both houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections . A great deal has been said about the " personal hostility " Vof President Jackson to the Bank of the United States . It seems to us , however , that he was actuated by a political , much more than a personal hostility , and that his opposition was not without good grounds . Let us examine a few of the political reasons brought against the rechartering of the Bank . It was an exclusive monopoly : it was the only institution which could carry on banking operations under the authority of the General Government . It was also a private corporation , managed hy individuals for their own benefit I It is contrary to the spirit of our institutions to establish a monopoly of any kind ; more especially a monopoly *vitls nowers superior to those of the national treasury . If national banking is to be allowed , it should be under the immediate control of the Executive and House of Representatives ; of those who appropriate and those who expend the revenues of the nation . The privile0es bestowed upon the Bank rendered the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this additional value was a gratuity to the stockholders , and of no advantage to the nation . The public moneys should not pay more than a legal interest ; the moneys of the bank were , in part , public money , and their profits were three-fold that of the funds . It was additionally urged , and we think with justice , " that the stock of this bank ought not to be held by foreigners . " In 1831 the stock held by foreigners was $8 ,  -- 000,000-nearly a fourth of the whole . It was calculated that the renewal of the charter would add several millions to the value of the stock . These millions were a simple gratuity , by act of Congress , to a few hundred American and foreign stockholders , who would realize enormous fortunes by its sale into still fewer hands ; and these latter would again , still more injuriously , consolidate the financial power . It was argued , that these immense profits should be reaped , not by a few wealthy individuals , hut by the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , offered by the Bank for its own continuance , was not perhaps a tenth part of what rhould have been offered . If the Government is to sell monopolies , it should receive their full price : if the finances of the United States are to be managed by a perpetual contract , the worst method ought at least to receive the highest price . All moneys are derived , first or last , from the labors of the industrious citizen ; directly or indirectly , it is needless to inquire . If foreigners or speculators reap a profit , it is derived from labor , the sole creator of values . The bill vetoed by General Jackson in 1832 proposed to sell an advantage , variously estimated at from ten to seventeen millions of dollars , for the sum of 3,000,000 , payable in fifteen annual instalments of 200,000 each . It was an unfortunate proposition for such an institution to make ; and would be unanimously rejected by the people of the United States , at any time , and under any circumstances , if they understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Jackson 's reasons for not sanctioning the bill , created an irresistible popular party against the renewal of the charter . It was further urged , and we think judiciously , that it would be better for the Government to create and sell the entire stock of the Bank at whatever price it would bring in the market , than to allow these enormous profits to fall into the hands of a few fortunate capitalists . The stock and the privileges should be sold to the highest bidder : it is the principle established , and should have been adhered to in this , as in all other cases . No reasons were offered against it . No wonder therefore the Executive objected to the bill . Other objections , of a character less easy to be understood , were r ised in the veto message of 32 , of which the most remarkable is the following : Arrangements were made , in the charter , by which the banks of the States had the advantage over private citizens . If a State bank , for example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could pay its debt in any species of notes of that bank , issued at the centre , or at the branches ; but if a private citizen owed the Government , or the Bank , he must pay in the notes of the centre , and not in those of a remote branch ; laying him under the // frequent injustice of a discount upon branch notes . Thus it appeared , that in order to conciliate the Banks of the several States and avert their opposition , the Bank of the centre had given them an advantage over the citizen ; departing from its original intention of providing an everywhere equal currency for the nation . This provision , however slight its actual effect might be , excited an excusable jealousy on the part of democratic politicians , as showing a disposition in the banking power  --  a disposition at least , if nothing more  --  to separate and consolidate its influence throughout the entire Union , above the reach and over the head of the citizen . It was unfortunate . Another apparently valid and serious objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in favor of non-resident stockholders . It was conceded that the stock of a branch Bank of the United States would be taxable in the State where it was established ; but not out of that State . Foreign stockholders were not taxable ; an arrangement by which an advantage of one per cent . was given to the foreign stockholder . The effect of this arrangement would be , to remove taxation alto*ether from these branch banks , in all parts of the Union . The citizen of New-York would not purchase stock in the branch bank of his own State , but in the branch bank of some other State , to escape taxation ; making a difference , in general , of one per cent . in favor of the foreign stockholder . Now it appeared , that of the twenty-eight millions of private stock in the original corporation , more than eight millions were held by foreigners , chiefly in Great Britain , none of which was taxable ! On the other hand , taking one of the States of the Union for an example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more than $95,000 ; but not a single share was held by the citizens of Mobile or Alabama . Mississippi and Missouri were in the same condition wit.h regard to their branches . The gist of this objection was , that by a tax on resident stockholders , the stock of the bank was driven out of the country , and preference given to foreigners . Again , the foreign stockholders were excluded by the charter fiorn all direct voice in the elections ; therefore , as the stock passed away from the hands of citizens , and it was left unrepresented , except by proxies , ' the control necessarily passed into fewer and fewer hands ; which produced a farther consolidation and centralization of power . The President very properly inquires , whether serious mischiefs might not be expected to arise from so great a coacentration whether the power of the Bank would not n aturally continue , from year to year , in the same hands ; and intimates that the interests of the directors would , in that case , become absolutely identified with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation would thereby he debased . Through such an institution , the commercial relations of Great Britain with the United States would soon be regulated to the disadvantage of the latter ; nor would any public functionary be able , of himself , to resist the long established influence of the Bank . The President of the Bank informed the Government that the existence of the State banks depended on the forbearance of the central institution : which will give some slight idea of the regulative power over the interests of the nation deposited in the hands of at most a dozen or twenty men , and these exerting , of necessity , a corrupting influence ; gaining every year additional power , experience , and wealth , managing foreign capital , principally English , without patriotic motive , and with a thousand influences to make them disregard the interest and honor of the Government , in its foreign relations . It is apparent by what causes and what considerations the popular instinct was excited a. *ainst the central banking power . Nothing could have been more natural than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern and Western sovereignties ; and it is idle to seek the causes of that opposition in the " private animosities " of President Jackson . Many of the arguments which they urged against the re-charter ot the Bank were not merely ingenious ; they were founded in fact , in history , and in a knowledge of human nature . rI*he popular outcry which followed , and which Vs continued to the present time , ought not to excite the surprise of any sensible politician . What would be the operations of a hank , regulating the business of the Union , owned l ) y Europeans , the subjects of monarchy , and managed by their adherents in connection with the fiscal of our own Government l Would such an institution facilitate the oper // ations of our Government in time of war with any monarchical power ? Would it not exert itself to the utmost in favor of its own stockholders ? Would it not influence all embassies and negotiations ? We believe that in good time a Bank of the United States will be established ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon a plan entirely different from that adoptedin 1811 and in 1832 . Suchaninstitution should be purely American in its character ; and we agree with the author of General Jackson 's message in thinking that its stockholders should consist of our own citizens , friendly to our own government and to republicanism . The Whigs of the present generation are opposed to free trade , because they find it injurious to the independence and nationality of the United States . For the same reason , it is probable , they will never permit the establishment of such a bank as that of 1832 . It is only within a few past years the utility of banking institutions has been called in question . The friends of Gen. Jackson , finding it impossible to resist public opinion in regard to the general necessity of a national bank , resorted to the usual means employed by desperate demagogues , and organized a general attack , not upon theform of the old bank , but upon banking itself . In 1791 , Congress had decided in favor of a hank ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and in 1816 in its favor . The precedents of general legislation , in every State of the Union except one , as well as in the District of Columbia , are a hundred to one in favo* of public banking . Such , however , is the ignorance of the people , and even of many public men , on the subject of banking , especially in the South and West , it was found difficult to organize a sensible opposition , grounded in solid reasons ; and as a substitute , the passions of the people were roused by demagogical appeals , discrediting for the time every institution of the kind . Against a national bank , however , there has always been a powerful opposition on the part of the inferior class of banking capitalits in the States . The policy of these men has been , and still is , to excite the anger of the people against a national bank , and afterwards to supply its place with institutions of their own contrivance , for which charters are procured in the States by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shape , is found to be as necessary as coinage ; but as the profits of coinage are not sufficient to tempt the cupidity of speculators , while those of banking are largest in times of popular excitement and commercial trouble , the jobbers of the State Legislatures have been satisfied to secure banking for themselves , leaving the coinage in the hands of the General Government . So great was the influence of bank power in the States , it procured the removal of the deposits of Government in 1833 , as is well known , and their division among the banks of the States , with consequences the most memorable and destructive . By the course of this argument , the reader is perhaps already satisfied that it was not the " personal hostility ' * of General Jackson which created the anti-bank party . The anti-bank party was created by more powerful motives than the hostility of any one man , or body of men , against the central institution . The removal of the deposits , and consequent destruction of the Bank , was a victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victory of the lobby members of State Legislatures , in the interest of private speculation , over the jobbers of Congress in the interest of foreign speculation . The corruption of the States was victorious over the indisci*etions of the centre . It was in vain the opinion of the Supreme Court was brought forward in defense of the Bank : the Court decided , that whatever institution was found " necessary " for the management of the public funds , was constitutional . The question remained , and could not be decided by the Supreme Court , whether a bank of the form proposed was or was not " necessary and beneficial . " A majority of the Senate had declared in its favor ; a majority in the House of Representatives were of the same opinion ; a majority of the nation , on th ( other hand , were undoubtedly against it , and finally sustained the action of the Executive . We have nothing to say in favor of that majority . It was created by the banking influence of the States , whose plans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of the central institution . Nor have we any apology to offer , on the other hand , for the imperfections of the central institution . The reasons brought forward in favor of its suppression as a contract , or private enterprise , seem to us suffi* // sufficiently conclusive . The original act of incorporation provided that no other great bank should be established while this one remained . It was therefore an exclusive monopoly , and in many respects hostile to the genius of the Constitution . Congress may establish banking institutions , but it has no right to grant monopolies to individuals , except for purposes of national defense . It may grant a monopoly of a fishery to citizens of the United States , against citizens of other states ; but it can not grant a monopoly of fishery or banking , or any other modes of profit , to the exclusion of citizens of the United States , in favor of other citizens , or of a corporate body . Few monopolies have ever been granted by any government , more exclusive and effectual than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say , for our own part , that we regret the demise of its charter . Enormous mischief was inflicted by the removal of the deposits , and the distributioa of the treasury amongst a company of private banks . By this act of the Government , a number of irresponsible monopolies were substituted for one , comparatively responsible . There is hardly a room for doubt , that the anti-bank party of 1833 was a combination utterly demagogical and fraudulent , and managed with as little regard for the welfare of the nation as can well be conceived ; and yet , we insist that many of the arguments brought forward by them against the renewal of the charter were not to be set aside . It has been argued on the other side that the Mint , even , is a monopoly , and that the Mint might be managed by contract ; but the case is not parallel with that of the Bank . The Mint is a chemical laboratory and workshop : it does not confer value upon metal or paper ; it knows nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver into pieces of equal weight and purity , and affix upon them a certain indicative mark . It has not , nor can not have , any control over the business of the nation or of individuals ; its officers have no interest in debasing the coin ; they do not furnish the gold and silver , and they do not retain a portion of it for their own profit : the profits , if there happen to be any , belong exclusively to the Government . The officers are paid by salary , and are responsible solely to the Government . The same is true , to a certain extent of the sub-treasury . The officers of the Treasury are salaried ; they are able to defraud the Government , but they must do so by direct robbery . Though it may be a cumbersome and uneconomical institution , it does not lay open the Government to the schemes of speculative bankers . The inquiry immediately suggests itself why should not a bank of the United States be conducted upon the same principle ? Why is Government under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is able to exercise itself , with perfect safety ? Why should it place out of its own hands an executive power expressly reposed in it by the Constitution ? Is it not clearly unconstitutional to do this ; much more so , even , than to allow the States to regulate for themselves the treatment of fugitive slaves l Is it necessary or proper that a fiscal agent of the United States should be managed for the profit of foreign capitalists ? Is it just that these capitalists , through their proxies and business agents , should exercise an uncontrollable power over the currency , commerce , and banking institutions of this Union ? Is it right that these foreign capitalists , profiting by the business of the Union , should be exempt from taxation ? Was it prudent to confer upon a private institution , performing the work of an irresponsible treasury and finance manager by contract , the privilege of establishing paper " sub-treasuries " in every State of the Union , using these paper sub-treasuries and fiscal sub-agents as a means of drawing the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parent institution , and substituting its own paper , at whatever premium or value ? In a word , is it admissible , in the present state of the world , to substitute the promises of a private company , chartered by the Government , for money ? - for this was the operation of the Bank . For the privilege of i*ealizing enormous profits by the management of public funds , the Bank was ready and willing to pay a small compensation to the Government : this was inverting the natural order . The Bank should have been paid , not the Government . The President of the United States and Vhe beads of departments do not pay annuities to the Government for the privilege of exercising their functions ; though , if report be true , some of them might , at times , very well do so : they , on the contrary , are paid by the Government , and can not law fully // make their offices a means of paying themselves . But if the Bank was a contract , it will be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We have shown sufficient reason why it ought not to be a contract , in any event ; but it was not a contract , for it wis not given to the highest bidder . The effectual exemption of the property of this institution from taxation , when we remember that it was an institution for the profit of individuals , as well as for the convenience of the public , was another , and in our opinion a valid , objection to the charter ofl*red in 1832 . The States have jealously reserved to themselves the right of taxing all persons and property ; they surrender only the imports and exports , and , by agreement , unsold lands belonging to the nation . But in the first part of this article we have shown that the stock of this Bank , was indirectly exempted from taxation ; an exemption which interfered directly with the reserved rights of the States . It is asserted in the message of July 10th , 1832 , that when the new charter , upon which this message was a veto , was presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation of the memorial for a new bank , although it was admitted by the President of the Bank that its executive power over the finances of the country was so great , the State banks existed only by its permission and sufferance . Independently , therefore , of all personal feelings , and of all political arguments and interested opposition , we do not feel the least surprise or indignation at the course pursued by the Executive itself in relation to the new charter . The Executive , whose business it was , by law , to administer the finances of the government , found an irresistible and irresponsible power growing up at its side , which at that moment , perhaps , had absorbed the greater part of its influence with Congress . Mr. Clayton said , that he believed upon investigation certain charges could be substantiated against the Bank , showing that it excited a powerful influence upon members of Congress and other influential persons . Now , it is not a very long tijac since a list of names of members of Congress could be found upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were known to be , or supposed to be , capable of English influence against a protective tariff . It is unnecessary to say by what means it was intended to exercise this influence . To enter at large upon the particulars would savor of scandal , which we wish by all means to avoid . In so large a body as the Congress of the United States , sent to Washington in part for interested purposes , consisting in part of agents of speculation , in the disguise of legislators , there will always be found a considerable number of men more open to pecuniary than to official influence . A bank that would " accommodate " members of Congress with money , without real security , and upon nominal endorsernen - as it is highly probable the Bank of the United States found itself compelled to do-was open to the charge of corruption ; and though it might easily have defended itself , to all appearance , against such a charge , the effect of the accusation would remain . The evil itself was perhaps inherent in the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is well known , under a system very much resembling bribery , to forward their particular interests but of all interests , that of the Bank would be soonest necessitated , by its very nature , to employ pecuniary influence , and would perhaps be unable to stand without it . The objectjon is valid : it does not arise out of the character of its conductors , so much as from the weakness of human nature . A number of charges were brought against the management of the Bank by Mr. Clayton and others , which it is unnecessary to inquire into : many of them were invidious. and unessential . The princpal defects of the institution we have already pointed out : its benefits , on the other hand , were unquestionable ; but they were of too general a character to be appreciated by the masses . It did succeed in maintaining and restoring a sound currency . tt did exercise a powerful and salutary control over the State banks . The removal of the government deposits , and their distribution among the lesser banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been suppressed by the central institution . Since that time , there has been no Bank of the United States . Both parties have successively brought forward proposals for the organixation of a fiscal agent for the Government these have either failed , fur want of a majority in their favor , or nave been sup- // qwq city , as they were issued , in packages , like a draft or a check , having never been ciaployed as currency . It is a money-lending establishment thus far , and not , properly speaking , a bank ; for it has not yet secured the confluence of the I ) eople , and consequently can not keep its notes in circulation . Paying in promises , the bank is both a lender and a borrower ; its gains are altogether upon time , or rather upon time rnultiplied by the quantity of issues . Every day , while a note is on its travels from hand to hand , is time , that is to say , interest , gained to the bank . But if the public have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bank considered as an " agency " has other profits ; but to these we need not now allude . We can not suppose that the people of the United States will suffer their Treasury to become a money-lending institution ; they would much rather increase the tariff , or establish direct taxes . The credit of the Government will never be sold in that manner ; the fact that it was so sold , is the principal objection to the charter of the old Bank . During such time as payments to the Treasury of the United States are made in Bpecie , the Government will have an abundant supply of the precious metals . The Epecie system works equally for and against the Government as long as the revenue is equal to the expenditure . Paper can not be used by the Treasury , as common currency , under the presei*t system . There remains , to our view , hut a single basis for the establishment of a regulative fiscal organ . We have already , in previous articles , suggested upon what system , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established . A private institution , guarantied by the stock of the United States , with a sufficiently extended capital , under the charter of the Union , established in every State of the Union , on the New-York plan , * would have the character and freedom , and be subject to all the responsibilities , of a common bank ; and could be employed by the Government without detriment to itself , and freed of all the objections which have been brought against the old Bank of the United States . If the occasion should arise , it is our intention to develop , at more leisure , the idea of such an institution .
