txt /q/h , of Camden , N. J. , obtained from four trees of the Tewksbury Blush , one hundred and forty bushels of apples , or thirty-five from each tree ; of these ninety baskets ( of about three pecks each ) sold late in the following spring for one dollar per basket . Examples almost beyond number may be given where single trees have yielded from five to ten dollars a year in fruit , and many instances where twenty or thirty dollars have been obtained . An acre of such would be equal to any of the preceding instances . If one tree of the Rhode Island Greening will afford forty bushels of fruit , at a quarter of a dollar per bushel , which has often occurred , forty such trees on an acre would yield a crop worth four hundred dollars . But taking but one quarter of this amount as a low average for all seasons and with imperfect cultivation , one hundred dollars would still be equal to the interest on fifteen hundred per acre . Now , this estimate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past thirty years , in our most productive districts ; let a similar calculation be made with fruits rarer and of a more delicious character . Apricots , and the finer varieties of the plum , are often sold for three to six dollars per bushel ; the best early peaches from one to three dollars ; and pears , from hardy and productive trees , for an equal amount . Of the three former kinds , tvo to five bushels per tree , with good management , is a frequent crop ; and on large pear trees five times this quantity . An acquaintance received eight dollars for a crop grown on two fine young cherry trees , and twenty-four dollars from four oung peach trees , of only six years growth from the bud . In western New- York , single trees of the Doyenne or Virgalieu pear have often afforded a return of twenty dollars or more , after being sent hundreds of miles to market . An acre of such trees , well managed , would far exceed in profits a fine hundred-acre farm . /z/ But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets be surfeited with fruit ? " This will depend upon the judgment and discretion of cultivators . With the exception of the peaches of Philadelphia , and the strawberries of Cincinnati , a great deficiency is still felt in all our large cities . Of these two fruits , large plantations are brought rapidly into full bearing . The fruit , when ripe , quickly perishes , and can not be kept a week ; yet thousands of acres in peach trees , bending under their heavy crops , - are needed for the consumption of the one city , and broad fifty-acre fields , reddened with enormous products , send many hundred bushels of strawberries daily into the other . If , instead of keeping but three days , sorts were now added which would keep three months , many times the amount would be needed . But the market would not be confined to large cities . Railroads and steamboats would open new channels of distribution throughout the country , for increased supplies . Nor would the business stop here . Large portions of the eastern continent would gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities for a resonable supply . Our best apples are already eagerly bought in London and Liverpool , where nine dollars per barrel is not an unusual price for the best Jewtown pippins . And by packing in ice , Doyenne pears , gathered early in autumn in NewYork , have been sold at mid-winter in Calcutta peaches have been safely sent to Jamaica and strawberries to Barbadoes . The Baldwin apple has been furnished in good condition in the East Indies , two months after it is entirely gone at Boston. * Good winter apples always command a market . For the past thirty years such fine varieties as the Swaar , Rhode Island Greening , and Esopus Spitzenburgh , have scarcely varied from twenty-five cents a bushel in some of the most productive portions of the country , remote from market . Late keepers are sold early in the summer for more than triple that sum . An acre of forty trees , with good culture , will average through all seasons not less than two hundred bushels , or fifty dollars a year . Instances are frequent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets out twenty acres of good apple orchard , and takes care of it , may expect /z/ it no remote period a yearly return of five to fifteen hundred dollars a year , and even more , if a considerable portion is occupied with late keepers . This is , it is true , much more than the majority obtain ; but the majority wholly neglect cultivating and enriching the soils of their orchards . It is not , however , merely as a source of income , that the cultivation of the finer kinds become profitable . The family which is at all times supplied with delicious and refreshing fruit from its own gardens , has within its reach not only a very important means of economy , but of real domestic comfort . An influence is thus introduced of an exalted character ; a tendency is directly exerted towards the improvement of the manners of the people . Every addition to the attractions of home , has a salutary bearing on a rising family of children . The difference between a dwelling with well planted grounds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely a single fruit tree softens the face of bleakness and desolation , may , in many instances , and to many a young man just approaching active life , serve as the guiding influence between a useful life on the one hand , or a roving and unprofitable one on the other between a life of virtue and refinement from early and favorable influences , or one of dissipation and ruin from the overbalancing effects of a repulsive home . Nor can any man , even in the noon or approaching evening of life , scarcely fail to enjoy a higher happiness , with at least an occasional intercourse with the blossoming and loaded trees which his own hand has planted and pruned , than in the noise of the crowd and tumult of the busy world . /z/ THE earliest fruits mentioned in history , are the grape , the apple , and the fig , the former having been cultivated about the time of the deluge . The almond is mentioned repeatedly in the sacred records , nearly 4000 years ago ; and Theophrastus , who lived about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only tree in Greece that produced blossoms before the leaves ; hence we may safely infer that the peach was then unknown . The fact that the Jewish history no where speaks of the peach , indicates that it was not a native of Persia , a country long inhabited by that people. * It was doubtless , however , early intioduced there . It was known to the Romans at the height of their power , and the nectarine was spoken of by Columella and by Pliny , as an admired fruit of their time . The Romans extended their conquests into nearly all parts of the known world , and brought back the horticultural productions adapted to the climate of Italy . The fig was obtained from Syria , the peach from Persia , the citron from Media , the pommegranate from Africa , the apricot from Epirus , apples , pears , and plums , from Armenia , and cherries from Pontus . When the Empire was at the height of its power , or towards the close of the first century , the following fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apples , 22 varieties ; Pears , 36 Cherries , 8 Quinces , 3 " Grapes , numerous varieties ; Plutns , many sorts , black , white , and variegated ; /z/ Figs , many ; black and white , large and small ; Almonds , sweet and bitter ; Medlars , larger and smaller ; Mulberries , two black varieties ; Nuts , hazel and filberts ; Strawberries , and Apricots . The orange is supposed to have been introduced at Rome at a later period . The art of Grafting , so indispensible to the diffusion oi the finer fruits , was well known to the ancients , but its origin is hid in the obscurity of antiquity . It does not appear to have been known in the age of Homer , and is thought to have been first practiced not far from the time of Hesiod . It was familiar to the ancient Greeks of a later period ; and the Roman writers describe a great variety of modes , quite as ingenious as the fanciful variations now used by gardeners . The statements of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partook largely of the conjectural , and frequently of the marvellous . Hence we find Pliny asserting that when plums were grafted upon apple stocks , they produced what were called apple-plums ; and upon almond stocks , they yielded a fruit of a compound nature , the stone being like that of the almond . And Virgil , with a little more poetical freedom , speaks of grafting apples on planes ; of adorning the wild ash with the blossoms of the pear ; and represents swine as crunching acorns under elms . After the fall of the Empire , the reign of violence nearly extinguished the taste for the improvements of gardening , and destroyed the means of enjoying rural life . Nearly the only exceptions were furnished by the monks , who labored with their own hands in the cultivation of the soil . At the close of the eighth century , Charlemagne recommended the culture of apples , pears , and plums , and gave great encouragement to the establishment of orchards and vineyards . His friendly intercourse with the Saracenic prince , Haroun al Raschid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best sorts of melons , figs , peaches , and other fruits , in existence at that time . When Europe gradually emerged from the night of the dark ages , the increased light diffused by the spread of lite- /z/ rature and science , was accompanied with a corresponding increase in the arts of cultivation . We have but little information , however , on this subject , till about three hundred years ago . England , France , and the Low Countries , seem to have taken the lead in improvement . The earliest British writer on the culture of fruit , was Richard Arnold , who published a chapter in his " Chronicles , " in 1502 , " On the crafte of graftynge and plantynge , and alterynge of fruits , as well in color as in taste . " He was succeeded about 1538 , by Tusser , who mentions apples , pears , peaches , apricots , cherries , plums , grapes , medlars , barberries , filberts , gooseberries , raspberries , and strawberries . The fig , the orange , and the pommegranate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the middle of the sixteenth century there were cultivated all the kinds or primary varieties known at the present day . Tusser was followed in 1597 , by Gerard , and in 1629 , by Parkinson . The former thus speaks of the apple of his time : " The fruit of apples do differ in greatness , form , color , and taste ; some covered with a red skin , others yellow or green , varying exceedingly ; some very great , some little , and many of a middle sort ; some are sweet of taste , or something sour ; most are of a middle taste , between sweet and sour ; the which to distinguish I think it impossible , notwithstanding I hear of one that intended to write a peculiar volume , of apples , and the use of them . " The number of varieties described or mentioned by Parkinson in 1629 , show their cultivation to have become extensive ; among them were , Apples , 58 5 " Apricots , 6 Figs , 3 Parkinson was followed by Evelyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave by his /z/ writings and active influence , a great impetus to rural culture . The great Brompton Nursery of Loudon and Wise , during the early part of the eighteenth century , disseminated vast quantities of fruit trees over the kingdom . Miller published his Gardeners ' Dictionary in 1724 ; Forsyth his Treatise on Fruit Trees in 1791 . The London Horticultural Society was instituted early in the present century , and in connexion with the earlier investigations of its president , Thomas Andrew Knight , and the later and unwearied labors of Robert Thompson , it has poured a flood of light on the science of cultivation , and on the " nomenclature of fruits . The Dutch made early advancement in the cultivation of fruit , and at the close of the sixteenth century , they were familiar with the principal kinds of fruit now cultivated , except " the pine apple , which was newly introduced into Belgium and England about that time . The French made a nearly similar progress . Quintinge , during the reign of Louis XIV. , or during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art by his writings and labors , and developed an excellent system of pruning , which has sine proved of the highest importance in the cultivation of wall and espalier trees . In the United States , the art , and the materials for its practice , have been mostly derived from England , and to a considerable extent from France and Germany . Many of the best European varieties have proved to be fine fruits here , but a larger portion do not appear well fitted to our climate ; and most of our richest varieties of apples and peaches are of American origin . The gradual progress of pomology is indicated in part by the increasing number of varieties successively named or described by the various authors for the past few centuries . Apples " of all sorts " are mentioned by Tusser ; Parkinson enumerates sixty-seven ; Hartlib , in 1650 , alluded to one cultivator who possessed two hundred , and believed there were not less than five hundred ; Ray , in 1668 , says there were seventy-eight cultivated in the London nurseries ; Forsyth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; George Lindley , in 1831 , minutely and accurately described two hundred and fourteen ; while the Fruit Catalogue of the London Horticultural Society gives a list of fourteen /z/ hundred varieties , collected and cultivated by that society , three-fourths of which were found to be either the same fruit under different names , or else unworthy of cultivation . The same remark will apply , at least in part , to the many hundreds offered for sale in the United St'ates . A similar progress , less in degree , is indicated in the cultivation of the pear . Tusser speaks of " all sorts ; " Parkinson enumerates sixty-four varieties ; Miller eighty ; and Lindley describes one hundred and sixty-two . Most of these writers also mention numerous varieties of the cherry and plurn . Gerard describes the early , and the white , red , and yellow peaches , and says there were many others ; Parkinson enumerates twenty-one ; Miller thirty-one ; Lindley describes sixty ; and in this country , more favorable to the peach than England , there are probably not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eminent advantages have resulted from the application of scientific principles , by Lindley , Knight and others , in the propagation of improved varieties . Several hundred new pears some of them of fine quality , were obtained by Van Mons of Belgium , by a successive selection of improved seedlings ; and Knight , in England , has produced some of the finest varieties of the cherry , plum , and apple , by a cross fertilization of old sorts . One of the greatest difficulties yet remaining , is the confusion in the names of varieties . The very slight shades of difference in some ; the unsuccessful attempts at accurately defining these shades in w r ritten descriptions ; and the changes produced by soil , situation , climate , and culture , have largely increased the difficulty . This confusion has been augmented by the multitude of names given in some instances to a single fruit . The celebrated White Doyenne or Virgalieu pear , is variously known by thirty different names ; the Brown Beurre , fourteen ; several others have nearly an equal number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different cultivators , may be easily imagined . The varieties of the peach which Lindley , an eminent British writer , describes as Grosse Mignonne , Neil 's Early Purple , Pourpree Hative , Royal Kensington , and Superb Royal , are all described as a single va- /z/ riety by Mclntosh , another British writer , under the name Grosse Mignonne , to which he adds twenty-seven synonyms . The labors of the London Horticultural Society have contributed much towards removing the bewildering confusion into which the numerous fruits and their names were thrown . Large collections were made from different countries ; and by a careful and minute examination for many successive years , innumerable mistakes were corrected . The Massachusetts Horticultural Society , at Boston , in connection with the labors of the late Robert Manning , of Salem , ( whose collection of pears alone contained eight hundred sorts , ) have tended greatly towards the same useful end in this country . The subject is also receiving much attention in various parts of the United States . The indispensible necessity of a more thorough examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more appreciated and becoming reduced to practice . Many extensive private collections of American and European fruits have recently been made , or greatly augmented , for the purpose of a more thorough examination , comparison , and selection of varieties . These , in connection with the increased facilities for an interchange of fruits and information , can not fail to pour a flood of light upon the darkness which has so long enveloped this branch of the subject ; to lead to a greater uniformity in names , and accuracy in their application ; to point out those only which are worthy of general cultivation , and to lead to the rejection of the hundreds , which , possessing good qualities , do not come up to the high standard of excellence which should be adopted by every enlightened cultivator and disseminator of fruits . /z/ THE tendency is more or less common with all plants , when successively produced from seed , to depart from the character first stamped upon them . These departures give rise to new varieties . In their native forests , many trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slight and obscure , or in consequence of the inflexible nature of the species . With others , varieties are conspicuous ; examples of which may be seen in the White Spruce , a part of the trees presenting rigid , erect branches , in contrast with the drooping aspect of others ; in the American Elm , the branches , in rare instances , being as pendant as the weeping willow ; in the more brilliant glow of red flowers on some trees of the Red Maple ; and in the diversity of size , form , and flavor of the wild plum of the woods . This tendency to vary is increased as plants are removed from their native localities ; and in an eminent degree by cultivation . Planted in gardens , and subjected to high culture , repeated and successive sowings often develope striking changes from the appearances which for previous centuries had remained unchanged . By a constant selection of seeds from the best , a gradual improvement on the original is effected . Most of our finest fruits , doubtless owe their existence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we sow a quantity of seed in gar- * The distinction between species and varieties should be well understood . A single species , or original , distinct , individual plnnt , often includes many varieties . All the varieties of one species , are from the same original plant ; the thousands which have been named of the single species , the apple , are but a small portion of the myriads which have been actually produced . Successive plantings have given us sorts as different in size as the Monstrous Pippin and the minute Lady Apple ; or as remote in flavor as the harsh and astringent Hewes Crab , and the rich and honied Bough . But widely different as these may be , they can never pass the boundary of the species an apple can never be changed to a pear , a cherry to a plum , nor a gooseberry to a currant . /z/ den soil , of the common black mazzard cherry , we shall find that , in the leaves and habit of growth , many of the seedlings do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is probable we shall also find as great a diversity in the size , color , and flavor of the fruit , though only a few , perhaps only one , may be superior to the original species . " Exactly in proportion as this reproduction is frequently repeated , is the change to a great variety of forms , or new sorts , increased . It is likely , indeed , that to gather the seeds from the wild mazzard of the woods , the instances ot departure from the form of the original species would be very few ; while if gathered from a garden tree , itself sometime cultivated , or several removes from a wild state , though still a mazzard , the seedlings will show great variety of character . " Once in the possession of a variety which has moved out of the natural into a more domesticated form , we have in our hands the best material for the improving process . The fixed original habit of the species is broken in upon , and this variety which we have created , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original form . It is true that all or most of its seedlings will still retain a likeness to the parent , but a few will differ in some respects , and it is by seizing upo'n those which show symptoms of variation , that the improver of vegetable races founds his hopes . " While a few of the seedlings from such improved variety , may become still further improved , a far greater number will probably approach towards the original or wild state . The more highly improved the fruit , the greater the difficulty to find one of its progeny which shall excel or equal the parent . In ten thousand seedlings from those highflavored apples , the Swaar and Esopus Spitzenburgh , it may be quite doubtful if any shall equal in quality those fruits themselves , while most may fall considerably below them . The improvements effected in former ages were doubtless the result of accident , as the ancients were ignorant of the means for their systematic accomplishment . The greatest progress in the art made in modern times , was effected by Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Mons , who directed his labors chiefly to the pear , produced many new and excellent varieties , by a constant and successive selection of the best seedlings . He first made a large collection of natural stocks , or wild pears , choosing those which , from the appearance of the wood and leaf , he had reason to believe , would be most likely to produce the best fruit . As soon as the first of these bore , he selected the best , and planted the seeds . Selections were again made , from the first , of these , and so on in continued succession ; the best and soonest in bearing were uniformly chosen . He thus obtained fruit from the eighth generation ; each successive experiment yielding an improved result on the preceding . At the fourth generation many of the fruits were good , several excellent , but a smaller number still bad . He had , in the early part of this series of experiments , no less than eighty thousand trees ; hence in selecting from so large a number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small collection ; and hence too the reason why , after seven or eight improving generations , he had obtained so many good varieties . In the early stages of his operations , he found " that twelve or fifteen years was the mean term of time , from the moment of planting the first seed of an ancient variety of the domestic pear , to the first fructification of the trees which sprung from them . The trees from the second sowing , yielded their first fruit at an age of from ten to twelve years ; those of the third generation , at an age of from eight to ten years ; those of the fourth generation , at an age of from six to eight ; and those of the fifth generation at the age of six years . Van Mons , being actually at the eighth generation , has informed me that he has obtained several pear trees which fruited at the age oj four years " * When his seedlings were at the age of three or four years , he was able to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne ; such only were taken for further trial , as enhibited the strongest probability of excellence . It is hardly necessary to remark that in all these trials , the young trees were kept in the highest state of cultivation . . Van Mons maintained that by selecting and planting the seeds of the first crop on the young tree , the product would be less liable to run back to the original variety , than where /z/ the seeds were taken from the fruit of an old bearing or grafted tree ; and to this practice he chiefly ascribed his success . The many instances , however , of fine seedlings from old grafted sorts , throw a shade of doubt over this theory . /z/ A familiar instance of cross-impregnation in plants occurs in the Indian corn . The pistillate or seed-bearing flowers covering the young ear , are remotely situated on the plant from the staminate or fertilizing flowers on the summits or ta*sds . Hence , from this remote position , the pollen or fertilizing dust from the summits may not certainly fall on the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably result . It is well known to farmers , that if different sorts , as white , yellow , and purple , are planted in the same field ; or , if common and sweet corn are planted together , each sort no longer remains distinct , but each ear the second year is speckled with a promiscuous assemblage of white , yellow , and purple , and of common and sweet corn , of various grades . In fruit trees , the stamens and pistils are in the same flower , and the chances of accidental mixture from other trees , become very small , unless affected by insects , which , becoming thickly dusted with powder from one flower , plunge into the recesses of another , and effect a cross-fertilization . Where many varieties grow in one garden , in close proximity , cases of promiscuous intermixture are constantly occurring , which can be developed only by raising fruit from the seedlings . In the annexed figure of the pear blossom , ( fig. 1 , ) the ? five central organs , a , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stigma . The surrounding thread-like organs , i , are the stamtns , surmounted by the anthers . The anthers are little bags or cases filled with the pollen or fertilizing dust . When the flowers open , the anthers burst , and Fi ff- * discharge the pollen- on the stigma , which operates on the embryo fruit at its base . The production of new varieties is greatly facilitated by cross-impregnation , or by fertilizing the pistil of one variety with the pollen of another . This was performed with great /z/ success by Knight . Selecting two varieties , while yet early in flower , and before the anthers had J ) burst and discharged the pollen , he cut " out with a fine pair of scissors all the stamens , leaving the pistils untouched , ( fig. 2 . ) When the stigma became sufficiently mature , which was indicated by its glutinous surface , he transferred the pollen of the other sort , on the point of a camel's-hair pencil . The fruit , thus yielded , was unchanged ; but its seeds partook variously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing from them bore new and intermediate varieties . For the success of such experiments , several precautions are requisite . The flower must be deprived of its stamens before it has fully expanded , or before the anthers have already burst and scattered their dust ; the pollen must be procured from a bursting or fully matured anther , when it will be dry and powdery ; the stigma must be inoculated as soon as it becomes adhesive or glutinous , otherwise it may be fertilized from another source , and then the intended pollen can not possibly take effect . For a stigma once inoculated , can not be inoculated again . It is safest , where practicable , to force the trees by artificial heat into flowering a few days earlier than others , so as to be secure from accidental inoculations of pollen floating in the air ; and to prevent its spread by bees , to apply a temporary covering of gauze . A want of attention to these minutia ? , has led some experimenters to fancy they had obtained crosses , when they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired qualities , select two which possess those qualities separately , and seedlings from crossing will be likely to exhibit these qualities combined . Thus , a very early pear deficient in flavor , as the Amire Joannet , might furnish one of superior quality *by a cross with a better and later sort , as Dearborn 's Se'edling . Or , a small and very rich pear , as the Seckel , might give us one of the larger size by fertilizing the Bartlett . A slowgrowing and tender peach , as the Early Anne , might be rendered hardier and more vigorous by an intermixture with /z/ che Early York or Cooledge 's Favorite . But it must be remembered , that there is a tendency in such highly improved sorts to deteriorate , and that out of a large number 3f seedlings , perhaps only one or two may be equal in flavor to the original . Some of our best fruits have resulted from artificial crossing . Coe r s Golden Drop plum was obtained by planting seed of the Green Gage , impregnated with pollen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Graffion ) T Bigarreau , fertilized with the White Heart ; and Knight 's Early Black and Waterloo , from the Mayduke and Graffion . The first crop of a young seedling is not always suffi:iently developed to exhibit its true character . Some years of bearing are often essential . Thus , the Black Eagle , one of the finest cherries , when exhibited the first time before the London Horticultural Society , was pronounced worthless . When a cross is obtained between two different species , instead of between mere varieties , it is termed a hybrid . But while varieties of the same species intermingle freely , the Dperation rarely succeeds between fruits of different species . The gooseberry , currant , and black currant , species of the same genus , and nearly related , have never produced a hybrid . Neither have any ever been obtained between the apple and the pear , or the pear and the quince . But different species of other plants , as the Heaths , and some of the Cacti , intermingle freely . The Rhododendron will fertilize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inoculate the American Arbor-vitae , though both these examples are between plants of different genera . Hybrids are frequently , sterile ; or if they possess the power of reproduction by seed , the progeny returns to the state of one or the other of its parents . /z/ WHEN trees are raised from seeds , as before stated , there is no certainty that the same identical variety will be reproduced . In many cases , the shade of variation will be scarcely perceptible ; in others it will be wide and distinct . It hence becomes desirable in preventing a return towards the original wild state , or , in other words , to perpetuate the identical individual thus highly improved , to adopt some other mode of propagation , for the purpose of multiplying trees of such varieties as possess a high excellence , instead of constantly creating new ones , with the hazard of most of them proving worthless . It will be distinctly remembered , that new varieties must always spring from seeds ; but the same individual variety can be multiplied only by separating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual plant . As an example , the Fall Pippin , when first produced from seed , was a single tree of a new variety . The myriads of trees now existing of this variety , are only multiplications of the branches of the original . This multiplication or propagation of varieties , is effected in several ways : 1 , Cuttings ; 2 , Layers ; 3 , Grafting ; 4 , Budding . Without these means of propagation , such delicious sorts as the Green Gage plum , the Elton cherry , and ihe Seckel pear , could never have been tasted except as picked from the single parent tree . In the multitude of different modes of grafting and budding , success must depend on the observance of certain fundamental principles ; a brief glance , therefore , at these principles , may serve to render the explanation of all the variations simple and intelligible . During the growing season of a fruit tree , the sap enters at /z/ the spongioles , or minute spongy extremities of the fibrous roots , * at which time it consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solution . It passes up through the alburnum or sap-wood , dissolving mucilage in its progress ; it becomes further charged in a very slight degree , and acquires a saccharine character . It ascends to the extremities of the branches , and is distributed through the leaves . Emerging thus from the dark and minute vessels of the wood , it is spread out and exposed to the action of the light , by means of the fine web or net-work of veins running from the mid-rib to all parts of these broad and thin organs . Here it becomes essentially changed in character , it enters into new combinations , and is charged with the materials for the newly forming wood ; it now descends , not through the sap-wood , but through the inner or living bark , t and deposits a new layer between the bark and the wood . This new layer being soft and fresh , interposed between them , causes that separation known as the peeli ? ig of the bark.t The sap is capable of flowing sidewise , through lateral openings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cut at one point more than half through on one side , and at another point more than half through on the other side , without intercepting the upward flow of sap , as in fig. 3 . Fig 3 This lateral motion explains the reason why a graft set in the longitudinal cleft of a stock , receives the sap from the split surfaces of the cleft , and succeeds as well as when cross-sections of both are brought into contact . * A greatly magnified representation of one of these spongelets is shown in the - r-  , -1 , s - ' . -j , .  --  - annexed figure , ( fig. 4. ) the central or dark part being woody , and the point of the exterior being cellular and spongy . t The liber , or inner bark , constitutes almost the whole bark in young trees , but often not onehalf on very old and rough-barked forest trees . t The importance of leaves to the growth and even life of the tree , is exhibited in various ways . A tree stripped of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sue cession of such stripping* , during the course of the season , soon /z/ When a ligature is bound closely round a branch , the obstruction which it imposes to the descending juices , causes an enlargement or swollen ring above the ligature , as in fig. 5 . The same result is produced if a small ring of bark is cut out , as in fig. 6 . If a shoot is taken from the tree before the leaves expand , and plunged into moist earth till il commences growth , the descending current exuding from the lower extremity , forms a callus or ring oi the newly formed wood , as in fig. 7 ; and under favorable circumstances the granulations forming the callus emit roots into the soil , ( fig. 8 , ) and thus a new plant is formed . Every leaf bud on a fruit tree may be regarded as an embryo branch , and capable of forming a tree when supplied kills it . Weeds which spread rapidly by the roots , as the Canada thistle , may be totally destroyed in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the same reason , trees which become divested of their foliage by leaf-blight while the fruit is partly grown , do not perfect the ripening process . An interesting instance occurred during the pat season : A plum tree lost all its leaves , when the fruit was about two-thirds grown , and before it had attai ) e , d in the slightest degree its flavor . The plums remained stationary , densely loading the naked branches , for three weeks , when a new crop of leaves came out . The fruit immediately recommenced growing , and subsequently acquired full size , and a fine , rich , honied flavor , about a month later than the usual period of ripening . Hence also the reason why the removal of large portions of the foliage , to favor the ripening of grapes and other fruits by admitting the sun , does not always effect the intended purpose . Another case , illustrating the same principle , was reported by the late President Knight : " A peach tree in my garden , of which I was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity of the weather , all its blossoms except two , which grew upon leafless branches . I therefore endevored to derive the necessary returning sap 1o mature the fruit from another source . To attain this object , the points of the branches , which bore fruit , were brought into contact with other branches of the same age , which bore leave* ; and a part of the bark , extending in length about four times their diameters , was paired off immediately above the fruit . Similar wounds were then made upon the other branches , with which these were brought into contact ; the wounded surfaces were closely fitted and tightly bound together . A union soon took place , and the fruit , in consequence , acquired the highest state of maturity and perfection . " Fig. 5 . Fig. 6 . Fig. 7. /z/ with separate roots . But single buds do not contain within themselves sufficient nutriment to sustain vegetation till roots are formed , without a considerable portion of the alburnum or sap-wood attached ; hence the superior advantage of taking an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of multiplying a variety . It consists simply in the insertion of a shoot of one year 's growth into the soil ; the moisture of the soil renews the supply of sap , the buds swell , the leaves expand , and the descending juices expend themselves in the production of new roots , which shoot downwards into the soil , fig. 9 . Under ordinary circumstances , or in open ground , this mode is only applicable to such species as readily throw out roots , as the currant , gooseberry , quince , and grape . Cuttings of the apple and pear may be made to strike root , only by confining the moisture under glass , while artificial heat is applied . The stories of empirics , of making peach and apple shoots grow by sticking them into potatoes , or covering with wax , have no foundation in fact . It may be stated , in general , that cuttings made of the ripened wood of such trees as have a large pith , succeed best when taken off with a portion of the preceding year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine , fig , &c.; With large and strong shoots , the best success will result if cuttings are separated at the point between the one and two years ' growth . When small side-shoots are used , they should be cut closely to the main stem , so as to secure the collar or enlarged portion of the wood at the base of the branch . Roots are more readily thrown out , if the cut is made immedately below a bud . The best time to take off " cuttings , in ordinary cases , is in autumn and winter . The autumn is preferable , by giving time for the w r ounded section to cicatrise , preparing it for the early emission of roots in spring . But where the soil is heavy or liable to heave by frost , or where the cuttings are of tender trees , they should be kept in damp mould in a cellar , to be planted as soon as the frost disappears from the Fig. 9. /z/ ground Fig. 10 creased , If not taken off till spring , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary instances to prevent drying , about two-thirds or three-quarters of the shoot should be buried beneath the surface ; and the moisture may be still ? * further retained by a covering of leaves or moss , or by placing them under the shade of a wall or V close fence . Failure often results from a neglect to press the soil closely about the cutting . To procure young plants of the gooseberry and currant with straight , clean stems at the surface , and free from suckers , it is only necessary to remove every bud except a few at the upper end , fig. 10 . The length may be eight inches to a foot . In propagating the grape , scarce sorts are in by single buds with a portion of adhering wood , each being placed separately in a pot , about half an inch deep , under glass in a hot-bed , fig. 11 . They are found to root better when a portion of the pith is removed by splitting lengthwise , as in fig. 12 . The plants from single buds are weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines in pots . A similar mode oi propagation , familiar to all , is adopted with the potato , the tubers oi which are only enlarged underground stems , covered with eyes or buds . /z/ A layer is a low side-shoot bent down and buried at the middle in the soil , fig. 13 . The buried portion strikes root , when it is taken off and planted separately . Its advantage over a cutting , is that it is nourished while the roots are forming by the parent plant . Hence many plants which can not be increased by cut- Fig. 11 . Fig. 12 . Fig. 13. /z/ tings , and indeed with great difficulty by budding and grafting , may be propagated readily by layers . When roots are freely emitted , as from the grape , simply bending the middle of the branch into the soil is enough to ensure success . But in cases of difficulty , other expedients are resorted to ; one of the most common is to split a portion upwards , immediately under a bud , ( fig. 14 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely and at once into the soil , without the resistance of the thick bark which they otherwise must pierce . Sometimes the branch is cut partly F- off to intercept the downward passage of the fluids , and induce them to form into roots . At other times a wire ligature , or the removal of a narrow ring of bark effects the same purpose . Burying the layer several inches under the surface is necessary , to keep it in moist earth ; and in drouth , moderate watering would be beneficial . A small excavation of the soil at the spot is convenient ; and when the branch is stiff ' , it must be fastened down with a forked stick . The excavation should be made with a spade . Use both hands in bending the shoot , so that it may not be bent too short , and break . If properly done , it will press against the nearest side of the hole , rest on the bottom , and rise up , pressing against the opposite side , when it should be fastened upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time of bending , a sod or other weight may be laid on to keep it down till the hole is filled ; and if the mellow earth be pressed firmly down with the foot , no forked stick will be usually necessary . The most favorable state of a plant for layering , is when the bark is somewhat soft and not too ripe ; and the worst shoots are those which are stunted , and with a hard bark . There are however , no shoots whatever , not actually diseased , that will not root by layers , if sufficient time be given . Layers , like cuttings , may be made of the ripened wood in autumn or spring ; or of the growing wood at or a little be- /z/ fore mid-summer , when the part intended to root is somewhat mature and firm in texture . The pear , the apple , and the quince , if layered early , in the spring- ; or the grape in summer will usually be well rooted in autumn . A moist season is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softer bark . For this reason , many plants may be more easily propagated in England than in the United States ; and more readily in Ireland than in England . Layering is largely made use of in propagating the grape , occasionally for the quince , and sometimes for the apple . It is also of very extensive application in propagating many ornamental trees and shrubs . Suckers may be regarded as spontaneous layers , the new shoots being sent up ' from buds on the roots or portions ol the stem beneath the surface of the ground . They are the only mode of multiplying most species of the raspberry . The runners of strawberries may be regarded as layers or suckers above ground . /z/ Upwards of twenty different modifications of grafting were mentioned by the ancient Roman writer , Varro ; and Thouin , of Paris , has described and figured more than a hundred kinds . The great number of modes described in books , has tended rather to bewilder than to enlighten beginners ; the following remarks , therefore , are more for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foi pointing out the peculiar modes of operation , which may be varied according to convenience , provided attention is given to the essential particulars . Propagation by grafting differs mainly and essentially from increasing by cuttings , by inserting the cutting into the growing stock of another tree instead of directly into the soil . The stock thus supplies the sap , as the soil does in the case of a cutting ; and the graft , instead of making roots of its own , extends its forming wood downwards , at the inner surface of the bark , into the stock itself . Hence there are two chief requisites for success : the first , that the graft be so set in the stock , that the sap may flow upward without interruption ; and the second , that the forming wood /z/ may flow downward uninterruptedly through the inner bark . To effect these two requisites , it is neettu , first , that the operation be performed with a sharp knife , that the vessels and pores may be cut smoothly and evenly , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , that the operation be so contrived that a permanent and considerable pressure be applied to keep all parts of these cut faces closely together . Thirdly , that the line of division between the inner bark and the wood , should coincide or exactly correspond in each ; for if the inner bark of the one sets wholly on the wood of the other , the upward current through the wood and back through the bark , is broken , and the graft can not flourish nor grow . And , fourthly , that the wounded parts made by the operation , be effectually excluded from the external air , chiefly to retain a due quantity of moisture in the graft , but also to exclude the wet , until , by the growth of the graft , the union is effected . 1 . The first requisite is best attained by keeping a keen , flat bladed-knife to cut the faces , and another knife for other purposes . 2 . The second requires that the jaws of the stock in cleftgrafting , press with some force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the graft . A stock one-third of an inch in diameter will sometimes do this sufficiently ; but three-quarters of an inch is a more convenient size . In whip-grafting , the tongue and slit should be firmly crowded or bound together . 3 . The third requisite is attained by close examination with the eye . 4 . The fourth is accomplished by plasters of grafting-wax or by the application of grafting-clay . Grafting-wax may be made by melting together rosin , tallow , and beeswax , in such proportions as to admit of being easily applied when softened by warmth , but not liable to melt and run in the sun 's rays . An excellent grafting-wax is made of 3 parts of rosin , 3 of beeswax , and 2 of tallow . A cheaper composition , but more liable to adhere to the hands , is made of 4 parts of rosin , 2 of tallow , and 1 of beeswax . But one of the best and cheapest consists of 1 pint of linseed oil , 1 pound of rosin , and 6 pounds of beeswax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be ap- /z/ plied in different ways . The wax may be directly applied when just warm enough to run , by means of a brush ; or il may be spread thickly with a brush over sheets of muslin , 01 thin , tough paper , ( " post-office paper " is best , ) which are afterwards , during a cold day , cut up into plasters of convenient size for applying ; or , the wax , after cold , may be worked up , with wet hands , and drawn out into thin strips 01 ribbons of wax , and wrapped closely around the inserted graft . In all cases success is more certain , when the wax is closely pressed so as to fit closely to every part , and leave no interstices ; and it is indispensible that every por tion of the wound on the stock and graft be totally excluded from the external air . In cool weather , a lantern , chafing dish , or hot brick , will be found necessary to soften the plasters before applying them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tig. 18 . The annexed figures represent the two most common modes of grafting fruit trees ; figs. 15 to 18 , representing successive stages of whip or tongue grafting , from the sloping cut of the scion and stock , to the completion of the operation by the covering with the wax plaster . Fig. 19 shows a stock cut off for cleft-grafting with the upright cleft separated by an iron or steel wedge , ready for the graft ; fig. 20 , cut wedge-form to fit it ; and fig. 21 , the graft in its place /z/ Fig. 19 after the wedge has been withdrawn , the projecting angle of the stock sloped off with a knife , and the whole ready for the application of the wax . Whip grafting is particularly applicable to small stocks , or where the graft and stock are nearly of equalsize ; and cleft-grafting to stocks considerably larger than the scion . In all cases , where the lock is in any degree larger , the graft must be placed towards one side , so that the line between the bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the cross section of cleft-grafting , fig. 22 . A useful implement for the rapid and perfect performance of cleft-grafting , is described in the chapter on implements . There are other modifications of grafting which are often useful . In saddle gTaJting , the stock is sloped oft ' on each side , giving it the form of a wedge , fig. 23 , a ; the graft is split in the middle , and each side thinned away with the knife , as in fig. 23 ft , until it will closely fit when placed like a saddle upon it , fig. 24 . The most perfect way to fit the graft , is to make a long sloping cut from the outer edge or bark , by drawing the blade from heel to point , till it reaches the centre of the graft ; and then another similar cut completes the acue cavity for fitting the wedge of the stock . A sharp , broad , and thin blade , is needed for this operation . A wax plaster , drawn closely round Fi-.24 the pl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock and graft are very nearly of equal size , this is a very perfect mode of Fig. 22 Fig. 23. /z/ Fig. 25. grafting , as large corresponding surfaces are made to fit , and the graft receives freely the ascending sap . In all these modes of grafting , whenever a wedge is made to enter a cleft , it should be thickest on the side where the fit is made between the two parts , so as to receive the full pressure of the cut faces at that side , as shown in fig. 22 . A modification of saddle grafting , very successful in its results , is thus performed : Late in spring , after growth has commenced , the scion , which is much smaller than the stock , is split up , nearer to one side , more than half its length , ( fig. 25 . ) The stronger side is then sharpened into a wedge at its point , and introduced between the bark and the wood , a slight longitudinal slit beino ; made through the bark of the stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thinner division of the graft is fitted to the opposite sloping side of the stock . The whole is then covered with wax . The great length of that portion of the graft in contact with the bark and fresh wood , greatly facilitates their union ; while the cut face of the stock is speedily covered with a new growth by that part of the graft which rests upon it . In grafting the peach , which , from its large pith and spongy wood , scarcely ever succeeds as commonly performed , it is found advantageous in selecting the grafts , to leave a quarter of an inch of the more compact two years ' wood at the lower extremity . Root-grafting is performed by taking up the stocks by the roots , and inserting the grafts immediately into the part below ground after the tops are cut off , after which they are again planted out , with the tip of the graft only above ground . This mode is successful with the apple , and occasionally with other trees , and is adopted on a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter or early spring within doors , and the grafted roots kept in cellars till the ground is ready to receive them . It will be found fully described in the chapter on the apple . In grafting the plum and cherry , success is found to be much more certain , when the work is performed very early /z/ in spring , before the buds commence swelling , or even before the snow has disappeared from the ground . Apples and pears may be grafted later , and if the scions have been kept in good condition in a dormant state , they will mostly grow if inserted after the trees are in leaf . After a graft is inserted , and as soon as the tree commences growth , the buds on the stock must be rubbed off , in order to throw the rising sap into the scion . If large trees are grafted , the buds need only rubbing off the single branch . The practice of allowing leaves to expand on the stock near the point of union , to " draw up the sap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sap thus drawn up , passes only into and is elaborated by those leaves , and is again immediately returned to the stock below , without ever reaching the graft . Each separate branch or portion of the stock , can not be nourished by the leaves of an opposite branch , foi a leafless stump left by pruning off a limb , wholly ceases growing . In the spring of the year , when the sap vessels are in a state of impletion , if the sap is permitted to be consumed by side leaves , less will flow towards the inserted scion . Experience fully confirms this view of the subject . Where it becomes desirable to preserve rare sorts , which have been grafted late in spring , a loose wrapper of white paper round the graft will protect it from the drying and scorching rays of the sun ; or shrivelling and failure will often be prevented by covering the whole graft with a wax plaster ; or by encasing it in moss kept damp by occasional applications of water . Grafts are usually cut during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if well kept they may be taken from the tree at any time between the cessation of growth in late summer or autumn , and the commencement of vegetation in spring . They may be kept safely if buried in moderate ly moist earth ; the best way is to place them in a box open downwards , and buried on a dry spot , the scions being kep ( from actual contact with the earth by sticks across the box . They may also be conveniently preserved in a box of damj powdered moss ; or still better in moderately moist peat o 1 black muck . Sawdust answers the same purpose , if not ir large quantities so as to become heated . /z/ Grafts which have become dry , may be restored if the moisture is applied so gradually that its absorption may re quire several weeks . In one instance shoots cut early in autumn , and subjected to thorough drying , were restored to perfect freshness by the next spring , by wrapping them well in moss and burying them in a dry spot of ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sending to a distance , are usually packed in damp moss , saw-dust , or fibrous peat . They may be sent by mail , within a very small compass , with great safety , by enwrapping them with oil-silk or thin oil-cloth , drawing it closely round them to exclude the moisture , by means of small thread . /z/ Budding consists in introducing the bud of one tree , a portion of bark and a little adhering wood , beneath . he bark of another , and upon the face of the newly forming vvood . It must be performed while the stock is in a state of vigorous growth . An incision is made lengthwise through the bark of the stock , and a small cut at right angles at the top , the whole somewhat resembling the letter T. , fig. 26 Fig. 30 . Fig. 29 . Fig. 27 . Fig. 28 . Fig. 26 . A bud is then taken from a shoot of the present year 's growth , by shaving off the lark an inch or an inch and a half in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the bud , fig. 27 . The edges of the bark , at the incision in the stock , are then raised a little , fig. 28 , and the /z/ bud pushed downwards under the bark , fig. 29 . A bandage of bass , corn-husk , or other substance , is wrapped round , covering all parts but the bud . The pressure should be just sufficient to keep the inserted portion closely to the stock , but not such as to bruise or crush the bark , fig. 30 . The shoots containing the buds should be cut when so mature as to be rather firm and hard in texture ; they are usually in the best condition after the terminal bud has formed . To prevent withering , the leaves must be immediately cut off , as they withdraw and exhale rapidly the moisture from the shoot ; about one quarter of an inch oi the footstalks of the leaves should remain , to serve as handles to the buds while inserting them , fig. 31 . After being thus divested of leaves , they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sent hundreds of miles in damp moss , or encased separately in thin oil-cloth . When by growth , the bandage cuts into the stock , usually in ten days to three weeks , it must be removed . The bud remains dormant till the following spring , when the stock is cut off two inches or more above it . If cut closer , the end A j ' j of the stock becomes too dry , and the bud often Vfl perishes . All other buds must be then removed , and all the vigor of the stock or branch thrown into the remaining bud , which immediately *-g commences a rapid growth . To secure a straight and erect growth , the new shoot , when a few inches long , is tied to the Fig. 31. remaining stump of the stock , fig 32 . By another month , no further support will be needed , and the stump may be wholly cut away , and the wound allowed to heal by the rapid formation of new wood . Buds inserted by midsummer , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock when adhesion has taken place ; but although often attempted , no advantage has resulted from this practice , as the growth is comparatively feeble , and in consequence of its badly matured wood , often perishes the following winter . Even where it escapes , it does not exceed in size at the close of the second season the straight and vigorous shoots of the spring . /z/ The essential requisites for success in budding , are first , a thrifty , rapidly growing stock , so that the bark will peel very freely . Secondly , a proper time ; not too early , when there is little cambium , or mucilaginous cement between the bark and the wood , for the adhesion of the bud , nor too late , when the bark will not peel freely , nor the subsequent growth sufficiently cement the bud to the stock . T.-iirdhj , buds sufficiently mature . Fourthly , a keen flat knife , for shaving off the bud , that it may lie close in contact upon the wood of the stock . Fifthly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bud to fit the stock closely . Various modifications have been proposed for the improvement of budding . One is to make the cross-cut at the bottom of the long slit instead of at the top , as the latter is supposed to impede the descent of nourishment . Another is , to raise the bark all on one side of the slit , making a small notch in its edge for the bud , this mode being supposed to avoid the bad consequences of the mutilation of the wood by the knife . But these modes are both inconvenient , and are found to possess no advantage in practice ; the supposed evils they are intended to obviate being too small to take into account . Making a square cut from the upper end of the bark of the inserted bud , so that it may fit in close contact with the bark of the stock at the horizontal incision , to receive the reFig. 32. turning sap , though strongly recommended , has been found of no utility in practice , as the union takes place wholly between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the small portion of wood cut from the shoot , has been found in the climate of this country not only useless , but really detrimental . Indeed it often happens that buds of the cherry and other trees of rather spongy growth and slow adhesion , succeed much better when a thick portion of wood is taken off with the bud than otherwise ; the wood in such cases assisting in the retention of moisture until cemented to the stock . /z/ When stocks are in the best condition , it is unnecessary to raise the bark any further than to admit the lower point of the bud , which , as it is pushed downwards , performs this operation in the most perfect manner . When the bark does not peel freely enough for this purpose , success becomes very uncertain . Budding is performed in summer , grafting in spring , and both have their advantages . Budding is a simpler operation , and more successfully performed by a novice . It is the best means to multiply the peach and nectarine , grafting very rarely proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a season not crowded with the labors of transplanting . It admits a repetition the same summer , in cases of failure , the stocks remaining uninjured . But in all ? ases thrifty stocks are needed , while grafting will succeed MI those older and less vigorous . Grafting requires less : are subsequently , as no ligatures need removing , nor stocks leading down , and may be conveniently employed as a reTfiedy for failures in the previous summer 's budding . In England , where most fruit trees do not make so rapid a growth as here , budding is less esteemed ; while from the noisture of the climate preserving grafts from dying , graftng becomes more successful . Terminal Budding . It sometimes happens , where buds ire scarce , that the terminal bud on the shoot may be used o advantage . In this case , the wood is cut sloping down vards , and the insertion is made as usual , fig. 33 , except that it becomes necessary to apply the whole of the ligature below the bud . The buds on small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two long , may be successfully used in this way , as the terminal eyes are stronger than any of the others . This practice may sometimes be adopted with much advantage with the peach , where scions of feeble growth only can be obtained , as such buds usually escape the severity of winter when most of the others are destroyed . Spring budding is successfully.practiced as soon as trees are in leaf , the buds hav- Fig. 33. /z/ ing been kept dormant in an ice-house or cool cellar . As soon as they have adhered , the stock is headed down , and a good growth is made the same season . Peaches , nectarines , apricots , and the mulberry , all very difficult to propagate by grafting , may in this way be easily increased by budding . If the buds are kept in a cellar , it will be found very important to preserve with them as unitorm a degree of moisture as possible , and in as small a degree as will keep them from wilting . Annular budding is applicable to trees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walnut , and magnolia . A ring of bark is removed from the stock , and another corresponding ring , containing the bud , slit open on one side , is made to fit the denuded space . Fig. 34 . Ti ets which have been girdled in winter by mice , may be preserved by a process similar to annular budding , by cutting away evenly Fig. 34. i g nawe d portions , and applying one or more pieces of bark peeled from the branch of another tree , so as to restore the connection between the two severed portions . This is done as soon as the bark will separate the same end may , however , be accomplished early in spring by cutting away portions of the sap-wood with the bark , and connecting the two parts by several pieces of a branch , care being taken that they coincide accurately , as in grafting The whole , in either case , is then covered with wax . /z/ In former ages of the world , it was erroneously supposed that grafting could be performed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Pliny , " are so red that they resemble blood , which is caused by their being at first grafted upon a mulberry stock . " Roses , it was said , became black when grafted on black currants , and oranges crimson if worked on the pomegranate . But the operation is never successful unless the graft and stock are nearly allied , and the greater the affinity the more certain the success . " Varieties of the same species unite most freely , then species of the same genus , then genera of the same natural order ; beyond which the power does not extend . For instance , pears work freely upon pears , very well on quinces , /z/ xess willingly on apples or thorns , and not at all upon plums or cherries ; while the lilac will take on the ash , and the olive on the phillyrea , because they are plants of the same natural order . M. De Candolle even says that he has succeeded , notwithstanding the great difference in their vegetation , to work the lilac on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bignonia radicans on the Catalpa ( in all cases of the same natural order ; ) but plants so obtained are very shortlived. " * There are . however , some exceptions to this rule . Thus , the cultivated cherry , and most species of wild cherry , though of the same genus , will not agree . The pear succeeds better on the quince than on the apple , although the apple and pear are within the same genus , and the pear and quince are by most regarded as of distinct genera ; the superior firmness of the wood of the quince , a quality so important to successful grafting , more than making up the difference in affinity . Lindley mentions also some exceptions which are apparent only . In one case , the fig was supposed to grow on the olive . But the graft , being below the surface of the soil , rooted in it , independently of the fig stock . " I have seen , " says Pliny , " near Thulia , in the country of the Tiburtines , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bough bearing nuts , another berries ; here hung grapes , there figs ; in one part you might see pears , in another pomegranates ; and to conclude , there is no kind of apple or other fruit but there was to be found ; but this tree did not live long . " This is explained by the process now sometimes performed in Italy , for growing jasmines and other flexible plants , on an orange stock , by the ingenious trick of boring out the orange stem , through which the stems of the other plants are made to pass , and which soon grow so as to fill it closely , and to appear as if growing together . Such a crowded mass of stems must , of course , soon perish . /z/ As a general rule , fruit trees succeed best when grafted on seedlings of their own species . Apples are best upon seedling apple stocks ; pears on seedling pears ; and plump /z/ and cherries on seedling stocks of their own kinds re spectively . Suckers , when their roots diverge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the uncertainty of finding such roots , and the inconvenience of crooked one-sided , or stunted trees , so often produced from suckers , renders them on the whole greatly inferior to seedlings , and they should never be used , except from absolute necessity . In some cases , stocks of a different kind from the grafl are chosen , where certain objects are to be attained . When , for instance , dwarf trees are wanted of the apple and pear , that they may cover less ground , or bear sooner , stocks ol smaller size or of diminished growth , are chosen . The quince is used for dwarf pear trees ; the small paradise and the Doucin or French stock , for dwarf apples . These will bear crops in one-half the usual time . Besides increasing the early productiveness , of some varieties , the quality too is changed and sometimes improved , as in the Angouleme and Beurre Diel pears . Sometimes different stocks are used as a protection from the attacks of insects . For example , the peach and apricot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are budded upon the plum , which very seldom suffers . The quince is often destroyed or injured by the borer , but the pear is exempt from this injury ; hence the former may be grafted on the latter . But such expedients sometimes fail . Instances have been observed where the peach-worm , not to be thwarted in this way , had attacked the apricot at the place of union on the plum , even as high as three feet from the ground . Tender , kinds are sometimes placed upon hardy stock ? with good effect . Thus , the peach budded on the plum has , in some instances , done better in cold climates , and made an earlier growth in spring . This is not to be ascribed to any alteration in the character of the peach , but to the simple fact that the plum is aroused by a less degree of warmth from winter 's sleep , and exerts an earlier influence by its supply of sap . Benefit has resulted from superior hardiness in stocks during wet or severe winters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with unusual wetness , followed by intense cold , destroyed large quan- /z/ titles of young pear trees on roots of their own species , while those on quince nearly all escaped . Sometimes a change in the character of the soil renders certain stocks desirable for particular localities . The White Doyenne pear flourishes finely on the quince in some places where it is otherwise cracked and worthless . Dr. Lindley found that in the chalky soil at Rouen , the peach on plum , and cherry on cherry , were languid and sickly ; while in the same garden , the peach was healthy and vigorous on the ilmond , and the cherry on the Mahaleb stock . But in rich artificial soil , composed of other ingredients , the two latter were again feeble in their turn . /z/ THE importance of attention to the variation in fruit , wrought by a change in climate , soil , and cultivation , appears to be much underrated . While the peculiar or essential character of a variety remains unchanged , the quality , or degree of excellence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious disappointment results ; and high expectations , caused by success in one case , are defeated by different circumstances in another . Hence the necessity of understanding these modifying influences . The changes produced by climate , are greater in some classes of fruits than in others . The cherry varies bat little in character and quality ; the fine varieties originated by Thomas Andrew Knight near London , are also among the finest when removed to the northern states of America . This may be owing in part to their period of maturity , which , occurring early in summer , could not be influenced oy the length of the seasons . But with the apple , pear , and peach , the case is quite otherwise . Very few of the whole British catalogue of apples , are first in quality here . The White Astracan , an apple of high reputation in Russia , becomes very inferior in England ; and a similar loss takes place on the removal to England of some of the finest apples of Italy . Some of the best peaches in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western New York , the shorter and cooler summers of the latter region not being sufficient to give full flavor to many of the more southern varieties . American peaches taken to England lose still more . Of fifty sorts , from the middle and western states , tested at the great Chiswick garden , all but two were pronounced " worthless . " /z/ But the influence of seasons alone . produces sometimes extraordinary results . In the year 1842 , the Wurtemburg pear was regarded in western New York as the finest foreign pear among several which had then just fruited ; but the two succeeding seasons it was nearly worthless . The Bezi de la Motte , about one year in seven , in some localities , is a delicious melting pear , and at other times dry and tasteless ; in other localities , it is uniformly good . Some striking cases were mentioned by the late Robert Manning of Salem . The Beuire Duval , which has a high reputation in Europe , produced , the first year of bearing , beautiful fruit ; but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year the same tree produced fewer pears , half the size , different in shade of color , and delicious in flavor . In another case the Hericart yielded fruit which proved melting and high-flavored . The next year it not only varied in size shape , and color , but was so tasteless as to be immediately rejected . Again , the Calabash pear produced in two seasons , oblong fruit with projecting ridges , the color being bright russett , and the flesh breaking , melting , and very good . The next year the fruit was more abundant , of larger size , of a bright yellow color , without ridges , and the flesh very insipid. * But these were unusual cases . They serve to show , however , the extreme caution to be used , both in describing fruit , and deciding upon the merits of new kinds . They also show the propriety of aiming to select such as are little affected by such influences , as the Madeleine , Bartlett , and Seckel . It is this liability to change , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that varieties are worn out by old age ; but this is disproved by the fact that the same varieties flourish elsewhere with undiminished excellence ; and that some of the new sorts , when removed to ungenial localities also exhibit precisely the same symptoms of " running out " and decay.t * Hovey 's Magazine , vol. 8 , p 87. t The English Gold Pippin , which originated centuries ago , was long since cited as an example of an old and defunct variety ; while even at the presenr day , in all fnvorble soils , both in Europe and America , it flourishes MS well as ever . The Doyenn ? pear h-s been many years since , rejec'e I in some parts of New England as worthless , where it once proved fine . But as proof that this deterioration is to be ascribed to some defect in the soil , and not to the age of the variety , it needs only to be stated that m central and western New- York , it is cultivated extensively and /z/ The effect of keeping the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicious fruits , can be hardly believed by those who have only seen it on the more common varieties of the apple . " No stunted tree bears fine fruit . Even the Seckel pear , of all sorts the highest flavored , is so inferior in some situations , as to be scarcely worth gathering . Some other pears , however , lose their distinguishing traits entirely , and bear nothing suitable for human lips . Of this class has been the St. Ghislain in my grounds , where the tree stood neglected for several years , and caused me to wonder how any thing- so insipid could have passed through the hands of Robert Manning . Yet that eminent and worthy pomologist was not to blame . An accidental improvement of its condition , caused it the last season to bear excellent fruit , increased some in size , but immensely in flavor. 14 It would seem that flavor is the last touch of perfection that some pears receive ; and that if the nourishment of the tree be exhausted with their growth , so that nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless . This is not the case however with all sorts of fruit ; and exceptions may be found in the Madeleine , Seckel , and Virgalieu ; but I think we have no right to condemn any variety of the pear , until the tree has done its best that is , borne fruit in a thriving condition . " * " No estimate , " says Samuel Walker , " can be made of the true character of any fruit , more particularly of the pear , unless the specimens are fair , well grown , of full size , and quite ripe : or , in other words , in the highest state of perfection the variety will attain under the most skilful management and favorable season . Some varieties , under the care of a lover of fruits , well cultivated in a congenial soil , may be compared to ' refined gold , ' while the same variety in unskilful hands , the trees neglected , in grass land , or in wet and impoverished soil , may prove as ' dross. ' " with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all known pears . Au interesting example occurred the past season in the garden of Dr. Wendell of Albany , where trees of this variety , in soils of different qualities exhibited ail the grades of difference from blighted and worthless fruit , to rich golden specimens . Further evidence on this subject is furnished by the fact that the Beurre Diel and other sorts of quite recent origin , have in unfavorable localities already exhibited the cracked and blighted appearance falsely ascribed to old age . /z/ There was much truth in the remark of Bacon , that " the scion overruleth the stock quite , the stock being passive only . " The change which takes place when the sap is converted into the descending juices , and thence into fruit , is effected entirely by the leaves ; that is , when a pear is grafted on a quince , the entire elaboration of the juices is effected by the leaves of the pear , and the perfect fruit of the pear is the result , and not a cross or mixture of the two fruits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock might produce a distinct specific change , analogous to that in hybrids . But although one species , or even variety , can not be changed to another by the stock which supports it , a slight modifying influence may be exerted by the shade of difference between the sap of one species and that of another . The sap of the quince may exert a sensible effect , small in degree , even after it has undergone the great change which is effected by the leaves of the pear . We accordingly find some sorts of pear improved , and others deteriorated on the quince . There is doubtless an analogy in the influence exerted by different stocks , and by different soils . As the earth is colder in summer a few feet below than near the surface , it is highly probable that such soils as variously favor the downward extension of roots , may modify the character of fruits like the changes of seasons . Different trees of the same variety are known to be affected by slight shades of difference , which are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a large share of influence . This view is further indicated by the increased or diminished luxuriance of some kinds when growing in a light or . a heavy soil . Different degrees of fertility often produce material effects , both in productiveness and flavor . There is no doubt that stocks on which trees are grafted , operate in some degree in a similar way . Some , like a rich soil , assist the more rapid growth of the branches ; others , like a sterile one , retard it ; hence corresponding resalts on the fruit may be expected . Stocks may hasten or retard ripening ; they may affect the size , color , and quality of fruit . The temperature , /z/ depth , and other characters of soils may do the same . Tender kinds are made hardier on hardy stocks , not because of any specific influence , but the usual supplies of sap are imparted sooner in spring and withheld earlier in autumn , arid the tender wood has more time to mature precisely similar to the planting of tender trees on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth . Although , as a general rule , the change in quality is so small as to be rarely taken into account in practice , it is in some rare instances considerable , and is worthy of investigation and experiment . Early fruits have been sometimes retarded a few days in ripening when grafted upon late varieties of their own species , and their maturity has been hastened on early stocks . In one case , the Red Magnum Bonum plum ripened ten days earlier when grafted on the Cherry plum , a variety which matures at midsummer , dian when worked upon a late prune . In another instance , late peach stocks were found to retard a few days the sorts budded upon them. * In one instance , related by President Knight , a very marked change was effected . His garden contained two trees of the Acton Scott peach , one growing upon a stock of its own species , and the other on a plum , other circumstances being the same . The fruit of that upon the plum was larger and much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arid its flavor so inferior that he would have denied the identity of the variety had he not himself inserted the buds . Such remarkable instances are to be regarded as of very rare occurrence . Salt peaches or plums , show that foreign substances may enter the juices , and modify or change the quality of the fruit , as well as poison or induce disease in the tree . Soluble substances in the soil may thus exert a sensible influence . In the same way , the peculiar character of the sap and secretions of a stock may produce a like result . The , increased productiveness effected by dissimilar stocks , is often so great as to become a very important object in practice . " In proportion , " says Lindley , " as the soon and the stock approach each other closely in constitution , the less effect is produced by the latter ; and on the contra- /z/ ry , in proportion to the constitutional difference between the stock and the scion , is the effect of the former important . Thus , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples upon crabs , plums upon plums , and peaches upon peaches or almonds , the scion is , in regard to fertility , exactly in the same state as if it had not been grafted at all ; while on the other hand , a great increase of fertility is the result of grafting pears upon quinces , peaches upon plums , apples upon white thorn , and the like . In these latter cases , the food absorbed from the earth by the root of the stock , is communicated slowly and unwillingly to the scion ; under no circumstances is the communication between the one and the other as free and perfect as if their natures had been more nearly the same ; the sap is impeded in its ascent , and the proper juices are impeded in their descent , whence arises that accumulation of secretion which is sure to be attended with increased fertility . " This view is strongly corroborated by the striking similarity between the swollen portion of a grafted limb on a dissimilar stock , as a plum on the peach , immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ungrafted tree bound with a ligature . From the preceding remarks , we may arrive at the following conclusions : 1 . That the difference in the soluble matter contained in the sap of dissimilar stocks , may exert a modifying influence in the fruit ; and that soluble matters in the soil , or their absence , may in a slight degree do the same . 2 . That a further change is at the same time effected by increasing or lessening the supply of sap from the stock to the graft ; and that a similar change may result from a fertile or sterile soil . 3 . That both early productiveness and early maturity may be produced by a stock or a soil which lessens the luxuriance of the tree ; dwarf trees and those of old or diminished growth maturing their crops perceptibly earlier than those possessing great thriftiness and vigor . As a general rule , the influence of the stock is not to be taken into account in ordinary practice , except with kinds of very different natures . Cultivation and fertility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of climate are to be attentively observed in making a selec- /z/ tion of varieties , the improvement of those selected sorts , to the highest degree of perfection , is only to be attained by skilful culture. * /z/ When fruit is thick upon the branches , both size and flavor are diminished . Many kinds are rendered nearly worthless by overbearing . It is often observed that early apples and peaches , remaining last on the tree , are much more delicious than the earlier portions which ripened on crowded limbs . With some varieties , the effect of productiveness is so great as wholly to alter the character . A tree of the Heath Cling , before unknown to the person who raised it , bore the first year a very abundant crop ; and the fruit , which had been recommended as of great size and excellence , was small , green , with only a disagreeable , bitter taste . In the warmer and longer summer of the following year , the fruit , which had been thinned by the frost , was three inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent flavor . The importance of understanding these influences , before deciding on the quality of a new fruit , is at once evident . The advantages of pruning are to be ascribed in part to the same cause . * The influence exerted by the graft on the stock , although not strictly within the limits of thi chapter , offers an interesting subject for inquiry . The extension of the wood of the stock , by successive depositions from the leaves of the graft , and through the cellular system of the bark , so as to preserve the strict specific identity of the wood of the former , is familiar to every practical cultivator . But the graft often exerts a modifying influence . The same seedling cherry stocks , grafted with sorts of different degrees of vigor , soon vary in the amount and size of the fibrous roots . Trees of the Imperial Gage and Jefferson plum , a few feet high , when budded on the wild plum , were found to liave only half the amount of roots possessed by the unbudded stocfc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Newtovvn Pippin , " says Dr. Kirtland , " will invariably render the bark of the stock rough and black , ( the habit of the variety , ) within three years after its insertion. " /z/ THE SOIL for fruit trees , as well as for farm crops , should be of good quality . Whatever will produce a vigorous growth of corn and potatoes , will in general be the best for fruit trees . Sterile soil is unfavorable for both ; but doubly so for the latter , for while it only lessens in quantity the growth of farm crops , it lessens the quantity and greatly injures the quality of fruit . Good soils vary in many particulars ; but as a general rule , one which is dry , firm , mellow , and fertile , is well suited to the cultivation of fruit trees . It should be deep , to allow the extension of the roots ; dry , or else well drained , to prevent injury from stagnant water below the surface ; firm , and not peaty or spongy , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , which would not be much benefitted , for all decidedly hardy kinds , as the apple and pear , by good manuring . Shallow soils should be loosened deeply by heavy furrows and manure ; or if the whole surface can not be thus treated , a strip of ground eight feet wide , where the row of trees is to stand , should be rendered in this way deep and fertile for their growth . The manure should be very thoroughly intermixed with the soil by repeated harrowings . An admirable method of deepening soils for the free admission of the fine fibrous roots , is first , to loosen it as deeply as practicable with the subsoil plow ; and then to trench-plow this deeply loosened bed for the intermixture of manure . The previous subsoiling admits the trench-plow to a greater depth than could be attained without its aid . The only trees which will not bear a high fertility , are those brought originally from warmer countries , and liable to suffer from the frost of winter ; as /z/ the peach , nectarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late in the season , and frost strikes them when the wood is immature . It however happens , in the ordinary practice of the country , that where one peach or apricot tree is injured by too rich a cultivation , more than a hundred suffer by diminished growth from neglect . Clayey and light soils in some cases require opposite management . The former , for instance , is much benefited by the admixture of chip-dirt , which renders it looser , lighter , and more retentive of moisture . But on light soils the effect is not so beneficial , and is sometimes positively injurious. * Peaty and spongy soil ? are particularly injurious to tender fruits . Such soils become very warm by day , and radiate the heat rapidly in clear frosty nights ; hence peaches and apricots generally perish when growing in them , the heat of the sun promoting a rapid succulent growth , which is the more easily destroyed by the succeeding intensity of cold . /z/ Besides the more common and universal ingredients of soils , sand and clay there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important of these are potash , lime , and phosphate of lime . Now , whatever earthy ingredients are found in the wood , bark , and fruit of trees , must be derived from the soil ; and if the soil in which they are planted does not contain all these ingredients , the trees can not flourish . It therefore becomes vitally important to supply such deficiencies by the applica'ion of the particular or specific manure needed . But it is not to be expected that cultivators generally will be able to analyze their variously differing soils , nor to procure it done by a skilful chemist . t The next thing , then , * A great deal of m s ' ; ; ! de-stand ng has arisen from an indefinite u-e of terms .

If it is found that a particular species contains an unusual quantity of some certain ingredient , we may safely conclude that such ingredient should be largely supplied as a manure . As instances , analysis has shown that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of 100 parts each of earthy ingredients , the following proportions of potash , lime , and j-hosphate of lime : * Pear . Sap-wood . Bark . Potash 22 6 Lime 13 SO Phosphate of lime 27 6 Apple . Potash 16 5 Lime 19 51 Phosphate of lime 17 3 Grape . Potash 21 2 Lime 17 39 Phosphate of lime 15 5 The proportions of these ingredients , although not exceeding the quantities found in sume other plants , are so large as to show conclusively the importance of a proper supply in the soil . They already exist in all soils adapted to the growth of fruit trees ; but their small amount in particular localities , from natural deficiency , or from long cultivation , may render their application a matter of the greatest importance . Such application may b- partially made by common yard manure , which contains them in considerable proportions ; but wood ashes , in which they mostly exist in large quantities , will furnish them more freely and with a more speedy effect ; as from the large proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth or even a irace of plxwphates when 100 grains , and afterwards IOO grains , of the soil wereor.erritfti upon , and it was only when 1000 prams were ued. thai a fiv  --  thu*iudtft part w-i delft-red Yet this minute proportion is equal to about ten cubic feet per acre vMh a depth of one foot , and supplies the necessary ingredient for heavy crops . /z/ surfeit would result from its abundant and exclusive application , an evil in no wise resulting from the use of ashes . But over-doses , even of these , should be avoided . The large proportion of lime in the wood an.d bark of the apple , indicates its value as a manure for this fruit ; we accordingly find that leached ashes , which contain much lime , are eminently useful . Leached as well as unleached ashes may indeed be applied with great advantage to nearly all fruit trees . Bones contain much phosphate of lime , and , pulverized , they would undoubtedly in many cases produce an excellent effect on the pear , and other species . Iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark of trees ; yet the speedy restoration from pale and sickly to deep green and luxuriant foliage , by its application to the roots in some instances , proves that however small its proportion may be , its presence is essential . An interesting experiment is stated in the Horticulturist , * upon a large pear tree , bearing blighted , cracked and worthless fruit , which resulted in its perfect restoration to health , and the production of smooth and fair crops . This change was affected by digging , three feet distant from the tree , a circular trench four feet wide and twenty inches deep ; filling this with fresh , rich soil and turf , and intermingling two bushels of scoriae from a blacksmith 's forge , two bushels of charcoal , and two pounds of potash . The fresh soil and potash , doubtless contributed largely to success . Other experiments of a similar character have been equally successful . Dr. Kirtland states that orchards on the limestone hills of Ohio , invariably afford the best apples a remark fully corroborated by other observations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success with specific manures : his pear trees on worn out land , made but two to six inches growth in a single season , and the fruit was blighted , knotted , and deficient in flavor . They soon began to exhibit evidences of disease and old age . An analysis of the soil was made by Dr. Emmons , indicating its deficiencies . Dressings of phosphate of lime , in pulverised bones , ashes , and barn-yard manure , with a limited supply of common salt , effected a complete renovation. /z/ The subject of special manures is destined to become one of great interest to cultivators . It is yet in its infancy . Many years of careful experiment , guided by patient and laborious analysis , can only carry it forward to maturity . But in the meantime , enough is known to enable orchardists to operate in many instances with great advantage . Not always knowing the deficient ingredient , they may not at once apply the precise remedy . But there are some manures that can never do injury , that will usually be highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivators to experiment with these , the following excellent practical hints are given from the Horticulturist , from the pen of A. J. Downing , its editor : " For old apple orchards , upon soil deficient in lime , we would recommend a top-dressing of lime for the first time of 200 bushels to the acre . This will , usually , if the land is in good condition , bring the trees into good bearing condition again . In some soils , the effects will be immediate , and in others it will require one or two seasons for the lime to produce its effect. * " For middle sized bearing trees , a peck of air-slaked lime to each tree , is sufficient . It is , perhaps , best applied in the autumn , but it will answer very well in the spring . Scatter it evenly over the surface of the ground , as far as the roots extend . It may be ploughed or hoed under slightly , or left upon the surface , as it will find its way downwards in the soil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a soil not calcareous , and not naturally congenial to the tree , it should be dressed with lime , and with ashes , every alternate autumn , and manured every other spring . The same quantity of spent ashes as of lime , may be used for each tree . " For the pear tree , we prefer the following compost . Take a wagon load of peat , or black swamp earth dissolve 20 Ibs. of potash in water , and water the peat thoroughly with the liquid . Let it lie a couple of days , and it is fit for use . Or , for the same quantity of peat , use one-third of a load of leached wood ashes , ( or ten bushels of fresh ashes , ) /z/ mixing the whole , and letting it lie a fortnight before usingit . Give each middle sized bearing tree , a bushtl of this compost annually ; a newly planted young tree , half a peck , and others in this proportion . If this compost is applied in the spring , the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily obtained , in the autumn , at the /ate of half a peck to a tree . " The same compost , and the same quantities , will answer admirably for the grape vine . But as the grape is a strong feeder , and likes more lime than the pear , we would give it besides , an autumnal coat of lime , at the rate of from 50 to 100 bushels to the acre , applied along with any manure or compost most easily obtained . " For the plum tree , in light soils , ( there is little or nu difficulty in growing it in clay soils , ) we would recommend a com.post , made as follows : To two wagon loads of strong loam , or yellow clay , add a bushel of cheap salt and four bushels of lime . Mix the whole thoroughly ; suffering it to lie at least a fortnight . Apply this as a top layer or top dressing to the soil directly under plum trees , ( spreading it over the surface as far as the branches extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle sized bearing tree , or half a peck to a young , newly planted tree . " As a general compost for fruit trees , we repeat , that nothing is equal to that formed of ashes and peat . These materials are easily obtained in all parts of the country , and they contain the elements most essential in the organic and inorganic structure of fruit trees . Where peat is not at hand , use wood ashes alone , at the rate of half a bushel of leached ashes to each middle sized bearing fruit tree . But as ashes furnish only the mineral or inorganic elements of food , the usual supply of ordinary manure must not be withheld , unless the soil is already sufficiently rich . " /z/ After a suitable soil is obtained , hardy trees , such as the apple , will usually succeed in almost any situation . But with tender fruits , as the peach and apricot , the case is very different . In many localities in the northern states , they are soon destroyed by the severity of winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , crops are not /z/ yk-lded oftener than once in two years . But some situations ur. - so favorable , that a failure scarcely ever occurs . In planti.igr out tender fruits , it is consequently very desirable to know what p aces will prove the best . Even the apple , in regions where the winters are rigorous , is sometimes destroyed by frost , and in some very unfavorable places rarely escapes . It is familiar to many cultivators , that warm , low valleys are more subject to night-frosts , than more elevated localities . Objects at the surface of the earth become chilled by the radiation of heat to the cold and clear sky above , and they cool by contact the surrounding air , which thus becoming heavier , rolls down the sides of declivities and settles Ike the waters of a lake , in the lowest troughs . This coldness is further increased by the stillness of those sheltered places favoring the more rapid cooling , by radiation of the exposed surfaces ; while on hills the equilibrium is partially restored by currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , rich , and sheltered places , is more luxuriant , and wood less ripened , and hence particularly liable to injury from frost . The mucky soil of Tallies radiates heat rapidly from its surface . The warmth of low places , during the mild weather , often occurring in winter , often swells fruit-buds , and succeeding cold destroys them . On more elevated lands , vegetation escapes all these disastrous influences . The existence of colder air in valleys , on still , clear nights , is often plainly observed in riding over a rolling or broken face of country . The thermometer has often shown a difference of several degrees between a creek bottom and a neighboring hill not fifty feet high . A striking proof was exhibited a few years since , after a severe night-frost early in summer . The young and succulent leaves of the hickory were but partially expanded ; and where the trees btood in a valley , twenty feet deep , all the leaves had been . frosted , and were black and dead , up to the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of this lake of cold air , were fresh and green . In the winter of 1845-6 , when the cold on a clear night sunk the thermometer several degrees below zero , after the /z/ peach buds had been swelled by a few warm days , trees which stood on a hill thirty feet higher than the neighboring creek valley , lost nine-tenths of their blossoms , while on another hill sixty feet high , nine-tenths escaped . The lake of cold air which covered the top of the smaller hill did not reach the summit of the larger . The cultivation of the peach is rarely attempted in the southern tier of counties in the state of New- York . Proofs are not wanting , however , that it might be entirely successful on selected ground . In the valley of the Conhocton , which is flanked by hills 500 feet high , peach trees have been completely killed to the ground . But on one of the neighboring hills , 500 feet above , and probably 1,200 feet above the level of the sea , an orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Spencer , Tioga county , near the head of Cayuga inlet , peaches have withstood the climate and done well , at an elevation of 700 feet above Cayuga lake . In the northeastern part of Pennsglvania , probably 1200 or 1500 feet above the level of the ocean , in the summer of 1835 , after one of the severest winters for twenty years , the only two peach trees observed in travelling many miles , were full of peaches ; while after the same winter , a large tree in Stroudsburg valley , was noticed killed quite down to the ground . While those hills are usually covered with snow throughout the winter , and vegetation consequently remains uniformly dormant , the valleys are subjected to occasional thaws , and are more un favorable to tender vegetation . These cases show the importance of elevated sites . A dry , firm soil , is however , of great consequence . The in fluence of a compact knoll , rising but slightly above the rest of the field , has been observed to save from frost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mucky of spongy portions of the rest of the field , radiating heat more freely , the crop has been destroyed . Cultivators of drained swamps have found it necessary to plant such lands with tender crops two or three weeks later than the usual period on upland . The successful cultivation of the peach and the grape , on the gently swelling hills called mounds , in the in the western prairies , while the crops are destroyed on the adjacent dark and porous soils of the plains , affords ano- /z/ ther example . In Lycoming county , Pa. , on the banks of the Loyalsock , a creek so rapid that no muck is deposited , but fine dry soil , peaches have been raised , though the cold is often intense. * Sometimes the effect of unfavorable soil more than overbalances that of situation . In some of the hilly parts of western New- York , where the highest land is peaty , spongy , or springy , and the valleys dry and firm , the latter are found best for the peach . " Some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation is high and airy , peach trees of the best bearing kinds planted there , have always been unproductive . " ! The preceding facts furnish strong reasons for believing , that in large portions of the northern states , where the cultivation of the peach has been entirely relinquished in consequence of the only attempts made having been in the warm vallies , abundant crops might be regularly obtained by a proper selection of soil and locality . Even much further south , the occasional destruction of tender fruits , points out the great importance of careful attention to situation . The death by frost of large orange trees in Florida in 1835 , proves that all parts of the country are liable to such disasters , and that no means of prevention are to be overlooked . Occasionally crops are saved by the artificial application of a remedy , which may be briefly glanced at in connection with this subject . In one case , a bank of snow covering the lower limb of a peach tree , saved the fruit , while all on the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peach trees close along the north side of a fence , where snowdrifts lay , were more fruitful than the other trees . Hence the practice of piling snow round them has been recommended , and in some cases practiced with success . It can not be considered infallible in any situation . It is only useful where a slight reduction of temperature is sufficient to prevent the starting of the buds . We can easily conceive such a time , when a part of the buds start , and a part do not . In one season , the lower buds on the tree , which re- J The skilful cultivator , as he values the size and quality of his fruit , will rendily distinguish between a rich soil consisting chiefly of spongy muck and peat , and a dry and firm soil rendered fertile by a due admixture of these substances , and potash , lime , and good manure . t D. Thomas , Traas . N. Y State Ag . Society , vol . I. /z/ ceived the reflected heat from the ground , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tops of the trees were not injured . It is evident that a very slight depression of temperature would have been sufficient to have prevented the lower buds from starting . But the warmth may be so great , either late in autumn or in mid-winter , that no check of the kind would be sufficient . It has often been observed that woods or thick trees , buildings , high board fences , or steep hills , on the east side of peach orchards , protect the crop . Hence the erroneous opinion , that it is the east wind , which does the damage . It is the sunshine upon the frozen buds which destroys them ; hence , a clouded sky after a clear frosty night , by preventing sudden thawing , sometimes saves a crop . Covering trees of rare kinds with mats , to shade them from the morning sun , after an intensely frosty night , might - sometimes be highly beneficial . Influence of deep Lakes and , Hirers . Large bodies of unfreezing water in the bottoms of valleys , will reverse some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters are peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of tender fruits . They soften the severity of the cold , by the large and warmer surface constantly presented ; on the other hand , they chill the dangerous warm air which starts the buds in winter ; and they afford great protection by the screen of fog which they spread before the morning sun . Along the borders of the lower parts of the Hudson , and on the banks of the Cayuga and Seneca lakes , tender fruit trees often afford abundant crops , while the same kinds are destroyed only two or three miles distant . Along the southern shore of Lake Ontario , the peach crop scarcely ever fails , and the softening influence of that large body of unfreezing water , extends many miles into the interior . /z/ The skilful cultivator , after having prepared his ground , procured the best trees the country affords , carefully transplanted them , and watched over them , and given them careful and laborious attention for years , feels a very natural desire to partake of their fruits . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless his fruit garden is protected /z/ from idle boys ' rambles . It can not be concealed that our country is rather remarkable for its fruit pilferers . It is feared it will continue to be so , until public opinion shall place the young man who steals a pocket-book , and the depredator of fine fruit , which has cost the owner as much care and labor , and which money can not replace , on precisely the same level. * This formidable evil has deterred many from planting fruit-gardens . The most quiet and secure protection is afforded by a good thorn hedge . The English hawthorn , far to the north , will generally succeed quite well for this purpose ; the Washington and Newcastle thorns are less liable to disaster from drouth and hot summers , and the attacks of insects ; but the Buckthorn , which gradually thickens in ermour as it becomes older , appears to be the only perfectly hardy and reliable hedge plant for severe climates . The Osage Orange , however , where the winters are not too cold , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorns render it perfectly impassable . It is sufficiently hardy in all places where the peach crop generally escapes . Further north than 41 or 4J degrees of latitude , it can not be expected to succeed in low valleys ; but on elevated ground , the winter-killing of its smaller shoots , vill only tend to thicken it below , like trimming with shears . The Michigan rose , in connexion with a high beard or picket fence , which it has covered and interlaced , has been found an effectual protection to a fruit garden . It grows as freely from layers and cuttings as the grape vine . * " The native fruit of a thickly populated country , growing without culture and free for all , has doubtless had its share in producing this laxity of morals .

Society , Vol. 1 , p. 223. /z/ NEARLY every fruit tree must at some period be removed from the nursery , and transplanted into the orchard or garden . When it is remembered that in a large number of instances , where hastily performed , the trees perish from the act ; and that in a still larger number , including a great majority , a severe check is given to their growth , it needs no argument to show the importance of transplanting well . This removal is from necessity , an act of violence . As frequently performed , it is so severe that it either results in death , or a lingering recovery . But with the skilful operator , the rigor of the operation may be so softened , as to be not only attended with perfect safety to the tree , but with scarcely an abatement in the thriftiness of its growth . It may indeed sometimes happen , that careless management from an accidental combination of favorable causes , is followed with success . The entire failure of similar treatment in other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish the object , with the same certainty that cause is followed by effect . The most skilful cultivators , who have the whole operation at their control , never expect to , and actually do not , lose one tree in a thousand . Taking up the tree , and shortening - in . Every person , about to transplant a tree , should remember that the roots and the leaves both perform very important offices , the one constantly dependent on the other . The first collects food for the tree ; the other elaborates and prepares this food for use . Without the roots , the leaves and rest of the tree perish . Without the leaves , the root can not grow , and eventually dies . It is obvious that if a tree could be removed with all its roots , including all the numerous thread-like radicles , and /z/ placed in its new situation precisely as it stood before , it would suffer no check in growth . The nearer then , we can approach this , the greater will be our success . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention must accordingly be directed to the roots . The spade should be set into the earth at a distance from the tree , and ihe whole carefully lifted , not forcibly withdrawn , from the soil . Or , so much of the earth should be separated in a circle by the spade , that when the tree is withdrawn , a large portion of the soil may be lifted with it with the small fibres. * The roots of a young tree usually extend in a circle quite equal to its height ; the workman , therefore , who cuts off all within six inches of a tree which is itself eight feet high , deprives it of a large portion of its means of sustenance . In the annexed figure , a indicates the trunk of the tree ; bb the circle of roots cut off with the spade in a hasty removal ; and without this circle , the rest of the roots which are left in the earth . Fig. 35 . But in ordinary , or even very careful practice , a part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . It is evident then , that the usual supplies of sap to the leaves must be in part cut off . Now the leaves are constantly ( during day ) throwing off insensible moisture into the air ; and good sized trees thus give off daily , many pounds . Reduce the supply from below , and the leaves can not flourish ; and if the reduction is severe , the tree withers and dies . The remedy consists in lessening the number of leaves , * Some cultivators have adopted the opinion that the small fibres are unimportant , and may be cut off without lessening the chances of growing . But this can only be true with very small trees or seedlings , which quickly reproduce a multitude of small roots , after the top is removed for the insertion of a graft ; or where the fibres of larger trees have been killed by exposure after removal , and which are followed by a necessary lopping of the branches . /z/ so as to correspond with the diminished supply . This may be done in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous year , to one quarter of its length , and in extreme cases , every shoot may be shortened back to one lud , just above the previous year 's wood . The other mode , attended with more labor , but preserving the full size of the head , is to leave all the shoots entire , and remove every alternate bud , leaving the terminals , or remove two-thirds or three-quarters of the buds in the same way . Neither of these modes can in the least degree destroy the natural symmetry of the tree . Cutting off large branches at random often quite spoils the shape . Fi 36 Fi s- 37 Fig. 36 , represents an unpruned tree , and fig. 37 , the same with the shoots shortened back . Where peach and other trees have been once a year trimmed up to a single stem , while in the nursery , the mode of shortening is shown by figs. 38 and 39 . A few experiments only are needed to convince any one of the advantages of thus cutting in the shoots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplanted 180 apple trees into good mellow soil . The roots had been cut rather short in digging . One-half had their tops shortened back , so as to leave only one bud of the previous season 's wood ; the heads of the other half were suffered to remain untouched . The season Fig. 38 . Fig. 39. p rove d favorable . Of the ninety which had their heads pruned , only two died , and nearly all made fine shoots , many being eighteen inches long . Of the ninety unpruned , eight died ; most of them made but little growth , and none more than six inches . Both the first and /z/ second year , the deep green and luxuriant foliage of the pruned trees afforded a strong contrast with the paler and more feeble appearance of the other. * A similar experiment was made with 78 peach trees , of large size , three years ' growth from the bud . One-half were headed back so as to reduce the buds one-half ; the rest were unpruned . The season was rather dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of those which were headed back . The unpruned , which survived , lost parts or the whole of the upper portions of their branches ; the pruned , made fine bushy heads of new shoots. * It has been found useful to shorten in the shoots of peach trees so severely as to reduce the heads to only one quarter of the original number of buds . This was tried with great success the past season . Trees , only one year 's growth from the bud , transplanted in the usual manner unpruned , were placed side by side with others of four years ' growth , and with trunks an inch and a half in diameter , the heads being pruned to one quarter their size . The growth of the former was feeble ; the large trees , with pruned heads grew vigorously . Again , trees set out before the buds had opened , and without pruning , presented a more feeble growth than others removed when the leaves were an inch long , with a copious shortening-in of the branches . The degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much on climate . In the cool moist atmosphere of England , the leaves perspire less , and a larger number may remain without exhausting the supply from the roots . In this country , the perspiration is more rapid , and fewer leaves can be fed , until new roots furnish increased supplies . But in no case should the lopping be excessive ; for as the reproduction of roots depends upon the action of the leaves , a disproportionately small number of the latter , would fail to produce a speedy renewal of the former . And especially , no one should unnecessarily mutilate the roots , with the hope that lopping the head will remedy the evil ; for it rarely happens , that with the most careful digging , more than one half the entire amount of roots will be secured , which would in that case , require the removal Hort. , Vol . II. , p. 319. /z/ of at least half the head . A badly mutilated root may be saved alive , by a severe lopping of the shoots ; but it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine large mass of uninjured fibres . Trees which quickly reproduce new shoots , as the peach , may be more closely shortened back than others having a less reproductive power , as the apple . The cherry throws out a new growth still more reluctantly , and hence more care is needed in digging up the roots entire . A very mistaken notion prevails with many who purchase trees for orchards , that the most important requisite is to obtain large straight stems and handsome heads , while the condition of the roots is regarded as entirely subordinate . It is far preferable that the limbs be mutilated than the roots ; for though the tree may have a bad appearance when first transplanted , well preserved roots will soon restore the loss . 1 Preparing the ground and manuring . Ground intended for trees must be secure from danger of being flooded in wet seasons , and from all liability of becoming watersoaked beneath the surface . If not naturally dry enough , it must be thoroughly underdrained . The next requisite , and it is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by trenching . In the garden this is done with the spade ; but in the open orchard , it is cheaply and thoroughly effected , by first loosening the earth to a depth of at least twenty inches with a subsoil plow . Next , to intermix the whole loosened bed of soil thoroughly together , it is trench-plowed . It would be impossible to attain this depth with a common plow , without previous subsoiling ; and subsoiling fails to accomplish a proper admixture without trenching . Manure is to be applied in sufficient quantity to render the whole fertile ; the amount to be graduated by the character of the ground . Trenching or deepening must in no case be omitted ; for if the soil is exhausted , if it is poor , if liable to suffer from drouth , it is a remedy which applies in all cases . If this deepening and enriching cultivation can be continued for a year or two , in connexion with root crops , before planting , the ground will be brought to the finest condition . /z/ In setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deepened , a strip of land ten feet wide extending across the orchard , may be treated in the same way , in the centre of which each row is to be set ; and the intermediate spaces , constituting two-thirds or more of the whole , may be prepared afterwards , by the time the roots have passed the boundaries of the first . Now , when it is recollected that a good orchard is worth annually a hundred dollars per acre , and that this thorough preparation will bring trees into plentiful bearing , in connexion with good subsequent culture , in one third of the time required where trees are crowded into small holes in hard ground , it must be perfectly plain to every one that the former is by far the cheaper treatment . Where , from any unavoidable cause , trench-plowing can not be accomplished , the holes should be seven or eight feet in diameter , and from one and a half to two feet deep . The earth should be mixed with a liberal allowance of well-rotted manure , or still better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting of two or three parts of muck or peat , one of barn manure , and a fifth part of leached ashes . This is indeed an excellent manure for fruit trees in all cases with ordinary soils . If the subsoil is sterile , it should be scattered back out of the way . In rare cases , where rotted manure or compost is not at hand , and it becomes necessary to use fresh manure , it must be thoroughly incorporated with an iron rake into the soil , and this mixture not placed in contact with the roots but at such a distance that they may not reach it till after some months of growth , when it will have become well combined with the soil . One quarter manure will be an abundant proportion in any case . Preparing the roots . Before a tree is set in the earth , ail the bruised or wounded parts , where cut with the spade , should be pared off smoothly , to prevent decay , and to enable them to heal over by granulations during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed of mud , which will coat every part over evenly , and leave no portion in contact with air , which accidentally might not be reached by the earth in filling the hole . The bed of mud /z/ is quickly made by pouring into a hole a pail of water , and mixing it with the soil . Setting the tree . It should not be set deeper than it stood before removal . Deep planting injures the tree , and when excessive , may cause its death . Setting it upon the surface of the ground without any hole , and placing a bed of fine earth upon the roots to the usual depth , is preferable , and on shallow or unprepared soils , or such as are quite clayey and rather wet , has been quite successful . When placed in the unfilled hole , if it is found to be too deeply sunk , a mound or hillock is to be made under the centre , to raise it sufficiently , and the roots separated and extended to their full length . Fine rich mould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to fill all the interstices , and using the fingers to spread out all the fibres during the operation . The mellow earth should rise two or three inches above the surrounding surface , to allow for its subsequent settling . In nearly all soils , the use of water insetthng the earth among the roots will be found eminently serviceable . Dashing in a few quarts before the hole is quite filled , is the more common way : but an admirable mode is to settle the fine earth as it is constantly sifted in , by a regular shower from a watering pot , one man holding the tree , a second filling in the earth , and the third applying the water . By this process the roots are not disturbed in their position , and every cavity about them is filled in the most perfect manner . The trees will be found to maintain their position better than vvher pulverised earth alone is used ; for although it may at first be easily moved while surrounded by the half liquid mass ; in a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will become as firm as when it has stood for weeks in its new position . Stiffening against the wind . Newly planted /z/ trees , being acted on as levers by the wind , often press aside the earth about their stems , and make an opening down to the roots , which in consequence suffer from both drouth and disturbance . There are two ways to prevent this disaster . In autumn transplanting , the Fig. 4u. best way is to embank a mound of earth about /z/ the stems , from ten to eighteen inches high , as the size of the tree may require , fisr. 40 . This mound performs the triple ofice of stiffening the tree , excluding mice , and covering the roots from frost . Only a few seconds are required to throw up one of these conical heaps of earth . After the tree commences growing , the mounds are removed . Trees which have had their heads lightened by the shortening process , already described , will not often need any other protection . But when the trees are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . If driven before the roots are covered , they may be erect , as in fig. 41 ; if driven afterwards , they may be slanting ; and in both cases , straw bands should be first wrapped once round , to prevent the trees from chafing Watering . A very common error is the belief that trees need frequent watering before they are in leaf . Deluging the roots , while in a partially dormant state , is as hurtful to trees as to greenhouse plants , and a continued repetition of it is almost certain death . When a plant is in a state of rapid vegetation , large quantities of moisture are drawn up by the leaves and thrown off ' , but while the buds are unexpanded , the amount consumed is very small . Fruit trees sometimes remain with fresh and green branches , but with unswollen buds , till midsummer . Instead of watering such at the roots , let the tops be wet daily at evening , with a watering pot , and it will in nearly all cases bring them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to the watering , will be found beneficial . The following successful treatment in transplanting , in cases that appeared almost hopeless , was practiced by the late S. G. Perkins , of Boston : " Some ten years ago , I imported from Paris two hundred and ten pear trees on quince stocks , whose roots , on their arrival , I found to be entirely black and dead . I shaved off with a drawing knife all the roots down to the stump . These I planted in trenches , tying them to cross-bars to keep them firm , and then filled up the trench with good soil . The heads and bodies of these trees were regularly washed in dry weather until they began to sprout which most of them /z/ did in abundance during the summer , and I finally saved oul of the whole number , one hundred and seventy-four , which became as well rooted and as good trees as any in mj garden . " This has happened more than once . Three or four years ago , I imported among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high , the heads of which had been budded the previous - year in France . These buds had grown from nine to twelve inches long , and were perfectly fresh when they arrived ; but the roots on examination were found entirely dead . Two of these I gave away . One was good for nothing , and the other seventeen I planted in my garden , having cut out all the roots that had fibers , they being entirely dead . One of my men said I might as well plant my walking stick . Sixteen of these are now flourishing trees , well grown and well rooted , new roots being induced by means of washing the upper part of the tree . " Watering the roots , even of fast growing trees , will rarely become needful if the soil is deep and is kept mellow But whenever it is performed , the surface earth should be thrown off , the water poured in , and the earth replaced . This will admit the water at once to the roots , and leave the surface mellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water will perhaps fail to reach the dry soil below , but only serve to harden and bake the surface . Mulching , or covering the ground about the tree with straw , coarse barn-yard litter , or , what is still better , leaves from the woods , will in nearly all cases obviate the necessity of watering . It is an excellent protection against mid-summer drouths , which so often prove destructive to newly transplanted trees , after they have appeared in leaf . A correspondent of the Horticulturist , mulched 50 trees out of 150 , all of which had commenced growth alike . Those which were mulched , all lived . Of the hundred not mulched , fifteen perished . The weather was hot and dry at midsummer . Trees received from a distance , and injured by drying , should immediately have their roots coated by immersion in a bed of mud ; and then the whole stems and branches buried in moderately moist earth for a few days . They will gradually absorb moisture , through the pores in the bark , and re- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes practiced , is more liable x to induce decay by water-soaking . Season for transplanting . Much discussion has arisen on the relative advantages of autumn and spring transplanting . When the work is well done , both are successful . For apple and other hardy trees , autumn is perhaps the best , as the soil becomes well settled about the roots , and the trees commence growing without interruption in spring. * The more tender trees , as apricots and peaches , removed to a colder region , may be in more danger , especially if the roots have been much mutilated and the setting out badly done . A neighbor purchased fifty peach trees in the autumn , and lost half of them the following severe winter ; another bought fifty the next spring , and . lost only one . Was this a conclusive proof that spring planting was best ? By no means ; for in the former case they were set out in grass land , and received no culture ; in the latter , they had the best care . The same autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while the same spring another lost most of his by neglect . We may hence infer that good management is of incomparably more importance than the season of the year.t But there are many things to be taken into account in drawing conclusions . It has been remarked that tender trees taken to a colder climate may be in danger of winter frosts . Good , thrifty , and well ripened wood , however , where the trees have grown on high , dry , firm soil , even from a warmer region of country , are much safer than trees of succulent growth and badly ripened wood , from a colder . So again , trees equally hardy , might perish when set out on a low , sheltered place , or on a wet soil , while they would endure the severest rigors of our winters on a drier and more elevated piece of ground . Again , success has sometimes attended careless transplanting ; while on the other hand , the greatest care has * The remark of Dr. Lindley that early fall transplanting is decidedly best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequent establishment of the tree in the soil before winter , though applicable to the moist climate and long mild autumns of England , is not so here where the growth while it lasts is more rapid , its cessation more sudden , and the dryness of the air unfavorable to removal before growth ceases . /z/ resulted in loss . In the first instance , the trees may have been in the best condition , the roots uninjured , the soil just right , and every attending circumstance favorable . In the other , every thing may have been done right , but some accidental disaster proved ruinous . A neighbor , as an instance , set out several peach trees in autumn in the best manner j but his soil was low , and became soaked with water in winter , causing their death . Removal from high and exposed , to low and frosty ground , or the reverse , may often influence the result . Even a wet subsoil , where the surface has been dry , has destroyed tender trees in winter , as the apricot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy clay , and holds water like a tub , tender trees are in great danger from autumn transplanting , unless provision is made for draining the holes ; which may be effected by running a deep furrow from one hole to the other , along the line of trees , and using brush , cornstalks , or straw , as a temporary underdrain for the water to soak away . As a general rule , the proper season for the removal of trees is at any period between the cessation of growth in autumn , usually a little later than mid-autumn in the northern states , and its recommencement in spring . The earlier in spring the better ; but if deferred till the buds are much swollen , the roots should be coated immediately with mud , and kept moist till again set out . Transplanting may be performed in winter , whenever the ground is open , and the air above freezing ; but roots which are frozen while out the ground , will perish unless they are buried before thawing . When it becomes necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are received from a distance , the roots may be placed sloping in a trench on a dry spot of ground , and fine earth thoroughly sprinkled in among them , filling up all interstices ; and if theyare of tender kinds , one-half of the stems may be covered with earth . Trees are often badly kept from neglect to fill up the cavities , which may be prevented by dashing in water , as in transplanting. * If received late in autumn , after having /z/ been frozen , the roots should be buried as speedily as possible before thawing takes place , the gradual abstraction of the frost by the soil being perfectly safe , in the same way that it takes place every spring when the frozen roots of standing trees are thawed with the thawing of the ground . The size for transplanting , must vary with circumstances . Six to seven feet high is large enough under ordinary circumstances , but those much larger may be successfully removed if they have been previously prepared by shortening the long roots to induce the emission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem . This is done one year previou-ly , by running a spade into the earth in a circle about the foot of the stem , if the tree yet stands in the nursery , or by cutting a circular trench around the tree if it is a large standard in open ground . Trees not over four or five feet high would usually succeed best with the usual hasty mode of digging , as a proper balance between the top and the root would be more nearly preserved , the danger of dying would be lessened , and the vigor of growth being less checked , they would as soon attain a bearing state . On a review of the essential requisites for successful transplanting , they may be summed up briefly as follows : 1 . A previous preparation of a rich deep bed of mellow earth to receive the roots , and land which can not be water-soaked. 2 . Removing the tree with as little mutilation of the roots as practicable . 3 . Paring off the bruised parts . 4 . Shortening-in the head , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary loss of roots . 5 . Immersing the roots in mud . 6 . Settling the earth with water . 7 . Planting no deeper than before . 8 . Staking or embanking to prevent injury by the wind , 9 . Watering the stems and branches only , before the appearance of the leaf . 10 . Mulching , where danger of mid-summer drouth is feared . they should happen to be frozen . In addition to this , they should be copiously packed in ii . imp moss , which retains moisture a longtime , and does not heat . For seavoyages , however , the moss should not be damp , as the sea- lir will preserve the requisite degree of humidity , which otherwise would be excessive and injurious . /z/ THE cultivator , having transplanted his trees in the best manner , and secured them from disaster by every means which skill can devise , has a still more important task yet to perform , the cultivation of the soil . It is more important , because it is not commenced and finished in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ordinary practice it receives greater neglect . For , of the thousands of trees which are every year transplanted in all parts of the country , the assertion may be made with safety , that more are lost from neglected after-culture than from all other causes put together . To purchase and set out fine fruit trees of rare sorts , in a baked and hardened soil , whose entire moisture and fertility are consumed by a crop of weeds and grass , might very aptly and without exaggeration be compared to the purchase of a fine horse , and then perpetually to exclude him from food and drink . Here is the great and fatal error with a large portion who attempt the cultivation of fruit . We may not incorrectly divide these into three classes : 1 . Those who , having procured their trees , destroy them at once by drying them in the sun or wind , or freezing them in the cold , before setting out . 2 . Those who destroy them by crowding the roots into small holes cut out of a sod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunted and feeble existence , like the half-starved cattle of a neglectful farmer . 3 . Others set them out well , and then consider their labors as having closed . They are subsequently suffered to become choked with grass , weeds , or crops of grain some live and linger , others die under the hardship ; or else are demolished by cattle , or broken down by the team which cultivates the ground . /z/ A neighbor purchased fifty very fine peach trees , handsomely rooted , and of vigorous growth ; they were well set out in a field containing a fine crop of heavy clover and timothy . The following summer was dry ; and a luxuriant growth of meadow grass nearly obscured them from sight . What was the consequence ? Their fate was precisely what every farmer would have predicted of as many hills of corn , planted and overgrown in a thick meadow , very few survived the first year . Another person bought sixty , of worse quality in growth ; he set them out well , and kept them well hoed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cultivate them with low hoed crops , they now afford yearly loads of rich peaches . Another neighbor procured fifty good trees . Passing his house the same year late in summer , he remarked , " I thought a crop of wheat one of the best for young peach trees ? " " Just the reverse ; it is one of the worst all sown crops are injurious ; all low hoed ones beneficial . " 14 Well , " answered he , " I have found it so my fifty trees all lived it is true , but I have lost one year of their growth by my want of knowledge . " On examination , they were found in excellent soil , and had been well set out . All the rows were in a field of wheat , except one which was hoed with a crop ofpotatoes . The result was striking . Of the trees that stood among the wheat , some had made shoots the same year , an inch long , some two inches , and a very few , five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one that grew with the potatoes , new shoots a foot and a half could be found , and on some the growth had been two feet , two and a half , and three feet . Other cases have furnished nearly as decisive contrasts . An eminent cultivator of fine fruit , whose trees have borne for many years , remarks : " My garden would be worth twice as much as it is , if the trees had been planted in thick rows two rods apart so that I could have cultivated them with the plow . Unless fruit grows on thrifty trees , we can form no proper judgment of it . Some that we have cultivated this season , after a long neglect , seem like new kinds , and the favor is in proportion to the size . " The thick rowtj here alluded to , may be composed of /z/ trees from six to twelve feet apart in the rows . This mode admits of deep and thorough cultivation , and the team can pass freely in one direction , until close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so deeply , or so as to /z/ * * * * iff * Fig. 42 . Fig. 43. injure the roots . Fig. 43 exhibits this mode of planting ; and fig. 43 another mode , where the trees are in hexagons , or in the corners of equilateral triangles , and are thus more equally distributed over the ground than by any other arrangement . They may thus be cultivated in three directions . For landscape effect , this is undoubtedly better than by any other regular order . Trees are frequently mutilated in cultivating the ground with a team ; * to obviate this difficulty , arrange the horses when they work near the line of trees , one before the other , ad tandem . Let a boy ride the forward une , use long traces and a short whipple-tree , and place the whole in the charge of a careful man who knows that one tree is worth more than fifty hills of corn or potatoes , and no danger need be feared . In the absence of this arrangement , oxen will be safer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grass , as in some instances near dwellings , a circle of several feet round each tree must be kept mellow by the spade , fig. 44 . The work should be shallow near the tree to prevent injury to the roots , and gradually deepen as it recedes . This operation when repeated several times during summer , has been known to increase But a not less important result is the Fig 44. the growth five fold . /z/ exclusion of the mice , for which this is by far the most effectual method , if the surface is raised nine or ten inches round the tree just before winter , fig. 45 . The grass no longer affords these animals any hiding place , and when they reach the bank of fresh earth , they are immediately diverted from their course , and never attack the stem . Such a circle of dug earth facilitates the application of manure , which may be spread about the tree late in autumn , when the soluble portions are carried down among the Fig. 45. roots by the autumn and spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spade . Unless , however , this circle is of large size , it can afford but very partial benefit . The size should increase as the tree advances in growth . In very small trees , most of the roots are within a foot or two of the stem , but their circumference forms an annually increasing circle . Hence the frequent practice of applying manure , or digging the ground losely about the base , as exhibited in the annexed figure , ( 46 , ) is comparatively useless . Hence , too , the practice of plowing a few furrows only on each side of a row of large trees in an orchard , is greatly inferior to the cultivation of the whole surface . Among the crops which are best suited to young trees , are pota- ig. 46. toes , ruta bagas , beets , carrots , beans , and all low hoed crops . Indian corn , though a hoed crop , is of too tall a growth , shading young /z/ trees too much by its formidable stalks . All sown crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meadows are ruinous . An acquaintance who purchased a hundred peach trees and placed them in meadow land , lost most of them by the overgrowth of the grass ; and the following winter , the mice , who avoid clean culture , destroyed the remainder . Every one was lost . A clean , mellow , cultivated piece of ground , kept so a few years , might have saved the whole of them , and brought them into bearing . A chief reason of the fatal effects of sown crops , is the impossibility of mellowing the ground by repeated cultivation . For this reason , a low crop of peas has been found much worse than a heavy growth of Indian corn . A large peach orchard was sown with peas , and bordered on one side with corn , in which one row of the peach trees stood . Such was the benefit derived by them from the hoeing given to the corn , that the single row was most conspicuously visible by the deeper green of its foliage , at the distance of half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more frequently the plow or cultivator passes among them , the greater will be the benefit to the tree . A friend , who well understands thorough cultivation , found that his young and newly planted standards which stood among the small seedling trees of his nursery , and which received the benefit of constant and continued working till autumn , made twice the growth of those in a field of beets , and which was kept well hoed only through the early part of the season , or till the crop covered the ground . Some of the former made shoots the first year four feet in length . The best peach orchard for market crops in western New York , is kept mellow by deep and thorough tillage without any other crop , and the improved quality and amount of the fruit is found of greater consequence than any other product of the land . The same course is pursued with the best of the great peach orchards which supply the city of Philadelphia . A very mistaken policy is the selection of uneven or stony ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing else . The truth should be unalterably fixed on every farmer 's mind , that the orchard /z/ should have the best piece of land on the farm , so long as clean , thrifty trees , loaded with fair , large , and highflivored fruit , are to be preferred to light crops of what is half grown and distorted , with deficient flavor ; with the acidi'ional difference that the former may be brought into full bearing in one-third of the time required for the latter .

In connexion with the cultivation of the soil , the restoration of trees of feeble growth will be much hastened , if the trunk and principal branches are scrubbed several times in a season , with a brush dipped in soap-suds , first scraping the bark , should it be rough or mossy . /z/ PRUNING has two objects ; one , to promote vigorous growth in older trees , and to lessen the number of branches , where they become so thick as to interfere with each other 's full development , and retard or lessen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , which have grown without care till the thick mass of branches and leaves present an almost impenetrable shade . The other object , is to lessen the luxuriant growth of young trees growing in rich soil , and to prevent the too rapid formation of the wood and leaves at the expense of the production of fruit ; the most familiar instance of which occurs in the summer pruning of hardy grapes , by pinching off the ends of the young shoots . I. Fruits are acid in cold summers , and comparatively destitute of flavor . Forced fruit , grown in winter when there is little light , can not compare in quality with that ripened under the full blaze of a summer 's sun ; and melons , grown in frames covered with mats , possess none of the luscious flavor of those cultivated in the open air . Hence the advantage of a free admission of light and air among the branches of fruit trees , instead of allowing them to be covered with a thick shade of leaves . The utility of sun-light is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree fully exposed to the solar rays , and in thick shade . Even the exposed side of the same apple is often found decidedly the highest-flavored . The rich acid of the Esopus Spitzenburgh , and the sugary sweetness of the Tallman Sweeting are more strikingly observable under the deep red skin of the one , . md the brown sunny cheek of the other . There is , however , more judgment needed in piuning large trees , than perhaps any other operation in their /z/ management . It is next to impossible to give particular rules , as circumstances vary so much that no two trees are to be treated precisely alike . But , keeping steadily the objects of pruning in view , the admission of light , the removal of crooked limbs , and the preservation of a handsome , evenly distributed top , the careful operator can hardly do amiss . The best practice , undoubtedly , is trimming moderately every year or two , as the trees may need it , which obviates the necessity of cutting away much at a time , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary practice , it is carried to a much greater extent than the health of the tree , or the necessity of the case requires . The safer error of the two , is trimming too little . Small portions , frequently pruned off , are the utmost that are needed . If judicious pruning is commenced early , and the growth of crooked or improperly crowded branches prevented by a timely removal of superabundant shoots , very little subsequent lopping will be necessary . Indeed , so much may be accomplished by early care , that some skilful cultivators have found it entirely needless to possess such a tool as a pruning-knife or pruning-saw , accomplishing all they desire by merely rubbing off the fresh shoots at the outset . The cutting off of large limbs should only be resorted to in cases of absolute necessity , or where trees have been for a long time neglected till they have become an impenetrable mass of brush . In - pruning standard trees , it should be observed , that the older they become , the more caution is requisite to effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , the case is quite different , where free trimming may be unhesitatingly adopted , particularly with such kinds as the peach , which quickly reproduce new branches . A familiar instance of the safety of pruning heavily quite young trees , occurs in the heading down of stocks to the inserted eye , after the operation of budding . In heading large apple and pear trees , and especially the latter , for the purpose of regrafling them , it is quite necessary that it be done gradually , and in successive years . For , /z/ if too many boughs are lopped at a time , a great number of young shoots will be emitted , which being of a tender growth are often eminently liable , if the tree be the pear , to the frost-blight . The renewing should commence at the top , otherwise the tree will be thrown up to too great a height , and should proceed downwards , till in successive years , the whole work is completed . Pruning , for the purpose of letting in light on the leaves and growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than further south . It is found of more utility in New England than in Ohio , and still more essential in England , where many fruits , to be perfectly ripened , need the full exposure of wall training , and the reflection of wall heat . The priming of the peach by shortening-in , described on a future page , is totally different from that of the apple and pear , and must be performed with an unsparing hand . The best mode to prune young trees in the nursery , is to cut off all the annual shoots in winter , close to the main stem . This gives the whole strength to the stem , and prevents large stiff branches , so discordant with a handsome , clean tree . The side shoots which are thrown out , sufficiently stiffen the tree , and if the ends of these shoots are shortened in summer , in a greater or less degree , varying with the degree of stoutness or " stockiness " desired , it will throw all the growth into the main stem . Keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Season for pruning . Thinning out the heads of old trees , or heading back for grafting , may be performed in autumn or winter ; and on younger trees , just before midsummer , when , the tree being in a growing state , the operator can judge better of the shape the head is assuming , and act accordingly ; and the wounds are soon healed by the new wood . Peach trees may be shortened back during winter , or if the climate is cold , early in spring . A cheap application to the wounds in pruning ; to shut out air and water , and prevent cracking and subsequent decay , is a mixture of tar and brick-dust . But a much better one is made by dissolving gum shellac in alcohol , so that it shall be of the consistence of paint . It is applied with great ease and rapidity , adheres firmly , keeps out the air , and /z/ not being a heavy application , but only a thin coating , it offers no impediment to the forming-lip of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this composition at all times at hand , would be found a great convenience . A shilling 's worth of gum shellac dissolved in a quart of alcohol , is all that is necessary , and is immediately ready for use . If too thick , it is at once rendered more liquid by the addition of alcohol , and vice versa . The most convenient way to use it , so that it may be instantly ready at all times , is to fit into the cork of a large-mouthed bottle , a brush of convenient size , the cork thus forming a sort of handle to the brush , which remains within the bottle when not in use . /z/ The principles of this mode of pruning will perhaps be best understood by a detail of the operation : In the early part of summer , or when the shoots have grown about one foot , cut off about one inch from their growing points ; the sap , in consequence , no longer expends itself to increase their length in the formation of useless wood but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to within two or three buds of the base , as often done , is objectionable , as not enough leaves are left for the elaboration of sap , and to support the healthy functions of the tree ; and this sudden diminution , induces the remaining buds to make an effort to replace them by a second growth of leaves . In two or three weeks , give the trees a second examination , and where shoots are too crowded , thin them out by cutting back so as to leave two or three buds at the base of each . Again , near the close of summer , or early in autumn , when the fruit requires more sun-light , and when there will be no danger of the remaining buds being stimulated . to growth , and when the leaves have nearly completed their office , cut all the shoots back to two or three good buds . By this mode , no half-ripened shoots , of mid-summer growth , will be produced , but all will be strong , well matured , and vigorous . The skilful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much denuding the tree of leaves ; for they are at all times indispensable to the ripening as well as the growth of the fruit . An analogous case may serve to illn** " *** tir ' /z/ effect , in the practice of lopping early in autumn the stalks of Indian corn immediately above the ear ; which , by careful measurement , has been found materially to lessen the crop . A common method in France , is to allow all shoots to start , and pinch off their ends when they are only a few inches in length . In this way they all subsequently become fruit bearers , without crowding the tree with a confused mass of branches , like those of a sheared hedge . This shortening of the young green shoots , is found much superior to the practice of leaving them till winter . It should be commenced at the top first , and so proceed downwards as the season advances , for the lower shoots always have a tendency to be the weakest . A second and further shortening of the upper shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper and lower parts . Pyra7nidal Trees . A neat and convenient mode of planting the sides of large walks , on cultivated ground , preferable in most cases to espaliers , because less adverse to a natural growth , and hence better adapted to the warm summers of America , where highly artificial modes of training are less needed , is by the use of trees trained as pyramids . For this purpose the trees are usually grafted on dwarf stocks , and are placed at distances of six to twelve feet asunder . The first year 's growth from the graft or bud , is headed down to within about six good buds of its base ; these buds , as a consequence , grow vigorously . About midsummer , their growth , with the exception of the upper one , is stopped by cutting off their tips , or by bending and tying them downwards . The upper or leading shoot , then grows with great vigor , and soon needs stopping again , to induce the emission of a second tier of shoots about one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is repeated for suc- Fig. 46 . Pyramidal Tree . /z/ cessive years , till the tree has attained its desired height . The side branches will throw out shoots , which must be cut back , as already described for summer pruning , so as to form a handsome pyramidal tree . This mode of pruning is usually adopted for dwarf pear trees on quince stocks , but it need not necessarily be confined to these ; applied to the pear on pear stocks , and other fruit trees , it will promote in a high degree its early frui ; fulness . These rules for summer pruning , will be found of much utility if applied to the operation , necessarily more common in this country , of pruning hardy grapes . It will be distinctly observed , that these remarks do not apply to standard trees , but only to those artificially trained in the form of espaliers or pyramids . But it might be adopted to a certain extent for standards , to give them a better head , and bring them into earlier bearing. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to increase the growth of a tree , causes also the formation of leaf buds instead of flower buds . On the contrary , whatever tends to an accumulation of sap in any part , or to retard its circulation , induces the production of flower instead of leaf buds . When trees are young , and the bark and wood soft and flexible , the sap flows freely and without check ; hence , leaf buds and the vigorous growth of branches are the result ; but as trees become older , and the bark and other parts more rigid , they offer more resistance to a free circulation , and hence the production of flowers and the consequent fruitfulness of the tree . This principle enables us to apply artificial means at pleasure for the promotion of the same object . When trees are young and small , a rapid growth and the attainment of size is desirable , which is given by enriching the ground , and by thorough and constant cultivation . A neglect of these operations , would check free growth and circulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , be at the expense of the future vigor and size of the tree , and of the size and excellence of the fruit . Indeed , it often happens , that with the best treatment , trees will bear as young as their ultimate success requires . There are , however , some varieties , which , in rich soil , continue growing a long time in an unproductive state . Fruitfulness is caused in various ways . 1 , By neglecting cultivation , or suffering grass to grow under them , which diminishes their growth . 2 . Pruning the roots beneath the surface , by cutting off a part of the larger ones , causing the same result . 3 . Ringing the branches , or removing a small ring of bark round them , which prevents the fluids from /z/ flowing back or downwards , and consequently induces their accumulation , to the formation of flower buds . 4 . Bending the branches downwards , causing a similar accumulation with a like result . 5 . Grafting on dissimilar stocks , which prevents a free flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Suffering grass to grow among trees , though beneficial in some very rare instances , is not on the whole advisable . The loss in the quality of the fruit is too great , and is not balanced by the advantages . The complaint of unfruitfulness has been frequently applied to the pear ; but a selection of those sorts which bear while yet very young , entirely obviates the difficulty . 2 . Pruning the roots . This has been tried to a very limited extent only . Its utility may therefore be doubted under ordinary circumstances , for long continued practice . For such varieties , however , as incline to unproductiveness , and in the deep and highly manured soils of the most fertile gardens , it has proved eminently successful . Its tendency is to render trees more dwarfish , and for this reason it may be used to advantage upon such varieties of the pear as can not be worked upon the quince , where the object is to produce early fruitfulness in connection with diminutive growth . It should be attempted , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , rich soil , and with the best cultivation . There is no doubt that it is better suited to a northern , moist climate , such as that of England , than to the hotter and drier portions of the United States . It is usually performed with a spade , ground sharp , and thrust down through the soil at a suitable distance from the tree . 3 . Ringing the branches is effected by taking out a narrow ring of bark , extending round the branch . By obstructing the downward descent of the juices , and by their accumulation above the ring , it not only causes fruitfulness , but frequently alters the appearance and quality of the fruit . In some cases , it has doubled the size ; in others it has brightened the colors . In the Court Pendu apple , the colors are changed from green and dull red , to brilliant yellow and scarlet . But Lindley says , " If performed extensively upon a tree , it is apt , if not to kill it , to render it incurably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut off all communication between the upper and lower lips of the /z/ wound , they produce little effect , and if they are they are difficult to heal . For these reasons , the operation is but little employed . " * 4 . Binding the branches downwards , by changing their natural position , as well as causing a partial obstruction where bent , promotes their fruitfulness . In all these modes , it must be remembered that the desired result will not be produced at once , as the first year is occupied in the formation of flower buds ; and the next in their growth into fruit . ThJU delay , however , will not take place , where the difficulty consists merely in the fruit not setting , the buds being already formed . 5 . The influence of the stok , when it differs in nature from the graft , is often of importance . The more widely they differ , the greater will be the effect . Thus , when pears grow upon pears , the effect is the same as when not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an increase of fertility . Hence the adoption of the quince stock . These artificial modes of inducing fruitfulness are not to be recommended for general practice , nor for orchard culture . It is true that trees will yield fruit sooner ; but heavy crops from young growing trees are not often desirable . Let them grow freely for a few years , and the amount ultimately obtained will be the greater . Indeed , the period of fruitfulness is often hastened by cultivation and retarded by neglect . Except for the sake of experiment , the preceding modes are not to be applied until trees are large , when good varieties will bear sufficiently without them . * " Many years ago . 5 ' says David Thomas , " I had a tree of the Mammoth Sweeting , which had two principal branches . It comes into bearing very tardily , and I became impatient to see the fruit I therefore drew my knife and cut through the bark transversely , forcing open the bark by straining the knife sideway- , as I drew it along an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring round the branch was completed , it had a z gzag appearance . Observe , that no bark was cut out , though the wood was scraped . This operation was very effectual however . The next season that branch bore plentifully , while the other branch remained as unproductive as before . Tiie cutting never appeared to injure the branch . " /z/ THE more common tools needed , are the shovel , the spade , and the hoe , for digging holes , transplanting , and cultivating the ground . The rake is useful in mixing manures with the soil for filling the remote parts or large holes . /z/ The pruning-knife , fig. 47 , is a large hooked knife , for removing useless branches . The pruning-saw is needed in taking off larger limbs ; attached to a handle seve47. ral feet long , it will reach those at a distance from the ground . The direction of the teeth should be the reverse of the common saw ; that is , they should Fig. 48. point towards the ope- rator , constituting what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to a pulling strain , it does not require so thick a blade as a thrust-saw , with the teeth in the usual way . For this reason , it is less liable to become broken or twisted . The Fig. 49. bow-saw , fig. 49 , is a light saw for cutting near the ground . The pruning chisel may differ but little from those of a common carpenter , fixed to the end of a long pole or handle , for cutting off small branches at a considerable height . It is placed against a limb , and the stroke of a mallet separates it . /z/ Fig. 51 . Small shoots are removed by the hooked part , shown in fig. 50 . The budding-knife , fig. 51 , should have a broad , flat blade , the edge of which is to be rounded outwards , for the more ready incision of the bark . The thin ivory blade or haft at the extremity of the handle , as the budding-knife is commonly made , may be dispensed with in nearly all cases , the bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downwards , more perfectly than by any other mode , after the corners of the bark are lifted with the point of the blade . The grafting-tool ( fig. 52 ) is useful in cleft-grafting large apple trees . It may be made of iron , the edge set with steel. - Fig. 52 . It is used for splitting the stock , after it is sawed off and pared . The part a should be two inches broad with a sharp edge , which should curve inwards , that the bark , in splitting , may be cut first , to give it a smooth flat face . The wedge b opens the stock to receive the graft . By the hook c it is hung on a twig close at hand , when not in use . Grafting wedges for common use , may be made by grinding down large cut nails . The graf ting-shears i a recent invention , have effected a great improvement in cleft-grafting , rendering the work much more expeditious and perfect . They consist of a short thin blade of the best steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches long , set at an angle of about a hundred and twenty degrees with the handle b , which moves it against a concave bed in the wooden piece , c . The angle which the blade and its bed form with the handles , imparts a sawing motion to the knife , which renders it more effective . It may be used on stocks an inch or an inch and a half in diameter . Pressing the top of the stock from the operator with one hand , it is cut off with remarkable ease by a single 5a /z/ stroke given to the shears with the other hand . Another perpendicular stroke slits the stock for the graft , leaving a perfectly smooth face cut for its reception . The expedition and perfection of the work is thus greatly facilitated . Small shears attached to a pole and worked by a cord , ( fig. 54 , ) are useful for cutting grafts on tall trees ; in removing the eggs of caterpillars , ( see chapter on the apple ; ) and in taking off fine fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole immediately under the shears . The blades of these shears , forming an oblique angle with the shaft at a little distance above the pivot , make a draw-cut instead of a crushing- cut , and are for this reason more effective . Apples , and some of the Fig. 54. harder fruits , may also be gathered with a wooden hook in the end of a pole , to draw the fruit from the branch , caught in a basket just underneath . In using the long handled pruning-saw , the pruningchisel , the graft-cutter , or the fruit-gatherer , the operator may stand on a ladder or high stool , as an additional assistance in reaching the higher parts of the tree . Self-sustaining fruit-ladders are very useful in gathering fine fruit , to prevent mutilation and bruising of the bark and branches . Fig. 55 , is one of small size and simple construction , is easily carried in one hand , and will raise one 's feet a yard or more from the ground . It consists of a small piece of light plank at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fig. 56 , represents one from eight to twelve feet high , the two single legs moving on joints , for closing against the ladder in carrying , and spreading like a tripod in setting up under the tree . The folding-ladder may be closed together with the facility of a pair of compasses ; it then becomes a round stick , easily carried in one hand . It is made of strong /z/ readily understood by the annexed figure , ( 57 , ) representing the ladder as open , as half closed , and as closely shut . An enlarged longitudinal section shows the manner in which the rounds lie in the grooves or concave beds in the sides or styles ; above which is a cross-section exhibiting the semi-oval form of the styles . The ends of the rounds turn on iron pins , slightly riveted outside . The rounds resting on shoulders , when the ladder is opened , render the whole stiff and firm . A ladder of this construction is found very useful , not only in fruit-houses , where a common ladder could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beFig. 57. cause it can be thrust through the branches like a round pole , without the least difficulty , and when once there , it is easily opened . The orchardist 's hook consists of a light rod , with an iron hook at one end , and a &-^=^; piece of wood made to t ! = slide along it . In using it the fruit-gatherer draw ? Fl - 58 down the end of a branch with the hook , and fastens it by the sliding piece to another branch below . The slider passes freely along the rod , but ceases to slide by the friction of the side-strain whenever it is in use , fig. 58 . TRELLIS , for grapes and espaliers . Cedar , or other durable posts should be used , set four or eight feet apart . The horizontal bars or strips should be let in the posts , and should be from six to twelve inches apart . NET SCREENS are useful in preventing the attack of birds on rare and valuable fruits on young trees . The net should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . LABELS for standard trees are useful in retaining the names of the varieties . Purchasers of trees usually neglect /z/ the names , and the labels received with the trees being soon lost , nothing more is thought of them till they begin to bear . Curiosity is then excited to know the " new kinds . " Conjecture is set on foot , and the greatest confusion follows . Serious and innumerable mistakes are maj , e and perpetuated in this way in all parts of the country . Permanent labels are therefore important and necessary . The simplest is made of a slip of wood , three inches long and half an inch wide , suspended to the branch by a loop of wire , of which copper is best , fig. 59 . The name will last three or four years , if written with a pencil on a very thin coat of fresh white paint . Better and more durable labels are made of small pieces of sheetzinc , written upon with a mixture of two parts ( by weight ) of verdegris , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . The ingredients are to be mixed in a mortar with a small portion of water art first , and the whole added afterwards . Preserve the mixture in a well corked bottle , shaking it repeatedly at first , and keep the cork downwards to prevent the escape of ammonia , and it will remain fit for use for years . If the pieces of zinc are suspended by copper wire , it should be firmly twisted round the zinc so as not to remain loose ( fig. 60 , ) or else the constant motion from wind , will soon wear off the wire . The wire should be nearly as large as a small knitting needle , to prevent cracking off by long use . The loop should be large , and pass round a side-shoot , instead of a main branch to prevent the danger of cutting in by the growth of the tree ; and should be attached below a small fork , to prevent its blowing off the end of the branch . The wire may be wholly dispensed with by the following contrivance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch wide and six to ten inches long . Draw the narrow or slender end Fig. so . roun i the twig , bring it through a hole punched mid-way between the ends , and clinch or twist it with the Fig. 59. /z/ fingers or a small pair of pinchers . These labels may be cut and punched by a tinman at a cheap rate . Sheet tin may be used instead of zinc , using a sharp awl to write the name , and being particular to cut through the tin coating . Oxidation soon renders the letters distinct . Lead labels , ( fig. 60 , ) stamped with type , and suspended with copper wire , well twisted against the hole , to prevent wearing by the motion of the wind , are very durable . Fig. 61 , shows the mode of stamping , by sliding the sheet 1 lead between two plates of iron , H a , b , screwed together , and setting m /z/ the types successively against the upper plate , # , and stamping one at a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The imprinted end of the sheet lead is then cut off , and forms the label. * No person , who plants an orchard or fruit garden , should depend wholly on labels , which may be lost off , to distinguish the names of his trees . The rows , and the kinds in each row , should be registered in successive order , in a book kept for the purpose . This will facilitate the replacement of any lost label . * It is sometimes a matter of convenience to mark the names on specimens of the fruit itself . This is quickly and permanently done by tracing the name with a blunt ttick , or a pencil , pressing hard enough to indent the surface , but not to tear the skin . It succeeds best on pears , the writing soon changing color and becoming conspicuous . /z/ IT is only by a uniform and definite use of terms , that descriptions can be made intelligible to the reader . A full explanation of these terms hence becomes a matter of importance . Distinctive characters should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of locality , soil , season , or climate ; or , if variable , the nature of such variation should be distinctly pointed out . To assist the cultivator the more fully to understand written descriptions , the devotion of a few pages to a clear explanation of the terms used in this work , may prove useful . / . Growth of the tree , shoots , and leaves . The form of growth often affords a good distinctive character of varieties , not liable to great variation . Young trees , only a few years old , usually exhibit peculiarities of growth more conspicuously , than old trees , of irregular spreading branches . Hence , in all cases , where this character is mentioned , it refers to young trees not more than three or four years from the bud or graft , unless otherwise expressed . 1 . Shoots are erect , when they rise nearly perpendicularly from the main trunk or stem , as in the Early Strawberry apple and Bartlett pear , fig. 62 . Diverging , when they deviate from the perpendicular at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the same tree ; as in the Domine and Ribston Pippin , fig. 63 . Spreading , when they more nearly approach a horizontal direction , as in most trees of the Rhode Island Greening , fig. 64 . Drooping , when they fall below the horizontal , a form /z/ which many spreading shoots assume , as they grow into the large branches of older trees . Ascending , when they curve upwards , as in the Gravenstein apple , and small Red Siberian Crab , fig. 65 . Erect trees usually partake more or less of this quality , but the Early Harvest is free from it . Irregular , when they assume no very distinct growth , but more or less a mixture of the preceding , as Black Gilliflower r and Summer Bonchretien pear . Straggling , similar to the next preceding , but with shoots more slender and curved , as Winter Nelis and Black Worcester pear , fig. 66 . Fig. 62 . Fig. 63 . Fig. 64 . Shoots are straight , as in the Early Harvest and Northern Spy apples ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , as in the Swaar and Roxbury Russett . This distinction is very apparent and uniform in young and very thrifty trees , but not in older ones of feeble growth . They are stout , as in the Red Astrachan ; slender , as in the Jonathan apple , and Winter Nelis pear . . Trees with erect straight shoots when young , usually form more regular and compact heads in older trees ; and those of a spreading habit , more irregular or drooping heads . Some trees which grow very rapidly when young , are small when of full size , examples of which are found in the Late Strawberry and Tallman Sweeting . Others at first grow more slowly , but ultimately become large , as Esopus Spitzenburgh . Some varieties , again , continue /z/ to increase rapidly in size at all periods , as the Northern Spy ; while others of feeble growth when small , never attain much magnitude , as the Early Joe and Sine Qua Non . // variety at different periods of the year , as well as with different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of soil , climate , and season . When fresh or very young , all have a greenish color , but gradually assume various shades of yellow , olive , brown , red , purple , and nearly black , as the season advances , and as they become bare and are exposed to the sun and weather . For this reason , in describing the color , the terms must be relative , and can only be correctly applied by a comparison at the time with the color of other sorts . During winter , and early in the spring , the shoots of most trees become so much darker than at other times , that it is only practice and by placing the different sorts side by side , that accuracy may be attained . Skilful culturists will readily distinguish , by a glance at the color of the shoots , many of the kinds they cultivate ; but the peculiar cast is hard to describe in words , in the same way that it is impossible to describe the handwriting of an individual , so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a glance , know the penmanship of hundreds of different persons . A few of the most strongly marked cases , however , present peculiarities of color , which form useful points of distinction . No one , for instance , could easily mistake the yellow shoots of the Bartlett and Dix pears , for the dark brown or purple of the Tyson and Forelle ; or the light greenish cast of the Bough and Sine Qua Non apples , for the dark color of the Northern Spy , or dark brown of the Baldwin ; nor the downy or greyish appearance of the Ladies ' Sweeting and Esopus Spitzenburgh , for the clear shining brown of the Gravenstein and Red Astrachan. * // examples , the large , compact , and projecting buds of the summer Bonchretien , always contrast strongly with the smaller , more rounded , and softer buds of the Madeleine . /z/ Buds are large on the Swaar and Golden Sweet ; small on the Tallman Sweeting and Rhode Island Greening. // in distinguishing different varieties . $ They are even , ( not wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fig. 67 . Fig. 67 . Fig. 68 Fig. 69 . Fig. 70 . Fig. 71 . Waved , as in the Tallman Sweeting , and Beurre d'Aumalis pear , fig. 68 . Wrinkled , when the waves are shorter and more irregular , as in Green Sweet , fig. 69 . Flat , as in the Madeleine and Skinless pears , fig. 70 . Folded and recurved , as in the Easter Beurre and Bonchretien Fondante , fig. 71 . Large and wide as in the Red Astrachan and Huling 's Superb . Narrow , as in Dyer apple , and Van Mons Leon le Clerc pear . Erect , as in Early Strawberry , fig. 72 . Droopi ? ig , as in Dominie , fig. 73 . But these two last are indistinct characters , and only to be resorted to in a few very - remarkable instances , as most leaves are " erect on new shoots , and become spreading or drooping as they grow older . The color of the leaves may sometimes assist in description , as light green in the Yellow Bellflower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greening ; and blueish green , as in Peck 's Pleasant . The serratures , or saw-teeth markings on the margins of leaves , are characteristics of importance , in many varieties of the apple , and on the peach they are so well defined as /z/ to form a basis of the classification of varieties . The latter will be found particularly described in the separate chapter on the peach . Leaves of apples are , Serrate , or cut with teeth like those of a saw . Sharply serrate , when every serrature ends in a sharp point , as in the Fall Pippin , fig. 74 . Doubly serrate , when the serratures themselves are again minutely serrated , as in the Vandevere and Drap d'Or , fig. 75 .

Obtusely crenate , when the teeth are unusually rounded , as in the Bough . Finely crenate , when the teeth are small , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and irregularly /z/ by the Fig. 77. great difference and rather deeply cut , they become toothed , as in Ladies ' Sweeting , fig-. 77 . Many varieties present intermediate degrees , as , Serrate-crenate , partaking somewhat of both , as Jersey Sweeting , Summer Rose . Crenate-toothed , as in Bevan 's Favorite . Serrate , slightly approaching toothed , as in Rambo . FLOWERS . In apples , pears , cherries , and most other kinds , but little difference exists in the flowers . In the peach and nectarine , however , an important division in classification is made between those with large and small pefals ; one class , including the Early Ann , Grosse Mignonne , and others , having large showy flowers ; and another class , comprising Early Crawford , George IV. , and many more , having flowers with small narrow petals . /z/ In the following pages , the base of a fruit or any other part or production of a tree , is the portion towards the branch or root . This is in accordance with the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been more or less departed from in the common language used to describe fruits , and especially so as applicable to the pear . This deviation from scientific accuracy tends to confusion , and if simplicity of expression is sought , ambiguity must be avoided . The apex of the stalk of a fruit , however , to avoid the chance for a mistake , may in all cases be termed the insertion . The term apex should be understood as applying to the part most remote from the branch or root . In fruits , it is the part opposite to the insertion of the stalk In pears , this part is usually denominated the crown . /z/ The aids is a line connecting the base and apex . A longitudinal section is made by cutting an apple from base to apex . A transverse section , by cutting it at right angles to the axis . The length is the longitudinal diameter ; the breadth the transverse diameter . A fruit is round when nearly spherical , as Fameuse , Green Sweet . Roundish , , when varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nearly equal , as Dyer and Gravenstein. 79 Oblate. 80 Conical . 81 Ovate . 82 Obconic . Oblate , flat , or flattened , when the height is much less than the breadth , as Rambo , Maiden 's Blush , fig. 79 . Conical , when tapering from the base to the apex , as Bullock 's Pippin , fig. 80 . Ovate , or egg-shaped , when the length rather exceeds the breadth , with a rounded taper from base to apex , as in Esopus Spitzenburgh , fig. 81 . Obconic. , * or reversed conical , when the smaller end is at the base or stalk , as in the Tyson pear , fig. 82 . Obovate , or reversed ovate , is when the smaller end of an egg-shaped fruit is at the base , as the Buflfum and Dearborn Seedling pears , fig. 83. 83 Obovate. 84 Oblong . 85 Round-ovate. 86 Oblate-conical . Oblong , when the length exceeds the breadth , and the /z/ sides are nearly parallel , as Kaighn 's Spitzenburgh , fig. 84 . Obtuse , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , as the neck of a pear , tapers to nearly a point . Fruits may partake of forms variously combined , as , Round-ovate , when nearly round , with a slight rounded taper to apex , as Lady 's Sweeting , fig. 85 . Round-conical , nearly the same as the last , but with the taper less rounded . Oblong- conical , as Yellow Bellflower . Oblong-ovate , as Black Gilliflower .

Depressed , pressed down , sunk , or shortened , applied to the apex of peaches , strawberries , &c.; Flattened at the ends when the base and apex only are flattened , as Winter Pearmain . An oblong fruit , though not flat , may be flattened at ends ; a conical fruit may be flattened at base . Compressed , pressed together , when the sides are flattened , as in some apricots , plums , &c.; The CAVITY is the hollow in which the stalk or stem of a fruit is placed . The BASIN is the depression which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossom . A cavity may be shallow , narrow , deep , or broad . It may be obtuse , or somewhat blunt or rounded at bottom , as in the Petre pear and Pomme Grise apple , fig. 87 . Acute , when simply ending in a sharp point at bottom , as Baldwin , fig. 88 . Acuminate , when ending in a long drawn out taper , as Fall Pippin , fig. 89 . The Holland and Fall Pippin are distinguished from each other by the rather obtuse cavity of the former , and acuminate cavity of the latter . The BASIN is always narrow in any fruit having a narrow /z/ Fig. 87 Obtuse . Fig* 88 . Fig. 89. or pointed apex , fig. 90 ; it is usually wide in fruits having a wide or obtuse apex , as Ram bo , fig. 91 ; but where the rim or boundary is broad and obtuse , the basin may be narrow , as in the St. Lawrence and Gravenstein , fig. 92 . It is distinct when well defined . Abrupt , when the depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 90 . Fig. 91 . Fig. 92 . Fig. 93 . Even , when not furrowed or wrinkled . Angular , with several corners .

Plaited , having small , straight , and regular ridges . Hibbed , with larger and more obtuse or rounded ridges . The peculiar forms of PEARS render some additional terms necessary : Many pears have a neck , or narrower part towards the stalk , and a body , or larger part towards the crown , fig. 94 . They are distinctly pyriform , when the sides formed by the body and neck , are more or less concave or hollowed in , as in fig. 94 , shown by the dotted lines . Turbinate , or top-shaped , when the body is nearly round , and a short rounded acute neck , as in the Bloodgood , fig. 95. /z/ The form of different pears is further distinguished by the form of the different parts : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in Beurre Bosc , fig. 96 .

Light or small , when not much larger than the neck , ss Washington ; in which case the fruit approaches oblong in form . Oblate , or flattish , as in Frederick of Wurtemburg . Round , as in Jargonelle . Conical , as in Vicar of Winkfield . Ovate , as in Marie Louise. * CHERRIES may be round , cordate or heart shaped , or ovate . STONE FRUITS usually have a furrow on one side , extending from the stalk to the apex , termed a suture , ( literally meaning a seam , which sometimes occurs on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct , when clear or well defined ; obscure , when faint ; obsolete , when not existing , or only a faint line on the surface . COLOR OF FRUIT . The lightest colored fruit is white , as the Snow peach ; next , yellowish white ; pale yellow ; yel- * Cultivation influences considerably the form of pears . Thus , on a young thrifty tree , the Seckel pear has a slight neck ; on an old heavily laden tree , the neck is obsolete . The body , when ovate or slightly conical on young trees , becomes rounded on older trees , and even flattened in rare instances . EXPLANATION OF TERMS . Ill low ; and deep yellow . The addition of red produces successively , orange yellow , orange , orange red , rich warm red . Shades of red , clear red , crimson when darkened , purple when blue is added , violet , less blue than in purple . Amber is a very light yellowish brown . Fawn color is a light reddish brown , with a slight admixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad lines of color ; Streaked , when the lines are long and narrow ; Marbled , when the stripes are wide , faint , irregular or waving ; Blotched , of different abrupt shades , without any order or regularity ; Clouded , when the blotches are broader and more softly shaded ; Stained , the lighter shades of a blotched or clouded apple ; Splashed , when the stripes are much broken and all sizes ; Mottled , covered with nearly confluent dots ; Dotted , when these dots are more distinct ; Spotted , when the dots become larger . TEXTURE OF FRUIT . Hard , those which need the artificial aid of cooking to soften them sufficiently , as the Catillac pear . Breaking , when tenderer than the preceding , but not yielding to the simple pressure of the mouth , as Summer Bonchretien . Buttery , when the flesh forms a soft mass , yielding to the pressure of the mouth , as in the White Doyenne and Seckel pears . Melting , when the flesh becomes nearly or entirely liquid by this pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as breaking and melting , in the Washington ; breaking and buttery , in the Onondaga ; buttery and melting , in the Tyson , and in most of the best varieties of the pear . The texture may be fine , granular , coarse , gritty , fibrous , tough , crisp , or tender . THE FLAVOR may be sweet , neutral , slightly sub-acid , or mild sub-acid , sub-acid , acid , very acid , or austere ; aromat ' /z/ or spicy ; perfumed or possessing odor and with more or less of a shade of musk ; astringent , usually a defect , but sometimes , an excellent quality , if in a very minute proportion ; rough , astringent and austere ; vinous , rich , high-flavored , and rather acid ; sugary or saccharine , sometimes nearly sweet , possessing the qualities of sugar , which may be mixed with acid . THE QUALITY is designated by first , second , and third rates ; and fruits perfectly worthless by still lower grades . A second rate fruit , to be worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high degree , as hardiness , productiveness , fair appearance , &c.; Very few fruits as low as third rate , can ever be worth retaining , and only for extreme earliness or other uncommon quality . Fruits that possess desirable qualities , are usually designated by three degrees of flavor ; the lowest , including the best of second rate fruits , or " good second rate , " are termed good ; the lower grade of first rate fruits are termed very good , or fine ; and the highest quality of all , are best , very fine , or excellent . Examples , Maiden 's Blush apple , Napoleon pear , Lombard plum , and Crawford 's Early peach , are good ; Khode Island Greening , Bartlett pear , Graffion or Bigarreau cherry , and Red Gage plum , are very good or fine ; and Swaar apple , Seckel pear , Downton cherry , and Green Gage plum , are excellent or best . /z/ THROUGHOUT the following part of this work , to enable the reader to perceive at a glance , the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading every separate description , the different degrees of excellence are indicated by the type used for the name . Those varieties which have been admitted as eminently worthy of cultivation , by a large vote in many different parts of the country , are printed in LARGE CAPITALS ; those next in quality and value , and in nearly all cases fruits of first quality , are designated by SMALL CAPITALS ; those worthy of a place only in large collections , or whose character has not yet been fully established , are in Italics ; while such as have been superseded or are unworthy of cultivation except on the trial grounds of the Pomologist , are in common Roman type . A few new varieties of high excellence , which promise to become general favorities , are given in ITALIC CAPITALS . It is scarcely necessary to remark that the task of thus classing the numerous varieties , is one of extraordinary difficulty . The diversities of tastes , the changes wrought by soil , culture , and climate , and the different estimates placed upon delicious flavor alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping , would wholly preclude entire unanimity in any one case . The author has endeavored to weigh properly all the different objections and recommendations , according to the best information to be obtained ; and in this labor he has been generously assisted by several of the most eminent Pomologists of the country . It has been the aim to admit , in no instance , any new variety , that can not deservedly rank among those of high excellence ; all others being such as have either been known by extensive dissemination or by descriptions in books . /z/ NAMES AND SYNONYMS . When more than one name for a single variety has been widely known , it has been the aim of the author to select the one most commonly used . For this reason , those adopted in Downing 's " Fruits and Fruit Trees of America , " have in nearly all cases been retained , a work more extensively circulated than any of a similar character . It happens , in some instances , that the original or correct name may have been for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one substituted ; thus , William 's Bonchretien has given way to the name Bartlett ; Pomme Royal to Dyer ; Epargne to Jargonelle ; Williams to William 's Favorite . In such cases , it can be hardly proper to tax the whole community to make a change , to rectify the error of an individual ; and the more common name has been retained . A pomological writer , like the compiler of a dictionary , should confine himself as nearly as practicable to general usage , and not to the manufacture of new names . Old and popular names , as Bough and Pennock , have hence been preferred to the newer ones of Large Yellow Bough and Pennock 's Red Winter . In a few instances , however , to prevent mistake or confusion , it becomes necessary to choose the appellation the less widely known . Preference is also given to English names . Thus , the example of Downing has been followed in the adoption of such names as Blue Gage , Purple Gage , and Echassery , as used by Lindley , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Thompson . The course pursued with foreign names is more fully explained on a future page . Cases of difficulty occur where usage differs with a change of locality . The fruit known as the Butter pear of Pennsylvania , the Virgalieu of New York , and the St. Michael of New England , evidently requiring a general name , the original European appellation of White Doyenne has been chosen . The Ortley or White Detroit apple , furnishes a similar case . Decisions can hardly be satisfactory to all parties , however carefully opposing claims may have been weighed ; and the voice of the public at large can only finally settle such disputed questions . /z/ " THE APPLE , " says Downing , " is the world-renowned fruit of temperate climates . " Although less delicious than the peach or pear , it possesses , from its great hardiness , easy cultivation , productiveness , its long continuance through the whole twelve months , and various uses , an importance not equalled by any other fruit . Its value as a table fruit , or for cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are well known . But its great value and cheapness as food for domestic animals is very imperfectly comprehended or understood . Take for example , a brief estimate : Where land is fifty dollars per acre , an acre of good productive apple trees may be planted and brought into bearing for as much more , making the entire cost one hundred dollars . These will yield , as an average , four hundred bushels annually , or ten bushels per tree , if the best cultivation is given . The annual interest of the orchard , at six per cent. , is six dollars ; the annual cultivation will not exceed six more , or twelve dollars as the cost of the whole crop on the trees , or three cents per bushel . In many fertile parts of the country , where one plowing and two or three harrowings each year would be all the cultivation needed , the cost of the ungathered crop would be only a cent and a half per bushel . The value of sweet apples for cattle and swine has proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land-owner need therefore fear to plant extensively , with a view of being furnished with a copious supply of food for domestic animals , needing not , like other crops , the yearly attention and care of procuring seed and planting . /z/ Raising the Seedlings . The seeds are most easily obtained from the pomace of cider mills . They will make the most thrifty plants , if the apples are selected from the most rapidly growing sorts . The pomace is to be broken up fine , in a large wash tub , mixed with water , stirred , and allowed to stand a few seconds , when the seeds will settle to the bottom , and the apple pulp is then racked off . A man will thus wash out half a bushel of seeds in a day . The clean seeds are more evenly and conveniently sown than in the pomace , which may be done either in autumn or spring . If not done till spring , they should be kept through the winter , mixed with clean , moist sand , or with fine peat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will tend to split the exterior horny covering . If mixed with soil or loam , it will be more difficult to separate the seed in dropping . The seeds may be sown in drills from one to two feet apart , to be kept clean with the hoe . Or where land can be afforded , they may be sown in wide drills , three feet apart , for the cultivator to pass between . When sown in the autumn , on soils which have a large admixture of clay , the seed should be covered with fine muck or peat , to prevent the formation of the crust on such soils , often so hard that the young plants can not rise through it . A compost made of peat and one quarter of its bulk of ashes , is still Letter . If sown in the spring , the seed should be mostly covered with soil , with only a sprinkling of muck on the surface ; otherwise the seeds or young plants may perish by becoming too dry before they are well established . A sprinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seedlings are treated in three different ways . They may be set out into nursery rows in the spring , when a year old , to be budded the second summer ; they may be taken up and root-grafted as soon as large enough ; or they may be planted into rows and grafted at any subsequent period . 1 . Budding . When the young plants are vigorous and the land fertile , the budding may sometimes be done the first year after removal to the nursery rows , but usually the second summer will be found best , when the trees are of sufficient size , and in the highest state of vigor , and /z/ when , as a consequence , the bark will separate freely , and the work be expeditious as we 1 as sure of success . These are headed back the following spring , according to the treatment described in the chapter on budding . 2 . Root- grafting . This is done by whip or tongue grafting , already described on a previous page . When performed on a large scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winter , and before the commencement of the usual spring operations . It is wholly performed within doors , and consequently the seedlings must be taken up the preceding autumn . Most of the part above ground is cut off , to save room , and they are then packed in tight boxes , to be secure from mice , in a common cellar . The usual practice is to fill the interstices among the roots with moist earth ; but pulverised muck is better , as it admits a more easy separation of the tre.es , and they are less covered with grit , and more easily washed . Trees of two years ' growth are usually quite large enough , and sometimes oneyear seedlings will do . When ready to commence grafting , roots enough for one day 's work are taken , the side roots trimmed within about a quarter of an inch of the main root , and they are cut in pieces about four inches long ; the upper piece may have a portion of the stem attached . They are then washed by stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , and taking out small quantities to dry ' , as wanted for use . Scions for half a day 's work are then cut about four inches long , and a portion prepared for setting by cutting the usual slope and tongue at the lower end . The roots are then cut one by one in the same way , and the grafts inserted . The place of union is then covered with grafting wax . This may be applied , either directly in a melted state , with a small brush , which is best and most expeditious ; or by rolling tightly round , a small strip of wax plaster . Tying with strings is wholly needless , if the grafting has been properly done by crowding the tongue and cleft closely together , so that the parts can not be easily displaced . Wax for this purpose , being placed always beneath the surface of the soil , should be softer than for other grafting , to facilitate its more ready application , and to prevent any danger of scorching the bark by heating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil in the wax described under grafting , will accomplish this purpose . When the grafting is completed , the grafted roots are to be packed away in boxes , " till the ground opens . Raisin boxes , or those of similar size , will prove convenient . Fine mould or peat , from the box in which the roots were packed , is sprinkled over the bottom , the grafts are placed in , slanting , in successive layers , and all the spaces filled with mould or peat . A strip of board , with a length equal to the width of the box , to press against each successive layer while applying the mould , is found convenient . The mould should reach within an inch or two of the tops of the grafts , and should be compactly filled among them . During the whole of the work , each heap of grafts must be kept with a label , and every box sufficiently marked , to prevent all possibility of mistake . It is a practice with many cultivators to place the boxes in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of a few inches before setting out . But unless the soil is very favorable , the result is often unsuccessful . As a general rule , for all localities , the grafts should be set out as early as practicable in spring , and before they have made much growth . Waxing is sometimes omitted ; but in light or gravelly soils , and especially if dry weather succeeds , the omission is attended with great loss . The most favorable soils , are rich , rather moist , and rather heavy loams . If light or gravelly , there is more danger from midsummer drouths , which often prove quite destructive . Grafting the whole root entire will much lessen the difficulty . The grafts are most expeditiously set out with a dibble , or a sharp tool , shod with iron or steel , about an inch and a half in diameter , one stroke of which into the mellow soil forms a hole for the roots , and two or three lighter strokes press the earth closely Fig. 100. about them . Fig. 100 represents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the handle of a broken spade . Fig. 101 shows the graft and root , ready for setting out . To keep the whole moist , till sufficient growth takes place , the place of union between the root and graft /z/ should be at least three inches below the surface . Especial care is needed to fill up closely the hole made by the tool , and that no cavity is left about the lower part of the root , which is sometimes done by the inexperienced workman . The chief care afterwards is to keep the ground constantly cultivated , and perfectly clean , which will increase the growth during summer , and exclude mice in winter ; the trees are to be trained up to one leading stem , not trimming so closely as to make them slender ; they are to be kept straight , by tying them when necessary to upright stakes ; and all 101. destructive insects must be watched and destroyed . If the ground is rich and kept perfectly clean , they will grow from one and a half to two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , the second summer ; five to six or seven feet the third summer , when many of them will be large enough for removal to the orchard , and most of the remainder in one year more . If suffered to remain longer in the nursery , they should be taken up and set out again , for the purpose of shortening the long roots , without which subsequent transplanting would be attended with too great a check in the growth , if not actual danger to the tree . Root grafting is extensively performed in large nurseries , but on unsuitable soils , budding is found the most certain of success , the buds being rarely destroyed , and only by the most unfavorable winters . The bud remaining dormant the first summer , the growth is one year later than on grafted stocks of the same age ; but this difference is made up by the more rapid growth of the shoot from the bud , which is usually twice as great as that of a graft on the root . To obtain handsome and good trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches of the ground . An industrious man will set and wax in a day 500 root grafts , or the same number of buds , tying them in for himself . If a careful boy ties the buds after him , 1000 per day will not be a severe task . /z/ Soil . The apple is a vigorous and hardy tree , and will grow upon most soils . It does best however , on those that /z/ are deep , rich and fertile , such as will give good crops of Indian corn . Hard , shallow , and wet grounds are to be avoided . Improvement by manuring , and deep cultivation , is desirable , as a great difference in quality and productiveness results from a difference in fertility . The application of lirne , where not abundant in the soil , is of great importance . Distance . Where the quantity of grour/d is limited and in rare cases , trees may for a time stand within fifteen or twenty feet ; but for large and permanent orchards they should not be nearer than thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of varieties , hence a variation may be allowed . But this variation in distance should not break the rows which are to be preserved for convenience in cultivation . The rows may be kept entire , by varying the distance in one way only , as in the annexed figure . The middle portion is for trees of the largest size , as the Spitzenburgh , Fall Pippin , and Rhode Island Greening ; those of smallest size , as Bough , Yellow Harvest and Sine Qua Non , are on the left ; and those of middle growth , as the Swaar , Black Gilliflower , and Tallman Sweeting , are on the right . /z/ This distinction in the size of the trees , is only necessary in the most extensive orchards . Transplanting . Full directions have been given in a pre ceding chapter , where the superior advantages of broad , deep , and loose beds of earth , made by heavy subsoiling and- manuring , have been pointed out ; or in the absence of this excellent preparation , by digging large holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This care is often thought unnecessary with so hardy a tree as the apple . But a just comparison of the two modes would exhibit its eminent advantages . Take , for instance , the least efficient of the two modes , that of digging large holes . A hundred holes , six feet in diameter , may be dug by a /z/ man in eight days , and filled with muck or rich mould in four days more ; the cost with team , eleven dollars . A hundred small holes may be dug in four days ; cost , three dollars ; difference , against large holes , eight dollars . The trees planted in the large holes would probably yield with good attention , a bushel a tree , in five years , making 100 bushels ; the sixth year 120 bushels ; the seventh , 150 ; the eighth , 190 ; the ninth , 240 ; the tenth , 300 ; total 1000 bushels , worth , at 20 cents , $200 . The other would not probably produce 100 bushels in less than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of large holes , $180 , to balance $8 , against them . Although the calculation can not be precise , it is probably a tolerable approximation , and must appear moderate when the increased size of the trees and superiority of the crop for many years afterwards is taken into account . The objection that such work must be done at a very busy season of the year , may be obviated by digging the holes and filling them at some other time . /z/ The importance of thorough cultivation , has been already aoticed , and can not be too well understood . If two specimens could be exhibited side by side , the one showing the stunted , lingering , mice-eaten and moss-covered trees , : aused by neglect ; and the other , the vigorous and thrifty growth , and the fair and abundant crops , resulting from ine and clean culture ; none could fail to be satisfied of the superiority of the one arid impolicy of the other . /z/ As soon as the first symptom of failure in old orchards ppears , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manured in connexion with the application of lime or leached ashes , as directed already under the head of Special Manures . The change which may be thus wrought , can hardly be understood by one who has not witnessed the result . The following experiment , similar in nature , but differing in the mode of performance , described by H. W. Rockwell , of Utica , N.Y. , can not fail to be interesting : * /z/ " The experiment was performed upon three trees standing in my grounds , none of which were less than thirty years old . One of these trees , an old-fashioned Nevvtown Pippin , and a great favorite , had borne moderately ; the other two made out between them , to " get up " about a dozen apples a year , just to let me know , I presume , that they " could do it , " but were perfectly indifferent how it was done . " I , last summer , undertook the renovation of these trees . For this purpose , I opened between them trenches , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about eight feet equidistant from tree to tree . The roots which were encountered in this operation , were , of course , all cut off , the trenches filled with well rotted manure , and closed . I finished by giving each of the trees about a peck of charcoal mixed with the same quantity of ashes , and now for the result . I have this year gathered from the " two outcasts " just mentioned , instead of my annual dividend of a dozen apples , from six to eight bushels a piece of as handsome fruit as you ever saw , with about the same proportion from the third , which has always been a moderate bearer . " Pruning . The mode of treating large trees , has been already adverted to in the chapter on pruning . There are some owners of orchards who most erroneously suppose that when trees become old , heavy pruning will restore their vigor in the absence of good cultivation ; while the correct mode of treatment , is , very modern 102. rate . an ? gradual pruning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct portraits of actually existing specimens of bad pruning , unhappily have too many originals over the country ; fig. 102 . This /z/ Fig. 1C3. most unsightly mode of trimming is often adopted when a removal of the top by grafting is intended . Grafting new tops on old trees . It often happens that fruit on large trees is worthless , and it becomes an important object to change the top by grafting or budding it with some better variety . In this case , instead of cutting off large branches and grafting them at once , it is better to prune the top in part , as shown by fig. 103 , which will cause an emission of vigorous shoots . These are then budded or grafted with ease and success . And , as the grafts gradually extend by growth , the remainder of the top may , by successive excisions , be entirely removed . Where trees are not too old , and the ground is kept cultivated , good sized trees are thus obtained much sooner than by setting out young ones . To give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to prevent the branches from shooting upwards in a close body near the ceritre of the tree , the old horizontal boughs should be allowed to extend to a distance in each direction , while the upright ones should be lopped . This is distinctly exhibited in fig 103 . The following judicious mode of renewing the old tops of trees formerly regarded as worthless , is given by George Olmsted , of Hartford , Ct. , in the Horticulturist : " These trees I commenced grafting six years ago last spring . I began on the top , and grafted one-third of the tree each year . It therefore required three years to complete the entire heads of the trees . " I like this method better than any I have ever tried for grafting large trees , as it gives the grafts a good opportunity to get well started . Cutting off and grafting the top first , gives the grafts there the best possible chance , while the necessary reduction of the top throws the sap into the remaining side branches , which fits them well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest branches being made ready in the same way , may be grafted success- /z/ fully . By this mode , it will be seen that when the grafts are put in on the side branches , they are not shaded by the heavy shoots above them , and they have an unusual supply of nourishment to carrry them forward . Those who have attempted to graft the whole head of a large tree at once , are best aware of the great difficulty in the common mode of getting the grafts to take on the side limbs . " One of these large trees so treated , is probably more than 75 years old , and has now an entirely new and vigorous head , grafted with this excellent variety . When I began with it , the fruit was only fit for cider , and it was questionable whether the tree should not be cut down . By grafting it in this manner , I have added surprisingly to its value . Two years ago , ( the bearing year , ) I obtained from it 10 bushels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , ( only six years from the time I began to graft it , ) I gathered 28 bushels of excellent fruit ! ; I consider this tree now worth $100 ; the cost of grafting it was about $5 ; and the latter was all repaid two years ago the first season the grafts bore fruit . " The bearing year of apple trees which yield excessive crops , is only every alternate year ; but by thinning out a large portion of the fruit while yet small , the exhaustion will not be so great as to render the tree barren the second season , and it will bear annually . By picking off all the young fruit , the bearing year may be entirely changed , or one bough may be made to bear one year , and another bough the second year . /z/ It is of great consequence in gathering all kinds of fine fruit , to avoid bruising ; the high quality of some sorts is nearly destroyed by carelessness , and they are rendered unfit for home use or for market . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most convenient . They should be filled sufficiently to cause a slight pressure when the barrel head is put in , to prevent rattling ; and the barrels should rest on their sides and not on the ends . Winter fruit has been preserved with great success and with much freshness , by alternating the layers of apples in the barrel /z/ with layers of dry chaff mixed with a small portion of dry pulverised lime . Apples may be well kept till spring , if buried late in autumn ; but to prevent swelling , cracking , and a loss of flavor , they should be placed in a box or on a bed of straw , and entirely excluded from contact with the damp earth . Where cool cellars are at hand , they are kept best for winter use on large shelves . The mode of gathering and packing apples for exportation , as practiced by R. L. Pell , of Ulster county , N. Y. , who obtains nine or ten dollars per barrel for his Newtown Pippins in the English markets , will serve as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In autumn , when the apple harvest commences , men are employed , each with a hand basket and hook , to attach the basket to a limb of a tree , and a step ladder . The apples are picked one at a time , and laid into the basket . When the basket is full the man cornes down from the tree and takes two apples at at a time and places them in two-bushel baskets . When there are enough large baskets filled for a load , they are lifted by two men on a sled , and drawn by oxen to a large building , where they are taken from the sled and put on the floor , two apples at a time . They are piled up 18 or 20 inches high , where they remain three weeks . At the end of this time , the apples having become dry , they are taken Uvo at a time and packed in new barrels , the size and kind of those used for flour . The barrels being headed up are lifted on a sled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by men on board a steamboat and taken to New- York . When shipped on board a vessel for London , the barrels are hoisted one at a time from the steamboat , and when lowered on board the vessel are caught on a man 's shoulder , and then taken by two men and placed in the coolest part of the vessel . " Upon the arrival of the vessel in London , the barrels are hoisted from the vessel and lowered on a hand-barrow , and then carried by two men to the warehouse , in the same manner that we carry a looking-glass . " It is seen that by the foregoing precautions the apples are never shaken , jolted , or jarred , and they arrive in London in far better order than apples usually taken to our city markets . /z/ " Apples for shipping have sometimes been packed in charcoal dust , dry sand , and at other times separately wrapped in paper , in the same manner as oranges are shipped , but they can be shipped with as much success without anything with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In shipping fruit , none but the very best should be sent ; all that are small , imperfect , or the least bruised , should be rejected . Those persons who pay from nine to twenty-one dollars per barrel for apples , expect to have the best. * " /z/ 7he . Caterpillar , ( Clisiocampa Americana . ) This has been a most serious enemy to the apple in most parts of the country . It has its seasons of increase and decrease . Some years it has nearly stripped whole orchards ; and again it has diminished in numbers in successive years , till few could be found . There are many species which feed on the apple leaf ; but the only one of importance , is that known as the com " mon orchard caterpillar , which is hatched in spring as soon as the leaf buds begin to open . At this time , it is not the tenth of an inch long , nor so large as a cambric needle , but it continues to increase constantly in size for several weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch in diameter . It then spins a cocoon and passes to the pupa state . In the latter part of summer , it comes out a yellowish brown miller , lays its eggs and dies . The eggs are deposited in cylinders or rings , containing three to five hundred each , encircling the smaller branches , and usually within a few inches of the extremity . The accompanying figure ( fig. 104 , ) represents one of these masses of eggs of the natural size . They remain through winter , protected from the weather by a vesicular water-proof varnish , and hatch in spring , as just stated . Each collection of eggs , makes a nest of caterpillars . B. G. Boswell . Fig. 104. /z/ One nest is enough to defoliate a large branch , and when several are on a tree , the size and quality of the fruit is seriously lessened . The best mode for their destruction , is to cut off the small branches which hold the eggs during autumn or winter , and commit them to the fire . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of clipping-shears , worked by a cord ; or a sharp hooked knife , on the end of a pole , will answer nearly as well . The eggs are seen at a glance , after a little practice ; a cloudy day should be selected to prevent pain to the eyes . If this work is done just at the moment the eggs are hatching , it will be equally efficacious , and the webs or downy covering of the young insect ? , render them conspicuous . Every nest of eggs thus removed , which is done in a few seconds , totally prevents a nest of caterpillars in the spring , and is far more expeditious and effectual than the usual modes of brushing off the caterpillars with poles , brushes , or washing them with soap-suds , ley , or white-wash . The Borer . ( Saperda bivittata . ) This insect enters the tree and cuts into the solid wood near the surface of the earth . It is a dangerous enemy ; for while only a few small holes are perceived in the bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all directions and reduced it to a mass of powder . It has not yet become very extensively spread , but in some parts of the country it has become a most serious evil , and has been allowed to multiply till it has destroyed whole orchards . The perfect insect is a brown and white striped beetle , about half an inch long , which flies at night . It deposits its eggs late in spring or the first of summer , in the bark near the surface of the ground , and sometimes in the forks of the branches . The first indication of its presence , is the appearance of numerous small round holes , as if the bark had been perforated by buck-shot . These holes will soon become more visible by the ejected dust . It is nearly impossible to save a tree , unless taken early . At the first , " the insect may be cut out with the point of a knife . If deeper in the wood , it may be extracted by a flexible barbed wire , or punched to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the insect from emerging and laying its eggs , it is doubly important that this be done early in the spring ; but the trees should be repeatedly examined at other periods of the year . To prevent the entrance of the borer , remove the soil a little about the roots , and then wash the whole trunk and larger forks of the branches , with a mixture of tobacco water , soft soap , and flour of sulphur . The proportions are , a pint of the sulphur , a gallon of soft soap , and enough tobacco water to reduce the whole to the consistence of paint . This should be done in spring , before the insect lays its eggs . It is stated by A. J. Downing , that this mixture is so offensive to the insect in its winged state , that no tree was touched which had been coated with it ; although the coating had been on for several weeks . He also recommends injecting , by a syringe , this liquid into the holes ; and plugging up the holes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to prevent the escape of the perfect insect . Not only the apple tree , but the quince , mountain ash , and hawthorn , suffer greatly from the attacks of this insect . The Canker worm . ( Anisopteryx pometaria . ) This caterpillar appears to have been as yet chiefly confined in its destructive ravages , to portions of New-England . The accompanying figures represent the perfect insect , the male with wings , the female nearly destitute . ( Fig. 105 . ) The canker worm attacks both fruit and leaves ; when numerous , the small webs they make , added to the destruction of the foliage , give the tree the appearance Fig. 105. of having been scorched . The re- medies consist in various contrivances to prevent the female insects ascending the tree , but none have been yet discovered of easy , safe , and effectual application . One of the best is to encircle the trunk with a canvass belt , coated with a mixture of tar and train oil . The mixture needs repeatedly renewing . Applying the tar directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Apple-worm , ( Carpocapsa pnmonana , ) attacks the fruit , oy entering at the blossom , and feeding at the core . In some Fig. 106. years , it has been so common , as seriously to injure the quality of the crop . The best preventive is to allow swine to pick up the wormy fruit as it falls , thus destroying the enclosed insect , and preventing its spread . The above figures , ( 106 , ) exhibit the apple-worm in its different stages ; a , the larva ; &,; the same magnified ; c , the cocoon ; f , the pupa within the cocoon ; e , / , the perfect insects ; g , the young larva , just hatched , after having been deposited within the calyx ; h , i , k , / , the progressive work of the larva within the apple , till it escapes. * The Wooly Aphis , ( Aphis lanigera , ) a European insect , falsely termed American blight , is a species of aphis or plant-louse , covered with long , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive ; and on young trees in this country it has done some injury . It is destroyed by whale-oil soap , and by lime-wash . Other species of aphis often infest the young leaves ; they are easily killed by a solution of whale-oil soap , which may be applied by a syringe or by immersing the branches . * The curcnlio or plum weevil , when very numerous , attacks the apple , and its peculiar - re ? ceiir-'haped incision* may be perceived on the skin of tender varieties . The larva , however , rarely readies the core . But the apple worm never attacks the plum , which has no permanent calyx for the lodgment of its eggs . /z/ The Blight , which sometimes kills the terminal shoots of the branches , has been variously ascribed to the sting of an insect , and to the effects of weather . The cause does not appear to have been satisfactorily ascertained . It rarely proves a formidable disaster , although trees are occasionally much disfigured by it , and temporarily checked in growth . The Bark-louse ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple and pear trees , may be destroyed by soap- wash or ley , applied early in summer . /z/ May be prevented by a small mound or bank of fresh earth , thrown up to the height of a foot around each tree , late in autumn , to be removed in spring . Trees laid-in or buried in a trench for keeping through winter , are sometimes seriously injured by the attacks of mice . This may be safely guarded against by placing the trees more nearly in an upright position , and banking up a foot high on all sides . /z/ This subject has been treated , as applied to fruits generally in a former part of this work ; a few brief remarks on the variations in the apple may be interesting . The winter apples of the northern states , when cultivated further south , are changed to autumn apples ; and as far south as Georgia , some of our good keepers ripen nearly by the end of summer . The Baldwin and Rhode Island Greening at Cincinnati and at St. Louis , cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the northern apples which succeed well as keepers as far south as Carolina . This is owing to the long southern summers . It has been found that varieties originated in the southern states are generally best adapted to the climate of that region . Some varieties are greatly influenced by a change of climate , and others but slightly . The Ribston Pippin , so excellent at Montreal , is of little value a few degrees further south . The Rhode Island Greening and the Roxbury Russet , on suitable so ; ls , throughout New- York and New-England , present the same characteristics of flavor and appearance ; the Baldwin , so fine at the east , greatly deteriorates /z/ in northern Ohio ; and the Belmont , which has been pronounced the most valuable of all apples at Cleveland , is unworthy of cultivation at Cincinnati . These changes in the latter instances , are however to be ascribed to a difference in soil ; and the application of special manures , as lime potash , &c.,; on those unfavorable soils , has restored their quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are intended to apply to the northern states . A diference of about two or three weeks exists between fruits cultivated at Boston and Rochester , and in central Ohio and southern Pennsylvania , and other differences of latitude nearly in the same ratio . /z/ Division I.

Greatly excelling the apple in these particulars , it falls below it in importance only in consequence of the less uniformly healthy habit of the tree . /z/ The best trees are raised from seedling stocks ; suckers , unless unusually furnished with fibrous roots , are of crooked , one-sided , and stunted growth . Seedling pears are more difficult to raise than those of any other kind of fruit ; and the many disasters to which the young trees are liable , have caused a great and general deficiency , in the midst of an abundant supply of trees of other kinds in the nurseries of this country . Raising the Se &dlings.; The seeds , after separation from the fruit , should be kept in the way already given for appleseeds , by mixing with sand or muck . The soil for the seedbed , should be unusually-deep and fertile , rather damp than otherwise , and should have a good manuring with lime and ashes , and an abundant supply of peat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nature with this ingredient . A correspondent of the Horticulturist states that he has been eminently successful by the following practice : First make a deep trench with the plow , and finish to the required depth with the spade two feet not less . The compost used to fill the trench is made of half a peck of iron filings or blacksmith 's cinders , with half a peck of slaked lime , and half a peck of wood ashes , and a peck each of swamp muck and barn-yard manure , thoroughly mixed.with /z/ a bushel of soil into a compost . J. Washburn , of Plymouth , Mass. , also furnishes the following statement : " I have a fine lot of pear seedlings , which were very copiously manured with compost in the following proportions : one load of muck , two loads of stable manure , two barrels of iron ' rust , one barrel of bone-dust , and two barrels of wood ashes . The whole was composted early in autumn applied in the fall and the seed sown the first of May . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with stable manure , have produced plants that rusted badly , and are not one quarter the size of the first lot , which are fine , strong stocks . " The mode of sowing the seeds may be the same as that described for the apple , in drills one to two feet apart . The more thinly they are sown , the less will be the danger of disaster from the leaf blight ; and for this reason , drills near together , with the seeds somewhat sparingly scattered in them , will be found best . The leaf-blight is the most serious evil met with in the cultivation of pear seedlings . Its immediate cause has not been satisfactorily explained . It is more formidable in some seasons than in others . Commencing about midsummer , sometimes earlier , but more frequently later , it is first indicated by the leaves in certain parts of the seed-beds turning brown ; in a few days they fall off ; other portions of the beds are successively attacked , till all the seedlings become more or less denuded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil . As a necessary consequence , growth immediately ceases ; and if they are attacked early , and have made but little previous growth , they are nearly ruined , and few will survive the succeeding winter , for they never make a second growth the same year of any value . But if their previous growth has been vigorous , and the blight appears late in summer , much less injury is sustained . The best remedy is the high cultivation , with special manures , already described . Wintering the young seedlings . The frequent destruction of the trees the first winter , is another serious evil . The danger is least with those that have made the best well ripened growth ; hence it becomes very important to secure healthful vigor by the adoption of the compost and /z/ cultivation previously mentioned . But in many localities , pear seedlings , which are always remarkably free from fibrous or lateral roots the first year , are drawn out by the freezing of the soil , and either destroyed or greatly injured . Several modes have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to a greater or less extent . One , is to induce the emission of lateral roots , by taking up the young seedlings from the thickly sown beds , early in the season and as soon as four leaves have appeared , cut off their tap roots , and reset them in the nursery rows . Robert Nelson , of Newburyport , Mass. , has pursued this course with great success ; but its general utility may be questioned , except during a rainy period or on favorable soils , unless abundant watering is given . A more easy as well as safe mode would perhaps be to cut off the tap roots , at the same age , by means of a sharp spade thrust beneath the soil , and without transplanting . Neither of these modes could be successfully applied except to large , vigorous seedlings , growing in a deep , rich soil . But where the growth of lateral roots has not been effected , and the consequent danger greater , of their being drawn upwards by frost , much protection may be given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of several inches ; and if the rows are near each other , and the trees several inches or a foot high , they will prevent the leaves from being swept off by the winds . The incursion of mice may be avoided by placing the seed-beds as near as practicable to the middle of a clean plowed field , and by encircling the ground with a bank or ridge of fresh earth , thrown up for this purpose , about a foot high . Mice will not pass such a boundary under the snow . Taking up the seedlings late in autumn , and burying them in a cellar , or laying them in by the roots and nearly covering the whole stems , will preserve them safely ; but this mode is liable to the objection of the check in growth necessarily given in transplanting . Budding and Grafting may be performed the second summer if the stocks have made a good growth . The management of the young trees is the same as with apples , by grafting or budding near the surface of the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pear /z/ stocks are valuable , budding is to be preferred to grafting , because it may be repeated in case of failure . For the same reason , root-grafting the pear is not adopted , especially as slightly unfavorable causes are apt to produce far greater failures of such grafts than with the apple . Propagation by Layers , giving every tree roots of its own kind , is easily effected by bending down a vigorous and thickly branched tree , and making layers of every good shoot . In two years at furtherest they will furnish well rooted young plants . /z/ For orchard culture , and in most parts of the country where the pear flourishes with great vigor and proves highly productive , pear stocks will doubtless always be found greatly preferable to all others . The advantages of a dwarf growth on dissimilar stocks , have been already pointed out under the head stocks . Such trees are not so long-lived as on pear roots , and they require more thorough and fertile culture , and care in pruning . But they have some important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a fifth part of the ground , thriving in many soils where pear stocks will not , and in a few instances improving the quality of the fruit . The stocks for dwarfs , which have been more or less used , are the mountain ash , the apple , the thorn , and the quince . Nearly all the experiments with the mountain ash have sooner or later proved failures . Budded or grafted upon apple seedlings , pears sometimes make a feeble growth for a few years ; but unless the grafts themselves throw out roots , by planting beneath the surface , they sooner or later perish . It sometimes happens that grafts of a few varieties inserted at standard height , grow and bear for a series of years . But experiments of this sort are not to be recommended , the few instances of success only forming exceptions to a general rule . The thorn has been extensively used in England , and to some extent in this country , with considerable success . But all other kinds of dissimilar stocks have given way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for general use to any other . Of the different sorts of quince , the Orange quince has proved the best . /z/ The varieties of the pear do not grow with equal facility upon the quince . A few , as the Duchesse d'Angouleme , Louise Bonne of Jersey , and Beurre Diel , are so much improved in quality that their cultivation on pear stocks is wholly discontinued by skilful fruit growers . A larger number flourish well , but are little changed in quality , as White Doyenne and Dearborn 's Seedling . A few , on the other hand , succeed badly or wholly refuse to grow upon quince stocks , without double working , which consists in first budding some freely growing pear upon the quince bottom , and then budding or grafting the " refractory " sort into the pear shoot . As a general rule , double-worked trees do not flourish for a great length of time . Single-worked have done well for 30 or 40 years under favorable influences . The following list , made out chiefly from the combined experience of European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dwarf pears : Pears succeeding best on the quince . Louise Bonne of Jersey , Long Green of Jlutumn , Beurre Diel , ' Early Rousselet , Duchesse d'dngouleme , Stevens ' Genesee , Easter Beurre , Fortunee , Beurrt d'dmalis , Glout Morceau , Vicar of Winkfield , Chauiuontelle .

Urbaniste , The result is not always the same in different soils and in different seasons . The Seckel , for instance , has wholly failed in one year , and in another , on the same spot of ground , has grown well . The White Doyenn ; grew finely one summer , and almost totally failed the next . Some sorts which in nearly all cases do well , occasionally prove unsuccessful . A few , uniformly , in all seasons and in all soils , make a rapid and vigorous growth , of which the Louise Bonne of Jersey is perhaps the most striking example ; some others , again , invariably fail , ( unless doubleworked , ) the most prominent among which stands the Beurre Bosc . Indeed , so averse is this variety to a union with the quince , that it is by no means certain that it may not soon fail if worked in whatever manner . In some places , however , double-working has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked and blighted on the pear . Both this and the Flemish Beauty , as w r ell as the Marie Louise , and some others , succeed well when grafted on the hawthorn . The changes wrought by the quince stock , are often important and interesting . T. Rivers states that the Beurre d'Arernberg ripens several w r eeks earlier in winter ; that the Easter Beurre is rendered more productive and matures its fruit , while on the pear it is a bad bearer , and does not ripen ; that the Fortunee is a " perfect crab " upon the pear , but on the quince is melting and juicy ; that the Glout Morceau is imperfect and ripens badly on the pear , but is always fair and attains a high and mature flavor on quince . As a general effect , the size of the fruit is increased , but in a few cases it is rendered more gritty in texture . Unfavorable soils occasionally preclude the cultivation of some pears , but for the favorable influence of the stock . /z/ Thus , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other places , the White Doyenn6 only succeeds well upon the quince . The stocks of dwarf pears should be wholly beneath the surface to avoid the borer , which avoids the pear . Pruning Dwarf Pears . Dwarf pear trees are usually pruned into the pyramidal and conical form , the latter only differing in its broader shape . The annexed figure exhibits these forms distinctly . The principle to be adopted in pruning has been already explained on page 90 ; the extent to which it must be carried , should be such as to keep the trees within ten or twelve feet in height , and from four to six feet in diameter at the base . A greater height increases the difficulty of pruning . The same reason forbids the adoption of a head with a clean stem below , as in common standards . The pyramidal mode of pruning may be applied to pear trees upon pear stocks , provided the luxuriance of growth is retarded by a triennial root-pruning . Without this , it would be difficult to prevent too great a growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vigor , and sufficient fruit fulness would not be induced . Dwarf trees may be planted at a distance of six to ten feet apart . They will always need careful attention to pruning , and to thorough and enriched cultivation of the ground . Horizontal training , for walls or espaliers , is ** very rarely practiced or needed in this country . " " " It is occasionally employed in limited gar- i * f* i dens , to torm bounciaFi - 158 - ries of walks , without occupying much lateral space , and where it is desired to Fig. 157. /z/ grow large and fine specimens of fruit by strong exposure to the sun . The mode may be briefly understood by the accompanying figure representing a partly grown tree . As the tree advances , shoots will be produced from the sides of the horizontal arms ; these must be stopped or pinched off early in summer , to prevent their drawing too hard on the rest of the tree , and a similar course pursued with them to that described on page 90 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spurs supporting fruit-buds , are to be cut closely off wherever too thick for an even crop . Early in autumn the shortened shoots are to be cut down , leaving the fruit-buds , only , to bear the next season . By this regularity of pruning , the tree will preserve a neat appearance , and bear regular crops . The horizontal branches may be about one foot apart for large pears , and eight inches for small ; and the trees , if on quince roots , may be about 10 feet apart . /z/ Nearly all pears ripen with a much finer flavor if picked and matured in the house . The exceptions are very few . Some , which prove only second or third rate when allowed to remain till they soften on the tree , become rich , melting , and delicious if house-ripened . Gathering the fruit while yet hard , will in nearly all cases prevent or greatly diminish the rotting at the core , which otherwise nearly destroys the value of many early sorts . Winter pears should hang upon the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be kept in a cool room till near their usual period of maturity , when the ripening is to be completed in a warm room , at a temperature of 60 or 70 degrees . They should be kept covered to prevent shrivelling . Some cultivators have wholly repudiated winter pears , merely from a want of skill in the management of their ripening , or the want of a good cellar to keep them in . Some sorts , however , as the Beurra d'Aremberg , require but little care ; others , as the Vicar of Winkfield need particular attention . But the transfer from the cool to the warm room is of great importance to most , and will convert tough and hard specimens into those which are juicy , melting , and excellent . /z/ Blight . A most formidable difficulty in the cultivation of the pear , is the blight , known in its modifications , supposed or real , by the names fire-blight , insect-blight , frost-blight , and frozen sap-blight . The causes may be various , but the apearances are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on certain limbs during rapid growth , and while the rest of the tree remains apparently in full vigor , the evil extending downwards , unless naturally or artificially checked , till the whole tree is destroyed . After a close investigation for years , by the most skilful cultivators of the country , a satisfactory explanation , applicable to all cases , has not been made . The earlier theory was , that the hot rays of the sun produced the disaster , and hence the original name fire-blight . This was confirmed by the fact that the blight was often most fatal in the hottest summers ; and weakened by the opposing fact that shaded portions of the tree were as frequently attacked as those fully exposed to the action of the hot sun . It was subsequently discovered that a small insect , ( Scolytis pyri , ) by the supposed infusion of poison , caused the death of the branches , but no general or wide destruction of the pear could be traced to this source . More recently , the frozen-sap theory has been extensively adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A damp and warm autumn causes a late and unripened growth of wood , imperfectly able to withstand the effects of winter . It is acted upon by severe frosts , not , however , so as to produce immediate death or winter-killing , but so as to result , sooner or later , in disease and partial decomposition of the sap , by which it becomes poisonous in its nature , and by passing downwards through the bark , spreads death in its progress. * This theory is corroborated by many local observations , and by the general fact that the blight is much more de- * A modification of the frozen-sap blight , known sometimes by the name of frostblight , occurs early in summer , immediately after unusuul and sharp nocturnal frosts . The young and tender shoots and the branches below them , are observed to die suddenly wiihiu a few days , but protracted in some instances to several weeks . The sap from the dead limbs does not in this case appear ' to be so deleterious as in other forms of blight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently escape after a partial loss of their tops . /z/ structive in the warm and fertile valleys of southern Ohio , where vegetation continues late , is more succulent in its texture , and where the frosts are sudden and sharp , than in the dryer and cooler climate of New England . But this same reason is also adduced in support of the original fireblight theory , and indeed it applies with strength to both . But after admitting that the different theories may be in part correct , and that the blight may be caused by a combination in a greater or less degree of each assigned cause , we are driven to the conclusion , from a large number of observations , of which these limits wholly preclude even a brief recital , that the cause of the blight , like that of the potato disease , remains hi : ! in a large number of instances from our knowledge . And that , whether the latent tendency to disease is only increased and developed by changes of the Weather , or whether those changes actually produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the remedy is not obscured in uncertainty . For whether by an insect , or by the poisonous influence of the descending juices , its progress must be arrested by an immediate excision of the dead branches . And , as the poison passes downwards some time before its effects are visible externally , the amputation must be made two or three feet below the affected part , if the poison as well as the dead part , is to be removed . Equally necessary is it , that the infection of the diseased limbs be removed as speedily as possible out of the way , by burning . This remedy can not be effectual , unless very promptly and fearlessly applied . Many cultivators , in fear of mutilating their trees , do not cut low enough , and leave the seeds of death remaining in the tree . Others delay the application of the remedy for a number of days , till cure is hopeless . In extensive and malignant cases , the disaster may be difficult to subdue even by the most prompt measures ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , it will be better to cut away and burn by successive portions a whole tree , than to lose it entire by this disease , a result equally certain , with the added evil of spreading the malady . Two contiguous neighbors had each a large pear orchard ; one of them neglectei all attention , the other spent ten /z/ minutes daily in the examination of all his trees , and incutting out freshly diseased limbs . The former lost many entire trees ; the latter saved every one , and kept his orchard nearly clear . Young trees in close rows have been attacked successively till all perished ; in other rows where the affected trees were quickly removed , few of the remainder suffered . Washing the affected parts with a solution of potash and sulphate of iron , ( or copperas , ) has in some cases arrested the disease , or destroyed the peculiar fermented odor which attends its more malignant forms , and by which , perhaps , it is sometimes spread . Among preventives , a good , rich , firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripening of the wood , and adverse to a late succulent growth , hold unimportant rank . The bark of the pear is evidently of a very delicate structure , and it becomes more able to resist changes and disease as the growth is moderately vigorous , and healthy and matured . The attempt has been made to select those varieties least liable to blight , but results vary so exceedingly , that nearly all efforts have proved fruitless . But among those which have escaped in the largest number of instances may be named , first , the Seckel , which is scarcely ever destroyed even at Cincinnati , and the White Doyenne . The Madeleine and Passe Colmar appear to be more liable than the majority of sorts . Dwarf pear trees are not usually so subject to blight as others . Cracking of the fruit has been ahead ? 1 adverted to under the head of soils and special manures , and the remedy pointed out .

Section III . Small . /z/ The quality of pears is remarkably liable to change from external causes . A difference in soil and cultivation exerts so great an influence with many fine sorts , that while they possess the highest flavor when growing on favorable ground kept rich and mellow , they become greatly inferior or even worthless in poor soil with neglected culture . Besides these , there are other influences dependant on a change of locality , all of which taken together , have contributed to the great diversity of opinion which exists in relation to many celebrated varieties . The experienced pomologist will hence perceive the difficulty of weighing evidence for and against the different sorts , and of expressing a degree of quality that shall coincide with the opinions of all . It will be understood , that the quality given on the following pages , refers only to pears tested in this country . Some European varieties , which maintain a high character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing pears , it may be well to repeat that the term base applies in all cases to the part nearest the tree ; and apex , to the part most remote . This is in accordance with universal practice among eminent botanists . The apex is usually termed the crown ; and it is sufficiently evident that the crown ( upper portion or surmounting part , can not at the same time be the base . /z/ Fig. 154 Bartktt .
