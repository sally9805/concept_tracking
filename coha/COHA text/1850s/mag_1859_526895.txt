A BUNDLE OF OLD LETTERS . To struggle painfully for years , spending all of life 's energies for others , and then to be forgotten by those for whom all was hazarded and consumed , is a lot demanding the most unselfish aims . Yet this befell many a suffering patriot in our Revolutionary struggle . The names of those who were the leaders in battle and in council , men whose position in the field or whose words in Congress gave them a country 's immortality , have remained bright in our memory . But others there were who cheerfully surrendered eminence in their private walks and happiness in social life to endure the hardships of a protracted contest till life was spent , and who , from the very nature of the services they rendered , have remained in obscurity . They would not themselves repine at this ; for they gave their strength , not for their country 's applause , but their country 's good . They sought , not our remembrance , but our freedom . In many an old garret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are wornout , faded letters , telling of struggles and hopes in that long contest , that would make their writers ' names bright on the nation 's record , were not the number of those who rendered that our golden age so countless . Pious is the task of tracing the services of some revered ancestor , who gave whatever he had to give , when his country called , but whose name is not now remembered . Those days are fast becoming to our younger race almost mythical , so that every living word from the actors in them is of use in vivifying scenes that else would seem dim fable . From a somewhat bulky bundle of yellow , tattered letters , long cherished with fond and filial care , a few are selected to interest the readers of the " Atlantic , " who , it is supposed , will first be glad to know a little about their writer . Dr. Isaac Foster was born in Charlestown , Massachusetts , on the 28th of August , 1740. his father , in early life a sea-captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for many years a prominent citizen of Charlestown , participating largely in the measures that preceded and led to the Revolution . At the age of eighteen , Dr. Foster graduated at Harvard , in the class of 1 758 . He then studied medicine under Dr. Lloyd of Boston , and afterwards completed his studies in England . lIe married , as his first wife , Martha , daughter of Thaddens Mason of Cambridge , and at her death , some years later , Mary , daughter of Richard Russell of Charlestown . In his profession he achieved a considerable reputation , acquired a large practice , and numbered among his pupils Doctors Bartlett , Welch , and Eustis . But while he was working his way to position and influence , more exciting themes began to attract his attention . With the earliest signs of comino conflict he took a determined stand on the Colonial side . In the town-meetings of the day he seems to have been prominent , and his name appears on most of the important committees appointed by the town in reference to public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1772 , the Committee of Correspondence in Boston called upon the other towns " to stand firm as one man , " his name is found upon a committee appointed to answer this letter and prepare instructions to the representative of the town in the General Court. * He was also one of a committee appointed to consult with the committees of other towns concerning the * pected importation of a quantity of tea . This was Kovember 24th . On the 22d of December of the same year , a petition numerously signed was presented to the selectmen , asking that a meeting might be called to take some effectual incas5* Fzo*rnINonAWs History of Charlestoum , p. 286. // ures to prevent the consumption of tea . Among the signatures is Dr. Foster's. * He was elected a delenate to the Convention in the County of Middlesex , in August , 1 774 , and a member of the first Provincial Congress of Massachusetts , in October , of the same year . Early in 17 75 , he was appointed a surgeon , and was , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while General Ward commanded at Cambridge . The day after the battle of Concord , at the urgent request of General Ward and Dr. Warren , he gave up his private practice , then very large , to attend the wounded . On the 18th of June , he was appointed by the Committee of Safety to attend the men wounded on the previous day at the battle of Bunker 's Hill . He was soon after al ) pointed Surgeon of the State Hospital , and by General Washington , on the discovery of the treachery of Dr. Church , in October , DirectorGeneral , pro tern. , of the American Hospital Department . Congress soon nominated to this post Dr. John Morgan of Philadelphia , Dr. Foster remaining as the oldest surgeon in the hospital . It seemed necessary , before selecting some of Dr. Foster 's letters , to give this account of his earlier life , to show that he was no soldier of fortune or eleventhhour laborer , but that his sympathies were enlisted and his aid given among the earliest of the friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , wealth , and professional fame , and abandoned home and ease , at what seemed to him the call of his country . The first extracts shall be from a letter to his wife , dated " New Y k , *S*unday , P. M. , June 2 , 1776 . " My DEAR POLLY , " I received your kind letter of the 27th last , and thank you for your ready acceptance of my invitation to come to me . Indeed , my dear , you could not have given a stronger proof of your SE FRoTRiNGwAM 's ifs y of Charlestown , p. 293. affection for me . Heaven only knows what dangers and difficulties you may be exposed to in this undertaking ; hut it shall be my constant endeavor to keep you out of the way of danger , and procure the best accommodation for you this country affords . If mother will add to her former kindness by taking the charge of our children , it will greatly ease my mind ; and as our enemies have , by their wanton barbarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Colonies at large , I believe von will be as safe and happy with or near me as anywhere . " The night before last , the city was much alarmed . A signal had been made from one of the islands of the arrival of a ship to join the small fleet at the Hook . Some one raised this to a large number of transports with the expected German forces ; some of the Tories here had the impudence to affirm they had seen eleven sail . When I came from the hospital to my lodging , in the evening , I found the neighborhood in confusion , the women talking of and preparing for flight . I thought it my duty to wait on General Putnam , who at present commands here in my way , I met Major Webb , who acquainted me with the truth of the matter . Upon this occasion , I could not help thinking I should go to my post with much more alacrity , if I might have the pleasure of seeing you again first . " Your affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short extract from a letter to he father , bearing ( late June 6th , 1776 . Speaking of his wife , he says : - " I wish she may have a pleasant journey , and arrive here in season to see the city before our enemies attack us . We are in daily expectation of them , and tolerably prepared to receive them . I am under no apprehension of their being able to get footing here ; but if they behave with spirit , the city must suffer in the contest . " The next is also to his father . 1859.1 551 // " New York , July 7th , 1776 . " HoNORED SIR , " It is with the greatest pleasure I embrace this opportunity of congratulating you on the most important event that has happened since the commencement of hostilities . On Tuesday , the 2nd inst. , the Honorable the Continental Congress declared the Thirteen United Colonies free and independent States . This Declaration is to be published at Philadelphia to-morrow , with all the pomp and solemnity proper on such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to have the pleasure of proclaiming it to the British fleet , now riding at anchor in full view between this city and Staten Island , by a feu de joie from our musketry , and a general discharge of the cannon on our works . This step , whatever some lukewarm would-be-thought friends or concealed enemies m*y think , the cruel oppression , the wanton , insatiable revenge of the British Administration , the venality of its Parliament and Electors , and the unaccountable inattention of the people of Great Britain in general to their true interest and the importance of the contest with their late Colonies , had rendered absolutely necessary for our own preservation ,  --  and has given great spirits to the army , as , by shutting the door against any reconciliation in the least degree connected with dependence on Great Britain , they know for what they are fighting , and are freed from the apprehension of being duped by Commissioners , after having risked their lives in the service of their country , and to secure the enjoyment of liberty to their posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his father , and relate mainly to the expected attack upon New York . " New York , July 22nd , 1776 . " HONORED SIR , " I received your kind favor of the 15th inst . I am glad to hear our friends are all well . I congratulate you on the spirited behavior and glorious success of our army under General Lee . It is generally thought to have been a decisive action , at least for this summer , as the two fifty-gun ships . are never like to get to sea again . I hope by the next post you will hear some of our exploits , if the enemy have courage enough to attack us . It is my week at the hospital ; and if anything happens , I hope to give you the particulars . Polly has got much better ; she joins me in duty to mother and love to the children . There has been another flag from the fleet ; the Adjutant-General of the British troops has been on shore to wait on his Excellency . He endeavored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the letter which had been twice refused . In conversation he related its contents , much the same as those to the late Governor . He was answered , ( as I am told from good authority , ) that it could not be expected people who were sensible of having committed no offence should ask pardon ,  --  that , as the American States owed no allegiance , so they were not accountable , to any earthly prince . He tarried about half an hour , and seemed pleased pith the politeness of his reception . " " July 23d , P. M. " I write to connratulate you on advice received this day from Virginia , an agreeable supplement to the paper I sent yesterday . On the 9th instant , Lord Dunmore with his slavish mercenaries and stolen negroes were driven from their post on Gwin Island in Virginia , and the piratical fleet from their station near it , with the loss of one ship , two tenders or armed vessels burnt by themselves , three armed vessels taken by our people , and Lord Dunmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be more particular , but , as I had only time to read the Philadelphia paper of yesterday which contains the account , and Mr. Mayo is just setting out , it is not in my power . " " New York , Aug. 12 , 1776 // 1859.1 A Bundle of Old Letters . are both very well , but disappointed in not hearing oftener from our friends at Boston . For news in general I must refer to the inclosed paper . I was in company the evening they came to this city with the two gentlemen who came from England in the packet . They say the British force on Staten Island is from twelve to fifteen thousand , of which about one thousand are Hessians ; that Lord and General Howe speak very respectfully of our worthy commander-in-chief , at their tables and in conversation giving bim the title of General ; that many of the officers affect to hold our army in contempt , calling it no more than a mob that they envy us our markets , and depend much on having their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident of driving us , and pretend only to dread our destroyin* , of it ; that the officers ' baggage was embarked , a number of flat-bottom boats prepared , and every disposition made for an attack , which we may hourly expect . On our side , we have not been wanting ; our army has for several nights lain on their arms , occasioned by several ships of war and upwards of thirty transports going out at the Narrows and anchoring at that part of Long Island best calculated for their making a descent , and where they received , by means of flat-bottom boats , a large detachment from the army on Staten Island . But this fleet went to sea yesterday , where bound we know not ; some think , to go round the east end of Long Island , come down the Sound , and land on our backs , in order to cut off any retreat , and oblige us to surrender ourselves and the city into their hands : but if they are so infatuated as to venture themselves into a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments , I trust they will have cause to repent their rashness . Generals Heath , Spencer , Greene , and Sullivan are promoted by the Honorable Congress to the rank of Major-Generals ; and the Colonels Reed , Nixon , Parsons , Clinton , Sinclair , and McDougall to be BrigadierGenerals . We have removed all our superfluous clothing , and whatever is not necessary for present use , to Rye , whither General Putnam 's lady has retired . Miss Putnam is yet in town , and the chaise is in readiness for her and Polly to remove at a minute 's warning . " The following copy of an " Order from head-Quarters " was found among the papers , directed apparently to his father ; and as Washington 's Orderly Books have never been published , with the exception of a few orders chiefly relating to courtmartials , it has been thought that it would be interesting . Though dated on successive days , it seems to have been issued as one order . A note by Dr. Foster , at the close , says ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mates . Some sentences are omitted . Imperfect as it is , I thought it would be agreeable . The principal omission is the order for having three days ' provisions readydressed , and that all who do not appear at their posts upon the signal are to be deemed cowards , and prosecuted as such . " " Head- Quarters , August 14 , 1776 . " The enemy 's whole reinforcement is now arrived , so that an attack must and soon will be made . The General , therefore , again repeats his earnest request , that every officer and soldier will have his arms and ammunition in good order , keep within their quarters and encampment as much as possible , to be ready for action at a moment 's call ,  --  and when called upon , to remember that liberty , property , and honor are all at stake , that upon their courage and conduct rest the hopes of their bleeding and insulted country , that their wives , children , and parents expect safety from them only , and that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with success in so just a cause . " The enemy will endeavor to intimidate us by show and appearance ; but remember how they have been repulsed on these occasions by a few brave Americans . Their cause is bad , their men are // conscious of it , and , if opposed with firmness and coolness at their first onset , with our advantages of works and knowledge of the ground , the victory is most assuredly ours . Every good soldier will be silent and attentive , wait for orders , and reserve his fire till he is sure of its doing execution ;  --  the officers to he particularly careful of this . The colonels and commanding officers of regiments are to see their supernumerary officers so posted as to keep their men to their duty ; and it may not he amiss for the troops to know , that , if any infamous rascal shall attempt to skulk , hide himself , or retreat from the enemy without the orders of his commanding officers , he will instantly he shot down as an example of cowardice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises that he will reward those who shall distinguish themselves by brave and noble actions ; and he desires every officer to be attentive to this particular , that such men may he afterwards suitably noticed . " " Head- Quarters , August 15 , 1*76 . " The General also flatters himself that every man 's mind and arms are now prepared for the glorious contest upon which so much depends . " The time is too precious , nor does the General think it necessary , to spend it in exhorting his brave countrymen and fellow-soldiers to behave like men fighting for everything that can be dear to freemen . We must resolve to conquer or die . With this resolution , victory and success certainly will attend us . There - will then be a glorious issue to this campaign , and the General will reward his brave soldiers with every indulgence in his power . " " New York , August 16 , 1*76 . " HONORED SIR , " It is now past ten o'clock , and Mr. Adams , who favors me by carrying this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have only time to acknowledge the favors received by Dr. Welch . If I survive the grand attack hourly expected , or if it is delayed until then , I will write again by next post . Polly has her things packed up ; the chaise can be ready at a minute 's warning ; if the wind favors our enemies , it is probable she will breakfast out of the way of danger . T*morrow is watched for by our army in general with eager expectation of confirming the independence of the American States . All the Ministerial force from every part of America except Canada , with the mercenaries from Europe , being collected for this attempt , God only knows the event . To His protection I commend myself , earnestly praying that in this glorious contest I may not disgrace the place of my nativity , nor , after it is over , be ashamed to see my wife , my children , and my parents again . To the care of Providence , and , under that , to you , honored Sir , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dear to me , and am , with duty to mother , love to the children , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , " YOUR DUTIFUL SON . " " P. 5 . Our troops are in good spirits , and , relying on the justice of their cause and favor of Heaven , assured of victory . " The next four months were , of course , spent amid the hardships of camps and removals . The frequent letters sent to his father and other friends are all of interest to those who claim descent from him , but the general reader can be concerned in but a few of more public import , and , in most cases , only in extracts from these . " Bethlehem , State of Penn. , Dec. 24 , 1776 . " HONORED SIR , " I returned from General Washington 's head-quarters last evening , and had the pleasure of finding Polly well an ( l as agreeably situated as I could expect . Were I to attempt writing all I wish to communicate , a week 's time and a quire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no gainer by lending my furniture to the General Court ; - General // Washington would have paid me for the i*se of it before I left Cambridge , but , for the credit of Massachusetts , I declined it . ' " Fishkill , State of N. York , Jan. 20 , 1777 . " HONORED SIR , " After spending the winter hitherto in Pennsylvania and the Jerseys , with frequent removals , some loss , much expense and fatigue , we are once more on the east side of Hudson 's River . We arrived at this place last Friday , in good health , after a journey of more than one hundred miles , in severe weather , through the upper part of New Jersey , a newsettled , uncultivated country . The sight of a hoarded house or glass window was a great rarity ; a cordial welcome to any connected with the American army still greater . Altho ' they are fully sensible of the value of money , and we offered cash for all we wanted , yet I believe we were not a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except only from one family . But I must defer a particular account until I have the happiness to see you . " I have nothing of news to write hut what you must bear sooner in another way . General heath and the militia are besieging Fort Independence ; if they can carry that , they will attempt New York . It is not improbable I shall join him in a few days . " The office of Deputy Director-General of Hospitals was established hy ordinance , April 7th , 1777 ; and four days later , Dr. Foster was chosen by Congress to this office , having charge of the Eastern Department . His subsequent resi ( lence was mainly at Danbury , Connecticut . Of Tryon 's expedition against Danbury we have the following account , differing in some respects from the common version " Danbury , May 1 , 1777 . " You have doubtless heard of the enemy 's expedition to this place , and been anxious for us . This is the first moment of leisure I have had , and , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . " On Saturday morning , about three o'clock , an express from Fairfield brought advice , that a large body , three or four thousand British troops , had landed from upwards of twenty transports , under cover of some ships of war near that place , and that it was probable their design was against the provision and other stores collected in this town ; another express soon after sunrise informed us of their being on the march . The militia were mustered , and a few Continental troops that were here on their way to Peekskill prepared to receive them ; but their number was so inconsiderable , and that of the enemy so large , with a formidable train of artillery , I had no hope of the place being saved . " I had , upon the first alarm , ordered all the stores in my charge to be packed up , ready for removal at a minute 's warning . Upon the second express , I persuaded Polly , with what money was in my hands , to quit the town : she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much put to it for teams to remove the medicines and bedding , that I determined rather to lose my own baggage than put it on any cart intended for that purpose ; and had not a gentleman 's team , already loaded with his own goods , taken it up , I must have lost it . As the enemy entered the town at one end , after our troops had retreated to the heights , I went out at the other , not without some apprehension ( as I was to cross the route of their flank-guard ) of being intercepted by the light horse . " After having seen the medicines , all of them that were worth moving , safe at New Milford , I returned to town the next morning , and went with our forces in pursuit of the enemy . About noon the action began in their rear , and coxitinued with some intermission until night the running fight was renewed next morning , and lasted until the enemy got // under cover of their ships . We have lost some brave officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried some of their dead , and carried off others ; but , from the dead bodies they were forced to leave on the field , it must have greatly exceeded ours . General Wooster was wounded early in the action ; he is in the same house with me , and I fear will not live till morning . " Our loss in provisions , &amp;c. , is between two and three thousand barrels of pork , a quantity of flour , some wheat , and some bedding . " In this bundle are many letters from Mrs. Foster . They are interesting for their true-hearted patriotism and domestic love ; but there is room for only a brief extract from a letter referring to this same expedition . " Danbury , May 13 , 1777 . " DEAR MADAM , " I received yours and father 's by Messrs . Russell and Gorham . Doctor had not the pleasure of seein* either of the gentlemen , as he was gone to Fishkill to oversee the inoculation of the troops , which was a very great disappointment .

I removed to New Milford , from whence I intended to have set out for Boston . On Sunday , the Doctor took his leave , and left me to take care of the wounded . Monday morning , everything was got ready for me to set out at twelve o'clock , when I received a note from the Doctor , desiring I would tarry a little longer . I have now returncd to my old lodgings at Danbury , where the Doctor thinks of building a hospital . He joins me in duty and love . " Your affectionate daughter , " MARY FosTER . " Much of Dr. Foster 's time was necessarily spent in journeyings to the several divisions of the army and various military stations . On such journeys his letters to his wife were very frequent .

The enemy 's fleet has sailed from New York , and was seen standing to eastward . Some suppose them bound for Boston ; but I can not think so , as General Washington , who , I presume , has the best intelligence , is moving towards Philadelphia . Before you receive this , it will be made certain with you . Should they attack Boston , I would have you get as many of our effects as possible removed out of their way , and inform me by the post where you remove to . Should such an event take place , it will become my duty , after visiting Danbury , to return to the scene of action . To your own prudence and the care of Heaven I leave all , and am , with love to the children , ever yours . " In the lapse of years , many letters have , without doubt , been lost . Thus , but two remain bearing date of 17 78 . Neither of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of intend-. ing a journey to Yorktown , and says , " if anything extraordinary happens between the two armies , " he shall be on the spot . In a letter addressed to his father , dated November 27 , 1778 , he says ,  --  " Public business calls me to Philadelphia ; but the state of your health , and my own , which is much impaired , determine me to visit Boston first . I expect a visit from the Marquis La Fayette next week , on his way to Boston , and shall set out with him .

" My DEAR POLLY , " Another post has arrived , and no letter from Boston . It is now a month , and near five weeks , since I have heard from you . If I thought you had neglected writing , it would make me very unhappy ; but , from your usual goodness , I can not think that is the case , but am confident your letters must have miscarried .

" My DEAR POLLY , " As I am waiting for Mr. De Lam*ter to come up , I will endeavor to give you an account of our journey . The evening we left Boston Dr. Warren rode with us as far as Jamaica Plains ; after he left us we proceeded to Dedham , where we arrived about dark , and were exceedingly well entertained : we had a brace of partridges for supper . Colonel Trumbull spent the evening with us . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from thence seven miles to Mann 's , where we fed our horses , and dined at Daggett 's , nine miles further ; that afternoon we arriyed at Providence , and put up at our old friend Gluey 's . The next day we dined with Adams and Townshend at their quarters ; the General honored us with his company ; the same evening supped with the General . Sunday , dined with the General , in company with ' some of the principal ladies of the place ; here I also saw your old acquaintance , General Stark ; he drank tea at my quarters one afternoon , and inquired after you . 1859.1 557 // Having finished my business much to my mind , I continued my journey on Monday morning ; the General , Colonel Armstrong , and Dr. Brown were so polite as to ride out four miles with us . After they left us , we proceeded to Angell 's , twelve miles from Providence , where we dined ,  --  not on the fat of the land . After dinner we rode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best house on the road ; here we were exceedingly well entertained , and , as it looked like a storm , intended staying there , but , it growing lighter towards noon , we set out , but had not rode far before the rain came on ; however , as we had begun , we determined to go through with it , and rode a very uncomfortable ten miles to Canterbury , where we dined , poorly enough , at one Backus 's . Not liking our quarters , we proceeded , notwithstanding the rain , to Windham , eight miles further , where we were well entertained at one Cary 's . As the storm looked likely to continue , and I was so near Windsor , I was determined , if I must lie by for it , to lie by in a place where I could do some business . I accordingly proceeded fifteen miles in the forenoon to Andover , where I dined at one White 's , and fifteen miles in the afternoon to Bissell 's at East Windsor , where I lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have got any cold .

Mr. De Lamater is not yet come up ; as soon as he arrives we shall visit Springfield . I shall not close this letter until I meet the post ; if anything worth notice occurs , I shall mention it . Adieu , my love . " October 8. - Mr . De Lamater arrived last night . Altho ' it is very raw and uncomfortable , I shall proceed immediately after dinner to Springfield .

" My DEAR POLLY , " I returned from Head-Quarters this forenoon . We went down yesterday morning , and dined with General Heath , who was so good as to lend us his barge to carry us to Head-Quarters . His Excellency received us as I could wish . He invited us to dine with him this day . Upon my excusing myself , as being in haste to finish my journey , he accepted the excuse , and invited us to breakfast with him , which we did . We returned last night to Robinson 's house , and slept with our friend Eustis . General Heath favored us again with his barge to carry us to Head-Quarters , and after breakfast his Excellency ordered his own to convey us to our horses , which we had ordered four or five miles up the river .

Eustis desires you would look out some suitable object of his attentions , while in Boston . He pretends it is only with a view to keep him alert and properly attentive to the ladies in general ; but I suspect he designs to become the domestic man. ** " Al ristown , Oct. 26tk , 1779 .

Upon our arrival there , we were informed there was no public house in the place , and it was after dark . Colonel Biddle had favored me with an order on all his magazines to supply me with forage ; he has one in this place . I waited on his deputy and presented the order ; he went out of the room , and in a few minutes returned with a Mr. Erskine , who is surveyorgeneral of the roads ; he gave me a polite invitation to spend the night at his house , where we were entertained in the most genteel , hospitable , and friendly manner .

" My DEAR POLLY , " I wrote you from Morristown , which it is probable you will receive by this post . Lest that should miscarry , this will inform you that I am at length arrived within twenty miles of Philadelphia , where I expect to dine this day . A few days will determine how long I am like to be detained there ; -I think it upon every account best to finish all my business .

" My DEAR POLLY , " I am once more returned to dear Danbury , on my way to Boston . I arrived here about an hour since , and never had a more fatiguing , disagreeable journey in my life than from Philadelphia here .
