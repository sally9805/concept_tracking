txt POLITICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . JOHN McKEON . John McKeon is the eldest son of Captain James McKeon , whose heroism in defence of Fort Niagara illumines a bright page in the history of our last war with Britain . The patriot father , exiled by misrule , in that signal achievement partly avenged the wrongs of his native land , yielded a rich return to his adopted country for the asylum it had afforded him and earned a renown which sheds undying lustre upon his name . The subject of this memoir , a native of the State of New-York , entered Colcmbia College , in the City of New-York , and graduated with the highest honors , at an early age . He then commenced a course of legal study , under the supervision of the Hon. John L. Mason , one of the present Associate Justices of the Superior Court , which he pursued with indefatigable industry , until his admission to the bar . The death of his father , near the close of his collegiate course , and a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected his youthful mind to trials which served to test its strength , and to fit him for the arduous but honorable career which lay before him . An extended sojourn in a southern climate , rendered necessary by his physical condition , though it interrupted the regular progress of his studies , enlarged the sphere of his association with men , and his opportunities of observing and appreciating human character in the various phases which are wrought upon it by difference in condition and circumstances . From the commencement of his collegiate course his taste had led him to the study of history , biography , political economy , and other subjects connected with the science of government . In a word , whilst directing his attention for the purposes of his future support and individual interest in life , to the study of law , in its application to private transactions , a loftier pursuit seemed ever before him-tempting to the acquisition of skill in that higher jurisprudence , whose office it is to control the action of society , and to establish upon sure and enduring basis the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South in renovated health , and with this tendency , ripened by study , happened to coincide with a condition of public affairs // well calculated to draw him into public life . The illustrious and ironwilled Tennessean , then at the helm of the government , was engaged in *n arduous struggle with the gigantic money power which had grown up in our midst . Whether the will of the people , spoken through their suffraJes , and resolutely sustained by their Democratic President , or the corrupt and corrupting intrigues of the United States Bank , should obtain the ascendancy , was the question at issue . The son of an Irish patriot could not pause to reflect which side he should pursue , or well abstain from participating in the conflict . The same ardent temper which made the father an exile and a hero , under the pressure of opportunity , forced the son into the arena of party strife , as a champion of the right , and a foe to the domination of associated wealth . It did not lessen his incentives to assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of free trade doctrines , by recommending important reductions of our import duties ; nor that he was denounced as self-willed , arbitrary , indiscreet and deficient in knowledge of the arts of government . In his favor of the free trade policy , Mr. McKeon saw a just perception of the common weal , which refuted the latter charge , whilst the rest served but to express the keen sense of his power and efficiency as a ruler , felt by those against whose abuses his measures were so energetically directed . It was at such a moment , in 1831 , when the Democratic party needed available talent , that Mr. McKeon , then quite a young man , commenced his political career . In that year he wi*ote the Address of the Young Men 's Democratic Committee at Tammany Hall . This address defended the administration and policy of General Jackson , with so much ability as to attract general attention , and the author was immediately thereafter elected one of the representatives of the City of New-York , in the Legislature of the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first speech was on a subject in relation to which he entertained peculiar predilections . During the commencement of the session he had been a silent observer , taking no part in the discussions of the House , but promptly rose to make a feeling and forcible reply to an attack made , during an incidental debate , on the officers and men of the war of 1812 . In this he ably defended the policy of that measure , and the patriotism of those who had borne the heat of the contest in the battle.fleld and on the ocean . He was appointed one of the members of the Judiciary Committee , and was constant in his attention to the duties it imposed . In the course of debate on the subject of increasing the salaries of the Judges , Mr. McKeon took a distinguished part , and eloquently advocated the measure . It was during this session that a resolution was introduced to instruct the senators from New-York to vote against the Bank of the United States . On that subject a division was growing up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed , that sach an institution was necessary for the commercial interests of the country . The delegates from the city , then consisting of ten , were equally divided on the vote of instructions , but Mr. McKeon was found among those opposing the bank . In 18 ' &amp;2 , Mr. McKeon gave his first vote for President . It was given // for Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren , the nominees of the Democracy of the Uuion . He was elected again to the Legislature of the State , for the Session of 1833 . It became manifest that he was likely to occupy a prominent position . Congress had met under very exciting circumstances . The Conventions of South Carolina , under the oppressions of the then exi tminT tariff laws , had proclaimed the doctrines of nullification , setting at defiance the laws of the United States for the collection of the Revenue . The President had issued his proclamation , in which he had expressed his determination that the laws should be enforced . In that document were doctrines which might be easily perverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the organization and powers of the General Government . This state paper , eloquently and powerfully written , was subscribed in the name of the most popular man the country had known since the time of Washington . The popular feeling of the country was in favor of the President who had avowed that the Union should be preserved . To avoid running counter to the particular impulses which were upholding the President-judiciously to discriminate between the Federal and Democratic tendency of the propositions he advanced  --  and to trace distinctly the line which the Democratic faith prescribed , was a delicate task ; yet it was accomplished by Mr. McKeon with signal success . Lie stated the true history of the organization of the General Government . His argument was , that not the people of the whole Union , but the States , in their separate capacity , made the compact . He avowed his support of the doctrines of the famous Virginia and Kentucky resolution of 1798 , hut denied that they authorized the doctrines of nullification . His appeal to the support of the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session he introduced a bill to tax certain property , owned by companies known as the Holland Land Company , and the Pultney Estate . The owners being non-residents of the state escaped taxation . Men of great wealth , also , to avoid taxation , in the state of New-York , had taken up their residence in other states . The doctrine advocated by Mr. McKeon was , that property should be taxed wherever it received protection . It was after a severe struggle , but with the bill ably sustained by the Hon. John C. Spencer , late Secretary of War , under President Tyler , that he succeeded in passing the measure . In the fall of 1833 , he was alone of his colleagues again elected , without opposition , to the Assembly of the State . It was then that the violence of the opposition to Andrew Jackson may be said to have reached its height . This was more immediately occasioned by the removal ot the deposits of public money from the Bank of the United States . His opponents charged him not only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution . To such a degree was the excitement carried , that a vote of censure was passed by the Senate . That vote , however , has since been expunged from its Journals . The Bank of the United States had , during its struggle with the government , extemided its discounts , granting facilities of all kinds to every person who in the least degree could affect public opinion . Representatives of the people , and editors of newspapers , were then peculiar favorites . As the election of General Jackson , in 1832 , had settled the question , that the bank could not be re-incorporated-that its days were numn // bered-it commenced a system of contraction . It endeavored to force a continuance of its existence , by pressure on the commercial community , *nd thereby occasioned a panic . At such a crisis , it became necessary to sustain the President in a measure which it was mnnifest had become necessary , to prevent the bank from using the people 's money against themselves . On the Sth January , 1834 , the anniversary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing our senators to vote against the restoration of the public moneys to the bank-reiterating the voice of the state against the existence of the Bank of the United States . The vote of the House of Assembly stood I I* in the affirmative to 9 in the negative . Such an expression of a great State operated powerfully to sustain the administration , and to decrease the influence of the bank in Congress . These resolutions were adopted by the Senate of the State of New-York , having encountered , however , the strenuous opposition of the Hon. William H. Seward , now the Whig Senator in the United States Senate , from the State of New-York . President Jackson had , during his administration , opposed a bill adopted through the influence of Mr. Clay , to dispose of the proceeds of the public lands . Mr. McKeon carried throut*h the Assembly of the State of New-York resolutions sustaining the President in his veto , in opposition to Mr. Clay 's bill . During that session he made a speech in favor of the abolition of capital punishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most masterly efforts ever made in the House . It occupied its attention the greater portion of three days-in the course of which he displayed great research , adducing the statistics of criminal jurisprudence , and the opinions of the greatest minds , to demonstrate the impolicy of the measure . During this session , as well as the preceding , he was industriously engaged in attending to the many legislative enactments required by the city of New-York . The various reli , , ious and charitable societies of the city owe him much for his attention to their interests . He sustained the amendments of the Constitution of the State , giving the election of Mayor of the city to the people . By this amendment , Cornelius W. Lawrence was elected the first Mayor , thus securing a - , reat triumph for the Democratic party , as great efforts were made to defeat him , for the purpose of showing the opposition of New-York to the President 's measures . Mr. McKeon also introduced , before the close of the session , a resolution for the appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legislature what improvements could be made in the system of education in the State . He was not a member the succeedin g session of the Legislature , having in the meantime been elected to the Congress of the United States . No report was made on the subject , but we have reason to believe that he contemplated the establishment of schools which should occupy a position between the Common Schools and the Colleges , in the manner of the Free Academy at present established . He proposed that the system of education in these schools should afford to the noechanical arts all the advantages which science affords to the various trades . It is perhaps to be regretted that Mr. McKeon was not permitted to mature and secure the adoption of the measures he then proposed in favor of education . // In December , 1835 , he took his seat as a member of the 24th Congress . The session in which he commenced his congressional career was marked by events peculiarly interesting . Our foreign relations attracted much of the attention of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been promised under a treaty negotiated between France and the United States , by Mr. Rives , the American minister . The cause of this refusal was imputed to certain expressions used by the President in relation to the indemnity . It was announ ced that France was increasing her naval force for the purpose of invading our coast . The President was anxieus to obtain for our citizens the amount conceded to be due to them . He recommended large and spee ( ly appropriations for the increase of the navy and the fortification of our sea-board . He also recommended reprisals on French property if France should delay the payment of her debt . In these propositions he was sustained by Mr. McKeon , whose first address to the House was in behalf of an increase of the naval force . On this subject , however , the better judgment of the French Government prevailed , and the payment was made . As the Presidential election in 1836 was then approaching , every effort was made by an uritiring opposition to defeat the nominees of the Democratic party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates the most likely to obtain the suffrage of certain portions of the Union . Judge White , of Tennessee , the friend and supporter of General Jackson , was looked to as the candidate who would unite the South and Southwest , whilst General Harrison , of Ohio , would secure the support of the Western , Northern and Eastern sections of the Union . Mr. Calhoun and is friends were likely to support Judge White . Against these candidates the Democracy presented Mr. Van I3uren . In Congress the struggle was to present such issues as would destroy the election of the Democratic candidate . The Abolitionists were incessant in their auz*plications , and in presenting petitions on the subject of slavery . On this question a committee of the House was appointed , of which Mr. Pinckney , of South Carolina was Chairman . Mr. McKeon voted for this committee , and that the petitions be referred to them to report specifically . The committee reported resolutions to the effect-that Congress possessed no constitutional authority to interfere in any way with slavery in any of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District of Columbia . Mr. McKeon , with the entire New-York delegation , voted for these resolutions . It should be remembered that John Qoincy Adams declined to vote on the resolution in relation to the District of Columbia . Mr. Abbot Lawrence , the present American Minister to London , voted against this resolution . The effort made at this session to reject petitions , Mr. McKeon strenuously opposed . The Committee alluded to , reported a resolution that all petitions on the subject of slavery stiould ho received , but without being printed or referred , should be laid on the table . Mr. McKeon voted with the Democratic members in its favor . The object of the agitation in the North was to create a false issue on the right of petition . That of the South on the subject , was to create the impression that the Northern Democracy was untrue to its constitutional duty to the Union . Another important subject which then occupied the attention of Congress , was the distribution of the surplus moneys belonging to the United // States . The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between thirty and forty millions of ' dollars remained in the public treasury . The opposition claimed that this money should be divided among the States . A large portion of the Democratic party was disposed to adopt the same idea , and it became manifest that on this question serious difficulties were to be apprehended . Mr. McKeon , with all his energy , opposed the ( liStribution . He proposed to expend the surplus in increasing our Navy , in building our fortifications , or in any manner which would be consistent with our duties under the Constitution . He contended that the rates of duties should be reduced so as to bring the taxes within the limits of the wants of the General Government . That any distribution of ' the surplus fund would be changing the whole design of the federal compact , and would end in distracting the business operations of the country . An ultra supporter of free trade principles , he saw nothing but injury and injustice in the distribution scheme , and as a statesman , great violence to the principles of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the tariW insisting that it was tyranny to exact money for mere distribution . His appeals in behalf of the interests of the laboring classes against the domination of the manufacturing and moneyed power , were unheeded . On the final passage of the bill he stood in the small minority of 38 in a House elected with a large Democratic majority , and of which James K. Polk had been elected Speaker . But five members in the Senate were found to refuse their sanction to the measure . This vote tested severely the republican principles of the Democratic representatives . The minority stands before the country as steadfast adherents in the hour of trial to the inflexible doctrines of republicanism . The position taken by this minority has been unqualifiedly approved by the Democracy , and is now regarded as a cardinal principle in the Democratic faith . Another question connected with the revenue presented itself which Mr. McKeon strenuously advocated . The treasury department had issued a circular , directing that nothing but gold and silver coin should be received in payment of public lands . Speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the banking institutions of the country . It was apparent that the public lands would be transferred to those who could obtain the favor of the banks . In the course of time the government would have parted with a great portion of the public domain , and have held nothi*ig but the promises of payment of the worthless banks of the country . This measure of the administration was defeated , and Mr. McKeon again stood in the minority . Arkansas and Michigan applied for admission into the Union . To the former State it was opposed , that slavery was tolerated within its limits ; and to the latter that in framing the Constitution , and the electoral laws under its provisions , aliens had been permitted to vote . This brought down on the new State all the federai wrath . Mr. McKeon insisted that under the Constitution and the ordinance organizing the Northwestern Territory , Michigan had a right to say who should be voters . It was during this debate that a personal allusion having been made to the exercise of the political power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to the protection of the government , and susta*ned the policy of a liberal system of naturalization . A resolution having been offered by Mr. Cambreleng , of the City of // New-York , to enquire into the expediency of abolishing the practice of granting protection to seamen , the subject was referred to the Commit-. tee on Commerce , of which Mr. McKeon was a member . He made a very elaborate report on the propriety of repealing all laws on the subject . This report entered into a history of the legislation and diplomacy on this question , and asserts that our character as an independent nation required that we should repeal the laws inflicting this burden on our sailors . It assumes the position that the ocean is open to all ; that it is a floating portion of the territory of the country ; that the deck of a ship . is as sacred from intrusion as a house on land ; that the flag of our Union should be the protection of all who sail beneath it . No determinate action was taken by Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grievance to our sailors and a discredit to our national dignity . To the City of New-York , Mr. McKeon was a zealous and faithful representative . He advocated a measure of relief which was demanded by its merchants , to the extent of several millions , from a fire which destroyed a large portion of the business part of the city . He also successfully advocated a bill regulating pilotage , whereby the safe conducting of vessels into the port of New-York , was opened to the pilots of New-Jersey . His object was to abridge the monopoly enjoyed by the New-York pilots under the laws of the State , and by ccmpetitiorm between them and those of New-Jersey , to increase the facilities to be afforded vessels entering the port . This measure has been of incalculable advantage to the navigating interests of the country . He also obtained large appropriations for buoys and light-houses to increase the security of the navigation of the harbor of New-York . After his return from Congress , he received a vote of thanks from the Chamber of Commerce , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of the interests of the city . In 1838 he was presented with a magnificent silver vase by his feilow-citi*ens , as a token of their regard for a faithful public servant . Under the administration of Mr. Van Buren , the Sub-Treasury , which had been recommended by him , immediately caused a division in the Democratic party in th2 State of New-York . The Conservatives , under the lead of Senator Talmadge , rallied into opposition , but Mr. McKeon stood firm in ' support of the great question of a separation of the government from the banking institutions of the country . In the election of 1840 , he was re-elected to Congress , and took his seat as a member of the 27th Session . When a general gloom overspread the prosperity of the Democratic , party during the administration of Mr. Van Buren , he was still animated with the hope of the eventual triumph of the principles of the republican faith . On the nomination of Mr. Van Buren for re-election , he was active in support of the principles with which his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The political canvass , however , resulted in the election of Harrison and Tyler . An extra session of Congress was held in May , 1841 . General Harrison had departed this life , le* ving the office of President in the hands of the Vice-President , John Tyler . After the re-organization of the House , Mr. Wise , of Virginia , proposed a resolution to appoint the usual committee to *vait on the President and inform him that the house was ready to proceed to business . Mr. McKeon mnov d // to amend the resolution , by striking out the word " President , " and inserting " Vice-President , now exercising the office of President . " Mr. McKeon argued that under the Constitution , Mr. Tyler was not President , but merely Vice-President executing the duties of President . He wished the point settled for future observance , as a precedent was then to be established . The House refused to sustain his amendment , but before the 27th Congress closed , the majority would gladly have acquiesced in the proposition . The same amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected . It had the support , however , among others , of Allen , of Ohio , Benton , of Missouri , and Silas Wright , of New-York . It was at this period , that Mr. Clay , considering the period a propitious one for his object , took occasion to present his measures concerning the public policy . His purpose was to c eate a Bank of the United States , to increase the TariW and to distribute the proceeds of the sales of the Public lands . In the Senate there was a majority favorable to these views . In the House , the election of Mr. White , of Kentucky , as Speaker , was evidence that Mr. Clay had a majority in that branch of Congress . The first proceeding contemplated , was a repeal of the Sub-Treasury law , and to provide a substitute in a Bank of the United States . The currency question in the Senate was referred to a committee of which Mr. Clay was Chairman , and the Democratic members were Senators Wright , of Nexv-York , and King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John Sergeant , of Pennsylvania , as Chairman , and among its members , the democrats were McKay , of North Carolina , McKeon , of New-York , and Rhett , of South Carolina . This committee , at that period , was the most important in the House . It is a part of the political history of the country , that various efforts were made to create some fiscal agent , which should take the place of the Bank of the United States . A scheme , with the title of " A Bill to incorporate the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank of the United States , " was presented to the House . On this question , Mr. McKeon made a long argument , to show the inexpediency of any such institution-that its action would he a viol ation of the Constitution , and unhesitatingly proclaimed that , as the supporters of the measure proposed it as a substitute for the Sub-Treasury , the Democracy of the country would insist on its repeal whenever they obtained the power to effect it . He opposed the various schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its stead a bank under the control of the government , insisting that it had not the power , and ought not to interfere with the currency and business operations of the country . During this session , Mr. McKeon thoroughly discussed the policy of the tariff laws , avo*ving his preference for direct taxation , and the great principles of free trade . He oppose4 and voted against the tariff bill passed by that Congress . In one of his speeches on this subject , he expressed his sentiments in the following language " Can I hesitate to continue this war on the restrictive system , when I feel confident that it commits injustice on one portion of my fellow-citizens to enrich another ? Can I hesitate to embrace that principle of freedom of industry which , no less than the principle of freedom of conscience and of the press , should be enshrined in the innermost recesses of the American heart ? Ought we to pause when , in the spirit of the // 45S Political Portraits with Pen and Pencil . Christian faith under a liberal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ! No , sir ; no . The spirit of the age cries aloud against the continuance of a barbarous system ; the nature of our institutions rebel against it ; the interests of our whole country , the wants of our government , all , all unite in throwing off restrictions from the industry of the nation . The hour of emancipation is at hand for the industry of the country . A deep change has been wrought upon the mind of the nation , and the revolution in public sentiment will soon produce its results . " Mr. McKeon concluded his remarks by declaring , that " the lofty battlemenis behind which privilege and monopoly had so long secured the plunder wrung from the people . would sooner or later be razed to the ground . " As a part of the policy of the Vhig administration , the Committee of Commerce , sustained by the then Secretary of State , Mr. Webster , reported resolutions directing the President to make known to the Governments of Denmark , Sweden , the Hanseatic Republics , Prussia , Austria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such commercial treaties then in force , as contracted to allow the respective parties to import on equal terms as regards duties and tonnage , each into the ports of the other , goods other than those of the growth or manufacture of the nation in whose vessels the same were carried . They were known as our Reciprocity Treaties . Mr. McKeon opposed these resolutions , and sustained the doctrine set forth in the resolution of the Committee of Commerce in l8S*2 , in favor of the principles of free commerce . In the House the resolutions were laid on the table . We have since seen the views entertained by Mr. McKeon on the subject of free trade , confirmed by the extension of public opinion , and the action of Great Britain in the repeal of her im*ibst duties . Lord Ashburton had during this administration arrived at Washington , for the purpose of arranging such questions of dispute as were then existino between the United States and Great Britain . Mr. Webster and the British Envoy settled the terms of a treaty , which was opposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the question came before the House on the appropriations necessary to carry out the treaty , Mr. McKeon denounced the treaty in terms of severe censure . That it occasioned an entangling alliance by its provisions in relation to the cooperation of the fleets of the United States with those of Great Britain on the coast of Africa , involved us in unnecessary expenditure , obtained exemption fo* the American flag from violation on the high seas by purchase , admitted an obligation to bind ourselves to execute our own laws , and placed the honor of our flag in the custody of officers of British cruisers . He animadverted on the British doctrine of an assumed right under suspicious circumstances to visit all vessels on the high seas . In the course of his argument he upheld the position taken by General Cass at Paris , against the Quintuple treaty , and insisted that it was the duty of the United States not to submit to any interpolation by Great Britain on the great International Code , but to maintain at all hazards the unrestricted freedom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Van Buren , caused great agitation in the State of New-York . Pe*sons under British authority had crossed the Niagara river , destroyed the steamboat Caroline , lying on the American side , and deprived those on board of // life . Some time after , a person named McLeod was arrested in the State of New-York for his participation in that outrage . The British government avowed that it approved of the conduct of McLeod , and that under the law of nations he was justified . An application was made to the Supreme Court of New-York , on habeas corpus , to discharge McLeod , hut this was refused . In the House of Representatives , Mr. Pickens , of South Carolina , submitted a report opposing the doctrines of the British government . Mr. McKeon sustained this report , and insisted that the State of New-York bad a right to try McLeod-that the Caroline affair involved the questions of the invasion of the territory of New-York , the burning of the property , and the murder of one of her citizens . A violent feud having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed it would induce many of the Democracy to become supporters of Tyler 's administration . Mr. McKeon , in a severe review of Tyler 's appointments and semiwhig recommendations , denounced the policy of any union with a leader selected by the opponents of the Democracy , and repudiated an alliance sought to be secured by the bestowal of official patronage . In 1842 , the 1 ) emocratic party had to deplore the loss of Mr. McKeon as a representative in Congress . The election in that year resulted in favor of Hamilton Fish , the Whig candidate , and now Governor of the State of New-York . On retiring from Congress , Mr. McKeon immed iately resumed the duties of his profession , and in 1844 was active in his opposition to the nomination of Mr. Van Buren as the Presidential candidate . The developments made during the session of Congress had in his opinion fully disclosed , that in the negotiations with Great Britain , arising out of the burning of the Caroline , Mr. Van Buren exhibited anything but the proper American spirit . Although a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of James K. Polk he gave a hearty support . Mr. Van Buren and his friends , disappointed in their attempts at a third nomination for the Presidency , made strenuous but secret efforts to defeat Mr. Polk . The country sustained him , and the Democracy had the proud gratification of witnessing a brilliant administration founded on the republican principles of Jefferson . Wheii it became manifest that territory must be acquired in consequence of the war with Mexico , Mr. Van Buren and his friends attempted , through the means of the Wilmot proviso and the discussion of the question of slavery , to embarrass the administration . Before the conclusion of the war with Mexico , Mr. McKeon , in an address presented by him at Tammany Hall , was the first to denounce the Wilmot proviso as a firebrand of disunion . ' The course pursued by Mr. Van Buren in relation to it  --  the injury sustained by the Democratic party in the loss of their Presidential candidates , Cass and Butler , the bad feelings engendered between the North and the South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacity of Mr. McKeon in early taking ground against the measure . In 1845 Mr. McKeon was selected by the Common Council as the District Attorney of the city of New-York , and was triumphantly elected by the people to the same office under the New Constitution of 1847 . It is an office , one of the most responsible and arduous in the State . In a large city like New-York , a great tide of crime is continually swelling . It requires activity and energy in no moderate degree to conduct the // affairs of the office of Public Prosecutor with success . Mr. McKeon has discharged the duties of the office with a fearlessness and zeal which can never be surpassed , and an efficiency and ability which have won for him additional honors as a lawyer and an advocate . The election of Mr. McKeon by the people was but a response to the frequent resolutions of thanks offered by the Grand Juries for his faithful services . Mr. McKeon took a prominent part in endeavoring to obtain for the emigrants arriving in our city some amelioration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law which organized the present Board of Corn missioners . As an orator , Mr. McKeon is forcible and eloquent , warm and enthusiastic . He is distinguished in action by his energy-in repose by his affability . Courteous in his manners , resolute in his temper , he unites the energies of a strong will with the warmer affections of the heart . The great principle of human freedom has been his polar star . It has displayed itself at every phase in his life . It has governed his conduct and guided his actions . Unaided by fortune or powerful friends , he has , by his own energy , won for himself a distinguished position and exalted name . We can not but trust , that in the changes of the times , he is soon to behold the restoration of the government , in all its departments , to the hands of that Democracy whose doctrines he has always sustained .
