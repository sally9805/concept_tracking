txt THE VIRGINIANS . BY W. M. THACKERAY . 2 CHAPTER LXIV . IN wiiicii hARRY LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY . THE trusty Gumbo could not console himself for the departure of his beloved maste : : at least , to judge from his tears and howls on first hearing the news of Mr. Harry 's enlistlnent , you would have thought the negro 's heart must break at the separation . No wonder he went for sympathy to the maid-servants at Mr. Lambert 's lodgings . Wherever that dusky youth was , he sought comfort in the society of females . Their fair and tender bosoms knew how to feel pity for the poor African , and the darkness of Gumbo 's complexion was no more repulsive to them than Othello 's to Desdemona . I believe Europe has never been so squeamish in regard to Africa as a certain other respected Quarter . Nay , some Africans-witness the Chevalier de St. Georges , for instance-have been notorious favorites with the fair sex . So , in his humbler walk , was Mr. Gumbo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly considered him not only as Mr. Harry 's man , but their brother . Hetty could not help laughing when she found Gumbo roaring because his master bad gone a volumteer , as he called it , and had not taken him . He was ready to save Master Harry 's life any day , and would have done it , and had himself cut in twenty tousand hundred pieces for Master Harry , that he would ! Meanwhile Nature must be supported , and he condescended to fortify her by large supplies of beer and cold meat in the kitchen . That he was greedy , idle , and told lies is certain ; but yet Hetty gave him half-a-crown , and was especially kind to him . Her tongue , that was wont to wag so pertly , was so gentle now that you might fancy it had never made a joke . She moved about the house mum and meek . She was humble to Mamma , thankful to John and Betty when they waited at dinner ; patient to Polly when the latter pulled her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her toes , or deranged her workbox ; silent in Papa 's company - oh ! such a trausmogrifled little Hetty ! If Papa had ordered her to roast the leg of mutton , or walk to enurek arm in arm with Gumbo , she would have made a courtesy , and said , " Yes , if you please , dear Papa ! " Leg of mutton ! What sort of meal were some poor volunteers having , with the cannon-balls flying about their heads ? Church ? When it comes to the prayer in time of war , oh ! how her knees smite together as she kneels , and hides her head in the pew ! She holds down her head when the parson reads out " Thou shalt do no murder " from the communion-rail , and fancies he must be looking at her . How she thinks of all travelers by land or by water ! How she sickens as she runs to the paper to read if there is news of the Expedition ! How she watches Papa when he comes home from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is good news or bad ! Is he well ? Is he made a General yet ? Is he wounded and made a prisoner ? ah me ! or , perhaps , are both his legs taken off by one shot , like that pensioner they saw in Chelsea Garden t' other day ? She would go on wooden legs all her life , if his can but bring him safe home ; at least , she ought never to get up off her knees until he is returned . " Have n't you heard of people , Theo , " says she , " whose hair has grown gray in a single night ? I should n't wonder if mine did - should n't wonder in the least . " And she looks in the glass to ascertain that phenomenon . " Hetty , dear , you used not to be so nervous when Papa was away in Minorca , " remarks Theo . " Ah ! Theo , one may very well see that George is not with the army , but safe at home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks very pensive . Au fait , if Mr. George // qwq This , manifestly , is not his game at all . He puts his tail between his royal legs , and retreats into his own sang den as quickly as he may . Were he to attempt to go and fight six tigers , you might write that Lion down an Ass . Now , Harry Warrington 's first feat of war was in this wise . He and ahout 13,000 other fighting men embarked in various ships and transports on the 1st of June , from the Isle of Wight , and at daybreak on the 5th the fleet stood in to the Bay of Cancale , in Brittany . For a while he and the gentlemen volunteers had the pleasure of examining the French coast from their ships , while the Commander-in-Chief and the Commodore reconnoitered the bay in a cutter . Cattle were seen , and some dragoons , who trotted off into the distance ; and a little fort with a couple of guns had the audacity to fire at his Grace of Mariboroagh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole British fleet was at anchor , and signal was made for all the grenadier companies of eleven regiments to embark on board fiat-bottomed boats and assemble round the Commodore 's ship , the Essex . Meanwhile Mr. Howe , hoisting his broad pennant on board the Success frigate , went in as near as possible to shore , followed by the other frigates , to protect the landing of the troops ; and now , with Lord George Sackyille and General Dury in command , the gentlemen volunteers , the grenadier companies , and three battalions of guards pulled to shore . The gentlemen volunteers could not do any heroic deed upon this occasion , because the French , who should have staid to fight them , ran away ; and the frigates having silenced the fire of the little fort which had disturbed the reconnoissance of the Commander-in-Chief ; the army presently assaulted it , taking the whole garrison prisoner , and shooting him in the leg . Indeed he was but one old gentleman , who gallantly had fired his two guns , and who told his conquerors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would not have landed at Cancale at all . " The advanced detachment of invaders took possession of the village of Cancale , where they lay upon their arms all night ; and our volunteer was joked by his comrades about his eagerness to go out upon the war-path and bring in two or three scalps of Frenchmen . None such , however , fell under his tomahawk ; the only person slain on the whole day being a French gentleman , who was riding with his servant , and was surprised by volunteer Lord Downe , marching in the front with a company of Kingsley 's . My LordiDowne offered the gentleman quarter , which he foolishly refused , whereupon he , his servant , and the two horses , were straightway shot . Next day the whole force was landed , and advanced from Cancale to St. Malo . All the villages were emptied through which the troops passed , and the roads were so narrow in many places that the men had to march single file , and might have been shot down from behind the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At nightfall the army arrived before St. Malo , and were saluted by a fire of artillery from that town , which did little damage in the darkness . Under cover of this the British set fire to the ships , wooden buildings , pitch and tar magazines in the harbor , and made a prodigious conflagration that lasted the whole night . This feat was achieved without any attempt on the part of the French to molest the British force ; but , as it was confidently asserted that there was a considerable French force in the town of St. Malo , though they would n't come out , his Grace the Duke of Marlborough and my Lord George Sackville determined not to disturb the garrison , marched back to Cancale again , and  --  and so got on board their ships . If this were not a veracious history , do n't you see that it would have been easy to send our Virginian on a more glorious campaign ? Exactly four weeks after his departure from England Mr. Warrington found himself at Portsmouth again , and addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter ran off to Dean Street so soon as ever he received it . " Glorious news , ladies ! " cries he , finding the Lambert family all at breakfast . " Our champion has come back . He has undergone all sorts of dangers , but has survived them all . He has seen dragons-upon my word he says so . " " Dragons ! What do you mean , Mr. Warrington ? " " But not killed any-he says so , as you shall hear . He writes : " DEAREST BRoTrnen ,  --  I think you will be glad to hear that I am returned , without any commission as yet ; without any wounds or glory ; but , at any rate , alive and Izarty . On board our ship we were almost as crowded as poor Mr. Holwell and his friends in their Black Hole at Calicutta . We had rough weather , and some of the gentlemen volunteers , who prefer smooth water , grumbled not a little . My gentlemen 's stomachs are dainty ; and after Braund 's cookery and White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rum and bisicet . But I , who have been at sea before , took my rations and can of flip very contentedly ; being determined to put a good face on every thing before our fine English macarouis , and show that a Virginia gentleman is as good as the best of em . I wish , for the honor of old Virginia , that I had more to brag about . But all I can say in truth is , that we have been to France and come back again . Why , I do n't think even your tragic/c pea could make any thing of such a campaign as ours has been . We landed on the 6 at Cancalle Bay , we saw a few dragons on a hill- ' " There ! Did I not tell you there were dragons ? " asks George , laughing . " Mercy ! What can he mean by dragons ? " cries Hetty . " Immense long-tailed monsters , with steel scales on their backs , who vomit fire , and gobble up a virgin a day . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Papa . // " Seeing St. George 's flag , I suppose they slunk off ) ' " I have read of em , " says the little boy from Chartreux , solemnly . " They like to eat women . One was going to edt Andromeda , you know , Papa ; and Jason killed another , who was guarding the apple-tree . " A few dragons on a hill , ' " George resumes , " who rode away from us without engaging . We slept under canvass . We marched to St. Malo , and burned ever so many privateers there . And we went on board shipp again , without ever crossing swords with an enemy or meeting any except a few poor devils whom the troops plundered . Better luck next time ! This has n't been very much nor particular glorious ; but I have liked it for my part . I have smelt powder , besides a deal of rosa and pitch we burned . I 've seen the enemy ; have sleppt under canvass , and been dredful crowdid and sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dear Aunt Lambert , and tell Miss Hetty I was n't very muc ' fritened when I saw the French horse . " Your most affectionate brother , " H. E. WARRINGTON . " ' We hope Miss Hetty 's qualms of conscience were allayed by Harry 's announcement that his expedition was over , and that he had so far taken no hurt . Far otherwise . Mr. Lambert , in the course of his official duties , had occasion to visit the troops at Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight , and George Warrington bore him company . They found Harry vastly improved in spirits and health from the excitement produced by the little campaign , quite eager and pleased to learn his new military duties , active , cheerful , and healthy , and altogether a different person from the listless moping lad who had dawdled in London coffeehouses and Mrs. Lambert 's dreoving-room . The troops were under canvas ; the weather was glorious , and George found his brother a ready pupil in a fine brisk open-air school of war . Not a little amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young volunteer , paced the streets of the warlike city , recalled his own brief military experiences of two years back , and saw here a much greater army than that ill-fated one of which he had shared the disasters . The expedition , such as we have seen it , was certainly not glorious , and yet the troops and the nation were in high spirits with it . We were said to have humiliated the proud Gaul . We should have vanquished as well as humbled him had he dared to appear . What valor , after all , is like British valor ? I dare say some such expressions have been heard in later times . Not that I would hint that our people brag much more than any other , or more now than formerly . Have not these eyes beheld the battle-grounds of Leipzig , Jena , Dresden , Waterloo , Blenheim , Bunker 's Hill , New Orleans ? What heroic nation has not fought , has not conquered , has not run away , has not bragged in its turn ? Well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Malo . Captured treasures were sent home and exhibited in London . The people were so excited that more laurels and more victories were demanded , and the enthusiastic army went forth to seek some . With this new expedition went a volunteer so distinguished that we must give him precedence of all other amateur soldiers or sailors . This was our sailor Prince , H. H. H. Prince Edward , who was conveyed on board the Essex in the ship 's twelve-oared barge , the standard of England flying in the bow of the boat , the admiral with his flag and boat following the Prince 's , and all the captains following in seniority . Away sails the fleet , Harry , in high health and spirits , waving his hat to his friends as they cheer from the shore . He must and will have his commission before long . There can be no difficulty about that , George thinks . There is plenty of money in his little store to buy his brother 's ensigncy ; but if he can win it without purchase by gallantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the regiment reports highly of his recruit ; men and officers like him . It is easy to see that he is a young fellow of good promise and spirit . Hip , hip , huzzay ! What famous news are these which arrive ten days after the expedition has sailed ? On the 7th and 8th of August his Majesty 's troops have effected a landing in the Bay des Marais , two leagues westward of Cherbourg , in the face of a large body of the enemy . Awed by the appearance of British valor that large body of the enemy has disappeared . Cherbourg has surrendered at discretion ; and the English colors are hoisted oti the three outlying forts . Seven-and-twenty ships have been burned in the harbors , and a prodigious number of fine brass cannon taken . As for your common iron guns , we have destroyed em , likewise the basin ( about which the Mounseers bragged so ) , and the two piers at the entrance to the harbor . There is no end of jubilation in London ; just as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors captured at Louisbourg . The colors are taken from Kensington to St. Paul 's , escorted by fourscore life-guards and fourscore horse-grenadiers with officers in proportion , their standards , kettle-drums , and trumpets . At St. Paul 's they are received by the Dean and Chapter at the West Gate , and at that minute-bang , bong , hung  --  the Tower and Park guns salute them ! Next day is the turn of the Cherbourg cannon and mortars . These are the guns we took . Look at them with their carving and flaunting emblems-their lilies , and crowns , and mottoes ! Here they are , the Tdmiraire , the Malfaisant , the Vainqueur ( the Vainqueur , indeed ! a pretty vuinqueur of Britons ! ) , and ever so many more . How the people shout as the pieces are trailed through the streets in procession ! As for Hetty and Mrs. Lambert , I believe they are of opinion that Harry took every one of the guns himself dragging them out of the batteries , and destroying the artillerymen . He has immeusely risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Bernstein // has asked about him . Lady Maria has begged her dear Cousia George to see her , and , if possible , give her news of his brother . George , who was quite the head of the family a couple of months since , finds himself deposed , and of scarce any account , in Miss Hetty 's eyes at least . Your wit , and your learning , and your tragedies , may be all very well ; but what are these in comparison to victories and brass cannon ? George takes his deposition very meekly . They are fifteen thousand Britons . Why should they not march and take Paris itself ? Nothing more probable , think some of the ladies . They embrace ; they congratulate each other ; they are in a high state of excitement ' . For once they long that Sir Miles and Lady Warrington wore in town , so that they might pay her ladyship a visit , and ask , " What do you say to your nephew now , pray ? Has he not taken twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns into the water , seized twenty-seven ships in the harbor , and destroyed the basin and the two piers at the entrance ? " As the whole town rejoices and illuminates , so these worthy folks display brilliant red hangings in their cheeks , and light up candles of joy in their eyes , in honor of their champion and conqueror . But now , I grieve to say , comes a cloudy day after the fair weather . The appetite of our commanders , growing by what it fed on , led them to think they had not feasted enough on the plunder of St. Malo ; and thither , after staying a brief time at Portsmouth and the Wight , the conquerors of Cherbourg returned . They were landed in the Bay of St. Lunar , at the distance of a few miles from the place , and marched toward it , intending to destroy it this time . Meanwhile the harbor of St. Lunar was found insecure , and the fleet moved up to St. Cas , keeping up its communication with the invading army . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had proposed to swallow at a single mouthful-was guarded by an army of French , which the governor of Brittany had brought to the succor of his good town , and the meditated coup de main being thus impossible , our leaders marched for their ships again , which lay dulyawaitingourwarriors in theBayofSt . Cas . Hide , blushing glory , hide St. Cas 's day ! As our troops were marching down to their ships they became aware of an army following them , which the French governor of the province had sent from Brest . Two-thirds of the troops , and all the artillery , were already embarked , when the Frenchmen came down upon the remainder . Four companies of the First Regiment of guards and the grenadier companies of the army faced about on the beach to await the enemy , while the remaining troops were carried off in the boats . As the French descended from the heights round the bay these guards and grenadiers marched out to attack them , leaving an excellent position which they had occupied  --  a great dike raised on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advantage . And now , eleven hundred men were engaged with six-nay , ten times their number ; and , after a while , broke and made for the boats with a sauve qui peut ! Seven hundred out of the eleven were killed , drowned , or taken prisoners  --  the general himself was killed - and , ah ! where were the volunteers ? A man of peace myself and little intelligent of the practice or the details of war , I own I think less of the engaged troops than of the people they leave behind . Jack the Guardsman and La Tulipe of the Royal Bretagne are face to face , and striving to knock each other 's brains out . Boa ! It is their nature to-like the bears and lions  --  and we will not say Heaven , but some Power or other has made them so to do . But the girl of Tower Hill , who hung on Jack 's neck before he departed ; and the lass at Quimper , who gave the Frenchman his brdle-gueule and tobaccobox before he departed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tender hearts , that you should grieve so ? My business is not with the army , but with the people left behind . What a fine state Miss Hetty Lambert must be in when she hears of the disaster to the troops and the slaughter of the grenadier companies ! What grief and doubt are in George Warrington 's breast ; what commiseration in Martin Lambert 's , as he looks into his little girl 's face and reads her piteous story there ! Howe , the brave commodore , rowing in his barge under the enemy 's fire , has rescued with his boat scores and scores of our flying people . More are drowned ; hundreds are prisoners , or shot on the beach . Among these , where is our Yirginian ? CHAPTER LXV. 5OLDIEIC5 RETURN . GREAT Powers ! will the vain-glory of men , especially of Frenchmen , never cease ! Will ir // qwq " Have you seen her ladyship 's address in the papers to the electors of Nottingham ? Lord Howe being now absent upon the publick service , and Lieutenant-Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to beg the favor of your votes and interests that Lieutenant-Colonel Howe may supply the place of his late brother as your representative in Parliament . ' Is n't this a gallant woman ? " " A Laconic woman , " says George . " How can sons help being brave who have been nursed by such a mother as that ? " asks the General . Our two young men looked at each other . " If one of us were to fall in defense of his country we have a mother in Sparta who would think and write so too , " says George . " If Sparta is any where Virginia way , I reckon we have , " remarks Mr. Harry . " And to think that we should both of us have met the enemy , and both of us been whipped by him , brother ! " he adds , pensively . Hetty looks at him , and thinks of him only as he was the other day , tottering through the water toward the boats , his comrade bleeding on his shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was she who drove him into the danger ! Her words provoked him . He never rebukes her now he is returned . Except when asked , he scarcely speaks about his adventures at all . He is very grave and courteous with Hetty ; with the rest of the family especially frank and tender . But those taunts of hers wounded bina . " Little hand ! " his looks and demeanor seem to say , " thou sbouldst not have been lifted against me ! It is ill to scorn any one , much more one who has been so devoted to you and all yours . I may not be over-quick of wit , but in as far as the heart goes I am the equal of the best , and the best of my heart your family has had . " Harry 's wrong , and his magnanimous endurance of it , served him to regain in Miss Hetty 's esteem that place which he had lost during the previous months ' inglorious idleness . The respect which the fair pay to the brave she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers , or sarcastic in h r obseivations regarding his conduct . In a word , she was a humiliated , an altered , an iml ) rovcd Miss Iletty . A RUN roa THE BOATS // And all the world seemed to change toward Harry , as he toward the world . He was no longer sulky and indolent : he no more desponded about himself , or defied his neighbors . The colonel of his regiment reported his behavior as exemplary , and recommended him for one of the commissions vacated by the casualties during the expedition . Unlucky as its termination was , it at least was fortunate to him . His brother volunteers , when they came back to St. James s Street , reported highly of his behavior . These volunteers and their actions were the theme of every body 's praise . Had he been a general commanding , and slain in the moment of victory , Sir John Armytage could scarce have had more sympathy than that which the nation showed him . The papers teemed with letters about him , and men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his honor . The fate of his affianced bride was bewailed . She was , as we have said , the sister of the brave commodore who had just returned from this unfortunate expedition , and succeeded to the title of his elder brother , an officer as gallant as himself , who had just fallen in America . My Lord Howe was heard to speak in special praise of Mr. Warrington , and so he had a handsome share of the fashion and favor which the town now bestowed on the volunteers . Doubtless there were thousands of men employed who were as good as they : but the English ever love their gentlemen , and love that they should distinguish themselves ; and these volunteers were voted Paladins and heroes by common accord . As our young noblemen will , they accepted their popularity very affably . White 's and Almack 's illuminated when they returned , and St. James s embraced its young knights . Harry was restored to full favor among them . Their hands were held out eagerly to him again . Even his relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whither Aunt Bernstein had by this time betaken herself , containing praises of his valor , and a pretty little bank-bill , as a token of his affectionate aunt 's approbation . This was under my Lord Castlewood 's frank , who sent his regards to both his kinsmen , and an offer of the hospitality of his country house , if they were minded to come to him . And besides this , there came to him a private letter through the post-not very well spelled , but in a handwriting which harry smiled to see again , in which his affectionate cousin , Maria Esmond , told him she always loved to hear his praises ( which were in every body 's mouth now ) , and sympathized in his good or evil fortune ; and that , whatever occurred to him , she begged to keep a little place in his heart . Parson Sampson , she wrote , had preached a beautiful sermon about the horrors of war , and the noble actions of men who volunteered to face battle and danger in the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a letter full of enthusiasm , in which he saluted Mr. Harry as his friend , his benefactor , his glorious hero . Even Sir Miles Warrington dispatched a basket of game from Norfolk : and one bird ( shot sitting ) , with love to my cousin , had a string and paper ronnd the leg , and was sent as the first victim of young Miles 's fowling-piece . And presently , with joy beaming in his countenance , Mr. Lambert came to visit his young friends at their lodgings in Southampton Row , and announced to them that Mr. Henry Warrington was forthwith to be gazetted as Ensign in the Second Battalion of Kingsley 's , the 20th Regiment , which had been engaged in the campaign , and which now at this time was formed into a separate regiment , the 67th . Its colonel was not with his regiment during its expedition to Brittany . He was away at Cape Breton , and was engaged in capturing those guns at Louisbourg , of which the arrival in Enjand had caused such exultation. ix WHICH WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the custom of visiting that famous garden in the Regent 's Park , in which so many of our finned , feathered , four-footed fellow-creatures , are ncommodated with board and lodging , in return for which they exhibit themselves for our instruction and amusement : and there , as a man's business and private thoughts follow him every where , and mix themselves with all life and nature round about him , I found myself , while looking at some fish in the aquarium , still actually thinking of our friends the Virginians . One of the most beautiful motion-masters I ever beheld , sweeping through his green bath in harmonious curves , now turning his black glistening back to me , now exhibiting his fair white chest , in every movement active and graceful , turned out to be our old homely friend the fioun CHAPTER LXVI. // der , whom we have all gobbled up out of his bath of water soucby at Greenwich , without haying the slightest idea that he was a beauty . As is the race of mau , so is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter in his right element , you may view him agile , healthy , aud comely : put him out of his place , and behold his beauty is goue , his motious are disgraceful : he flaps the unfeeling ground ridiculously with his tail , and will presently gasp his feeble life out . Take him up tenderly , crc it be too late , and cast him into his native Thames again But stop : I believe there is a certain proverb about fish out of water , and that other profound naturalists have remarked on them before me . Now Harry Warrington had been floundering for ever so long a time past , and out of his proper element . As soon as he found it , health , strength , spirits , energy , returned to him , and with the tap of the epaulet on his shoulder he sprang up an altered being . He delighted in his new profession ; he engaged in all its details , and mastered them with eager quickness . Had I the skill of my friend Lorrequer , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the march , at the mess , on the parade-ground ; I would have many a carouse with him and his companions ; I would cheerfully live with him under the tents ; I would knowingly explain all the manoeuvres of war , and all the details of the life military . As it is , the reader must please , out of his experience and imagination , to fill in the colors of the picture of which I can give but meagre hints and outlines , and , above all , fancy Mr. Harry Warrington in his new red coat and yellow facings , very happy to bear the King 's colors , and pleased to learn and perform all the duties of his new profession . As each young man delighted in the excellence of the other , and cordially recognized his brother 's superior qualities , George , we may be sure , was proud of Harry 's success , and rejoiced in his returning good fortune . He ote an affectionate letter to his mother in Virginia , recounting all the praises which he had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George knew , would never allow him to repeat . He described how Harry had won his own first step in the army , and how he , George , would ask his mother leave to share with her the expense of purchasing a higher rank for him . Nothing , said George , would give him a greater delight than to be able to help his brother , and the more so as , by his sudden return into life as it were , he had deprived Harry of an inheritance which he had legitimately considered as his own . Laboring under that misconception , Harry had indulged in greater expenses than he ever would have thought of incurring as a younger brother ; and George thought it was but fair , and , as it were , as a thank-offering for his own deliverance , that he should contribute liberally to any scheme for his brother 's advantage . And now , having concluded his statement respecting Harry 's affairs , George took occasion to speak of his own , and addressed his honored mother on a point which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friends he and his brother had found in England were the good Mr. and Mrs. Lambert , the latter Madam Esmoud 's school-fellow of earlier years . Where their own blood relations had been worldly and unfeeling , these true friends had ever been generous and kind . The General was respected by the whole army , and beloved by all who knew him . No mother 's affection could have been more touching than Mrs. Lambert 's for both Madam Esmond 's children ; and now , wrote Mr. George , he himself had formed an attachment for the elder Miss Lambert , on which he thought the happiness of his life depended , and which he besought his honored mother to approve . He had made no precise offers to the young lady or her parents ; but he was bound to say that he had made little disguise of his sentiments , and that the young lady , as well as her parents , seemed favorable to him . She had been so admirable and exemplary a daughter to her own mother , that he felt sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , Mr. Warrington described the young lady as a model of perfection , and expressed his firm belief that the happiness or misery of his own future life depended upon possessing or losing her . Why do you not produce this letter ? haply asks some sentimental reader of the present Editor , who has said how he has the whole Warrington correspondence in his hands . Why not ? Because t is cruel to babble the secrets of a young man 's love ; to overhear his incoherent vows and wild raptures , and to note , in cold blood , the secrets-it may be , the follies-of his passion . Shall we play eavesdropper at twilight embrasures , count sighs and hand-shakes , bottle hot tears : lay our stethoscope on delicate young breasts , and feel their heart-throbs ? I protest , for one , love is sacred . Wherever I see it ( as one sometimes may in this world ) shooting suddenly out of two pair of eyes ; or glancing sadly even from one pair ; or looking down from the mother to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's happiness as she is whirllug round the room with the captain ; or from John Anderson as his old wife comes into the room  --  the 1$enne viejile , the ever-peerless among women ; wherever we see that signal , I say , let us salute it . It is not only wrong to kiss and tell , but to tell about kisses . Every body who has been admitted to the mystery-hush about it . Down with him qui Dece secrum vulgarit arcane ? . Beware how you dine with him , he will print your private talk : as sure as you sail with him , he will throw you over . While Harry 's love of battle has led him to smell powder  --  to rush upon reluctantes dracones , and to carry wounded comrades out of fire , George has been pursuing an amusement much more peaceful and delightful to him ; penning sonnets to his mistress 's eyebrow , mayhap ; pacing in the darkness under her window , and watching the little lamp which shone upon her in her chamber ; finding all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to require little answers , but get them ; culling bits out of his favorite poets , and flowers out of Covent Garden for somebody 's special adornment and pleastire ; walking to St. James 's Church , singing very likely out of the same Prayer-book , and never hearing one word of the sermon , so much do other thoughts engross him ; being prodigiously afihetionate to all Miss Hetty 's relationsto her little brother and sister at school ; to the elder at college ; to Miss iletty , with whom he engages in gay passages of wit ; and to Mamma , who is half in love with him herself , Martin Lambert says ; for if fathers are sometimes sulky at the appearance of the destined son-in-law , is it not a fact that mothers become sentimental , and , as it were , love their own loves over again ? Gumbo and Sady are forever on the trot between Southampton Row and Dean Street . In the summer months all sorts of junketings and pleasure-parties are devised ; and there are countless proposals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marylebone Gardens , and wbat not . George wants the famous tragedy copied out fair for the stage , and who can write such a beautiful Italian hand as Miss Theo ? As the sheets pass to and fro they are accompanied by little notes of thanks , of interrogation , of admiration , always . See , here is the packet , marked in Warrington 's neat hand , " T 's letters , 1758-9 . " Shall we open them and reveal their tender secrets to the public gaze ? Those virgin words were whispered for one ear alone . Years after they were written , the husband read , no doubt with sweet pangs of remembrance , the fond lines addressed to the lover . It were a sacrilege to show the pair to public eyes : only let kind readers be pleased to take our word that the young lady 's letters are modest and pure , the gentleman 's most respectful and tender . In fine , you see , we have said very little about it ; but , in these few last months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has found the woman of women . She may n't be the most beautiful . Why , there is Cousin Flora , there is Cceha , and Ardelia , and a hundred more , who are ever so much more handsome : but her sweet face pleases kim better than any other in the world . She may n't be the most clever , but her voice is the dearest and pleasantest to hear ; and in her company he is so clever himself ; he has such fine thoughts ; he uses such eloquent words ; he is so generous , noble , witty , that no wonder he delights in it . And , in regard to the young lady-as thank Heaven I never thought so ill of women as to suppose them to be just-we may be sure that there is no amount of wit , of wisdom , of beauty , of valor , of virtue with which she does not endow her young hero . When George 's letter reached home we may fancy that it created no small excitement in the little circle round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wished to marry ! It was but natural , and would keep him out of harm s way ' . If he proposed to unite himself with a well-bred Christian young woman , Madam saw no harm . " I knew they would be setting their caps at him , " says Mountain . " They fancy that his wealth is as great as his estate . He does not say whether the young lady has money . I fear otherwise . " " People would set their caps at him here , I dare say , " says Madam Esmond , grimly lo6king at her dependent , " and try and catch Mr. Esmond Warrington for their own daughters , who are no richer than Miss Lambert may be . " " I suppose your ladyship means me ! " says Mountain . " My Fanny is poor , as you say ; and t is kind of you to remind me of her pov-erty ! " " I said people would set their caps at him . If the cap fits you , taut pis. ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madam , I am scheming to keep George for my daughter ? I thank you , on my word ! A good opinion you seem to have of us after the years we have lived together ! " " My dear Mountain , I know you much better than to suppose you could ever fancy your daughter would be a suitable match for a gentleman of Mr. Esmond 's rank and station , " says Madam , with much dignity . " Fanny Parker was as good as Molly Benson at school , and Mr. Mountain 's daughter is as good as Mr. Lambert 's ! " Mrs. Mountain cries out . " Then you did think of marrying her to my son ? I shall write to Mr. Esmond Warrington , and say how sorry I am that you should be disappointed ! " says the mistress of Castlewood . And we , for our parts , may suppose that Mrs. Mountain was disappointed , and bad some ambitious views respecting her daughter-else , why should she have been so angry at the notion of Mr. Warrington 's marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back that she was pleased with the fraternal love George exhibited ; and it was indeed but right in some measure to compensate Harry , whose expectations had led him to adopt a more costly mode of life than he would have entered on had he known he was only a younger son . And with respect to purchasing his promotion , she would gladly halve the expense with Harry 's elder brother , being thankful to think his own gallantry had won him his first step . Tbis bestowal of George 's money , Madam Esmond added , was at least much more satisfactory than some other extravagances to which she would not advert . The other extravagance to which Madam alluded was the payment of the ransom to the French captain 's family , to which tax George 's mother never would choose to submit . She had a determined spirit of her own , which her son inherited . his persistence she called pride and obstinacy . What she thought of her own pertinacity , her biographer who lives so far from her time does not pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago pretty much resembled their grandchildren of the present date , and loved to have their own way , and to make others follow it . Now , after paying his own ransom , his brother 's debts , and half the price for his promotion , George calculated that no inconsiderable portion of his private patrimony would be swallowed up : nevertheless he made the sacrifice with a perfect good heart . His good mother always enjoined him in her letters to remember who his grandfather was , and to support the dignity of his family accordingly . She gave him various commissions to purchase goods in England , and though she as yet had sent him very trifling remittances , she alluded so constantly to the exalted rank of the Esmonds , to her desire that he should do nothing unworthy of that illustrious family ; she advised him so peremptorily and frequently to appear in the first society of the country , to frequent the Court where his ancestors had been accustomed to move , and to appear always in the world in a manner worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's money would be forthcoming when his own ran short , and generously obeyed her injunctions as to his style of life . I find in the Esmond papers of this period bills for genteel entertainments , tailors ' bills for Court suits supplied , and liveries for his honor 's negro servants and chairmen , horse-dealers ' receipts , and so forth ; and am thus led to believe that the elder of our Virginians was also after a while living at a considerable expense . lie was not wild or extravagant like his brother . There was no talk of gambling or race-horses against Mr. George ; his table was liberal , his equipages handsome , his purse always full , the estate to which he was heir was known to beimmense . I mention these circumstances because they may , probably , have influenced the conduct both of George and his friends in that very matter concerning which , as I have said , he and his mother had been just corresponding . The young heir of Virginia was traveling for his pleasure and improvement in foreign kingdoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence with his Highness , and constantly enjoined him to act as became his lofty station . There could be no doubt , from her letters , that she desired he should live liberally and magnificently . He was perpetually making purchases at his parent 's order . She had not settled as yet ; on the contrary , she had wrote out by the last mail for twelve new sets of wagon-harness , and an organ that should play fourteen specified psalm-tunes : which articles George dutifully ordered . She had not paid , as yet , and might not to-day or to-morrow , but eventually , of course , she would ; and Mr. Warrington never thought of troubling his friends about these calculations , or discussing with them his mother 's domestic affairs . They , on their side , took for granted that he was in a state of competence and ease , and , without being mercenary folks , Mr. and Mrs. Lambert were , no doubt , pleased to see an attachment growing up between their daugh ter and a young gentleman of such good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was honesty in all Mr. Esmond Warrington 's words and actions , and in his behavior to the world a certain grandeur and simplicity which showed him to be a true gentleman . Somewhat cold and haughty in his demeanor to strangers , especially toward the great , he was not in the least supercilious ; he was perfectly courteous toward women , and with those people whom he loved , especially kind , amiable , lively , and tender . No wonder that one young woman we know of got to think him the best man in all the world - alas ! not even excepting Papa . A great love felt by a man toward a woman makes him better , as regards her , than all other men . We have said that George used to wonder himself when he found how witty , how eloquent , how wise he was , when he talked with the fair young creature whose heart had become all his I say we will not again listen to their love whispers . Those soft words do not bear being written down . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined-lay down the book and think over certain things for yourself . You may be ever so old now , but you remember . It may be all dead and buried ; but in a moment up it springs out of its grave , and looks , and smiles , and whispers as of yore when it clung to your arm , and dropped fresh tears on your heart . It is here , and alive , did I say ? 0 far , far away ! 0 lonely hearth and cold ashes ! Here is the vase , but the roses are gone ; here is the shore and yonder the ship was moored ; but the anchors are up , and it has sailed away forever . Et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . This , however , is mere sentimentality ; and as regards George and Theo , is neither here nor there . What I mean to say is , that the young lady 's family were perfectly satisfied with the state of affairs between her and Mr. Warrington ; and though he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what the answer would be when it came . Mamma perhaps thought the question was a long time coming . " Pshaw ! my dear , " says the General . " There is time enough in all conscience . Theo is not much more than seventeen ; George , if I mistake not , is under forty ; and , besides , he must have time to write to Virginia and ask Mamma. ** " But suppose she refuses ? " " That will be a bad day for old and young , " says the General . " Let us rather say , suppose she consents , my love ? -I ca n't fancy any body in the world refusing Theo any thing she has set her heart on , " adds the father ; " and I am sure t is bent upon this match . " So they all waited with the utmost anxiety until an answer from Madam Esmond should arrive ; and trembled lest the French privateers should take the packet-ship by which the precious letter was conveyed . // IN WHICH A TRAGEDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOLFE , Harry 's new Colonel , came back from America a few weeks after our Virginian had joined his regiment . Wolfe had previously been Lieutenant-Colonel of Kingsley 's , and a second battalion of the regiment had been formed and given to him in reward for his distinguished gallantry and services at Cape Breton . Harry went with quite unfeigned respect and cordiality to pay his duty to his new Commander , on whom the eyes of the world began to be turned now  --  the common opinion being that he was likely to become a great General . In the late affairs in France several officers of great previous repute had been tried and found lamentably wanting . The Duke of Marlborough had shown himself no worthy descendant of his great ancestor . About my Lord George Sackville 's military genius there were doubts , even before his unhappy behavior at Minden prevented a great victory . The nation was longing for military glory , and the minister was anxious to find a general who might gratify the eager desire of the people . Mr. Wolfe 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendly intercourse between those officers was renewed , no one being more delighted than Lambert at his younger friend 's good fortune . Harry , when he was away from his duty , was never tired of hearing Mr. Wolfe 's details of the military operations of the last year , about which Wolfe talked very freely and openly . Whatever thought was in his mind , he appears to have spoken it out generously . He had that heroic simplicity which distinguished Nelson afterward : he talked frankly of his actions . Some of the fine gentlemen at St. James 's might wonder and sneer at him ; but among our little circle of friends we may be sure he found admiring listeners . The young General bad the romance of a boy on many matters . He delighted in music and poetry . On the last day of his life he said he would rather have written Gray 's Elegy than have won a battle . We may be sure that with a gentleman of such literary tastes our friend George would become familiar ; and as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both eager for happiness , no doubt they must have had many sentimental conversations together which would be very interesting to report could we only have accurate accounts of them . In one of his later letters , Warrington writes : " I had the honor of knowing the famous General Wolfe , and seeing much of him during his last stay in London . We had a subject of conversation then which was of unfailing interest to both of us , and I could not but admire Mr. Wolfe 's simplicity , his frankness , and a sort of glorious bravery which characterized him . He was much in love , and he wanted heaps and heaps of laurels to take to his mistress . If it be a sin to covet honor , ' he use to say with Harry the Fifth ( he was passionately fond of plays and poetry ) , I am the most offending soul alive . ' Surely on his last day he had a feast which was enough to satisfy the greediest appetite for glory . He hungered after it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do his duty , but rather like a knight in quest of dragons and giants . My own country has furnished of late a chief of a very different order , and quite an opposite genius . I scarce know which to adshire most . The Briton 's chivalrous ardor , or the more than Roman constancy of our great Virginian . " As Mr. Lainbert 's official duties detained him in London , his family remained contentedly with him , and I suppose Mr. Warrington was so satisfied with the rural quiet of Southampton Row and the beautiful flowers and trees of Bedford Gardens , that he did not care to quit London for any long period . He made his pilgrimage to Castlewood , and passed a few days there , occupying the chamber of which he had often heard his grandfather talk , and which Colonel Esmond had occupied as a boy : and he was received kindly enough by such members of the family as happened to be at home . But no doubt he loved better to be in London by the side of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any which my Lord Castlewood 's circle could afford him , though all the ladies were civil , and Lady Maria especially gracious , and enchanted with the tragedy which George and Parson Sampson read out to the ladies . The Chaplain was enthusiastic in its praises , and indeed it was through his interest , and not through Mr. Johnson 's after all , that Mr. Warrington 's piece ever came on the stage . Mr. Johnson , it is true , pressed the play on his friend Mr. Garrick for Drury Lane , but Garrick had just made an arrangement with the famous Mr. Home for a tragedy from the pen of the author of Douglas . Accordingly , Carpezan was carried to Mr. Rich at Covent Garden , and accepted by that manager . On the night of the production of the piece Mr. Warrington gave an elegant entertainment to his friends at the Bedford Head , in Covent Garden , whence thy adjourned in a body to the CHAPTER LXVII . // theatre , leaving oniy one or two with our young author , who remained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to him with an account of the performance . The part of Carpezan was filled by Barry , Shuter was the old nobleman , Reddish , I need scarcely say , made an excellent Ulric , and the King of Bohemia was by a young actor from Dublin , Mr. Geoghegan , or Hagan as he was called on the stage , and who looked and performed the part to admiration . Mrs. Woffington looked too old in the first act as the heroine , but her murder in the fourth act , about which great doubts were expressed , went off to the terror and delight of the audience . Miss Wayn sang the ballad which is supposed to be sung by the king 's page just at the moment of the unhappy wife 's execution , and all agreed that Barry was very terrible and pathetic as Carpezan , especially in the execution scene . The grace and elegance of the young actor , Gahagan , won general applause . The piece was put very elegantly on the stage by Mr. Rich , though there was some doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the manager was correct in introducing a favorite elephant , which had figured in various pantomimes , and by which one of Mr. Warrington 's black servants marched in a Turkish habit . The other sate in the footman 's gallery , and nproariously wept and applauded at the proper intervals . The execution of Sybilla was the turning point of the piece . Her head off , George 's friends breathed freely , and one messenger after another came to him at the Coffee House , to announce the complete success of the tragedy . Mr. B*rry , amidst general applause , announced the play for repetition , and that it was the work of a young gentleman of Virginia ; his first attempt in the dramatic style . We should like to have been in the box where all our friends were seated during the performance , to have watched Hetty 's flutter and anxiety while the success of the play seemed dubious , and have beheld the blushes and the sparkles in liereyes when thevictorywas assured . Harry , during the little trouble in the fourth act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry , with all his chalk . But if Briareus could have clapped hands , he could scarcely have made more noise than Harry at the end of the piece . Mr. Wolfe and General Lambert huzzayed enthusiastically . Mrs. Lambert , of course , cried : and though Hetty said " Why do you cry , Mamma ? You do n't want any of them alive again ; you know it serves them all right , " the girl was really as much delighted as any person present , including little Charley from the Chartreux , who had leave from Dr. Crusius fos that evening , and Miss Lucy , who had been brought from boarding-school on purpose to be present on the great occasion . My Lord Castlewood and his sister , Lady Maria , were present ; and his lordship went from his box and complimented Mr. Barry and the other actors on the stage ; and Parson Sampson was invaluable in the pit , where he led the applause , having , I believe , given previous instructions to Gumbo to keep an eye upon him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure there was a very jolly supper of Mr. Warrington 's friends that night - much more jolly than Mr. Garrick 's , for example , who made but a very poor success with his Agis and its dreary choruses , and who must have again felt that he had missed a good chance in preferring Mr. Home 's tragedy to our young author 's . A jolly supper , did we say ?  - -  Many jolly suppers . Mr. Gumbo gave an entertainment to several gentlemen of the shoulder-knot , who had concurred in supporting his master 's master-piece : Mr. Henry Warrington gave a supper at the Star and Garter , in Pall Mall , to ten officers of his new regiment , who had come up for the express purpose of backing Carpezan : and , finally , Mr. Wari*ngton received the three principal actors of the tragedy , our family party from the side box , Mr. Johnson and his ingenious friend , Mr. Reynolds the painter , my Lord Castlewood and his sister , and one or two more . My Lady Maria happened to sit next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king . Mr. Warrington somehow had Miss Theo for a neighbor , and no doubt passed a pleasant evening beside her . The greatest animation and cordiality prevailed , and when toasts were called , Lady Maria gayly gave " The King of Hungary " for hers . That gentleman , who had plenty of eloquence and fire , and excellent manners , on as well as off the stage , protested that he had already suffered death in the course of the evening , hoped that he should die a hundred times more on the same field ; but , dead or living , vowed he knew whose humble servant he ever should be . Ah ! if he had but a real crown , in place of his diadem of pasteboard and tinsel , with what joy would he lay it at her ladyship 's feet ! Neither my lord nor Mr. Esmond were over well pleased with the gentleman 's exceeding gallantry - a part of which they attrihuted , no doubt justly , to the wine and punch , of which he had been partaking very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to the world , were a little frightened by the exceeding energy of Mr. Hagan 's manner  --  but Lady Maria , much more experienced , took it in perfectly good part . At a late hour coaches were called , to which the gentlemen attended the ladies , after whose departure some of them returned to the supper-room , and the end was that Carpezan had to be carried away in a chair , and that the King of Hungary had a severe headache ; and that the Poet , though he remembered making a great number of speeches , was quite astounded when half a dozen of his guests appeared at his house the next day , whom he had invited over night to come and sup with him once more . As he put Mrs. Lambert and her daughters into their coach on the night previous all the ladies were flurried , delighted , excited ; and you may be sure our gentleman was with them the next day , to talk of the play and the audience , and the actors , and the beauties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard // that the ladies of the theatre were dangerous company for young men . She hoped George would have a care , and not frequent the greenroom too much . George smiled , and said he had a preventive against all green-room* temptations , of which he was not in the least afraid ; and as he spoke he looked in Theo 's face , as if in those eyes lay the amulet which was to preserve him from all danger . " Why should lie be afraid , Mamma ? " asks the maiden , simply . She had no idea of danger or of guile . " No , my darling , I do n't think he need be afraid , " says the mother , kissing her . " You do n't suppose Mr. George would fall in love with that painted old creature who performed the chief part ? " asks Miss Hetty , with a toss of her head . " She must be old enough to be his mother . " " Pray , do you suppose that at our age nobody can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left ? " asks Mamma , very tartly . " I believe , or I may say , I hope und trust , your father thinks otherwise . He is , I imagine , perfectly satisfied , miss . He does not sneer at age , whatever little girls out of the school-room may do . And they had much better be back there , and they had much better remember what the fifth commandment is-that they had , Hetty I " " I did n't think I was breaking it by saying that an actress was as old as George 's mother , " pleaded Hetty . " George 's mother is as old as I am , miss ! - at least she was when we were at school . And Fanny Parker-Mrs . Mountain who now is-was seven months older , and we were in the French class together ; and I have no idea that our age is to be made the subject of remarks and ridicule b*y our children , and I will thank you to spare it , if you please ! Do you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad my mother is of your age , Aunt Lambert , " says George , in the most sentimental manner . Strange infatuation of passion-singular perversity of reason ! At some period before his marria*e , it not unfrequently happens that a man actually is fond of his mother-in-law ! At this time our good General vowed , and with some reason , that he was jealous . Mrs. Lambert made much more of George than of any other person in the family . She dressed up Theo to the utmost advantage in order to meet him ; she was forever caressing her , and appealing to her when he spoke . It was , " Do n't you think he looks well ? " - " Do n't you think he looks pale , Theo , to-day ? " - " Do n't you think he has been sitting up over his books too much at night ? " and so forth . If he had a cold , she would have liked to make gruel for him and see his feet in hot water . She sent him recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , she never ceased talking about him to her daughter . I dare say Miss Theo liked the subject well enough . When he came , she was sure to be wanted in some other part of the house , and would bid Theo take care of him till she returned . Why , before she returned to the room , could you hear her talking outside the door to her youngest innocent children , to her servants in the upper regions , and so forth ? When she reappeared , was not Mr. George always standing or sitting at a considerable distance from Miss Theo-except , to be sure , on that one day when she had just happened to drop her scissors , and he had naturally stooped down to pick them up ? Why was she blushing ? Were not youthful cheeks made to blush , and roses to bloom in the spring ? Not that Mamma ever noted the blushes , but began quite an artless conversation about this or that , as she sate down brimful of happiness to her work-table . And at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat , well-known hand , and over which George trembled and blushed before he broke the seal . It was in answer to the letter which he had sent home , respecting his brother 's commission and his own attachment to Miss Lambert . Of his intentions respecting Harry Madam Esmond fully approved . As for his marriage , she was not against early marriages . She would take his picture of Miss Lambert with the allowance that was to be made for lovers ' portraits , and hope , for his sake , that the young lady was all he described her to be . With money , as Madam Esmond gathered from her son 's letter , she did not appear to be provided at all , which was a pity , as , though wealthy in land , their family had but little ready-money . However , by Heaven 's blessing , there was plenty at home for children and children 's children , and the wives of her sons should share all she had . When she heard more at length from Mr. and Mrs. Lambert she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretend to say that she had not greater hopes for her son , as a gentleman of his name and prospects might pretend to the hand of the first lady of the land ; but as Heaven had willed that her son 's choice should fall upon her old friend 's daughter , she acquiesced , and would welcome George 's wife as her own child . This letter was brought by Mr. Van den Bosch , of Albany , whohad lately bought a very large estate in Virginia , and who was bound for England to put his grand-daughter to a boardingschool . She , Madam Esmond , was not mercenary , nor was it because this young lady was heiress of a very great fortune that she desired her sons to pay Mr. Van d . B. every attention . Their properties lay close together , and could Harry find in the young lady those qualities of person and mind suitable /br a coiepanionfor 4fe , at least she would have the satisfaction of seeing both her children near her in her declining years . Madam Esmond concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she begged to hear further , and her blessing to the young lady who was to be her daughter-in-law . The letter was not cordial , and the writer evidently but half satisfied ; but , such as it was , // her consent was here formally announced . How eagerly George ran away to Soho with the long-desired news in his pocket ! I suppose our worthy friends there must have read his news in his countenance - else why should Mrs. Lambert take her daughter 's hand and kiss her with such uncommon warmth when George annonnced that he had received letters from home ? Then , with a break in his voice , a pallid face , and a considerable tremor , turning to Mr. Lambert , he said ; " Madam Esmoad 's letter , Sir , is in reply to one of mine , in which I acquainted her that I had formed an attachment in England , for which I asked my mother 's approval . She gives her consent , I am grateful to say , and I have to pray my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God bless thee , my dear boy ! " says the good General , laying a hand on the young man 's head . " I am glad to have thee for a son , George . There , there , do n't go down on your knees , young folks ! George may , to be sure , and thank God for giving him the best little wife in all England . Yes , my dear , except when you were ill , you never caused me a heartache-and happy is the man , I say , who wins thee ! " I have no doubt the young people knelt before their parents , as was the fashion in those days ; and am perfectly certain that Mrs. Lambert kissed both of them , and likewise bedewed her pockethandkerchief in the most plentiful manner . Hetty was not present at this sentimental scene , and when she heard of it , spoke with considerable asperity , and a laugh that was by no means pleasant , saying , " Is this all the news you have to give me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think I have no eyes to see , and no ears to hear , indeed ? " But in private she was much more gentle . She flung herself on her sister 's neck , embracing her passionately , nad vowing that never , never would Theo find any one to love her like her sister . With Theo she became entirely mild and humble . She could not abstain from her jokes and satire xvit*h 4I*eorge , but he was too happy to heed her much , and too generous not to see the cause of her jealousv . When all parties concerned came to read Madam Esmoad 's letter , that document , it is true , appeared rather vague . It contained only a promise that she would receive the yonn* people at her house , and no sort of proposal for a settlement . The General shook his head over the letter-he did not think of examining it until some days after the engagement had been made between George and his daughter ; but now he read Madam Esmond 's words they gave him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shall have three hundred pounds for my tragedy . I can easily write a play a year , and if the worst comes to the worst , we can live on that . " Ou that and your patrimony , " says Theo 's father . George now had to explain , with some hesitation , that what with paying bills for his mother , and Harry 's commission and debts , and his own ransom - George 's patrimony proper was wellnigh spent . Mr. Lambert 's countenance looked graver still at this announcement , but he saw his girl 's eyes turned toward him with an alarm so tender , that he took her in his arms and vowed that , let the worst come to the worst , his darling should not be balked of her wish . About the going back to Virginia , George frankly owned that he little liked the notion of returning to be entirely dependent on his mother . He gave General Lambert an idea of his life at home , and explained how little to his taste that slavery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , write more tragedies , study for the bar , get a place , perhaps ? Why , indeed ? He straightway began to form a l ) lan for another tragedy . He brought portions of his work , from time to time , to Miss Theo and her sister : Hetty yawned over the work , but Theo pronounced it to be still more beautiful and admirable than the last , which was perfect . The engagement of our young friends was made known to the members of their respective families , and announced to Sir Miles Warrington , in a ceremonious letter from his nephew . For a while Sir Miles saw no particular objection to the marriage ; though , to be sure , considering his name and prospects , Mr. Warrington might have looked higher . The truth was , that Sir Miles imagined that Madam Esmond had made some considerable settlement on her son , and that his circumstances were more than easy . But when he heard that George was entirely dependent on his mother , and that his own small patrimony was dissipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's indignation at his nephew 's imprudence knew no bounds ; he could not find words to express his horror and anger at the want of principle exhibited by both these unhappy young men : he thought it his duty to speak his mind about them , and wrote his opinion to his sister Esmond in Virginia . As for General and Mrs. Lambert , who passed for respectable persons , was it to be borne that such people should inveigle a penniless young man into a marriage with their penniless daughter ? Regarding them , and George 's behavior , Sir Miles fully explained his views to Madam Esmond , gave half a finger to George whenever his nephew called on him in town , and did not even invite him to partake of the famous family small-beer . Toward Harry his uncle somewhat unbent ; Harry had done his duty in the campaign , and was mentioned with praise in high quarters . He had sown his wild oats-he at least was endeavoring to amend ; but George was a young prodigal , fast careering to ruin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groan . Are there any poor fellows nowadays , I wonder , whose polite families fall on them and persecute them ; groan over them and stone them , and hand stones to their neighbors that they may do likewise ? All the patrimony spent ! Gracious Heavens ! Sir Miles turned pale when he saw his nephew coming . Lady Warrington prayed for him as a dangerous // reprobate ; and , in the meantime , George was walking the town , quite unconscious that he was occasioning so much wrath and so much devotion . He took little Miley to the play and brought him back again . He sent tickets to his aunt and cousins , which they could not refuse , you know ; it would look too marked were they to break altogether . So they not only took the tickets , but whenever country constituents came to town they asked for more , taking care to give the very worst motives to George 's intimacy with the theatre , and to suppose that he and the actresses were on terms of the most disgraceful intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expressed his approbation of Mr. Warrington 's drama to Sir Miles , when he attended his iR-y-l H-ghn-ss 's levee at Saville House , Sir Miles , to be sure , modified his opinion regarding the piece , and spoke henceforth more respectfully of it . Meanwhile , as we have said , George was passing his life entirely careless of the opinion of all the uncles , aunts , and , cousins in the world . Most of the Esmond cousins were at least more polite and cordial than George 's kinsfolk of the Warrington side . In spite of his behavior over the cards , Lord Castlewood , George always maintained , had a liking for our Virginians , and George was pleased enough to be in his company . He was a far abler man than many who succeeded in life . He had a good name , and somehow only stained it ; a considerable wit , and nobody trusted it ; and a very shrewd experience and knowledge of mankind , which made him mistrust them , and himself most of all , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Castlewood , a woman of the world , wore always a bland mask , and received Mr. George with perfect civility , und welcomed him to lose as many guineas as he liked at her ladyship 's card-tables . Between Mr. William and the Virginian brothers there never was any love lost ; but , as for Lady Maria , though her love affair was over , she had no rancor ; she professed for her cousins a very great regard and affection , a part of which the young gentlemen very gratefully returned . She was charmed to hear of Harry 's valor in the campaign ; she was delighted with George 's success at the theatre ; she was forever going to the play , and had all the favorite passages of Carpezan by heart . One day , as Mr. George and Miss Theo were taking a sentimental walk in Kensington Gardens , whom should they light upon but their Cousin Maria in company with a gentleman in a smart suit and handsome laced hat , and who should the gentleman be but his Majesty King Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and left them presently . Lady Maria had only just happened to meet him . Mr. Hagan came sometimes , he said , for quiet , to study his parts in Kensington Gardens , and George and the two ladies walked together to Lord Castlewood 's door in Kensington Square , Lady Maria uttering a thousand compliments to Theo upon her goodlooks , upon her virtue , upon VOL . XVIII. - No. 107. -X x her future happiness , upon her Papa and Mamma , upon her destined husband , upon her paduasoy cloak and dear little feet and shoe-buckles . Harry happened to come to London that evening , and slept at his accustomed quarters . When George appeared at breakfast the Captain was already in the room ( the custom of that day was to call all army gentlemen Captains ) and looking at the letters on the breakfast-table . " Why , George , " he cries , " there is a letter from Maria ! " " Little boy bring it from Common Garden last night-Master George asleep , " says Gumbo . " What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peruses his letter with a queer expression of face . " About my play , to be sure , " George answers , tearing up the paper , and still wearing his queer look . " What , she is not writing love-letters to you , is she , Georgy ? " " No , certainly not to me , " replies the other . But he spoke no word more about the letter ; and when at dinner in Dean Street , Mrs. Lambert said , " So you met somebody walking with the King of Hungary yesterday in Kensington Gardens ? " " What little tell-tale told you ? " " A mere casual rencontre  --  the King goes there to study his parts , and Lady Maria happened to be crossing the garden to visit some of the other King 's servants at Kensington Palace . " And so there was an end to that matter for the time being . Other events were at hand fraught with interest to our Virginians .

The young General was more than ordinarily grave . The conversation all related to the war . Events of great importance were pending . The great minister now in power was determined to carry on the war on a much more extended scale than had been attempted hitherto : an army was ordered to Germany to help Prince Ferdinand , another great expedition was preparing for America , and here , says Mr. Lambert , " I will give you the health of the Commander  --  a glorious campaign , and a happy return to him ! " " Why do you not drink the toast , General James ? " asked the hostess of her guest . " He must not drink his own toast , " says General Lambert ; " it is we must do that ! " What ? was James appointed ? - All the ladies must drink such a toast as that , and they mingled their kind voices with the applause of the rest of the company . Why did he look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they withdrew . In after days they remembered his pale face . " Perhaps he has been parting from his sweetheart , " suggests tender-hearted Mrs. Lambert . And at this sentimental notion no doubt all the ladies looked sad .
