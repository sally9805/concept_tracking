txt ART . III . - Addresses and Speeches on Various Occasions . By ROBERT C. WINTHROP . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1852. 8vo. pp. 773 . THE most effective school for popular eloquence is a democratic government . Whenever , in the settlement of great questions of public policy , the ultimate appeal lies to the body of the people , some more effective and immediate means of moving them must be found , than are afforded by the printed or written word . The people will natually be brought together in large assemblages to hear the measures propounded upon which they are to act , and the reasons alleged which are to g6vern their actions . Newspapers , and other similar means of directing their opinions and influencing their conduct , are not quick and stirring enough in their operation , to have the whole of the desired effect . It is a comparatively laborious and irksome process to study and weigh the development of an argument , or a course of persuasive considerations , in print , while it is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gestures command the attention and enlist the sympathies of his audience , and thus open , for the matter which he has to offer , a ready access to their understandings . In a crowd , also , the first effects produced are increased and propagated by the magnetic operation of sympathy . The hearer , who might listen unmoved if he stood alone , is caught and hurried away by the enthusiasm of the bystanders . And he who harangues a multitude is himself inspired by the emotion of his audience . His diction becomes more copious , his action more animated , and a throng of unstudied ideas and images seem to impede each other in // pressing for utterance . In this diffusive and inspiriting action of mind upon mind lies the secret of the superiority of truly popular eloquence , or of that which is addressed to large collections of men , over that which is peculiar to the senate arid the bar . For the same reason , the plea which is addressed to a jury is more animated and impressive than that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even among the precious remains of the great orators of antiquity . iDemosthenes always addressed a crowd ; for , by the constitution of the courts at Athens , the judges were not much less numerous or more learned than the great assemblages which were brought together to decide whether they would go to war against Philip . Cicero 's speeches for Marcellus and Ligarius , which are addressed to Cmsar alone , come short of those delivered before the senate , and are immeasurably inferior to the splendid harangues by which he swayed the populace in the forum . With the decay of freedom both in Greece and Rome , the art of oratory declined , and would hardly have been cultivated even in appearance , except from a tradition of the effects it had once produced . In the very eloquent and scholarlike address , delivered by Mr. Winthrop before the Alumni Association of Harvard College last July , too late to he included in this collection of his speeches , there is a striking passage on the vast superiority of the means enjoyed in our own day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for diffusing argument and eloquence , and thus acting speedily and effectively upon the public opinion of a great nation , or of the whole civilized world . Certainly , the perfection of the present system of reporting , and the ease with which copies are multiplied and transmitted by the combined *rid of the printing-press and the magnetic telegraph , are among the greatest wonders of modern civilization . " The orators of antiquity , " said Mr. Winthrop , " spoke only to their immediate audience . They could address themselves to nobody else . It was upon the living multitude before them that an influence was to be produced , or not at all . Their power was limited by the number of persons assembled to hear them , or even more limited by the strength of their own lungs . The 6000 // men who were necessary to constitute a psephisma or decree , or , at the very most , the 20,000 men who enjoyed the right of suffrage , were all to whom Demosthenes could appeal , - all upon whom his magic words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Athens , the eye of Greece , mother of arts And eloquence , native to famous wits Or hospitahie , " - was a city just about the size of Boston , with a population of only 140,000 in all , men , women , children , and slaves ; - and the whole territory of Attica was not more than an eighth part of our own little Massachusetts . " " It would perhaps be an extravagant remark , were I to say that the last thing , which a speaker of modern times cares about , is the number or the character of his audience . It would certainly be a most ungracious remark for one standing in the immediate presence , and appealing to the immediate indulgence , of so distinguished and brilliant an assembly . Great results , I know , are to be produced , and great results are often , in fact , produced , in these days as in days of yore , by the influence of the spoken word upon the many or the few who hear it . And much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are witnessed , in modern times , if the voice , the manner , the emphasis , the gesture , the whole art of oratory were more carefully studied and cultivated . There are many occasions , moreover , when present , practical , and most important consequences depend upon the success of an immediate oratorical effort . In the pulpit , that noblest of all rostrums , and at the bar , the first business of the speaker is to instruct , animate , convince , and carry away captive , if possible , those whom he directly addresses . Now and then , too , there is a popular meeting , or a legislative assembly , at which great measures are to be lost or won , great principles vindicated or overthrown , momentous issues finally made up and decided . " " But how little , under all ordinary circumstances , is the influence of a modern speaker confined by the accidents of voice or of audience ? I have heard , and you , Mr. President , have far more frequently heard , a past or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little room hardly more ample or more elegant than many of our common country school-houses or townhalls , and in the presence of two or thr* hundred rather drowsy gentlemen , and with not half a dozen hearers besides ourselves in the galleries , diplomatic box and all , pronounce words which // not merely determined the policy of a colossal Empire , but which , before another sun had set , were read , marked , learned and inwardly digested by the whole reading population of the United Kingdom , - and which , before the next week bad ended , had settled the judgment , and fixed the public opinion , of the whole continent of Europe , on the subject to which they related . " The contrast here suggested is a very striking one , and it is clearly and powerfully stated , though the want of space has obliged us to make omissions which leave only the skeleton of the speaker 's thought . We are not sure , however , that the effects of the spoken word in modern times are not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants of our own age which have given occasion for , and even created , the increased facilities for multiplying and disseminating the records of argument and eloquence . It might be an unfair application of the argumentuim ad homirtem , to say to Mr. Winthrop himself , that he can not reasonably expect the copies of this handsomely printed collection of his speeches , easily multiplied and widely circulated as they may be , to produce so general an effect , either in the way of awakening pleasant emotions or of influencing opinion and conduct , as they did when they were separately first delivered , and aided by those accompaniments of " voice , manner , emphasis , gesture , and the whole art of oratory , " which no one has iuore successfully studied and cultivated than himself . The living speech must always retain those advantages over the lifeless written or printed page , which have made many of the greatest orators of modern times , - Charles James Fox , and our own Webster , for instance , - seemingly indifferent whether their speeches were reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not give up vivd voce discussion altogether , and trust entirely to writing in book and the newspapers , as a means of directing public opinion ? What modern preachers have produced a stronger and wider effect than Wesley and Whitefield ? And how little of the influence of either is to be attributed to the circulation of their printed sermons , which few could read without yawning , even when they were in the heyday of their popularity ! Dr. FrankLin was not a person whose natural temperament was very impressible , even by the greatest efforts of // oratory . But we all know the story which he has so inimitably told , how Whitefield , on one occasion , conjured all the copper and silver and gold out of his pocket , though the Doctor , when he began to listen , was as pebble-hearted as Launce 's dog Crab . If the preacher had not delivered the sermon , but only printed it , the next day , in the Doctor 's newspaper , we doubt whether Franklin would have given a penny . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very limited in number ; but they were large enough for the purpose , for they contained nearly all the persons whose opinions the speakers wished to influence . Mr. Winthrop himself tells us that Athens was hardly larger than Boston , and that the whole territory of Attica did not equal in size the county of Middlesex . What need , then , was there of multiplying copies of the oration* when almost the whole body of voters could have been collected within the limits of the speaker 's voice ? If every oration of Demosthenes could have been reported and printed the next morning in a penny newspaper , we doubt whether the Athenians would have gone to war with Philip one week sooner . Perhaps , their warlike enthusiasm might even have been abated or retarded by such a publication ; for , coolly weighing the facts and arguments the next day , as they were comfortably seated at their breakfast tables , the enthusiasm created at the Bema having passed off in a good night 's sleep , they might find reason to believe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhetoric was brilliant and overpowering . At Rome , the case was seemingly different , for her empire extended to the bounds of the civilized world . But her government was lodged within the city walls ; and he who could there carry the Senate and the citizens along with him , as Cicero often did , by speeches which were not published till long after the event , could well afford to disregard the opinion of the provinces . No one thought of asking how they were affected towards any public measure . Under popular governments in modern times , the vast increase in the number of voters , and of those whose opinions have a direct substantive influence in determining the policy of the country , has created a necessity for // the use of some means whereby the words of the statesman and orator may be borne to those who are beyond the reach of his voice . The printed page is necessarily substituted , to a great extent , for the spoken word . Considered merely as a substitute , its operation is marvellous ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitable globe . Still , for this particular purpose , it is only a substitute - a makeshift - an invention to which we are driven by necessity , not by choice . The full effect of oratory is perceived by those who hear ; only a portion of it , often an insignificant portion , by those who read . Hence , as the government becomes more and more democratic , as the circle widens within which it is necessary for the waters to be stirred , the occasions for popular eloquence multiply , and greater efforts are made to supply the want . Even in England , the business of public agitators is not carried on wholly in the newspapers . O'Connell first showed the power of " monster meetings " in Ireland , and the Corn Law League profited by the lesson in the sister isle . The Edinburgh Review and the newspapers had been advocating the abolition of the Corn Laws for a quarter of a century , to very little effect ; and but for the aid of the League , they might have argued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the world contained only scholars and thinkers , whose actions are governed by argument and reflection , and not by impulse and sympathy , and who can better weigh and judge when they read than when they hear , Mr. Winthrop 's thesis would hold good . But it is not so ; the vast majority of men , even in the most highly cultivated community , are of the opposite description . They are governed far more by the emotions than the judgment ; to act upon their feelings is the only way to control their will . At least , they are thus brought to act upon all subjects , like religion and politics , the application of which to their daily concerns is comparatively remote , infrequent , and uncertain . In the exercise of their common avocations , indeed , or in the management of their personal concerns , reason asserts its rightful supremacy and constant influence . Elsewhere , passion rules ; and only the orator who can stir their sympathies , and ope the sacred fount of tears , can sway their conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which religious belief and practice are kept up in the community . Give up the stated services of the sanctuary , give up public preaching and prayer , and , though the Bible should be put into every man 's hand , and a constant succession of the best religious works be circulated among the people without price , we fear that , humanly speaking , or without divine aid , Christianity would have no wider influence over men 's hearts and lives than metaphysics . And with regard to the different kinds of preaching , the great masters of reasoning act in a very narrow sphere compared with the great masters of eloquence . Butler and Chillingworth would have comparatively little influence in our times , while Jeremy Taylor and Whitefleld would draw multitudes after them . We speak , however , of the two things in their separate action , and not as combined or fused together . Of course , the highest kind of eloquence is close , vigorous , and impassioned reasoning ; the most effective rhetoric is red-hot logic . But when separately considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cogent as that of Euclid 's Elements is comparatively powerless , while brilliant and florid declamation may excite a war or lead a crusade . Peter the Hermit or Kossuth may be followed by millions , the efforts of the sober and reflecting portion of the community to the contrary notwithstanding . Hence it is , that all the marvellous improvements of modern times in the art of disseminating the written word , upon which Mr. Winthrop lays so much stress , have not , so far as religion and politics are concerned , materially diminished the number of occasions for oratory , or lessened its comparative influence . Books and new*spapers are vastly multiplied , it is true , and nowhere more so than here in the United States . But in each of our larger cities , we still have more speech-making than there ever was in Athens or Rome . In each political campaign* the ablest Review or newspaper article is quite inferior in efficiency to a speech by Choate , Phillips , or Corwin before what is called a " mass-meeting , " though , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Eloquence is already more practised here- we can not yet say that it is more cultivated - than in any country of // the world . The appetite for it and its efficiency are in* creased with every step in the development of our demo* cratic institutions . Only a few years ago , it was not thonght to be good taste , here at the North , in a candidate for office to canvass the country , or ( to adopt a significant Americanism ) to " stump the State , " making speeches to his constituents in every town-hall and district schoolhouse . The practice and the phrase which designates it belonged to the West ; it was generally decried , and even ridiculed , in New England . But it is very common nowadays , and the custom will soon be universal . Mr. Webster remarked , more than a year ago , " that , for party men and in party times , there is hardly any thing so desirable as a topic , " that is , a theme for vehement declamation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest success with the people which has for its ostensible purpose and battle-cry some subject which , as it appeals to the sympathies and the passions more than to the selfishness and the intellect of men , offers the widest scope for oratory , or the most fertile theme for effective speechmaking . It is always easier to kindle the war-spirit than to pacify and subdue it , simply because patriotism , bravery , the vindication of our country 's honor , and the punishment of foreign insolence , are rich themes for earnest appeal and passionate invective . To adopt one of Mr. R. W. Emerson 's curt apothegms , " eloquence is dogcheap at the anti-slavery meeting ; " hence the rapid and marked popularity of the anti-slavery movement both in England and this country . Even the cry for cheap bread , or for protection to domestic industry , which appeals so strongly to our interests , is inferior to it as a topic of popular agitation . Mr. Winthrop , then , must not modestly depreciate his own vocation . The world will heed his theory much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright antecedents by which his own path has been lighted . The records of oratory already form a large component part of American literature . " Orations and Addresses " are as natural a product of our institutions , as pines and hemlocks are of our soil . In our last number , we reviewed the six massive volumes of Mr. Webster 's Speeches ; and Mr. Winthrop , a much younger man in the public service , // now offers a volume of nearly 800 pages more . No ; in this country at least , the press is not likely soon to outrun or to silence the tongue . The contents of this volume are varied and miscellaneous , covering a wide range of subjects , and manifesting upon all of them the large information and pure taste of the well-trained scholar , as well as the fluent manner and ready logic of the practised debater . Five or six of the speeches belong to the division of demonstrative , or what we should rather call commemorative , eloquence ; the others are chiefly of a forensic or senatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions agitated in this country during the last seventeen years , which were delivered in the legislatures of the State or the Union , or before large assemblages of the people . Most , if not all , of them were published at the time in pamphlets or the newspapers , so that they are more or less familiar to our readers . Mr. Winthrop 's political career has been an eminently successful one . His name and lineage were enough to secure him a favorable introduction to public notice here in Massachusetts . The lineal descendant of the Founder and first Governor of the Colony , and of James Bowdoin , the second Governor of the State , no one could have a higher claim , if inherited honors were ever recognized in this country , to take the lead in the affairs of the Commonwealth . But transmitted distinction was not needed for one who could manfully hew out his own path to popular favor and offices of public trust . After serving a reasonable period in the State Legislature , he was chosen to Congress by the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eleven years , being elected Speaker for the only two years during which his party had the control of the House . The volume now published is , to some extent , a record of the measures he has supported and the opinions he has maintained during this long term of employment in the councils of the nation . It would be hardly fair to apply the strict principles of literary criticism to such a book . It is made up of materials not originally designed , we suppose , to be collected and republished at a future day . The purpose of most of these speeches was answered as soon as they were de // livered , or as soon as they had outlived their necessarily brief term of newspaper publication and notoriety . They express but a portion of the speaker 's thought , because the dimensions of many of them were determined by " the hour rule , " and by the particular stage which the discussion had reached when he obtained the floor . Mr. Winthrop 's Preface warns us that " they thus contain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what I actually did say , on the subjects to which they relate . " But they need little allowance on this score . They evince a clear head arid cool temperament , not disturbed by the warmth of debate or by the excitement of the hour . They are moderate in tone , lucid and vigorous in reasoning , and precise in statement . The style is fluent and animated , often rising to the pitch of earnest declamation , but always directed by good taste , arid never lapsing into rant . Mr. Winthrop is an active politician , but never forgets what is due to the gravity of the question discussed , to his audience , and to his own character . He knows how to vindicate his position and repel unmannerly and unjust assaults , without losing his temper or bandying personalities with his opponents . The place which he has occupied has been too conspicuous , and his influence in party movements too great , to allow him to escape altogether the calnrniiy and invective which so generally dog the steps of one distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repel both without borrowing the weapons of his assailants , or forfeiting his own self-respect . And it is only his political conduct which he has ever been required to defend ; not even the rancor of party spirit has ever attacked his private character or left any imputation upon the uprightness of his conduct . This volume contains a very full report of all that he has been obliged to utter in the way of personal controversy ; and we believe that all who are not immediately concerned with it , though they may belong to the ranks of his political opponents , will admit that it contains not a sentence or a word which he ought to blot . We gladly turn for a moment to those portions of the book which lead us out of the din and turmoil of party manoeuvres and political dispute . One of the most interestiiig // discourses in this volume is devoted to a review of the life and public services of James Bowdoin , a leader in the councils of MassaThusetts during our revolutionary epoch and the dark years which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fit task to be undertaken by the present representative of Governor Bowdoin 's family , and it was appropriately delivered , by request of the Maine Historical Society , at Bowdoin College , an institution liberally endowed by the Governor 's son . From the private papers in his possession , and from careful examination of ' public documents , Mr. Winthrop has been enabled to prepare a very complete and valuable memoir of the patriot statesman , whose life is a portion of the history of his native State . It is carefully and modestly written , with a natural feeling of pride in the subject , but with no disposition to exaggerate Bowdoin 's services , or to claim for him a higher place than will readily be conceded by those who are best acquainted with his career . The Bowdoin family is of Huguenot origin , its founder in this country having fled from France after the revocation of the edict of Nantz , and taken refuge for a time in Ireland , whence he soon removed to New England . This Pierre Bowdoin , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1687 , a grant of one hund*red acres of land on Casco Bay , in the Province of Maine . The original application , written in the French language , and signed by the petitioner , is still extant . The family remained in this location only two years and a-half , removing to Boston just in season to escape the destruction of the fort at Casco by the Indians , who massacred all the remaining settlers . " Pierre himself however , lived but a short time after his arrival at Boston , and his eldest son , James , was left at the age of seventeen years , with the charge of maintaining a mother , a younger brother , and two sisters , in a strange land . " But this great call upon his youthful energies was nobly met ; and so successful were his efforts , that he became one of the first merchants in the Colony , was often elected to the Council , and bequeathed to his children the largest estate that had then ever been accumulated by an individual in Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this prosperous merchant , was born in Boston on the 7th day of August , 1726 , and was graduated at Harvard College in 1745 . Coming into possession of an ample fortune as soon as he was of age , he soon withdrew from mercantile pursuits , to devote himself to the study of science , and , at a later period , to political objects . He was a friend and correspondent of Dr. Franklin , who communicated to him in manuscript all his papers on electricity , and invited him to make known such observations and criticisms as they suggested . This was not a mere compliment , and Bowdoin soon proved himself a worthy coadjutor in the task of investigating the secrets of iiature . His objections to the hypothesis that the sea is the grand source of electricity , appear to have induced Franklin to abandon that part of his theory ; and the explanation which Bowdoin suggested , of the zigzag path of the lightning , was approved and adopted by him . Bowdoin also first accounted for the luminousness of sea-water , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - a theory which is now generally received . These services in the cause of science did not pass without acknowledgment ; Franklin forwarded the papers of his correspondent to the Royal Society at London , who published them in a volume with his own , and elected Bowdoin a Fellow of their association . " But the sympathies of Franklin and Bowdoin were not destined to be long confined to philosophical inquiries . There were other clouds than those of the sky , gathering thickly and darkly around them , and which were about to require another and more practical sort of science , to break their force and rob them of their fires . Ertpuit ccelo fuimen , sceptrumque tyrannis ' is the proud motto upon one of the medals which were struck in honor of Franklin . Bowdoin , we shall see , was one of his counsellors and coadjutors in both the processes which secured for him this enviable ascription . " Bowdoin entered into political life in the year 1753 , as one of the four representatives of Boston , in the Provincial Legislature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , having been reI*lected by the same constituency in 1754 and 1755 . " The American Colonies were , at this moment , mainly engaged // in resisting the encroachments of the French upon their boundaries . The Colony of Massachusetts Bay devoted itself with especial zeal , to this object . It was said , and truly said , by their Councillors in 1755 , in an answer to one of Governor Shirley 's Messages , that since the peace of Aix la Chapelle ( 1748 ) we have been at more expense for preventing and removing the French encroachments , we do not say than any other Colony , but than all His Majesty 's Colonies besides . ' " Bowdoin appears from the journals to have cooperated cordially in making provision for the expeditions to Nova Scotia and Crown Point , and in all the military measures of defence . He seems , however , to have been more particularly interested in promoting that great civil or political measure of safety and security which was so seriously agitated at this time , - the U*ion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project for this end , which was formed and advocated by iDr . Franklin , Bowdoin gave a uniform and hearty support . There still exists among his papers an imperfect memorandum of the speech which he made in its favor , when the subject came up for discussion in the General Court of Massachusetts . He urged , that a union of some sort was necessary before the Colonies could prevail against the French , who were united in their councils and acted under one head , while their opponents had little concert and often pulled in opposite directions . He was made the chairman of a committee of seven in the lower House , " to consider and report a general plan of union of the several Colonies on this continent , except those of Nova Scotia and Georgia . " They agreed upon such a plan , and it wa&amp; adopted by the Council ; but the Representatives delayed to act upon it , and appear to have silently abandoned the project . The fear that no plan would be approved by the king which did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' Crown , was undoubtedly the reason why the measure was dropped . Bowdoin remained in the House of Representatives for three years ; and then , in May , 1737 , he was chosen by them a member of the Council , and was annually reelected into that body till 1774 , the intervening period being a more interesting and momentous one for all the b British American Colonies than any other seventeen years of their history . The sphere of action in which he // then moved was a wide and important one . The Council of our Colonial times was not merely , what its name imports , a body appointed to advise and restrain the action of the executive head of the government . It was , in fact , a Senate , or Upper House in the Legislature , its twenty-eight members being annually elected , indeed , by the House of Representatives , but afterwards acting independently of them , and having coOrdinate power in the enactment of laws . Bowdoin 's character , fortune , and abilities seem at once to have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the direction of affairs in that day falling more easily than it does at present , into the hands of one or two prominent members , whose example and suggestions were implicitly followed by the rest . For this reason , among others , the two branches of the Legislature generally acted with singular unanimity throughout their contest with the Governor and the British Ministry . This controversy did not assume a distinct form till the appointment of Bernard in 1760 , from which time it went on steadily increasing in acrimony and importance , till it resulted in the disintegration of the , British empire . " Governor Bernard , in his very first speech to the Assembly , gave a clue to his whole political character and course , by alluding to the blessings which the Colonies derived from their subjection to Great Britain ; ' and the Council , in their reply to this speech , furnished a no less distinct indication of the spirit with which they were animated , by acknowledging how much the owed to their relation to Great Britain . ' y " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and progress of revolutionary principles on this continent ; if he would understand the arbitrary and tyrannical doctrines which were asserted by the British ministry , and the prompt resistance and powerful refutation which they met at the hands of our New England patriots , he must read what are called The Massachusetts State Papers , ' consisting , mainly , of the messages of the Governor to the Legislature , and the answers of the two branches of the Le*islature to the Governor , during this period . He will find here almost all the great principles and questions of that momentous controversy , Trial by Jury , Regulation of Trade , Taxation without Representation , the Stamp Act , the Tea Tax , and the rest , stated and argued with unsurpassed ability and spirit . It was by these State Papers , more , perhaps , than by any thing else , that the people of that day were instructed as to // the great rights and interests which were at stake , and the popular heart originally and gradually prepared for the great issue of Independence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1761 , ( as was said by John Adams , ) breathed into this nation the breath of life , ' few things , if any thing , did more to prolong that breath , and sustain that life through the trying period of the nation 's infancy , until it was able to go alone , than the answers of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts to the insolent assumptions of Bernard and Hutchinson , mainly drafted by the same James Otis and Samuel Adams , and the answers of the Council , mainly drafted by fames Bowdoin . " Of the first-rate part which Bowdoin played , during his long service in the Council , we have the fullest testimony from most unquestionable sources . " Governor Hutchinson , who was himself a principal actor in the scenes which he describes , and who will not be suspected of any undue partiality to Bowdoin , furnishes unequivocal testimony as to his course . " In most of the addresses , votes , and other proceedings in Council , of importance , for several years past , ( says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the commencement of the year 1766 , ) the Lieutenant-Governor , ( Hutchinson himself ) had been employed as the chairman of the committees . Mr. Bowdoin succeeded him , and obtained a greater influence over the *ouficil than his predecessor ever had ; and being united in principle with the leading men in the House , measures were concerted between him and them , and from this time the Council , in matters which concerned the controversy between the Parliament and the Colonies , in scarcely any instance disagreed with the House . " " Again , under date of 1770 , Hutchinson says , Bowdoin was without a rival in the Council , and by the harmony and reciprocal communications between him and Mr. S. Adams , the measures of Council and House harmonized also , and were made reciprocally subservient each to the other ; so that when the Governor met with opposition from the one , he had reason to expect like opposition from the other . ' " Hutchinson also states , under the same date , that Bowdoin greatly encouraged , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaliation for the arbitrary taxes imposed by Great Britain , ) the association for leaving off the custom of mourning dress , for the loss of deceased friends ; and for wearing , on all occasions , the common manufactures of the country . " pp. 101 - 103 . In June 1774 , the General Court of Massachusetts elected its five delegates to the first Continental Congress // at Philadelphia , and at the head of the list stood the name of James Bowdoin , his colleagues being the two Adamses , Cushing , and Paine . Bowdoin was prevented from acting on this appointment , however , by the dangerous illness of his wife , and by the alarming failure of his own health , which soon followed . The wife of John Adams met him in society in June , 177* , and thus writes of him to her husband - . " He , poor gentleman , is so low , that I apprehend he is hastening to a house not made with hands ; he looks like a mere skeleton , speaks faint and low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , far advanced in consumption . " This sickness , from which he did not entirely recover for some years , lost him the honor of inscribing his name on the roll of the Declaration of Independence . When the news of the Declaration arrived in Boston , however , he acted as chairman of the committee appointed to superintend its proclamation from the balcony of the Old State House . In the same year , also , he presided over the Committee appointed to manage the affairs of the State during the recess of the General Court . In 1779 , he was a delegate from the town of Boston to the Convention which framed the Constitution of the State , and was elected its president . He also served as chairman of the select committee that prepared the original draft of the Constitution ; and according to Judge Lowell , " it is owing to the hints which he occasionally gave , and the part which he took with the committee who framed the plan , that some of the most admired sections in the Constitution of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was during the few years which elapsed between the peace of 1783 and the formation of the Federal Constitution that the firm character and commanding abilities of James Bowdoin were most conspicuously manifested , and the most signal services rendered by him to his country . It was a period of general anxiety and gloom , - of national bankruptcy , private distress , the relaxation of the bonds of morals and law , and popular insubordination . It was the true crisis in the history of free institutions , not only in this country , but throughout the world . The contest of arms was over , and the thirteen feeble Colonies had become so many independent States , united // by a loose and uncertain compact or league , but not welded together into one nation , and not yet acknowledging any community of interest or any tie of allegiance to a central power . It remained to be seen whether national independence was to be a blessing or a curse ; - whether the people , after throwing off all foreign restraint , would be xvise and magnanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when made , or whether they would follow that course of anarchy , license , and civil war which has subsequently rendered the history of the South American republics , and of the ephemeral republican governments of the Old World , a warning to mankind . The vast exertions they had made during the armed struggle had exhausted the energies of the people , and , to a considerable extent , had demoralized them . On the one hand , there was a general feeling of lassitude , an indisposition to make any further sacrifices or efforts , and on the other , a fierce impatience of any act or movement which should even seem to limit their recently acquired , universal freedom . The load of public and private debt was enormous . Of what use was it that the people had successfully resisted English bayonets , if they were now to be called upon to respect implicitly the orders of the sheriff and the staff of the constable ? To what purpose had they braved the wrath of Crown and Parliament , if creditors were still to distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment ? Or why tax themselves millions of hard dollars , when they had just gone through a seven years ' war because they would not pay an impost of three pence a pound on tea ? It is no cause for wonder that such questions were frequently asked , or even that a majority of the people were inclined to answer them in a manner most consonant with their present feelings of weariness and independence . And now that there were offices in their gift , there were demagogues enough to flatter them with the belief that licentiousness was freedom , that an effective central government would be as tyrannical as the foreign dominion which they had just thrown off , and that domestic debt might be as easily repudiated as English allegiance . The best and wisest patriots never faltered in their opinions or their conduct for a moment ; but they saw the difficulties // roct. which environed them , and looked gloomily into the future . Washington 's letters at this period evince even greater discouragement than at the darkest periods of the war . He argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it was possible for one of his sedate disposition and majestic deportment to lose his temper . His influence was immense over the reflecting and judicious portion of the community ; but as yet , he had little control over the populace . If his efforts had not been strenuously seconded by the great civilians of the country , upon whom the burden fell now that the din of war had ceased , - by such men as Hamilton , Morris , Madison , and Bowdoin , - he might have sadly looked out from Mount Vernon upon the spectacle of a nation ruined by its own victory . In the darkest hour for Massachusetts , in January , 178* , Bowdoin was elected its chief magistrate . His attention was first turned to financial measures , for the purpose of restablishing the credit of the State , and of finding profitable employment for the people . But the policy which he recommended for this end was that of a strict discharge of all pecuniary obligations , whether of a public or private character ; " he stood forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern advocate of supporting the credit of the State at all costs , and as the uncompromising opponent of every idea of repudiation . " In the same address , also , he earnestly advised that the powers of the Continental Congress should be enlarged , so that they might lay duties upon imports , and thus afford protection to domestic industry . " The state of our foreign trade , ( said he , ) which has given so general an uneasiness , and the operation of which , through the extravagant importation and use of foreign manufactures , has occasioned so large a balance against us , demands a serious consideration . " To satisfy that balance , our money is exported ; which , with all the means of remittance at present in our power , falls very short of a sufficiency . " Those means , which have been greatly lessened by the war , are gradually enlarging ; but they can not soon increase to their former amplitude , so long as Britain and other nations continue the commercial systems they have adopted since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate their trade with us , and to admit into their ports , on their own terms , the vessels and cargoes that go from the United States , or to refuse an admittance ; their own interest , or their sense of it , being the only principle to dictate those regulations , where no treaty of commerce is subsisting . " The United States have the same right , and can , and ought to regulate their foreign trade on the same principle ; but it is a misfortune , that Congress have not yet been authorized for that purpose by all the States . If there be any thing wanting on the part of this State to complete that authority , it lies with you , gentlemen , to bring it forward and mature it , and , until Congress shall ordain the necessary regulations , you will please to consider what further is needful to be done on our part , to remedy the evils of which the merchant , the tradesman , and manufacturer , and indeed every other description of persons among us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance , ( he continues , ) and the happiness of the United States depends upon it , that Congress should be vested with all the powers necessary to preserve the Union , to manage the general concerns of it , and secure and promote its common interest . That interest , so fa.r as it is dependent on a commercial intercourse with foreign nations , the Confederation does not sufficiently provide for ; and this State and the United States in general are now experiencing , by the operation of their trade with some of these nations , particularly Great Britain , the want of such a provision . " This matter , Gentlemen , merits your attention ; and if you think that Congress should be vested with ampler powers , and that special delegates from the States should be convened to settle and define them , you will take the necessary measures for obtaining such a Convention or Congress , whose agreement , when confirmed by the States , would ascertain these powers . " - pp. 116 , 117 . Acting upon this advice , in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recommending that a convention should be held of delegates from all the States , to revise the articles of Confederation and enlarge the powers of Congress . Meanwhile , they passed an act of their own authority , for the purpose of protecting the labor of our own people against the restrictive policy of Great Britain and other nations ; the law being operative , of course , only within the limits of Massachusetts , and being designed to cease when the subject should pass under national control . An extract from the Governor 's // second message to the legislature , at its session in October , 1785 , shows with what intentions this act was passed , and how clear and sound were Bowdoin 's views upon the subject . " As one intention of the act ( says he ) was to encourage our own manufactures , by making such a distinction in the duties upon them and upon foreign manufactures as to give , in regard to price , a clear preference to the former , you will please to consider , in revising the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of them . I would particularly instance in the manufacture of loaf sugar , which , at a time when we were under the dominion of Great Britain , was for a while very profitably carried on here ; but by the British Parliament giving a large bounty on the exportation of it from thence , and this with a view of putting a stop to our manufacturing it , it was imported here so cheap as effectually to answer that purpose . The bounty , as I am informed , being still continued , the duties on each of these manufactures , and on foreign in general , should be so regulated , as to give a decided preference in favor of our own ; and a like attention should be also had in reference to all our manufactures . " pp. 119 , 120 . Mr. Winthrop gives a string of other citations , of a similar character , from Governor Bowdoin 's messages , the purport of which fully justifies the following language - " It is not for me , on this occasion , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System . ' Nor would I , at any time , disturb the laurels of those among the living to whom its paternity has been ascribed . But if any one of later years is privileged to wear the title of the father of this system , I think I may safely assert , upon the evidence which I have now furnished , the unquestionable claim of Governor Bowdoin to be remembered as its grandfather . " Certainly , if any one desires to know for what object the revisal of the old articles of confederation was demanded by at least one of its earliest and most prominent advocates in New England ; if any one desires to understand what was the original Massachusetts meaning of the constitutional phrase , Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations ; ' he may read it in language which can not be mistaken , in these messages of Governor Bowdoin. " pp. 121 , 122 . In April , 1786 , Bowdoin was again elected Governor by a large majority , and again urged the legislature , in // his opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It needed no ordinary firmness to give such advice , when the pressure of the taxes already imposed was fast driving the people into rebellion . We need not repeat here a story so familiarly known as that of Shays 's Insurrection , of the vast exertions by which it was crushed , and of its indirect but happy result in convincing a majority of the nation that a strong central government was indispensable , not merely for their wellbeing , but for the preservation of society itself from anarchy and ruin . Distress and discontent were so general that the legislature could not be induced to act with firmness , and it was doubtful whether a majority of the people did not so far sympathize with the insurgents that , at the next elections , they would place the government in the hands of men who would grant all that Shays and Shattuck demanded . All the hopes of the reflecting and judicious portion of the community were centred in the Governor , and nobly did he justify their trust . Office was not desirable to him except as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared to lose it and to forfeit his own popularity , whenever the interests of the State demanded such a sacrifice . After the legislature , at a special session which he called , had proved to be timeserving and pusillanimous , refusing to declare the disaffected counties in a state of rebellion , passing a new tender law , and publishing a conciliatory address to the men who were already in arms against the government , he resolved to act upon his own responsibility . He called out forty-four hundred of the militia , placed them under the command of General Lincoln , and ordered them to march , in the depth of winter , against the insurgents . Just as the troops were ready to obey , the CommissaryGeneral informed him that the necessary supplies could not be had without a considerable sum in cash , which the Treasurer was unable to borrow . A subscription *aper , with the Governor 's name at the head of it , was immediately circulated among the more wealthy and intelligent citizens of Boston , and in less than twenty-four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the march . The military commander was as prompt and decided in action as the Governor had been in his instructions . // Within a fortnight from the time of taking the field , and in the middle of a winter of unprecedented severity , Lincoln traversed a great part of the interior of the State , dispersed the two great collections of the insurgents , took many of them prisoners , and entirely crushed the rebellion on the east side of the Connecticut , without a drop of blood being shed by the troops under his immediate command . Well may Mr. Winthrop say , " that to the lofty principle , the calm prudence , the wise discretion , and the indomitable firmness of Bowdoin , the result was primarily due , and that his name is entitled to go down in the history of the country as pre-iminently the leader in that first great vindication of law and order within the limits of our American Republic . " The elections came about in the spring , and , as had been foreseen , Bowdoin was turned out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His friends seem to have acquiesced in this result ; and Mr. Winthrop says it " is well understood now , that the ratification of the Federal Constitution by the Convention of Massachusetts was unquestionably brought about by this concession on the part of his political friends to the demands of their opponents . He would have counted no sacrifice of himself too great to accomplish such a result . " * " But Bowdoin was to be permitted to *id in the *iccomplishment of that result in a move direct and agreeable manner . Once more , and for the last time , he was to be employed in the service of the Commonwealth and the Country . A Constitution , embodying the great principle of the Regulation of Trade by a General Union , was at length framed by the National Convention at Philadelphia , and submitted to the adoption of the people . The Massachusetts Conventiaa assembled to consider it in January , 178g . Bowdoin was a delegate from Boston , and had the satisfaction of finding his son by his side , as a delegate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new . instrument of govermnent , and both made formal speeches in its favor . " The elder Bowdoin concluded his remarks with a sentiment , which will still strike a chord in every true American heart , - " If the Constitution should be finally accepted and established , it will complete the temple of American liberty , and like the keystone of a grand and magnificent arch , be the bond of union to keep all the parts firm and compacted together . May this // temple , sacred to liberty and virtue , - sacred to justice , the first and greatest political virtue , - and built upon the broad and solid foundation of perfect union , - be dissoluble only by the dissolution of nature ! and may this Convention have the distinguished ho nor of erecting one of its pillars on that lasting founda-tion ! ' " It was Bowdoin 's happiness to live to see this wish accom* plished , to see the Federal Constitution adopted , and the Government organized under it , and to welcome beneath his own roof his illustrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1789 , as the first President of the United States . " pp. 126 , 127 . Mr. Bowdoin 's age and the state of his health rendered this the last public service which he was able to perform for his country . What remained to him of life and energy he devoted to a resumption of those philosophical inquiries which had interested his youth , and to a renewal of his correspondence with Dr. Franklin . The two friends died within a short time of each other , - Franklin on the 17th of April , 1790 , and Bowdoin on the 6th of November , in the same year . " Rarely has the end of a public man in New England been marked by evidences of a deeper or more general regret . " We have dwelt the longer upon this sketch of the life and services of James Bowdoin , because it seems to us to present as complete a picture as the history of our country can furnish , next to that of Washington , of the qualities of character and conduct which should distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say ; for in point of intellect , IJamilton , Adams , Franklin , and others were probably his superiors . But no one labored from a purer motive , or with higher aims . Office was to him a means , never an end . So long as the confidence of his fellow-citizens enabled him to hold it to their advantage , so long he would devote to it the whole of his time and thought , and the best of his endeavors . When this confidence was withdrawn through no fault of his own , he could retire without rnitrmu4ng to private life , and find , in the elegant and thoughtful pursuits of science , more than a compensation for all the bustle and show of gratified ambition . Patriotic and conservative , firm but discreet , daring and yet pr4emt4 he rendered far more to his constituents than he e*r 30 // received from them , even counting the posthumous honors that attend his name . There is no blot upon his fame , no record of any weakness in any portion of his public or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; but , perhaps , the greatest benefit which he has left to posterity is the history of his life and his stainless example . We return from the Governor , for a moment , to the " Addresses and Speeches " of his descendant , who is emulously treading in his steps . The first speech in this volume which was delivered by Mr. Winthrop , in his legislative capacity , is an able argument in favor of making a grant from the State Treasury to indemnify the proprietors of the Ursuline Convent , in Charlestown , for the destruction of their building and furniture by a mob , on the night of the 11th of August , 1834w It was the first " No Popery " outrage that had disgraced any portion of Massachusetts for many years . Strongly as the feelings and opinions of a great majority of the peopie were directed against the Roman Catholic faith , the principles of religious toleration and respect for the substance and the forms of law were still more deeply rooted in their hearts ; and therefore , they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erection of Catholic churches upon our soil , and on the efforts of the Romish priesthood to establish , confirm , and even propagate their peculiar doctrines and worship . But any form of monachism is particularly repugnant to the feelings of Protestants ; and the establishment of an Ur*uline Convent in Charlestown , the first institution of the kind in the State , was consequently regarded with peculiar fear and disiike* Base means were soon used to foster this unworthy prejlidice . Odious rumors were circulated affecting the conduct of the inmates of the insti*tution ; and though an immediate investigation proved that they were entirely baseless and absurd , the fury which they had kindled in the minds of the populace could not be satisfied without violence . The building was t*nanted only by helpless women and children ; but even this consideration could not protect it from an attack at midnight . The result may be . stated in Mr. Winthrop 's words . // " An institution , established partly for purposes of religion , partly for purposes of education , and partly for purposes of char4y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laud , and paying the price of protection to the government in the prescribed form of annual taxes , - was besieged by a mob , sacked , pillaged , and burned ; and this - not silently , not secretly , not in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye - but by a course of concerted measures , openly and publicly carried on for a period of six or seven hours in succession , in the presence of thousands of spectators , while not a single arm was lifted in its defence . " p. 173 . Mr. Winthrop 's argument in favor of indemnifying the proprietors of the Convent was able , eloquent , and complete . Of course , no one was found bold enough to tand up in the legislature and justify the act itself ; all admitted that it was wholly indefensible and atrocious . Even before the courts of justice , though most of the perpetr*tors escaped , through defect of evidence or from the reluctance of juries to convict , one of them was found guilty , and sentenced to imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State was fairly responsible for the deed , or for not preventing it , and was therefore bour*d in equity to compensate the sufferers . Mr. Winthrop based his reasoning upon the broad doctrine , that a cQmpact everywhere exists between the State and those who are subject to it , protection being the consideration on one side , and allegiance on the other ; if either party fails to perform its obligation , reparation is due . The argument was conclusive , but it fell upon unwilling ears ; neither then , nor since , was a dollar of compensation granted . Yet the principle upon which Mr. Winthrop argued was fully affirmed , and partly carried out , by a law which passed the legislature four years afterwards , making towns and cities responsible to the amount of three quarters of the value of any property within their limits which should in future be destroyed by rioters , This wise act of legislation seems to declare , that the community is bound to do just three fourths of what is right , the other fourth being chargeable , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts has not always acted in this spirit . While the Stamp Act was in force , and during the greatest political excitement 4Jiat ever raged in the Colony , the mob in Bo*ton at*ked // the mansion of the Lieutenant-Governor in the night time , completely gutted it , and burned his furniture and private papers in bonfires kindled in the street . The legislature , the next year , composed almost exclusively of the political opponents of the Lieutenant-Governor , and acting under the direction and advice of James Otis , who had personal as well as political grounds of enmity with him , granted over three thousand pounds in compensation , this sum being estimated as more than sufficient to cover the direct pecuniary loss . Hutchinson appeared in person at the bar of the House , to thank them for their liberality . That a spirit of the broadest religions toleration and of equal justice to all churches and sects is perfectly compatible with the most profound respect for Christianity , and with the opinion that the obligations of religious belief are indispensable to hold the bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech published in this volume , which is an argument against the bill for allowing atheists to testify in a court of justice . The reasoning is clear and forcible , and , as we think , perfectly conclusive . The true ground for excluding atheists is , that it is neither proper nor safe to allow grave cases , affecting property and life , to be decided in our courts of justice , except upon the testimony of persons who are sworn to tell the truth . To one who does not believe in the existence of a God , an oath has no meaning , and he is therefore , virtually , not sworn at all . But if one witness is to be admitted unsworn , all ought to be so admitted ; otherwise , the atheist would have an unfair advantage , which , in a chancery suit , where the parties are allowed to testify in their own cause , would be a very important advantage . Consequently , those who hold that atheists ought to be allowed to testify , if they are consistent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - that is , that men in general are just as likely to swear to an untruth as simply to utter one , - which is contrary to experience and common sense . If it be urged , that the exclusion of the testimony of an atheist may sometimes occasion a failure of justice , the true answer is , that in a community constituted like our own , or , in fact , like any civilized community of the // present day , not one case in a thousand will be found to depend on the testimony of an atheist ; and no one can reasonably maintain that we ought to run the risk , created by giving up oaths altogether , of a failure of justice in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases , in order to provide against such a chance of failure in a single instance . XXTe have not space to comment on the other speeches contained in this volume , and it is not necessary . Most of them relate to topics which have been warmly agitated in the community during the last seventeen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the debates in legislative halls and in the newspapers have made us abundantly familiar . It is little to say that Mr. Winthrop discusses them with firmness , moderation , and good taste . His argument is seldom complete for the reason already intimated ; it is adapted to the stage of the debate at which it was uttered , being intended only to cover the ground which had not been preocenpied by other speakers , or which was most likely to influence the decision then pending . But so far as it goes , it is able , manly , and frank , - creditable alike to the speaker 's scholarship , decision , and good sense . The volume is an honorable record of its author 's long term of public service , an explicit avowal of his political opinions and preferences , and a fair and creditable specimen of the ability with which he has maintained them .
