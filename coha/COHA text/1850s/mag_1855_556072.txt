THE contents of these works first saw the light , as letters from their respective authors , in the columns of religious newspapers ; and we rejoice in the credit which their re-issue in a permanent form can not but reflect on so influential a department of periodical literature . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , records of travel , in part over the same ground , have induced us to group them together . // In other respects , they are as utterly unlike as they could be without some wide mutual dissiliency of principle . The authors are all men in whom the religious nature is too profound and active not to make itself constantly perceived and felt ,  --  yet in each after his own peculiar way . Mr. Prime connects with every scene and occasion the commonplaces of religious thought ( we use the phrase not in a disparaging sense , but to denote the thoughts which a given scene or occasion would primarily suggest to ninety-nine serious and cultivated minds out of a hundred ) ; Dr. Sprague 's researches in European society were guided for the most part by his Christian sympathies , and present no more attractive picture than the undesigned one of the traits of a Christian gentleman in his own person ; while Professor Upham , on a still more elevated plane , merges the traveller in the mystic , and depicts such sights as could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by years of contemplative devotion . With this brief indication of their points of resemblance and difference , we will pass to the consideration of these books in the order in which we have named them . We have seldom felt under greater indebtedness to a traveller than to Mr. Prime . He carried with him open eyes , a hospitable mind , and a kind heart ; the glow of convalescence imparted to his delineations just enough of its own heightened tint to make them lifelike ; and his American and Protestant opinions , never extreme or intolerant , but steadily maintained and modestly asserted , give us confidence in the accuracy of his observations and the soundness of his jndgments . We can not but admire , too , the evenness of his work . He does not ( as is the manner of not a few ) alternate between ambitious rhetoric and slipshod journalizing . He does not scant and slight his descriptions of one class of objects , to bestow superior labor on others . Nor yet does he let his pen go beyond his full perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting and sculpture , he makes no parade of artistical or aesthetic terms , and offers no criticism in detail , but in the simplest style tells us what he saw and what he felt . His was for the most part a common tour over ground which is trodden every year by hundreds of American travellers , // and about which there are books innumerable ; and almost every new writer , in his fear of saying what has been said before , seeks to excite interest by what is peculiar in his own experience or speculations , rather than by what lies open to every eye . The consequence is that some of us diligent readers of travels know little more than the names of many of the places and objects whose names have become household words . Mr. Prime writes as if no other book of travels had ever been written before , and puts on record what his brethren are apt unwarrantably to assume as already familiar to their readers . What we most of all regret in connection with these volumes is , that their author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , from his original purpose of visiting Jerusalem , and making a thorough exploration of sacred sites in Palestine . His felicitous illustrations of Scriptural narratives and references , so far as opportunity served him , show that the chapters which his fears would not let him write would have been among his richest and most instructive . We learn from a contemporary journal , that other parties accomplished in safety his contemplated route at nearly the time when he abandoned it ; yet his story leaves us no reason to doubt that he acted the part of a prudent man , under the representations made to him by those whose knowledge or veracity , however questionable , he was not entitled to call in question . We quote , as in its subject profoundly interesting , and as a happy and yet no more than an average specimen of Mr. Prime 's style of narrative , his description of Mount Gerizim . " Taking a lad with us for our guide , we walked out of the city , to wander for an hour or two among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable town . It was natural that we should wish to go from the synagogue of the Samaritans to the hill on which they had worshipped from the earliest aces of their history . Even now , and four times in every year , they march in solemn procession , reading the law as they go , and ascend to the summit of Gerizim and perform their worship , not without the shedding of blood . It was , therefore , with strong and strange emotions that we took their line of march , nd on the Sabbath-day , when , more than on any other , we could feel the contrast between our own and the ancient Jewish forms // of religion , we wended our way out of the upper gate . The path led us through well-tilled gardens , and among various fruit-trees , to a large fountain where several women were washing clothes . They made themselves merry with our appearance , and we were pleased to see that they ventured to enjoy themselves by the inspection of strangers . The winding path up the hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rough , but in twenty minutes we arrived at the ridge , and then bore off to the eastward toward a wely , or tomb of a saint . A short distance from this was a hole in the ground stoned up , perhaps six feet deep and four across ; ashes and brands were lying in it , the memorials of recent sacrifice . For although we have the impression that even in Juda*a there is no more sacrifice for sin , *id the day has long since gone by when the blood of bulls or of goats is shed in the worship of the God of heaven , it is true that this remnant of the ancient Samaritans come up hither , and once in every year , at the Feast of the Passover , they slay and burn seven lambs at the going down of the sun ! They lodge all night in tents upon the mountain and descend the next day . Again they come on the day of Pentecost , and at the Feast of Tabernacles , and on the day of Atonement ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will doubtless never have it removed . A little further on we came to the foundations of a large fortress or temple , the walls of it about ten feet thick and made of immense stones . We were ready to believe that this is the ancient temple of the Samaritans ; but Dr. Robinson determines it to be the remains of a castle erected by Justinian . There is no use in disputing Dr. Robinson and his friend Dr. Smith ; and when we have their united opinion , the two witnesses put an end to all strife . I have consulted books many , of foreign and domestic production , to aid me in forming opinions on Palestine antiquities ; but modern travellers are disposed , as a general thing , to consider the Researches ' of these gentlemen as exhausting the field of discussion . Certain it is the Samaritans themselves attach no sacredness to these ruins ; and their tradition would undoubtedly have preserved the identity of these stones with those of their temple , if such were the fact . We examined with much attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the walls , lying on the ground , under which we are told are the twelve stones brought up by the children of Israel from the river Jordan , and with which the altar of the Samaritans on this hill is said to have been built . Now they are buried under these ; and here they are to lie until the Guide , the Saviour of the Samaritans - not the Messiah of the Jews - appears . " And then we came to the Holy Place , - the Most Holy , - a broad , flat rock , like a threshing-floor , level with the surrounding earth , and 17 * // slopin* , westward to a cistern into which the blood of sacrifices may have flowed . No one of their people now treads upon it unless he first takes off his shoes . Wherever they now pray , they turn their faces toward this sacred spot . Doubtless their temple stood over this rock , and the site of its walls can be distinctly traced . In their zeal to have a monopoly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot where Abraham offered his son . As we stood among these memorials of this'remarkable people , it was painful to reflect that they are perishing from among men , without the slightest evidence being given that any of them are brought to a knowledge of the truth . They are dwindling away , and one or two generations more will probably terminate their race . Dr. Robinson thinks there are not more than one hundred and fifty now left in their entire community . " The view is exceedingly interesting from this summit . On the rich plain below us are villages whose associations are with the earliest recor s of Israel 's history . There lies Salem , the Shalim before which Jacob pitched his tent . Before us lies the plain on * which Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel , and gave them his dying charge , and made a dying covenant with them , and took a great stone and set it up under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord . And that stone which , Joshua said , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witness unto them lest they should afterward deny their God . Here came the children of Israel with the bones of Joseph , which they brought up out of Egypt ; and they buried them in Sheehem , in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor ' : and there is his tomb to this day . And every hill-top that I see on this bright Sabbathday is not more lustrous with this Eastern winter sun than with the imprint of the Divine presence , which faith discovers in all the mountains and valleys of this holy land . " And just here , at our feet , at the base of Mount Gerizim , is Jacob 's Well , - the scene of one of the most interesting and instructive incidents in the life of our Lord . We mark the route by which he was journeying along through this valley ; how he would naturally pause about the middle of the day - the sixth hour-at this well , a mile and a half from the city , while his disciples went there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw water as he was sitting on the well , which was stoned up a few feet above the ground ; and then followed that remarkable conversation , in which she says , Our fathers worshipped in this mountain , ' - the Gerizim , on which we are now standing . And then Jesus revealed himself unto her as the Messiah , the Saviour of the world . ' " - Vol. 11. pp. 368-372 . Dr. Sprague 's book composed of articles recently published // in " The Presbyterian , " is compiled from notes of European tours in 1828 and 1836 ; and its value , if not created , is greatly enhanced , by the years that have elapsed since its materials were gathered . It is the record of interviews and conversations with distinguished persons , most of whom are no longer living , and several of whom are among those illustrious men whose recent decease attaches intense interest to every memorial of their personal history , manners , and habits . For obvious reasons of delicacy and propriety , private and familiar conversations could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rendered such reminiscences rightfully the world 's property . The study of man is full as much an art as a science , or , if a science , it is an experimental one . It demands not alone keen powers of observation , but the ability to draw out what is in men of mind and heart , of generous nature and good-breeding , of sense , wit , and wisdom ; and this can be done only by one who in social intercourse can make others his debtors , and thus force them from the citadel of reserve and indifference into which " celebrities " are prone to retreat . In skill of this description Dr. Sprague has few equals , no superiors . In person and address commanding respect and inviting confidence , with an inborn courtesy trained by exercise and refined by the highest social influences , and with a position and reputation the prestige of which often prepared for him a kind reception , he had rare opportunities of research in his favorite field . As a collector of autographs , and a virtuoso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal habits and history of distinguished men , he had , before he first crossed the Atlantic , an almost world-wide knowledge of the living as well as the dead , and , what is of more worth , he had by these pursuits educated his curiosity both generally and specifically , so that he knew where and how to look for the indications of character , and what to expect and watch for in each individual instance . Add to these qualifications a rare tact in procuring the right kind of introduction , and in pre-arranging circumstances for an interview when the case admitted of it , and you have a writer than whom none could be better fitted to furnish a series of // off-hand sketches of character . The several articles are necessarily short , as they are generally confined to what transpired at a single interview ; but some of them have a value that is not even approximated by a posthumous biography , for a single section of a man 's private life drawn on the spot often reveals more of his true self than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the very first sketch in this book , of the splendid fanatic , Edward Irving , occupying but little more than six pages , has for us harmonized the conflicting accounts and opinions of him that we had previously read , and suggests a theory of his character which will more adequately explain the facts of his life than the views that have been presented by those who have treated his course either with weak admiration or with indiscriminate censure . As regards Neander , we are by no means deficient in the memorabilia of his personal habits , and his lecture-room has afforded the scene for very many word-paintings both before and since his death ; yet we have hardly seen anything concerning it so graphic as the following paragraph . " My curiosity was gratified - I can not say that my mind was particularly enlightened- by attending one of his lectures on the Life of Christ . ' The room in which the lecture was delivered had been , originally , a splendid one ; but it had been suffered to go to decay , and withal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , and a good deal more than was consistent with decency . The number of students in attendance was large , - I should think not less than four hundred . After I had waited in the lecture-room a good while , the worthy professor made his appearance ; and a singularly plain , and to me perfectly unique , appearance it was . As he came in , his head was down , as if he had lost something that he was trying to find ; and among other attractive articles of dress was a huge pair of boots , which he wore outside of his pantaloons , and which came up nearly to his knees . I noticed , on his entering the room , and several times during the lecture , that there was a hissing among the students , which I feared , at the moment , was intended as an insult to the lecturer ; but I soon learned that it was nothing more than a demand for perfect silence . Neander 's manner of lecturing indicated the extreme of modesty and diffidence ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree attractive . His eyes seemed never to be more than half open ; but they were steadily fixed upon his paper . On one hand he rested // his forehead , and with the other he was whirling about a goose-quill ; and once in twenty seconds , upon an average , according to *n accurate estimate by my watch , he entertained us by spitting ! I know not whether this was the effect of disease or habit ; but I should charitably hope , and I think somebody told me , that it was the former . He delivered his lecture standing , and bending over a desk in the most ungraceful posture ; but his utterance was distinct , and sufficiently loud to fill a large room . I could see that the lecture was listened to with great attention , and the lecturer was evidently regarded with the highest respect . " - pp. 132-134 . Our author had the rare privilege of being present during one of Elizabeth Fry 's ministrations to the inmates of Newgate . The following is the paragraph in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time of my visit in England , there were few persons , male or female , who were in greater repute , especially in the walks of philanthropy , than Mrs. Fnv . It was quite an object with me to obtain an introduction to her , and I succeeded in accomplishing it with great ease . She was a noble - I should say , a splendid looking woman ; considerably above the ordinary height , and of a remarkably symmetrical form ; with a countenance indicative of great vigor of mind and strength of purpose , and with a general air and bearing more dignified and impressive than I have often met with in a lady . Withal , her face expressed great benevolence ; and when I knew that it was Mrs. Fry with whom I was conversing , it seemed to me that she looked exactly as a person of her character might be expected to look . 11cr great mission , at that time , was reading the Scripturcs once or twice a week to the wretched inmates of Newgate . I was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as soon as she knew my wish , she assured me that it should be gratified . Accordin* , ly , by previous appointment , I met her at the prison , and witnessed one of the most interesting and impressive services at which I have ever been present . I entered the prison just as the female prisoners were going up into the room where Mrs. Fry was to meet them . There were about forty , all decently and uniformly dressed , and nearly every one having in her hand a Bible . They had all been tried and sentenced for some crime or other , and most of them had been taken from the streets , - the very refuse of society . Several of them had babies in their arms , that were playful and smiling in their nuconscious degradation . Mrs. Fry read the twelfth chapter of the Epistle to the IRomans , and the thirteenth Psalm ; commenting a little upon each with great propriety and feeling . // Nothing could have been more appropriate and beautiful than her manner of reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest model of a reader which the American pulpit has furnished - ever read the twelfth chapter of IRomans more impressively than Mrs. Fry did on that occasion . And it had its effect upon other minds than mine ; for I saw some , who looked like veterans in crime , burying their faces in their hands , as if overwhelmed with compunction at least , if not with penitence . At the close of the reading , which , in connection with the comments that accompanied , and a brief exhortation that followed it , lasted , perhaps , three quarters of an hour , the different monitors ( one from each ward ) came up successively and rendered in their account ; and all the reports , with one or two exceptions , were very good . There was a young gentleman who came in to see Mrs. Fry , just after the exercise had closed , who looked very modest and retiring ; but I was surprised to find that it was a noble lord , who took the deepest interest in her philanthropic enterprise . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assured me that she had good reason to believe that the Word of God , as read by her , had been the power of God to the salvation of a goodly number of those wretched beings . I perceived that all her movements towards them were kind and winning , and their treatment of her seemed most deferential and grateful . I did not think it strange that the Emperor Alexander should have pronounced her one of the wonders of the age . Though she talked with the Quaker precision , the style of her conversation was worthy of the court . She wished me to visit her at her house , but I could not . She , however , sent me a little book , containing an account of her selfdenying labors , and gave me also a letter of introduction to her brother , Joseph John Gurney , whom she wished me to visit at Norwich . It is several years since she has passed away ; but the record of her good deeds will pass away - never . " - pp. 163-1 65 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of a visit to Mrs. Grant , the author of " Letters from the Mountains , " whose childhood , it will be remembered , was spent in America , chiefly in the city of Dr. Sprague* s resideuce , and who was able to give him reminiscences of Albany as long ago as when the late venerable Stephen Van Rensselaer was cradled in her arms . Dr. Sprague 's reception by Southey was peculiarly flattering , and from the whole tedious length of the poet 's " Life " we could hardly compile so copious a collection of his opinions of his contemporaries as we have in this single day 's talk . // Indeed , it has seemed to us lamentable that a character , so transparent as his was in life , should have had so foggy a penumbra thrown around it by his biographer , and we gratefully welcome the clear , though transient glimpse of him presented in the volume before us . Among the " celebrities " whom our author visited were Wilberforce , Robert Hall , John Foster , Hannah More , Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Jeffrey , Sir David Brewster , and Professor Wilson , in Scotland ; and Guizot , Sismondi , Tholuck , Gesenius , and Alexander von Humboldt , on the Continent . The entire number of names in the table of contents falls little short of a hundred . To believers in the new science of chirognomy the work is rendered doubly interesting by the prefixing to the several chapters of the autographs of the persons to whom they respectively relate . We have no doubt that the ingenious author could discourse learnedly and eloquently on the mental and moral characteristics thus betrayed through the pen ; but for ourselves the only generalization which we have been able to reach is that men and women of genius write seldom well , and often illegibly , and that not a few of the names held sacred elsewhere must have left with the goodly fraternity of compositors and proof-readers a memory by no means fragrant . Professor Upham , with characteristic modesty , has issued of his book only a " private edition " of four hundred copies . We can not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will consent that the work shall go no farther . As a mere book of travels it is indeed of unequal and often defective worth , - meagre in its details in England , France , and Rome , profoundly interesting among the Waldenses , eminently suggestive and impressive in Egypt and in the desert of Sinai , rich almost beyond comparison among the scenes hallowed by the presence of the Saviour . But it is inestimably precious as a record of the author 's inward life and spiritual experience in communion with Nature in her solitudes , her grandeur , and her beauty , with humanity under various phases of civilization and religion , and with the memorials of supernatural events , sacred history , religious heroism , and Christian martyrdom . If his vision was sealed // where other men 's eyes are open , - if he closed his letters from Rome without so much as a reference to St. Peter 's , - he more than compensates us by the promptness of his intuitions and the depth of his insight wherever the nobler faculties of mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a connoisseur , we can not but regard his comments on art and on individual works of art as eminently instructive . An harmoniously developed nature is necessarily possessed of the canons of the highest art , and is an immeasurably more competent judge of artistical truth , ( without which there is neither grandeur nor beauty , ) than a person of the best technical training , but of coarser sensibilities and a lower standard of refinement . " He that is spiritual judgeth all things . " He may not , indeed , employ the conventional terms that pass current among the initiated , but his verdict ( for it is a ver m dictum ) will for this very reason only the more fQlly justify itself to the universal consciousness . Such are the criticisms embodied in the following extract . " In the countless statuary which came under our notice , the defect which seemed to me most frequently to occur was the failure to harmonize expression with character . If it is true that every man has a character of some kind , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for the predominant dispositions of the mind , has its appropriate expression . A sculptor may give the great outlines of the head of Nero or Caligula , but if he adds the comparatively mild and just expression which characterizes the features of Antoninus or INerva , he violates both history and nature . I am not certain that I shall make myself understood , but it seems to me that the celebrated statue of Moses by Michael Angelo may properly be regarded as an illustration of this remark . " In looking upon this great work , which occupies a place in the church of St. Peter IN VINCULIS in Rome , we felt no disposition to detract from its acknowledged and obvious merits . In all the attributes of art , with the exception , as it seemed to me , of the relation between expression and character , it is a work eminently worthy of its distinguished author . We could not fail to recognize the creative mind of the artist at once . But naturally forming our ideal of Moses from our early readings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other mind which the mind of the artist has undertaken to repre // sent ? Where is the mind of Moses , which it should have been his first object to gather up and combine from history , and re-establish and make alive in marble ? Where is the expression of that humble and meek disposition , which his history and his writings have led us especially to attribute to him ? We certainly failed to recognize it in that stern and angry grandeur which characterizes the countenance of this statue . " In many of the numberless paintings and statues of the Virgin Mary which we everywhere saw , there was this painful failure of appropriate expression . Art has exhausted itself in drawing the outlines of her beauty ; but they are not inlaid with those revelations of holy thought and feeling , which her personal history has led us to expect . And still more is this defect seen in the statues and paintings of the Saviour . The predominant dispositions of the Saviour in his humanity were meekness , benevolence , pity , and perfect faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured by man 's unbelief and persecutions , nor by the inward trials to which his Heavenly Father sometimes left him . He had nothing in himself , but all things in God . And being a partaker of the divine nature , ' he loved as God loves , and communicated himself to others in all the appropriate sympathies of humanity . His love shone in his tears . His faith was not shaken , when the powers of darkness were let loose upon him . " In Paris , in Florence , in Rome , I looked upon painting after painting and statue after statue , and in almost every instance missed something of that divine expression , which should have stood out as the interpretation and the symbol of his character . The works in other respects were often admirable . There was symmetry , intelligence , beauty , such as we often see in the statues and portraits of good and distinguished men , but still an absence , in a greater or less degree , of the true and Christ-like disposition . " I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which is exempt in a great degree from this defect . It does not fully give the idea of Christ 's intellectual power ; but the expression of his affectional nature , of those heavenly dispositions which I have mentioned , leaves nothing to be desired . In the church of St. John Lateran we were shown a recumbent statue of Christ after his crucifixion , which produced upon us a similar effect . The countenance , as it appeared to be made present in marble , had not lost the look which was appropriate to its humanity ; but a mingled expression of sympathetic sorrow and triumphant peace seemed to ally it both with earth and heaven . But I think I never saw the character of the Saviour , the outline and filling up of his inward and sacred disposition , so per // fectly sculptured in the countenance , as in the marble statue of Christ in death , which we were shown in the church of St. Mary in the city of Naples . This extraordinary work was designed by Anthony Corradini , a Venetian artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was executed by Sarumartino , an artist of Naples , to whom a large share of its perfection is to be ascribed . Christ is laid in the tomb veiled . The veil is wrought in the marble with immense care and labor , and with such skill that the form of the body , and even the muscles , are seen through it , and what is remarkable , it is made to appear by the artist as if it were slightly moistened by the perspiration of death . But this veil does not obscure in any unfavorable degree the expression of the Saviour 's countenance , which is full of resignation , sympathy , peace , and triumph . My heart , which had lone , d relt upon the inward image , was deeply affected in the presence of that triumph of Christian art . The divine countenance , which it had embodied in marble , seemed to come like a revelation from another world , and was present with me many days after . So perfect was the expression of the Christ-like attributes , - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of the Scripture narrative , - that I could hardly help saying to myself , that I had seen the Saviour . " - pp. 245-249 . Another feature of this charming volume is the author 's generous sympathy with every form and manifestation of goodness , with every expression of the religious life , with sincerity and devotion under whatever name or rubric , and with whatever admixture of reputed error in speculative belief . What more worthy utterance of this sentiment could be given than in the following paragraph ? " One of the pleasant things of a religions nature , which increases the interest and happiness of the Christian traveller in foreign countries , is the evidence which he often obtains of the essential unity or oneness of character which exists in religious experience . In Europe , Asia , Africa , America , the child of God is one . Under blazing suns , and in polar snows , under all forms of government and diversities of education , as well as in all varieties of climate , the image of Christ is the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - not always completed , but filling out , with each day 's added lines and touches , into the likeness of that great and beautiful model , which cxLibited , in the person of Christ in his earthly incarnation , the soul of the Godhead in man 's human heart . Names , sects , parties* have no power to hide it , - any more than diversities of language , government , // and color . This beautiful image I saw in my travels , in countries and places far remote from each other ; - on the banks of the Po and the Tiber , in London , in Florence , in Alexandria , in Jerusalem , in the cottages of Waldensian Mountains , as I had seen it before in the mountains of America , - differing , undoubtedly , in degrees of completeness , but always true to the great Master 's hand . It needed no letter of introduction . I saw it with the eye of the heart . I embraced it with the arms of the affections . I can not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was more pleasant to me than the beauties of nature , delightful as they are ; - brighter than the light of the morning sun on the mountain-tops. " - pp. 577 , 578 . There is profound truth , as well as kind appreciation , in these remarks . On the lower branches of the tree of human existence , the blossoms , expanding slowly and imperfectly , are so tinged by earthly hues , and thrown out of symmetry by the pressure and attrition of surrounding objects , as to present perpetual diversity and contrast ; but on the topmost boughs , iii free air and sunlight , where alone they can reach perfection , they unfold after the same pattern of divine beauty and loveliness . The highest types of character bear a close mutual kindred , exhibiting indeed individualities of genius , taste , and capacity , yet no traits that mark them as of different races or conditions , or that interfere with their reciprocal recognition and fellowship . The elect spirits of all nations bear a strong family likeness . The insignia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianized slave , than do his frequent fetters and manacles to our conception of St. Paul . The hard , rough features of manhood disappear from the man who approaches the true standard of spiritual greatness , and womanly weakness seems merged in invincible might in those heroic Christian women who in every age have pressed into the foremost ranks of the cross-bearers . The differences of human character grow out of the power of circumstances as compared with that of character . Nations and conditions owe their dissilient peculiarities to the fact that their circumstances are stronger than they are . Individuals put off these peculiarities by accessions of inward might which make them stronger than their circumstances . And xvhile this might has no certain source other than Christianity , the ultimate unity of the race is not only // a vision of prophecy , but a necessary result of the progress of Christianity . Its progress , therefore , must tend toward universal peace . The offensive characteristics of nations no doubt lie behind the pretexts , give birth to the jealousies , are the remote causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these characteristics in their harshness and offensiveness become merged in a common Christian type , filaments of union and of fraternal feeling will so interlace the nations of Christendom , as to render the recurrence of the past and usual grounds of alienation impossible . Indeed , imperfectly as the leaven of Christianity is incorporated into the constitution of even the most favored people , we believe that there are already nations between which war has become a moral impossibility , on account of the assimilation and brotherly sympathy of those in each who have attained the highest type of character , who , perhaps with little direct political influence , wield a power in the creation of opinion and sentiment , to which courts and ministries must unconsciously succumb . To return to our author , his genial sympathies are by no means confined to the Christian fold . We are accustomed to stories of the disgusting squalidness of the populace of Egypt , and to long-drawn complaints of Arab perfidy and truculence . Not an unkind or distrustful word of any human being escapes him . He refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nile only in terms of compassion , and as proffering added claims on his tender regard and fellow-feeling . He seeks every opportunity of familiar intercourse with the poorest natives of the benighted regions through which his Oriental pilgrimage carries him , and announces the interchange of affectionate greetings and kind offices with some wretched family in a hut on a sand-waste , with the same serene satisfaction with which Dr. Sprague records a successful visit to a professor of world-wide celebrity . We quote the following estimate of the Arabs , with the characteristic apology even for their dogs , and the interview , which is but one of many of its kind , with the shepherd and his household . " I was favorably impressed with many of their traits of characterI // judge of them from what I saw . They seem to have lost the active and fierce spirit which characterized their ancestors . They are timid , and make but poor soldiers . I am not prepared , however , to condemn that cowardice , if such it may be called , which shrinks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed no deficiency of industry ; but there is very little enterprise . Their study is to live , and not to improve and advance . I can not easily join with those who are disposed to make an impeachment of their honesty , - because personally I have had no evidences to sustaia it . Nor have I seen evidences of inordinate suspicion , cruelty , and disposition to injure . I have been in their villages daily . The dogs which guard every door have sometimes attacked me . But the dogs were faithful to what they considered their trust ; and I have no especial complaint to make of their somewhat premature and unnecessary zeal . And the less so , because in some instances the Arabs themselves came and drove them away . What may be true of the Bedouin Arabs inhabiting the deserts , who are of the same race but differently situated and under different influences , 1 am unable to say . Time will perhaps determine . But from the Arabs of the Nile I have received as decided marks of kindness as amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single instance , which may be taken as an illustration of their treatment of me . One day the boat was fastened to the shore on account of a head wind . I strayed away alone into the fields , as was sometimes mypractice . Passing near the little hut of an Arab shepherd , who was seated at his door on a mat , he made signs to me to come and sit down . I accepted the invitation and sat down on the mat with him , and we began to converse in signs , aided by a few Arabic and Italian words which one easily picks up . I felt quite at home . In a short time he arose and went to his dwelling , which was a very simple inclosure formed partly by a mud wall and partly by a fence of long reeds which were strongly bound together ; and which was covered at the top with a roof of corn-stalks . Bringing out a jug of water and a wooden dish filled with excellent dates , he invited me to eat . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I saw he had that faith which can take hold of the common link of human brotherhood . Looking up I saw a little child peeping round the corner of the hut . This was a new incident . I made signs to it to come to me ; but it was frightened at my strange appearance , and ran away . The father smiled at this , and got up , and ran after the child , and brought it back . I pacified it with a little present , and we soon became good friends . The result of this was , that in a little time all the children , some four or five in number , came round successively from an opening on the other side of the inclosure. 18* // After a little while the Arab 's wife - contrary I believe to the usual customs among them - came also with an infant in her arms . The sun shone brightly , but we were on the shady side of the hut and a gentle breeze made music in the reeds . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as well pleased with me , as I was with them . I staid half an hour , and know not how much longer the visit might have been prolonged ; but our captain ( the RATS , as the people of the country call him ) sent one of his men , named Mohammed , to find me . He came with an amazing long club , to guard me , as he said , against the Arabs , which seemed to me a very unnecessary precaution . I left my hospitable entertainers , well pleased with my visit , and with sincere desires and prayers for their happiness ; - and have often thought of them since . " - pp. 265 - 267 . We would gladly copy extracts from the letters relatino* to Sinai and Palestine , but it is difficult to make selections where there is hardly a paragraph that is not remarkable either for descriptive power or for devotional sentiment ; and still more difficult is it by detached passages to convey any idea of the quiet ecstasy of lofty conteiuplation , reverence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting the reflection of a soul whose emotional life is calm from its very depth and fulness , and which with every step upon the soil consecrated by the Redeemer 's footprints drinks in his fresh benediction . Professor Upham has added greatly to the interest of us book by materials of which the title-page gives no presage . In his letters he not only describes his tour and the mental and spiritual experiences immediately connected with it , but freely follows out suggested trains of thought , sometimes in vivid reminiscences of the past , sometimes in the discussion of resthetie laws and principles . He has also inserted several poems , which purport to have been written under the inspiration of the scenes to which they relate , and were evidently the spontaneous expression of feelings , to which the numbers came unsought and flowed almost unbidden . Of these we copy what seems to us one of the best . " LINES WRITTEN ON THE MAIDEN FISH-TAMER. // From oozy bed and watery cave , The tenants of the lake who drew .

We have by no means done justice , in our brief notice , to a book of which we can only add , that , while as a devotional work it is a worthy companion of the author 's " Interior Life , " it presents an array of literary resources and imaginative power , which , had it no higher claims , would make it one of the choicest books of the day . We have taken it in hand , not so much for the sake of reviewing it , as to show the author into how great an error his modesty led him , when he wrote concerning these " Letters " : " I can not at present persuade myself that they would be likely to possess any special interest beyond a very limited circle .
