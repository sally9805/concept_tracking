AMERICAN WHT* REYJEW . No . XCII . FOR AUGUST 1852 . THE WHIG CONYENTION : THE CANDIDATE AND THE CAMPAIGN . THE respective National Conventions of the two great parties of the United States have closed their labor , and the stir and strife of discussion which have for the last few months divided the public mind with reference to the action of the divisions of one or the other party , to the success of this or that Whig or Democratic candidate in Convention , to the fate of this or that local and distracting sentiment , have at last resolved themselves into a concentrated and earnest question as to the triumph of one of the two great popular parties , whose forces now present themselves in the field of political action , marshalled and organized , and intent upon the work which lies before them . In a preceding number of this Review , we entered into the history of the late Democratic Convention , as illustrated and elucidated by the Conventions of former years . We detailed the various distracting elements which it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assimilate ; we reviewed the history of that monstrous and anti-democratic measure , the TwoThirds Rule ; showing its mischievous influences-the power which it confers upon stubborn and factious minorities , the opportunities it offers alike to the wilfulness of radical innovation and the blind pertinacity VOL. *VI. - EO . II . of conservative obstinacy , and the dark and ruinous precedents with which it has defiled our national history . We glanced at the man whom this infamous rule had raised to his present conspicuous position of candidateship , and indicated our belief that so negative a character , with so negative a creed as his party put forward , could hardly hope for success . We noticed also the reasons why it became necessary for his party to propose him to the acceptance of the people in place of the renowned and tough old soldiers of the Democratic army . We saw how these veterans had only lived to become contaminated by the parasites and the schemes of their party ; how , in the event of th3ir success , they would have become bankrupt from the ni*iltitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and how , therefore , out of sheer desperation-forced upon the Convention by the Two-Thirds Rule , and the scandal of the candidates-recourse was had to an unknown man , whose obscurity was the cause of that measure of political purity which he possesses , whose personal enemies were few simply because he was never strong enough or prominent enough to create enemies , whose political virtues and vices were almost negations , and in whose weakness // 98 The Whig Cc , nvention : was discernible a prospect of success . In the nomination of Franklin Pierce , we brought the history of the Democratic party to its final alliance with political and personal negation , leaving it , as it were , upon the shore of that unfathomable sea of noth ingness whose depths are now yawning for their intended victim . Since that time the Convention which we are now to chronicle has met and has made its choice . Before its assembling , during the months in which the claims of the three candidates for its suifrages were most eagerly discussed , we did not predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final disposition of the platform from which the party was to appeal to the people , would be made with that hearty promptitude and conciliatory zeal by which its final establishment has been honored and commemorated . We were aware that difficulties of moment and magnitude beset the Whig party , and while we did not for an instant doubt that they would be finally overcome , our most sanguine hopes have been infinitely distanced by the harmonious consummation to which we have alluded . While we disavowed alike the extremism of inconsiderate partisans of exclusive Northern or Southern interests , and saw their ultimate defeat plainly written in the de*tiny of the party , we also apprehended a degree of mischief from their collision from which we have been delivered by the non-consummation of the accident itself . It is a fault , but no sin , to have a disorganized conscience . While therefore we disown any sectional sentiment as Whig or National doctrine , we will not refuse to examine it , to consider it , and to prescribe for it . Here and there , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workings of embittered sectionalism , afflicting both parties , and thriving most rankly where the harshest means have been used to stifle it . We have not hesitated to argue with the men by whom these sentiments have been held . While we have shown them their folly and their want of national fidelity , we have not ruled them out of the pale of forbearance , or refused to admit their honesty in their misguided devotion to the principles of their adoption . For this we have earned the respect of candid men , and what is of equal importance , the respect of ourselves . Since the breaking out of sectional feeling between North and South in the time of the Mexican war , and the subsequent accessions to our territory-a feeling which it required the energies of our ablest statesmen to quell , which , although it could never have subverted the Union , might have distracted its councils during many years of strife and darknessthrough the memorable times of 1850 , up to the present hour , we have regulated our course by what we conceived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irrespective of local prejudices and political aspirations . Indeed , from our position we should have been doubly guilty had we done otherwise . Did we acknowledge the force of any such motive , we are not constrained to write for nny particular locality , or shape the current of our thought to suit the wishes of dictating constituents . A journal whose circulation is bounded by a county or a state district may have some shadow of excuse for sectionalism ; but had we stooped to any such weakness , the whole vocabulary 01 apologetics would have been ransacked in vain to find any plea or pretext for the voluntary degradation . In the contest we have maintained with the ten-headed monster of sectionalism , whose trunk has spanned this Republic , and drawn nourishment through its foul jaws at either end , it has been our fortune to make enemies as well as friends ; and we regard this as a welcome indication that we have not labored in vain . We have contended for principles steadily and from the beginning , and if we had encountered no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should have felt that we had been neither read nor recognized . The Review his not escaped the reproach of being styled an " anti-slavery organ . " The editors of this journal are not in love with the institution of slavery , but we defy the closest investigator to discover any passage in our cohumfis in which we have either attacked or defended that institution . It has not lain within our province to attack or defend slavery in any manner whatever . We do not recognize it as a national principle , and it is only with national principles and measures that as moral or political questions we have to do . In other quarters we have been styled a " compromise journal , " and we have been given to understand that the title was one of eminent reproach , and intended to do us injury . To the gentlemen who have honorcd us with these several ap // pellations we have only to express our regret that their zeal for our injury has resulted in such slight success . We intend to conduct this journal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with profit to all intelligent and sound-judging men ; and those who do not believe in the utility of such a course will do us a real and signal service by persevering in their attacks . We have no apology to offer for this brief statement with reference to the policy of the Review . We return to the difficulties which appeared to beset the Convention . As the time for the assembling of that body drew near , the troubles did not diminish . The peculiar position of one of the candidates  --  a po*ition now explained , and indeed relieved of all its embarrassment by the preliminary action of the Convention-was the text on which a great deal of argument was set forth by the different wings of the Whig party . The opposition to General Scott was of a nature easily explained . In his own view it was an act of political impropriety to give any written pledges of future action before called upon to do so by a nomination to that position which should make action necessary . With a reputation for high and steadfast integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a long and hard campaign of his soldier life , and with the profoundest assurance that not one word of all that hs had ever said or written could be quoted to show that he was not keenly and constantly alive to the interests of the entire nation-with this reputation and conviction , he felt hituseif , as an individual , under no obligations to give pledges until the time should came when to give the pledge and to maintain it before the people would be one and the same thing . In private letters and in conversation no reservation has been expressed by General Scott as to his views on national policy , or on that framework of concession which grew out of the joint labor of the wisest statesmen in the Congress of 1850 . In his own judgment , therefore , it was unnecessary to affix any further seal to the chart on which was inscribed his love for his country . In the event of his nomination he foresaw a necessity which did not , in his estimation , previously exist . To any resolutions submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully willing to subscribe . It became a matter of opinion with him whe ther he should or should not publish an explicit profession of his doctrine previous to his nomination , as the rule by which his actions should be gauged ; and as a matter of opinion it should be estimated . Nor was it argued in any other light . Those who have carefully read the eloquent debates  --  and there are few who have not-made on the floor of Congress by the members of the two disputing Southern parties , of whom Messrs . Gentry and Stanly may severally be taken as the representatives , will recollect that those who opposed the nomination of General Scott opposed him , not because he had ever shown himself hostile to the Union or the measures of 1850 , but simply because , in a crisis like the present campaign , it was better to adopt a candidate whose soundness could not be by any possibility assailed , than to select one against whom the arrows of the enemy could be more easily directed . Further than this the argtrment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body were with other candidates . Against such preferences no one objects , or has a right to object . But had it been foreseen before the Convention that the resolutions there adopted by a triumphant majority would have been adopted so easily and by so large a preponderance of votes , the argument against General Scott would haAre dwarfed at once into a personal preference for other candidates , such a preference as is at any time capable of being merged in the will of the majority . The resolutions passed by the Convention preliminary to the balloting for candidates did indeed place them all on a similar footing . But as these resolutions did not abate personal preferences , so they could not at once remove those apprehensions which had been so long suffered to affiliate with them that both seemed to share the same texture . When a body of men have entertained opinions for weeks or mont*s , and have spent much time in arguing then , they can by no process be at once delivered from them . If a single individual can not change his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consolidated body . There is a feeling of association , of pride in preserving a common bond of sentiment , of unwillingness in the case of each to yield before the rest , that goes very far towards perpetuating for a time any opinion or set of opinions formed by a group of intelligent and conspicuous men . // But if our opponents imagine that the opposition expressed by Southern Whigs to General Scott 's nomination before the Convention is not now removed by the removal of its cause , they are most egregiously at fault , and are counting on finding the weakness of disorganization where they will find all the power of united and determined action . The resolutions of the Whig Convention are at once explicit and national . The candidate who is nominated by that Convention endorses , in his acceptance of the nomination , the entire series of the resolutions . In coming before the people , he only appears in the attitude of a national candidate , who if elected will swear with the just solemnity of a Presidential inauguration " TO STAND BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sincerity of his vow , as it will be consistent with all his previous life . And now , while on the subject of the candidate , we wish to say a word relative to the course which this Review has pursued with reference to General Scott . We have not considered ourselves disqualified from having a preference in the matter of a Presidential candidate . The most remote and insignificant newspaper of the country is free to express its preference , and generally claims the honor of the Presidency for some individual within the lirnit.s of the State . We , of course , are influenced by no such local prejudice , and regard principally the statesmanlike qualities by which a man is fitted for that high office . Looking mainly at superiority in these qualifications , we have an indisputable claim to such a . preference as we can express without disparaging the services of others-such a preference in short as any intelligent citizen feels himself at perfect liberty to entertain and freely make known . Our first choice therefore was not General Scott . Had we acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to have made the Review a decided Scott journal , since its circulation is very much larger in the States whose votes were recently cast for Scott than in those whose votes were cast for the other candidates . There are few who will deny that the chances of General Scott for the Presidential nomination have all along been better than those of the Secretary of State , or the present incumbent of the Presidential office . By supporting him , therefore , or by ignoring other candidates , we should have been in the right way to prove our political sagacity , and perhaps might have got up a reputation for President-making that would not have been at all unflattering . But these considerations were of no moment in comparison with . the duty which we felt was owing to that man with whose name American greatness will always be associated , and who , we are proud to think , will not be forgotten so long as the noblest qualities of the statesman and the orator shall command the admiration of mankind . As a statesman long tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great beyond all examples in American history ; as a diplomatist feared by European monarchs , and successful in the most difficult of all diplomatic schemes ; as an unyielding and efficient supporter of the various measures by which the Whig party proposes to benefit the nation ; as a friend to the eminently national project of Land Reform ; and as a zealous and unflinching Whig ; in fine , as a man eminently fitted to guide the councils of this nation , to give dignity to its domestic acts and foreign policy , and to hasten us on the path to our high destiny , . our preferences were naturally in favor of Daniel Webster . We represented his services in t-hat light in which they deserved to be placed ; nor did we hesitate to say that if any thing can entitle a citizen to the nomination for the highest office in the gift of his fellows , it rests first in that combination of statesmanlike qualities which go so far to form the glory and renown of Webster . In being just to Mr. Webster , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice made to rest between three men so eminent , and so warmly backed by the incontestable proofs of actual service . Never was choice so delicate . One candidate was already in the Pi'esidential office . Another was his Secretary of State , and acting officially under his direction . The other was engaged under his orders as a General of the United States Army . Each of the three enjoyed the veneration and confidence of an influential portion of the Whig party . And never has there been a time when to speak well of one candidate was to say so little to the disparagement of the others . In suggesting , therefore , the claims of the Secretary of State for the Presidency , we felt that we enjoyed a peculiar immunity // from derogating from his competitors , since we felt that in this instance it was easy to be just . It was with no blind and indiscriminate eulogy that we remarked upon the characteis of Fillmore and Scott . We recognized the claims of both to the warmest ath*ction of the Whig party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firm , and progressive administration ; the other had rendered material services to the State , second only to those of Washington himself . We felt that they had merited the rewards they had already received , and were not undeserving higher honors . While we deemed the nomination of Mr. Webster an act at once of policy and justice , we argued that if he were set aside the choice bhould fall upon one of the remaining two of the illustrious group . In either case we saw a good Whig , a national man , and an upright President ; and when oir preferences were overruled by the majority of Conventional delegates , we felt that , however much the friends of Messrs . Fillmore and Webster might endure disappointment as individuals , the great Whig party was yet intact and harmonious , and that its moral and political strength was in no wise impaired by the discussion through which it had passed . Our views might have assumed a more sombre aspect , had we suffered ourselves to contemplate any such unwarrantable despotism as was exercised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate desired by none of its constiuents . But as the Whigs did not send their delegates to Baltimore to nominate a third-rate man over the heads of wiser and more distinguished candidates , so we had no fear that such a suicidal course would be pursued . The choice of the Whig party lay palpably between Scott , Webster , and Fillmore . That choice the delegates were bound to respect and abide by , and we congratulate them and the party that they have done so . There would have been no excuse for them had they done otherwise . The candidates were disfigured by no false pretensions ; they were hampered by no vile associations ; they were dogged by no foul and blackening history . The party had not proposed them , after months of deliberation , and in the solemn faith of honest men , to have them promiscuously thrown overboard . The ship was not so waterlogged to render such an act necessary . The officers were not so unworthy that they must be swept from the decks to give place to an unknown subaltern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played successfully in the ranks of the Whig party , and any attempts at such shameless imposition , should they ever take place , will be summarily and effectually put down . Let such maneuvring do for the " Democracy . " It may suit their tastes , although time alone can determine this . The prescription is a bitter one for them , but they may swallow it . But it will never do for the Whigs . The chances are infinite against its being attempted by any Whig Convention , nor indeed can it ever happen until a Convention of Whigs shall come together with the pr&amp;determined purpose of organizing defeat for the party whom they represent . In the most unequivocal terms , therefore , and with pride and pleasure , speaking for the National Whig party , both of the North and South , do we accept the nomination of Winfield Scott . He stands before us on a platform broad and firm ; the representative of principles national and enduring , untrammelled by inconsistencies or political wrongdoing , attended by an unbroken prestige of success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is supported . Already has disapointment passed from the feelings of the supporters of rival candidates , and the hearty and universal ratification of the nomination has afforded an unmistakable sign of that victory which , already organized , waits only the progress of time for its fulfilment . We are aware of the antipathy manifested by a few Southern men , formerly Whigs , to the nomination , and their determination to oppose it . While we regret that we should be obliged to chronicle any withdrawals from the Whig party at any time , and for any cause , we itre not conscious of any such feelings of dismay at this defection as the opposition seem disposed to ascribe to us . For , in the case of Messrs . Toombs , Stephens , and their more intimate political associates , this disaffection is not of recent origin . It has existed so long that we have became quite well acquainted with it . We have measured it by itself , by its precedents , and by concomitant circumstances , and we find in it little cause for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Messrs- Gentry and Williams , // of ' Tennessee , whose names appear in a sort of codicil to the document issued by Messrs . Toombs and Stephens . The gentlemen from Tennessee do not intend to oppose General Scott , but they are not inclined to support him . Heretofore known as true and leading Whigs , they have been scared by a political bugbear into a position full of perplexity to themselves , of gratulation to the Locotbeos , of antagonism to the sentiments of their constituents , and of no profit to the Southern Whig party at large . We sympathize with these gentlemen , as we sympathize with any honest man who places himself in a false and untenable position . We have no charity for the error itself , but reason teaches us to be considerate to its victims . Reflect , gentle men , that the votes of Tennessee were instrumental in nominating General Scott . Remember , moreover , that Scott could not have been nominated without the help of Tennessee , and Kentucky or Virginia ; and that the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true and profound conviction that he stood above the sectional atmosphere with which his enemies charged him with being nourished ; and that , by his announcement in his letter read before the Convention , and in his warm acceptance of the resolutions of the Convention , he had removed that distrust which , in your Congressional speeches , you had asserted as prevalent among yonr constituents . The nomination of General Scott is so far from being a Northern measure , that he could not have been nominated without a good share of Southern votes ; and never in the history of the nation have Southern votEs in Convention been cast with so much deliberation , care , and forethought The political life of Messrs . Gentry and Williams has been up to this time consistent and distinguished . They stand to-day almost alone among the Whigs of Tennessee in the tenacity with which they adhere to an unhappy prejudice ; nor can we believe that this prejudice will much longer continue to afflict their vision . The great Whig party at the North , the Whigs of Louisiana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of Tennessee , are forcing it upon their convictions daily that their eyes are gazing through a false medium , and that the dangers which they apprehend are visionary and impossible . We feel safe in leaving the future to their honesty , which has been throughout unquestioned . In the nomination of William A. Graham for the Vice-Presidency , we recognize a just tribute to the wisdom and purity of the Administration ; for , setting aside the high qualifications of the nominee for the office , we see a principle involved in his nomination which we would have the party bear in mind . In the earlier days of this Republic , when presidential power and purity of action were synonymous terms , and when cabinets were framed with a jealous eye to national honor and well-doing , it was the custom to look to the cabinet of one administration for the executive , or the substitute , of the next . Our fathers , with the punctilio of the old school , viewed this as by no means an unmeaning compliment . As a testimony of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound . Are we not entitled to claim a similar weight for the testimony which , in the present nomination , we have seen so explicitly manifested ? And may we not also find in Mr. Graham 's nomination a complete refutation of the charge of sectionalism urged against the Convention , and a convincing proof of the high nationality of the ground assumed by the Whig party ? But in the campaign on which we have now entered , the contest , with thinking men , will be a contest of principles . The Democratic party can make very small personal capital on a candidate and representative of the negative renown of Franklin Pierce . The question which has so long distracted our councils , we may regard settled by unanimous consent ; or if ever hereafter agitated , it can in no shape be made a party matter . The issues of a past century can not be trumped up to serve as rallying cries for either party , although by the resolutions of the Democratic Convention , we might understand that a different opinion is entertained by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for national decision . It is simply the duty of the contending parties , as we read the indications and the necessities of the times , to place before the people of this nation , in clear and unambiguous terms , what they intend to do , what are their creeds , their policy , and their prospective measures . On these a true and intelligent contest can alone be waged . // From such a contest the Democratic party seem anxious to hold aloof . With a temerity for which we can find no example , they come before the people without a creed , and without a man . They have miserably parodied the old game of 1844 . Then there was a show of reason for the course they adopted . Now their action is but an unbroken infatuation . They have put forward no inflammatory sentiments , such as " Annexation " and the " whole of Oregon , " and the deficiency is fearful and profound . They have ousted their well-known men for an image of straw , who represents nothing , and for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The claims they put forward for the votes of the nation sound more like the pretensions of professed mendicancy than the demands of a definite political organization . For what mendicancy can be more shameless or complete than that which asks for alms as a right , and ignores the necessity of acknowledgment by repudiating all the obligations of gratitude or reciprocal service ? That these remarks are true and can be readily substantiated , will be seen from a survey of the platform adopted by the Democratic Convention at Baltimore . A more negative body of resolutions were never passed by any political organization in this country . The first resolution in that body could with propriety be adopted by either party , and the same may be said of the fifth , eighth , and ninth . The second , third , and sixth are mere negatives ; and the fourth and seventh are cowardly evasions of negatives which the party do not dare to utter . Of the fossiliferous nature of most of these resolutions , we have elsewhere remarked . They are indeed memorable as specimens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unable to see the justice involved in propounding for popular acceptance , a creed which resolves itself upon examination into negation and repudiation of long since dead and buried issues . Nothing in the entire series appears so contemptible and cowardly as the following : " Resolved , That justice and sound policy forbid the Federal Government to foster one branch of industry to the detriment of any other , or to cher . ish the interests of one portion to the injury of another portion of our common country ; that every citizen and every section of the country has a right to demand and insist upon an equality of rights and privileges , and to complete and ample protection of persons and property from domestic violence or foreign aggression . " We suppose this resolution is aimed at a protective tariW and we are confirmed in this supposition by the absence of any other allusions to the subject of a tariff in the entire body of the resolutions . No one will refuse to subscribe to the words of this resolution , and there is therefore a peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning and despicable trick , by which the tariff Democracy are to be deceived as they were deceived in 1844 , and the anti-tariff Democracy are to propagate their mongrel and destructive half-way theory of free trade . Its ambiguous wording , its studied non-committalism , and its power of indefinite and manifold construction , fix us more firmly in the belief of what we have so often avowed , and with increasing definiteness of late years , that the doctrine of protection is every day growing more popular in the United States ; and that the Locofoco party , while professing to believe in the utility of free trade , dare not recommend it , dare not embody it in their written creed , and are even ready to disavpw it wherever such duplicity will secure votes . We have proved this in the case of the campaign of 1844 , in which Pennsylvania was carried for " Polk and the tariff of 1842 , " and the covert spirit of the resolution just quoted amply substantiates it . It is evident then , that in this campaign , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherents to the doctrine that " Revenue , sufficient for the expenses of an economical administration of the Government , should , in time of peace , be derived from a duty on imports , and not from direct taxation ; and in laying such duties , sound policy requires a just discrimiation , whereby suitable enct*uragment may be afforded to Americah industry , equally to all classes and to all parts of the country ; " - as adherents to this doctrine , we say , we shall be forced to contend with a duplicity and a meanness almost too great to be comprehended . In Pennsylvania , the Locofoco press and orators will assure the people in the most solemn terms , precisely as they assured their deluded hearers in 1844 , that a protective tariff is a measure dear to the heart of Democratic legislators , and one that will not be overlooked in the event of tri // umph . This falsehood will be repeated wherever found necessary , and we must expect that it will make many dupes . In quarters where the " Democracy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " manufacturing monopolies , " their ears will be tickled and their apprehensions allayed by a skilful reading of that sentence in which the Convention t'Al us that " Justice and sound policy forbid the Federal Government to foster one branch of industry to the detriment of any other , or to cherish the interests of one portion to the injury of another portion of our common country . " We warn the Whigs and that portion of the Democratic party who esteem the protective policy as most suitable to the development of our industrial resources , to beware of this cheat in time . We have been tricked and imposed on once ; let us not be deluded a second time . The artifice is as cunning as it can be made , but it is a shallow artifice after all , and a few plain facts are on.ly required to expose it . Let all protectionist Democrats be assured that , in event of the election of Franklin Pierce , no rise will be made in present tariff duties-least of all , on the commodity of iron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that one fruit of a Democratic victory will be a return to the tariff of 1842 ; it would make no difference if stump orators should canvass the mineral districts with pledges to such a measure , signed by the nominees themselves ; the Locofoco party dare not and will not sustain efficient tariff measures , and any local promises of such support will prove a sham and a delusion , fruitful of cheated and repentant victims . Nor will they dare to advocate in its lei*gth and breadth the doctrine of free trade . It is the policy of their leaders to conciliate the free-trade and protectionist wings of the party by promises of a contrary nature made severally to each . Therefore neither doctrine will be adopted , but each will be made available in time and place . The freetrader will be flattered , the protectionist will be tickled , and each will continue to see his favorite measure postponed . It remains to be seen whether this subterfuge will long continue to flourish , and whether , in the present campaign , it will make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We warn Whigs and honest Democrats to beware of it in time . We come now to another issue of the present campaign still more direct and tangible ; and one which , while it affects the entire territory of the United States , is full of peculiar interest to the inhabitants of the Western and Southwestern States , where " Democracy " is counting on its largest triumphs . We refer to the issue between the Whig and Locofoco parties on the subject of Internal Improvements , as embodied in the following resolutions , the first adopted at Baltimore by the Whig party , the latter by our opponents : " Resolved , That the Constitution vests in Congress the power to open and repair harbors , and remove obstructions from navigable rivers . It is expedient that Congress should exercise such power whenever such improvements are necessary for the common defense , and for the protection and facility of commerce with foreign nations , or among the States-said improvements being , in every instance , national and general in their character . " The other resolution reads as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confer upon the General Government the power to commence and carry on a general system of internal improvements . " Now , granting that there is doubt about the power of Congress to appropriate money for the improvements of rivers and harbors , allowing , for the sake of the argument , a restriction which we repudiate as narrow and unnational to the last degree , what other motive can a party have for turning doubt into denial other than a confirmed hatred of all beneficent general legislation ? Alike in law and equity , where there is doubt as to a measure , its decision is influenced by its utility . By this rule we are willing that that clause of the Constitution relative to internal improvements should be interpreted . Statesmen have differe4 about its interpretation as a technicality , but with reference to its spirit no doubt can be entertained . If , as we say , Congress is entitled by the Constitution to app opriate money for general internal improvements , and if , as the Locofoco party say , Congress is not so entitled , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public funds , what arbiter should be allowed to intervene other than a wise regard for national interests such a regard as can only be manifested by actual and tangible operations ? // qwq We take leave here of what we conceive to be the two vital and practical issues of the campaign , not , however , without the intention of doing them full justice by as many expositions as shall be hereafter necessary . We intend to set forth elaborately and completely the demands of our Western lakes and rivers upon the beneficent care of the General Government , by displaying their present condition , and by suggesting that state of improvement to which in the future they can be made to attain ; we intend to explain , as in past time , the phi- single one brought to a successful consummation , the " let alone " policy would not prove to have been particularly useful . But the Erie Canal is a work of construction , not of improvement . It differs only in a slight degree from the laying of a railway , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad nothing to do with it . We do not ask Congress to vote money for our railways , or canals , or turnpikes . When we begin to petition for such appropriations , it will be time to introduce the Erie Canal as a counter argument to the demand . What we ask is that the General Government shall take cognizance of water communications which exist hy nature ; that it shall increase the navigability of those vast rive* s which drain the broad plains of the Western States ; and afford safer harborage on the shores of our great lakes . Intelligent men need hardly he told of the difference between such measures , and a measure like that of constructing a canal lying entirely within the borders of a single State . From the continual misstatement of the issue , however , we have thought proper to add this note . losophy and the effects of a Protective Tariff ; and to display from time to time the minor questions of our politics in the clear light of Whig doctrine . We can not expect that all voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied by very many intelligent men of both parties in the ensuing months , we have full faith . Were we also assured that a prompt renunciation would follow conviction of error , and that the magnitude of the interest would be equalled by the diligence and candor of the research , we should have no fear as to the result of the coming election . Nor in any case do we allow ourselves to doubt of the success of the Whig party in the present campaign . We say this not presumptuously , nor as a party comment upon political texts , but as the result of a profound conviction of the strength of our cause and the popularity of our candidate . In the separate materials of creed and representative , we are thoroughly furnished . The elements of success are with us , and it only remains to use them wisely , in order to the achievement of a complete and signal victory . And while we believe that no shocks can turn the course of this Republic from its high and noble destiny , we also believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded , and its elements of internal wealth kept more widely apai-t from harmonious union , than by the triumph of what we are required to call " Democracy.
