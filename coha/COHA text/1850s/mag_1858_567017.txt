HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY . We have received an extended communication with regard to Mr. J. C. Hamilton 's " History of the Republic of the United States of America , as traced in the writings of Alexander Hamilton , and of his contempOraries.77* It is from the pen of a gentleman who has been most honorably known in the history of this state for his public services ; and who BOW , near the ninetieth year of his life , retains the recollections of the whole period embraced in the history whose title we have given above . We doubt not that his criticisms will be read with interest , and we gladly make room for them here . The first volume of this work was published a year or two since . It will be recollected that it was severely criticised on account of certain bold claims advanced in it in the public archives of the nation , which bear the signature of General Washington . A second volume has recently appeared , in the preface to which the author takes occasion to remark upon these criticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this preface , Mr. Hamilton declares that , having recently had access to the public archives at Washington , he " found a mass of material of great value , much of it hitherto unused . " He says that the autograph letters written by Hamilton , " in behalf of Washington , while a member of his staff , exceed a thousand in number ; " and that " others have been traced in private collections . " It was in consequence of the wider field of view thus obtained , that he resolved to " embrace in the plan of his work , both a history and a biography . " He asserts his object to be to present a faithful and honest narrative  --  a series of authentic statements , which will bear the closest scrutiny , and thus be of service to his country . As a biographical work , a finer subject could hardly have been selected . The singular precocity of Hamilton*s genius and talents , the unsurpassed industry with which they were cultivated , the fortunate period of their existence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and action , formed a most felicitous basis for their display ; and nobly was it improved . Any failure that may be imputable to the work before us , is not to be found in the subject , but in History of the Republic of the United States of America , as tracedi the writings of Alexander Hamilton , and of his Contemporaries . By JOHN C. HAMILTON . 2 vols . Svo. *cw York : ID . Appleton &amp; Co. 1858. // the management of it . That the work is a failure , it will be our object in some measure and degree to point out , thou , h by no means to the extent of which the subject is susceptible . This failure results from an attempt to grasp for Hamilton the praise of achievements to which he never laid claim , nor was entitled to lay claim . In doing which it is believed , and with regret believed , that Mr. John C. Hamilton has essentially injured the fame of his illustrious sire . To begin with the statement that the autograph letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of his family , and now in the department of state , exceed a thousand in number , while others are to be found in private collections . This may be , but we are strongly inclined to imagine that this assertion should be taken with some qualification , and not literally understood . The official letters of General Washington , during his command , were doubtless very numerous , but the period of Hamilton 's acting as aid-de-camp being a little less than four years , having , as stated by Mr. J. C. Hamilton , commenced March 1 , 1777 , and abruptly terminated February 16 , 1781 , and all connection with Washington 's family having ceased in the month of April of that year , the number stated would amount to about a letter a day during the period alluded to . But it can hardly be supposed that the whole drudgery of the correspondence was cast upon Hamilton . He was a favorite and highly esteemed aid-de-camp of the General , while he remained in his family , and afterwards , during the General 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , " were undoubtedly written during this same period by other members of his military family . Now we doubt whether , at that time , General Washington 's correspondence was so voluminous . Charity compels us to regard Mr. Hamilton 's statement as a random guess . We will next pay some attention to the work as a " History of the Republic of the United States . " The preface invites the " closest scutiny . " We do not profess to have given it a close scrutiny , but we have marked many obvious mistakes . We will quote a few , as a test of Mr. Hamilton 's qualifications , as an accurate historian . On page 58 , of the first volume , he states in his account of the Congress of September , 1774 , that as no delegate appeared from Georgia , there were but eleven colonies represented . There is probably scarcely a school-boy to be found in the land , who does not know that at the commencement of the Revolutiop , there existed thirteen British colonies . Georgia being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . At page 77 it is stated that George Clinton , during // nearly the entire continuance of the war , or at l*ast the most trying part of it , had the chief command at the Highlands , and thus held the keys of that natural citadel . The fact is that George Clinton never held the chief command of the Highlands for a single day . He , indeed , commanded at Fort Montgomery , an important post in that region , the day it was stormed and taken . But at that post only , and that for a very short time . At page 92 , in giving the account of the first appointment of general officers by congress , he states that Seth Pomeroy of Connecticut , was appointed a brigadier general . The only brigadiers appointed at that time in Connecticut , were David Wooster and Joseph Spencer . Pomeroy was a Massachusetts man , and if appointed did not accept . At the next page he mentions the battle of Bunker Hill ; but that event is not deemed of importance enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation more than one short paragraph , and that contains an historical inaccuracy in assigning the chief command to Prescott , instead of to Putnam . Prescott , indeed , commanded in the redoubt , but Putnam was the superior officer and commanded in the field , and at the breast-works . These instances of inaccuracy , found within the first hundred pages of the first volume , will be sufficient to evince the safety , or rather want of safety , of the ground on which he relies , when inviting scrutiny . We will advert now to the title of Mr. Hamilton 's work . He has been equally unfortunate here . The biography of no man , except perhaps that of Washington , is so connected and interwoven with the leading events of the war , as to render it the proper basis of a history of that period of the American annals , and even that would scarcely afford sufficient ground for an undertaking so comprehensive as that proposed by the author . The plan , too , of combining in the same work the biography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great nation , does not please us . It makes it necessary to pass over in entire silence many events , which no historical work should omit ; to record others of equal importance in a slight and unsatisfactory manner ; and to give an undue prominence to the events in which the subject of the work had an agency . We have illustrations of this , in the history before us , which would seem little better than ridiculous , if biography did not come to its aid . The letter of Hamilton to his friend Col. Mead , which is quoted , describing the person and character of his boy-baby seven months old , and proposing a match between him and Col. Mend 's baby of the other sex , of about equal age , would appear both proper and pleasing in a mere biographical work , but is hardly up to the dignity of history , and surely // should not have found a place in a work where that is ostensibly the leading object . Furthermore , with regard to the title . It does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its progress . The title , to comport with the real object , should read thus- " Alexander Hamilton , the Republic of the United States . " Louis XLV , during a long course of unbroken successes , said of himself , " I am the nation ! I am France ! " and Napoleon Bonaparte , in the midst of a far more brilliant career , said " I am the Republic ! " But Alexander Hamilton never laid claim to any such distinction , nor to any other which was not justly his due . In his writings , there is not a word which gives the least countenance to the claim so confidently put forth in the work under review , that he was the principal , if not the sole writer and conductor of the official correspondence of Washington , during nearly half of the entire period of his command of the army . This effort of the son to enhance the fame of the father , at the expense of Washington , is preposterous ! The subject of the work is illustrious enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and importance by taking aught from the fame of the Father of his Country ! But , after all , what we most emphatically reprehend in this book is the manner in which Mr. J. C. Hamilton makes his astounding claims . He alludes to a vast number of letters , which he says exist in Hamilton 's hand-writing , and bear the signature of Washington . Some of these he quotes at length . Others he gives only in part , and in very many eases he mentions only the occasion , the address and the date . But in every single instance he is careful to use language of this kind , " Written by Hamilton over the signature of Washington ; " - " Written by Hamilton for Washington ; " - " by Hamilton at the request of Washington ; " - " from the pen of Hamilton , signed by Washington . " And in every instance in which a letter of Washington is mentioned , which is almost as numerous as the pages devoted to that four year 's relation to his family , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions , or language of precisely the same import , accompanies the quotations , or allusions ; this too , in the most disgusting manner imaginable . If any person can read that portion of Mr. Hamilton 's work without disgust , he must certainly have more patience than we possess . We never experienced more unutterable disgust than in reading that part of the work devoted to the proof of his claim that Hamilton was the real author of all Washington 's writings for the period specified . Whether the claims were true or false , the manner of enforcing it is perfectly ridiculous and utterly // disg*isting . It is cuckoo ! cuckoo ! cuckoo ! Pen of Hamilton ! Pen of Hamilton ! Pen of Hamilton ! But we will give a somewhat closer scrutiny to this part of the work . General Washington , in a letter to Congress , given at page 174 of the first volume , complains that his correspondence , and other matters in writing , necessary and proper to be preserved , was more than his secretary was able to enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still remained in loose sheets in the " original rough draft , " mentioning at the same time the assistance rendered by his aid-decamps to his secretary , and requesting leave to employ assistant writers at the public expense , for copying letters , et cetera , but saying nothing of composing them . This was granted , we are told , by Congress . It is by no means improbable that in the press of business , the General may , as in the printed volumes of his correspondence it appears he did , direct his secretary , on particular occasions , to write letters for him , giving in writing , or in mere verbal directions , the substance of what he wished communicated ; and as Hamilton was certainly a very able writer , it is not at all improbable that in certain critical instances his pen was called into exercise . Mr. Hamilton , in the preface to the second volume , has justly observed that the style of men much practiced in writing , is very distinguishable , and states this to be true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few documents , which he says bear the signature of Washington , and much resemble the style of a number of letters , contained in these volumes , addressed by Hamilton to Morris , Clinton , and others . One of these is a remonstrance to a resolution of Congress , addressed by Washington to that body , in apprehension that it would , as in fact it did , defeat a cartel for the exchange of prisoners , negotiated by him with the British commander-in-chieg through the agency of Hamilton ; he having been appointed for that purpose by Washington . This remonstrance , as he claims , bears a considerable resemblance to letters written by Hamilton himself on the subject , to Morris and others . But by far the most striking letter of all , said to bear Washington 's signature , is dated the 11th of November , 1778 , cited on page 505 of the first volume . This is worthy of special attention . Congress had devised an expedition to Canada , to be conducted by the Marquis LaFayette , in conjunction with a naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its several details , was submitted by Congress to Washington , and his opinion thereon required . " The preparation of this opinion , " says Mr. Hamilton , " was confided to Hamilton . " // The opinion of Washington upon this subject appears in the second volume of his published letters . It is written in his well known , straight forward and unadorned style , looking directly at the subject in view , without turning to the right hand or to the left in search of ornament . Yet this is claimed as entirely the work of Hamilton . We quote the language : " A full examination of the subject , in its military aspects , was communicated to Congress in a letter written by him ( Hamilton ) in the name of Washington . " But very wisely , not a word of this letter is quoted . Every word , however , is given of a letter of November 14th , 1 ' 7 ' 78 , three days after the former , which , Mr. Hamilton says , was addressed as a private letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 11th . We admit that this letter , in the form in which it appears , is written in a style unlike that of Washington ,  --  as unlike as anything ever written by Hamilton in his most ambitiously elegant effort . It is to be remarked , however , that this letter does not appear among the published letters of Washington , nor is there anything to lead us to suppose that it was a common practice with him , when addressing Congress through the President , to add a private letter upon the same subject . This practice , as appears by General Burgoyne 's published correspondence , concerning his unfortunate expedition , with Lord George Germaine , seems to have been common with the British commanders when communicating with the ministers in England . We acknowledge there may have been reasons why it was best that such a private letter should be written . The wise foresight manifested in it may well be conceived to have existed at that time in the mind of Washington , but it would have been consummate imprudence and folly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress then was , composed of the most heterogeneous materials . Washington would never have put his name to such a letter at that crisis , or suffered such a letter from him to be laid before Congress . It is very possible , we say , that Hamilton was directed to write a letter expressing just those views . But what a parade has Mr. J. C. Hamilton made of it ? and to what preposterous use has he put it ! We will give one more example . As if to test th' credulity of the public , and to establish his complete sway over it , Mr. Hamilton has been at the pains of inserting in his work a fac simile of Hamilton 's handwriting , containing a military order of Washington to the officer commanding at Red Bank , specifically prescribing the conduct to be observed by him in that station . Having presented the order in this form , Mr. Hamilton , with his usual confidence , doubtless concluded it would be ta // ken as demonstrative proof of entire authorship in Hamilton , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as aid-de-camp , who furnishes the reason of its being so signed , to wit , that the General had gone to bed . Now it is hardly possible to credit the idea that any man of common sense , having the least knowledge of Gen. Washington 's character , ( J. C. Hamilton excepted , ) would be induced to believe that he would wholly confide to an aid-de-carup , of a few months over twenty years of age , the authority of making out and transmitting ( and that too , without inspection ) directions to be observed by the commandant of so important a post as that of Red Bank , upon the maintenance of which , in a great measure , depended the successful defense of Fort Muffin ; upon the fate of which depended the security of winter quarters for the British army in Philadelphia , and the effort to take which fortress for that purpose , cost the British fleet and army much toil , and the loss of a ship of the line and a sloop of war . Who is there that reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least doubt but that Gen. Washington penned every word in that order , and committed it to his aid-de camp to copy and forward before retiring to rest l This may well he estimated as being the ne plus ultra of Mr. Hamilton 's presumptive confidence in the gullibility of the public ! Mr. Hamilton even carries his claim of the entire dependence of Washington upon Hamilton 's pen , so far as to represent that he had recourse to it in a very short congratulatory note to his friend Gov . Livingston , upon his lucky escape from a kidnapping plan to catch and carry him within the British lines . All this , however , is by no means the extent of Mr. Hamilton 's scheme to enhance Hamilton 's fame , at the expense of that of Washington . No intelligent person who reads the work can fail to see that the object of it is stealthily to inculcute the idea that Hamiltoa was the prime mover of many , if not the most of the acts at h'ead quarters during his abode there , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approbation . How Washington got along with his correspondence after Hamilton left his family , Mr. Hamilton does not inform us . Now we state emphatically , and perhaps should have stated it at an earlier stage of our remarks , that with a few exceptions , to some of which we have alluded , all the specimens of Washington 's correspondence given , either in whole or in part , bear a most striking resemblance to the style of Washington throughout . Not one of them bears the least // resemblance to the style of Hamilton , as exhibited in his letters to Morris and others . Alexander Hamilton was born in January , 1 ' 75 ' 7 , ( Mr. Hamilton says on the 11th day , ) was selected by Washington to act as his aid*de-camp , in the early part of the year 1V7* , ( Mr. Hamilton says on the first day of March , ) when but little over twenty years of age . How startling then the claim , that Washington , whose character for cautious wisdom and dignified self-respect has rarely if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a youth , however precocious , a portion of his public functions , so important , and of so delicate a nature as that of his official correspondence ; and that too , when all thoroughly acquainted with the history of those times know that many of the great and wise patriots of the country , who started the Revolution , had ceased to occupy seats in Congress , and in a measure were succeeded by men wanting both the wisdom and patriotism of their predecessors , and frequently intermeddling with the affairs of the army in such a manner as was greatly to the embarrassment of the commander-in-chief . Congress at that time , rarely adopted a wise measure in regard to military affairs until lugged into it by the patient and perseveing labors of Washington , in his correspondence with them . Furthermore , he was not ignorant of the existence of the celebrated " Cabal , " in which a number of its members were engaged , nor of its object . It came into existence in the latter part of the year 1* ' 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members for a time cherished a sanguine faith in its success , but like the hopes of the wicked , it soon perished . Mr. J. C. Hamilton seems to suppose that , because there are many letters in the public archives at Washington , in the hand-writing of his father , which bear the signature of Washington , this is conclusive proof that he was their sole and original author . Now so far is this from being the case , it does not in the slightest degree tend to prove it . The puL lication of the writings of Washington , by Mr. Jared Sparks , shows what the common sense of any man would suggest , that Washington endeavored to preserve copies of all his official letters , whether written or dictated by him , during his command of the army . Very many of these were written , doubtless , in perplexing haste , and many with much thought and deliberation , requiring attention and review . All these , it is natural to suppose , would show more or less of erasure and interlineation , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of keeping copies of his correspondence , whether of a literary or of a business character , may be confidently appealed to , whether it has not been his invariable practice // to keep for himself the original draft , and forward to its address the corrected copy . But if the hand-writing in which a document appears in the public archives is conclusive evidence of authorship , what are we to suppose when we find the originals of these very letters among Washington 's own manuscripts , and in his own hand-writing ? Must we believe that General Washington copied , with his own hand , the letters which his subordinates had written for him ? We doubt whether even Mr. J. C. Hamilton is bold enough to indulge this supposition , though we must admit , if he advanced it , it would manifest scarcely less intrepidity than the claims made in his first volume , and reiterated and elaborately sustained in the preface to the second . How many of the letters , signed by Washington , and addressed to Congress , to the Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now appear among the public archives in the hand-writing of different secretaries or aids-de-camp , Mr. Hamilton does not inform the public . Doubtless very m*sny ; probably the greatest part of them so appear . But what does this prove with regard to the authorship of these letters ! Two volumes of Washington 's official letters , commencing within ten days after his appointment as commander-in-chiet and extending to the 13th of December , I 778-embracing the period of four entire campaigns , were published more than sixty years ago . Some of these were professedly writen by secretaries , and appear with their signatures as such . As for the rest , we think it would severely test the discriminating faculties of a more accurate detector of peculiarities of style than Mr. J. C. Hamilton has shown himself to be , to point out which of those signed by Washington were written by another hand . In fact it Thay be assumed with safety , that there never were an equal number of letters found in any one publication of epistolary compositions , so uniformly manifesting unequivocal evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preface , in a somewhat positive , not to say pompous manner , repells the suggestion that his object has been to exalt his father 's fame at the expense of that of Washington . But we are still constrained to ask what other object could he have had ? It surely could not have been to establish the reputation of General Hamilton as a writer of extraordinary capacity , force and elegance of diction , for all this both friends and foes accord to him , without a single dissenting voice . No fair minded man can read this book without having the impression forced upon him that the author makes out that Hamilton was the prime mover in every important matter-Hamilton did // this , and Hamilton did that ! Nothing is left for Washington but to attach his signature to the various letters of advice and command which the aid-de-camp sees fit to write to Congrees , and to officials of every grade . Is all this true ? Can a man who gives such an impression exonerate himself by simply saying that lie means no injury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impudent than the original claim , is it not this lame attempt to apologize ? We regret that such an attempt has been made by a descendant of Alexander Hamilton , a name which will ever adorn the annals of the United States , and be held in admiration for talents and statesmanship of the highest order . We do not doubt that a far more exceptionable effort is to be put forth in the further progress of this work . We see it shadowed forth that an attempt will be made to attribute the principal , if not the sole authorship of Washington 's farewell address to Hamilton . This claim , indeed , has already been made , founded on the unquestionable fact that a paper , very nearly a copy of the address , as published by Washington , was found among the effects of Hamilton , after his decease . This paper was cited by some of his surviving friends , and afterwards by his sons as they grew up , as full proof that he was the author of that celebrated and admirable production . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the death of Hamilton , drew forth a letter from Governor John Jay . It was dated in March , 1811 , and was addressed to Judge Peters of Philadelphia , and may be found on page 336 , of the second volume of " The Life and Writings of John Jay . " In this letter , the fact of such a copy being found among General Hamilton 's papers , is satisfactorily accounted for ; and the claim of original authorship in Hamilton thoroughly disposed of and set aside . That letter , not surpassed in force of reasoning or elegance of diction by any one in our language , states historically in regard to the real authorship of the address , that General Hamilton , a short time before its appearance , informed him that he had received a letter from the President , accompanied by a " valedictory address , " which he requested him and Governor Jay to revise . A day was fixed upon by them for attending to the President 's request , at the Governor 's house . Hamilton attended according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reading and considering it , " he thought it was susceptible of improvement , and that he thought it the best and easiest way to leave the draft untouched , and in its fair state , and to write the whole over with such amendments ; alterations and corrections , as he thought advisable , and that he had done so , and proposed to read it , and make it the subject // of their consideration . " The Governor then goes on to say , that they proceeded to consider it , paragraph by paragraph , until it met their approbation . Some few alterations were made , and the original manuscript draft , and the amended one , were then sent to the President . How far the President approved of and adopted the amendments proposed , does not , by Governor Jay 's letter , appear . Probably the most , if not all of them , were adopted ; for having selected the two ablest political writers in the nation , as the revis*s of what he had written , he would be very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hand-writing , finally sent to the printer , was , after his decease , sold by his executors . We have seen what professed to be an exact printed copy , with every alteration from the first draft exactly delineated ; and if so , they were nearly all verbal alterations . Governor Jay , in his letter , not only gives an historical account of the action of Hamilton and himself in compliance with Washington 's request , but with eloquent indignation and lofty scorn denounces in advance the assertion , if it should ever be put forth , that any one but Washington was entitled to the credit of being the author of the " valedictory address " As the Life and Writings of John Jay were published many years ago , and the taste of the great mass of readers is directed to new publications , it may be expedient to give a short extract from the letter in question . The Governor , in his letter , before giving the minute statement above cited , of the course pursued by Hamilton and himself in the revisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , speaks of the great achievements of Washington , of his ability as a writer , the great amount of his writings and of his surpassing digni.ty of character , then proceeds to enquire whether it can be credible that Hamilton , after receiving the " valedictory " for revisal , should send it back , and with it an entirely new one drawn up by himself , together with his advice to make use of it instead of his own . A supposed proceeding which he describes in the following appropriate language : " Among those to whose judgment and candor President Washington would commit such an interesting and delicate task , where is the man to be found who would have the hardihood to say to him in substance , though in terms ever so nice and courtly-Sir , I have considered your draught of an address . It will not do ; it is really good for nothing . But , Sir , I have taken the trouble to write out a proper one for you ; and I now make you a present of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world as your own ; the cheat will never be discovered , for you may // depend on my secresy. " * * * " If it be possible to find a man among those whom he esteemed capable of offering to him such a present , it is impossible to believe that President Washington was the man to whom such a present would have been acceptable . They who knew President Washington , in his various endowments and qualifications and virtues , know that aggregately considered , they formed a tout ensemble ' which has rarely been equaled and perhaps never excelled . " If all this be not sufficient to silence the claim of Mr. J. C. Hamilton , - that his father was the real and sole author of the address , surely a letter from that father to General Washington , published in the works of Hamilton , edited by the son , ought to be deemed amply sufficient . That letter , bearing date some short time before the appearance of the valedictory address in which Washington declines being a candidate for the then approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mentioned to me your wish that I would redress a certain paper which you had prepared , " and then goes on to request that the paper might be sent to him as soon as convenient . It is not necessary to quote the exact language . Every circumstance being considered , no possible doubt can be entertained that the valedictory address was the paper alluded to in the letter . Mr. J. C. Hamilton 's claim of the authorship by Hamilton of that address , can not be persisted in without involving a direct imputation of want of veracity of both the distinguished men whose letters have been cited . That Hamilton should retain a copy of the draft agreed upon by Jay himself , everybody must agree was perfectly natural and proper ; if for no other purpose , certainly for that of seeing how far those proposed amendments were approved of and adopted by Washington . No one who entertains a just estimate of the character of Alexander Hamilton , can be found who will believe he would have suffered that paper to have remained unexplained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been made of it as has here been attempted . The world , it is hoped and believed , will hold his fame above the taint of such an unworthy act . The third volume of " The Spanish Conquest in America * has been long upon our table .
