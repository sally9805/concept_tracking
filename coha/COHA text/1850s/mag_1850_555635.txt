txt ART . VI . - The Scarlet Letter , a Romance . By NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE . Boston : Ticknor , Reed , and Fields . 1850. 15mo. pp. 322 . THAT there is something not unpleasing to us in the misfortunes of our best friends , is a maxim we have always spurned , as a libel on human nature . But we must be allowed , in behalf of Mr. Hawthorne 's friend and gossip , the literary public , to rejoice in the event - a " removal " from the office of Surveyor of the Customs for the port of Salem , - // which has brought him back to our admiring , and , we modestly hope , congenial society , from associations and environments which have confessedly been detrimental to his genius , and to those qualities of heart , which , by an unconscious revelation through his style , like the involuntary hetrayal of character in a man 's face and manners , have won the affection of other than personal friends . We are truly grieved at the savage " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national eagle , scratches gratuitous and unprovoked , whereby his plumage remains not a little ruffled , if his breast be not very deeply lacerated . We hope we do not see tendencies to self immolation in the introductory chapter to this volume . It seems suicidal to a most enviable fame , to show the fine countenance of the sometime denizen of Concord Parsonage , once so serene and full of thought , and at the same time so attractively arch , now cloudy and peevish , or dressed in sardonic smiles , which would scare away the enthusiasm of less hearty admirers than those he " holds by the button . " The pinnacle on which the " conscience of the beautiful " has placed our author 's graceful image is high enough , however , to make slight changes from the wear and tear of out-door elements , highway dust , and political vandal-. ism , little noticed by those accustomed to look lovingly up to it . Yet they can not be expected to regret a " removal , " which has saved those finer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; from being worn away by rough contact , or obliterated by imperceptible degrees through the influence of the atmosphere . Mr. Hawthorne 's serious apprehensions on this subject are thus candidly expressed - " I began to grow melancholy and restless ; continually prying into my mind , to discover which of its poor properties were gone , and what degree of detriment had already accrued to the remainder . I endeavored to calculate how much longer I could stay in the Custom House , and yet go forth a man . To confess the truth , it was my greatest apprehension , - as it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as my . self , and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to in the Surveyorship , and become much such another animal as the old Inspector . Might it not , in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me , finally be with me // as it was with this venerable friend , - to make the dinner hour the nucleus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an old dog spends it , asleep in the sunshine or the shade ? A dreary lookforward this , for a man who felt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities ! But , all this while , I was giving myself very unnecessary alarm . Providence had meditated better things for me than I could possibly imagine for myself . " A man who has so rare an individuality to lose may well shudder at the idea of becoming a soulless machine , a sort of official scarecrow , having only so much of manly semblance left as will suffice to warn plunderers from the property of " Uncle Sam . " Haunted by the horror of mental annihilation , it is not wonderful that he should look askance at the drowsy row of officials , as they reclined uneasily in tilted chairs , and should measure their mental torpidity by the length of time they had been subjected to the soul-exhaling process in which he had not yet got beyond the conscious stage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not in a satirical , and far less a malicious , mood , that he describes one of them as retaining barely enough of the moral and spiritual nature to keep him from going upon all fours , and possessing neither soul , heart , nor mind more worthy of immortality than the spirit of the beast , which " goeth downward . " Judging his aged colleagues thus , well might the young publican , as yet spiritually alive , stand aghast ! A man may be excusable for starving his intellect , if Providence has thrown him into a situation where its dainty palate can not be gratified . But for the well being of his moral nature , he is more strictly responsible , and has no right , under any circumstances , to remain in a position where , from causes beyond his control , his conscience is deprived of its supremacy over the will , and policy or expediency , whether public or selfish , placed upon its throne . " Most men , " says our honest author , " suffer moral detriment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( having just devoted four pages to a full-length caricature , ) he bad not space to hint at , except in the following pithy admonition to the aspirants after a place in the Blue Book . " Uncle Sam 's gold - meaning no disrespect to the worthy old gentleman - has , in this respect , a quality of enchantment , like that of the Devil 's wages . Whoever touches it should look well 12* // to himself , or he may find the bargain to go hard against him , involving , if not his soul , yet many of his better attributes ; its sturdy force , its courage and constancy , its truth , its self-reliance , and all that gives the emphasis to manly character . " It was great gain for a man like Mr. Hawthorne to depart this truly unprofitable life ; but we wish that his demise had been quiet and Christian , and not by violence . We regret that any of the bitterness of heart engendered by the political battle , and by his subsequent decapitulation without being judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purer and higher state of existence . That a head should fall , and even receive " an ignominious kick , " is but a common accident in a party struggle , and would be of no more consequence to the world in Mr. Hawthorne 's case than any other , ( the metaphorical head not including brains , ) provided the spirit had suffered no material injury in the encounter . Of that , however , we have no means of judging , except by comparing this book of recent production with his former writings . Of the " stern and sombre " pictures of the world and human life , external and internal , found in the Scarlet Letter , we shall speak anon . The preface claims some farther notice . One would conclude , that the mother on whose bosom the writer was cherished in his urchinhood had behaved herself like a very step-mother towards him , showing a vulgar preference of those sons who have gathered , and thrown into her lap , gifts more substantial than garlands and laurel wreaths . This appears from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his disrespectful remarks upon her homely and commonplace features , her chilly and unsocial. disposition , and those marks of decay and premature age which needed not to be pointed out . The portrait is like , no doubt ; but we can not help imagining the ire of the ancient dame at the unfilial satire . Indeed , a faint echo of the voice of her indignation has arrived at our ears . She complains , that , in anatomizing the characters of his former associates for the entertainment of the public , he has used the scalpel on some subjects , who , though they could not defend themselves , might possibly wince ; and that all who came under his hand , living or dead , had probably relatives among his readers , whose affections might be wounded . Setting . this consideration apart , we confess that , to our // individual taste , this naughty chapter is more piquant than any thing in the book ; the style is racy and pungent , not elaborately witty , but stimulating the reader 's attention agreeably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , falling naturally into their places , as if of their own accord , and not obtained by far seeking and impressment into the service . The sketch of General Miller is airily and lightly done ; no other artist could have given so much character to each fine drawn line as to render the impression almost as distinct to the reader 's fancy as a portrait drawn by rays of light is to the bodily vision . Another specimen of his word painting , the lonely parlor seen by the moonlight melting into the warmer glow of the fire , while it reminds us of Cowper 's much quoted and admired verse , has truly a great deal more of genuine poetry in it . The delineations of wharf scenery , and of the Custom House , with their appropriate figures and personages , are worthy of the pen of Dickens ; and really , so far as mere style is concerned , Mr. Hawthorne has no reason to thank us for the compliment ; he has the finer touch , if not more genial feeling , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which savor somewhat strongly of his late unpoetical associations , and the favorite metaphor of the guillotine , which , however apt , is not particularly agreeable to the imagination in such detail , we like the preface better than the tale . No one who has taken up the Scarlet Letter will willingly lay it down till he has finished it ; and he will do well not to pause , for he can not resume the story where he left it . He should give himself up to the magic power of the style , without stopping to open wide the eyes of his good sense and judgment , and shake off the spell ; or half the weird beauty will disappear like a " dissolving view . " To be sure , when he closes the book , he will feel very much like the giddy and bewildered patient who is just awaking from his first experiment of the effects of sulphuric ether . The soul has been floating or flying between earth and heaven , with dim ideas of pain and pleasure strangely mingled , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the half shut eye . That the author himself felt this sort of intoxication as well as the willing subjects of his enchantment , we think , is evident in many pages of the last half of the vol // ume . His imagination has sometimes taken him fairly off his feet , insomuch that he seems almost to doubt if there be any firm ground at all , - if we may so judge from such mistborn ideas as the following . " But , to all these shadowy beings , so long our near acquaintances , - as well Roger Chillingworth as his companions , - we would fain be merciful . It is a curious subject of observation and inquiry , whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom . Each , in its utmost development , supposes a high degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge ; each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another ; each leaves the passionate lover , or the no less passionate hater , forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions seem essentially the same , except the one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance , and the other in a dusky and lurid glow . In the spiritual world , the old physician and the minister - mutual victims as they have been - may , unawares , have found their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love . " Thus devils and angels are alike beautiful , when seen through the magic glass ; and they stand side by side in heaven , however the former may be supposed to have come there . As for Roger Chillingworth , he seems to have so little in common with man , he is such a gnome-like phantasm , such an unnatural personification of an abstract idea , that we should be puzzled to assign him a place among angels , men , or devils . He is no more a man than Mr. Dombey , who sinks down a mere caput ? nortuurn , as soon as pride , the only animating principle , is withdrawn . These same " shadowy beings " are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henweed . " Hester at first strongly excites our pity , for she suffers like an immortal being ; and our interest in her continues only while we have hope for her soul , that its baptism of tears will reclaim it from the foul stain which has been cast upon it . We see her humble , meek , self-denying , charitable , and heartxvrung with anxiety for the moral welfare of her wayward child . But anon her humility catches a new tint , and we find it pride ; and so a vague unreality steals by degrees over all her most humanizing traits - we lose our confidence in all - and finally , like Undine , she disappoints us , and shows the dream-land origin and nature , when we were looking to behold a Christian . // There is rather more power , and better keeping , in the character of Dimmesdale . But here again we are cheated into a false regard and interest , partly perhaps by the associations thrown around him without the intention of the author , and possibly contrary to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by our faith in religion , where it has once been rooted in the heart . We are told repeatedly , that the Chris- ' tian element yet pervades his character and guides his efforts ; but it seems strangely wanting . " High aspirations for the welfare of his race , warm love of souls , pure sentiments , natural piety , strengthened by thought and study , and illuminated by revelation - all of which invaluable gold was little better than rubbish ' * to Roger. * Chillingworth , are little better than rubbish at all , for any use to be made of them in the story . Mere suffering , aimless and without effect for purification or blessing to the soul , we do not find in God 's moral world . The sting that follows crime is most severe in the purest conscience and the tenderest heart , in mercy , not in vengeance , surely ; and we can conceive of any cause constantly exertmg itself without its appropriate effects , as soon as of a seven years ' agony without penitence . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhuman passion , or a most unwearying conscience it must be , neither being worn out , or made worse or better , by such a prolonged application of the scourge . Penitence may indeed be life-long ; but as for this , we are to understand that there is no penitence about it . We ' finally get to be quite of the author 's mind , that " the only truth that continued to give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this earth , was the anguish in his inmost soul , and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect . t Had he once found power to smile , and wear an aspect of gayety , there had been no such man . " lie duly exhales at the first gleam of hope , an uncertain and delusive beam , but fatal to his misty existence . From that time he is a fantasy , an opium dream , his faith a vapor , his reverence blasphemy , his charity mockery , his sanctity impurity , his love of souls a ludicrous impulse to teach little boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance of " a volley of good , round , solid , satisfactory , heaven-defying oaths , " ( a phrase which seems to smack its lips with a strange gof*t ! ) but good taste and the mere outward shell , " the buckramed habit of clerical decorum* " // The only conclusion is , that the shell never possessed any thing real , - never was the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale , as we have foolishly endeavored to suppose ; that he was hut a changeling , or an imp in grave apparel , not an erring , and consequently suffering human being , with a heart still upright enough to find the burden of conscious unworthiness and undeserved praise more intolerable than open ignominy and shame , and refraining from relieving his withering conscience from its load of unwilling hypocrisy , if partly from fear , more from the wish to be yet an instrument of good to others , not an example of evil which should weaken their faith in religion . The closing scene , where the satanic phase of the character is again exchanged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a triumphant coup de thdiatre , seems to us more than a failure . But Little Pearl - gem of the purest water - what shall we say of her ? That if perfect truth to childish and human nature can make her a mortal , she is so ; and immortal , if the highest creations of genius have any claim to immortality . Let the author throw what light he will upon her , from his magical prism , she retains her perfect and vivid human individuality . When he would have us call her elvish and implike , we persist in seeing only a capricious , roguish , untamed child , such as many a mother has looked upon with awe , and a feeling of helpless incapacity to rule . Every motion , every feature , every word and tiny shout , every naughty scream and wild laugh , come to us as if our very senses were conscious of them . The child is a true child , the only genuine and consistent mortal in the book ; and wherever she crosses the dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pure truth and radiant beauty , and brings to grateful remembrance the like ministry of gladsome childhood , in some of the saddest scenes of actual life . We feel at once that the author must have a " Little Pearl ' * of his own , whose portrait , consciously or unconsciously , his pen sketches out . Not that we would deny to Mr. Hawthorne the power to call up any shape , angel or goblin , and present it before his readers in a striking and vivid light . But there is something more than imagination in the picture of " Little Pearl . " The heart takes a part in it , and puts in certain inimitable touches of nature here and there , such as fancy never dreamed of // and only a long and loving observation of the ways of childhood could suggest . The most characteristic traits are so interwoven with the story , ( on which we do not care to dwell , ) that it is not easy to extract a paragraph which will convey much of the charming image to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the description of Little Pearl playing upon the sea-shore . We take in the , figure of the old man as a dark back-ground , or contrast , to heighten the effect . " In fine , Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband , and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe . The occasion was not long to seek . One afternoon , walking with Pearl in a retired part of the peninsula , she beheld the old physician , with a basket on one arm , and a staff in the other hand , stooping along the ground , in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicines withal . " Hester bade little Pearl run down to the margin of the water , and play with the shells and tangled seaweed , until she should have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs . So the child flew away like a bird , and , making bare her small white feet , went pattering along the moist margin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full stop , and peeped curiously into a pool , left by the retiring tide as a mirror for Pearl to see her face in . Forth peeped at her , out of the pool , with dark , glistening curls around her head , and an elf.smile in her eyes , the image of a little maid , whom Pearl* having no other playmate , invited to take her hand and run a race with her . But the visionary little maid , on her part , beck . oned likewise , as if to say , - This is a better place ! Come thou into the pool ! ' And Pearl , stepping in , mid-leg deep , beheld her own white feet at the bottom ; while , out of a still lower depth , came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile , floating to and fro in the agitated water . " Meanwhile , her mother had accosted the physician . " I would speak a word with you , ' said she ,  --  ' a word that concerns us much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that runs through the book , - that revenge may exist without any overt act of vengeance that could be called such , and that a man who refrains from avenging himself may be more diabolical in his very forbearance than he who in his passionate rage inflicts what evil he may upon his enemy ; the former having that spirit of cold hate which could gloat for years , or forever , over the agonies of remorse and despair , over the anguish bodily // and mental , and consequent death or madness , of a fellow man , and never relent - never for a moment be moved to pity . This master passion of hatred , swallowing up all that is undevilish and human in Roger Chillingworth , makes him a pure ahstraction at last , a sort of mythical fury , a match for Alecto the Unceasing . " All this while , Hester had been looking steadily at the old man , and was shocked , as well as wonder-smitten , to discern what a change had been wrought upon him within the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown older ; for though the traces of advancing life were visible , he bore his age well , and seemed to retain a wiry vigor and alertness . But the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man , calm and quiet , which was what she best remembered in him , had altogether vanished , and been succeeded by an eager , searching , almost fierce , yet carefully guarded look . It seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile ; but the latter played him false , and flickered over his visage so derisively , that the spectator could see his blackness all the better for it . Ever and anon , too , there came a glare of red light out of his eyes ; as if the old man 's soul were on fire , and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast , until , by some casual pull ' of passion , it was blown into a momentary flame . This he repressed as speedily as possible , and strove to look as if nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Roger Chillingworth was a striking evidence of man 's faculty of transforming himself into a devil , if he will only , for a reasonable space of time , undertake a devil 's office . This unhappy person had effected such a transformation by devoting himself , for seven years , to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture , and deriving his enjoyment thence , and adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analyzed and gloated over . " The scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne 's bosom . Here was another ruin , the responsibility of which came partly home to her . " What see you in my face , ' asked the physician , ' that you look at it so earnestly ? ' " Something that would make me weep , if there were any tears hitter enough for it , ' answered she . But let it pass ! It is of yonder miserable man that I would speak ) So Roger Cbillingworth - a deformed old figure , with a face that haunted men 's memories longer than they liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away along the earth . He gathered here and there an herb , or grubbed up a root , and put it // into the basket ou his arm . His gray beard almost touched the ground , as he crept onward . Hester gazed after him a little while , looking with a half-fantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath him , and show the wavering track of his footsteps , sere and brown , across its cheerful verdure . She wondered what sort of herbs they were , which the old man was so sedulous to gather . Would not the earth , quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye , greet him with poisonous shrubs , of species hitherto unknown , that would start up under his fingers ? Or might it suffice him , that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch ? Did the sun , which shone so brightly everywhere else , really fall upon him ? Or was there , as it rather seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformity , whichever way he turned himself ? And whither was he now going ? Would he not suddenly sink into the earth , leaving a barren and blasted spot , where , in due course of time , would be seen deadly nightshade , dogwood , henbane , and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce , all flourishing with hideous luxuriance ? Or would he spread bat 's wings and flee away , looking so much the uglier , the higher he rose towards heaven ? Be it sin or no , ' said Hester Prynne bitterly , as she still gazed after him , 1 hate the man ! ' * " She upbraided herself for the sentiment , but could not overcome or lessen it . " It is time to seek the exhilarating presence of " Little Pearl , " whom we left on the sea-shore , making nature her playmate . He being gone , she summoned back her child . " Pearl ! Little Pearl ! Where ' are you ? ' " Pearl , whose activity of spirit never flagged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked with the old gatherer of herbs . At first , as already told , she had flirted fancifully with her own image in a pool of water , beckoning the phantom forth , and - as it declined to venture - seeking a passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky . Soon finding , however , that she or the image was unreal , she turned elsewhere for better pastime . She made little boats out of birch bark , and freighted them with snail-shells , and sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in New England ; but the larger part of them foundered near the shore . She seized a live horseshoe by the tail , and made prize of several five-fingers , and laid out a jelly fish to melt in the warm sun . Then she took up the white foam , that streaked the line of the advancing tide , and // threw it upon the breeze , scampering after it with winged footsteps , to catch the great snow-flakes ere they fell . Perceiving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles , and , creeping from rock to rock after these small sea-fowl , displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting them . One little gray bird , with a white breast , Pearl was almost sure , had been hit by a pebble , and fluttered away with a broken wing . But then the elf-child sighed , and gave up her sport ; because it grieved her to have done harm to a little being that was as wild as the sea-breeze , or as wild as Pearl herself . " Her final employment was to gather sea-weed , of various kinds , and make herself a scarf , or mantle , and a head-dress , and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid* She inherited her mother 's gift for devising drapery and costume. ** We know of no writer who better understands and combines the elements of the picturesque in writing than Mr. Hawthorne . His style may be compared to a sheet of transparent water , reflecting from its surface blue skies , nodding woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grassy margin ; while in its clear yet mysterious depths we espy rarer and stranger things , which we must dive for , if we would examine . Whether they might prove gems or pebbles , when taken out of the fluctuating medium through which the sun-gleams reach them , is of no consequence to the effect . Every thing charms the eye and ear , and nothing looks like art and pains-taking . There is a naturalness and a continuous flow of expression in Mr. Hawthorne 's books , that makes them delightful to read , especially in this our day , when the fear of triteness drives some writers , ( even those who might otherwise avoid that reproach , ) to adopt an abrupt and dislocated style , administering to our jaded attention frequent thumps and twitches , by means of outlandish idioms and forced inversions , and now and then flinging at our heads an incomprehensible , break-jaw word , which uncivilized missile stuns us to a full stop , and an appeal to authority . No authority can be found , however , which affords any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rocks and ridges , and gridiron bridges , " in one of these prosaic latter-day omnibuses , how pleasant it is to move over flowery turf upon a spirited , but properly trained Pegasus , who occasionally uses his wings , and skims along a little above terra firma , but not with an alarming pre // feren ce for cloudland or rarefied air . One can not but wonder , by the way , that the master of such a wizard power over language as Mr. Hawthorne manifests should not choose a less revolting subject than this of the Scarlet Letter , to which fine writing seems as inappropriate as fine embroidery . The ugliness of pollution and vice is no more relieved by it than the gloom of the prison is by the rose tree at its door . There are some palliative expressions used , which can not , even as a matter of taste , be approved . Regarding the book simply as a picture of the olden time , we have no fault to find with costume or circumstance . All the particulars given us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to show his research , ) are in good keeping and perspective , all in softened outlines and neutral tint , except the ever fresh and unworn image of childhood , which stands out from the canvas in the gorgeously attired " Little Pearl . " He forbears to mention the ghastly gallows-tree , which stood hard by the pillory and whipping-post , at the city gates , and which one would think might have been banished with them from the precincts of Boston , and from the predirections of the community of whose opinions it is the focus . When a people have opened their eyes to the fact , that it is not the best way of discountenancing vice to harden it to exposure and shame , and make it brazen-faced , reckless , and impudent , they might also be convinced , it would seem , that respect for human life would not be promoted by publicly violating it , and making a spectacle , or a newspaper theme , of the mental agony and dying struggles of a human being , and of him least fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his account . " Blood for blood 1 " We are shocked at the revengeful custom among uncivilized tribes , when it bears the aspect of private revenge , because the executioners must be of the kindred of the slain . How much does the legal retribution in kind , which civilized man exacts , differ in reality from the custom of the savage ? The law undertakes to avenge its own dignity , to use a popular phrase ; that is , it regards the community as one great family , and constitutes itself the avenger of blood in its behalf . It is not punishment , but retaliation , which does not contemplate the reform of the offender as well as the prevention of crime ; and where it wholly loses the remedial element , and cuts off the oppor // tunity for repentance which God 's mercy allows , it is worthy of a barbarous , not a Christian , social alliance . What sort of combination for mutual safety is it , too , when no man feels safe , because fortuitous circumstances , ingeniously bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not bestir herself to rescue us from the doom which the judgment of twelve fallible men pronounces , and our protector , the law , executes upon us ? But we are losing sight of Mr. Hawthorne 's book , and of the old Puritan settlers , as he portrays them with few , but clearly cut and expressive , lines . In these sketchy groupings , Governor Bellingham is the only prominent figure , with the Rev. John Wilson behind him , " his beard , white as a snowdrift , seen over the Governor 's shoulder . " " Here , to witness the scene which we are describing , sat Governor Bdllingham himself , with four sergeants about his chair , bearing halberds as a guard of honor . He wore a dark feather in his hat , a border of embroidery on his cloak , and a black vel. vet tunic beneath ; a gentleman advanced in years , and with a hard experience written in his wrinkles . He was not ill.fitted to be the head and representative of a community , which owed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to the impulses of youth , but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood , and the sombre sagacity of age ; accomplishing so much , precisely because it imagined and hoped so little . " With this portrait , we close our remarks on the book , which we should not have criticized at so great length , had we admired it less . We hope to be forgiven , if in any instance our strictures have approached the limits of what may be considered personal . We would not willingly trench upon the right which an individual may claim , in common courtesy , not to have his private qualities or personal features discussed to his face , with everybody looking on . But Mr. Haw .. thorne 's example in the preface , and the condescending familiarity of the attitude he assumes therein , are at once our occasion and our apology .
