THE WAR IN KANSAS . The War in Kansas* A Rough Trip to the Borders , among New Homes and a Strange People . By G. DOUGLAS BREWERTON . New-York : Derby* &amp; Jackson . WE hope the title of this book will not induce the reading public to shun it . it is true , that the word " Kansas " is tedious to the ear of almost every man , woman and child in the Republic , as a thrice-told tale ; but since it has been used by the most cunning of modern magicians , the Abolitionists and Free Soilers , to raise the devil with , it is only by a " backward muttering of the dissevering spell " that the black phantom can be laid at rest again . The subject has lingered amongst us until its freshness is exhausted , and yet it is only as it becomes stale and wearisome that we begin to arrive , little by little , at the truth . Captain Brewerton 's book is amongst the first inklings of it . It would be well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pulpit drum ecclesiastic , Beat with fist instead of a stick ; " the universal " bletherum-skate " of the Free Soil press ; the studied falsehoods and careful misrepresentation of the whole Anti-slavery army of knights errant , to whose distorted vision every ebo-shin is an African prince in disguise , and every wind-mill a Pro-slavery enchanter by whom he is enslaved ; the painful efforts and elaborate attempts of Black Republican Senators to split the hair of treason so nicely " twixt north and north-west side , " as to produce its effects without incurring its penalty ; all these things lend a peculiar value to any book displaying the slightest appearance of fairness in its history of the troubles upon which so much venomous falsehood has been voided by political charlatans . The one before us has every appearance of fairness . It undertakes the championship of neither side . A man , who appears to be blessed with quite an * The War in Kansas .

He goes also under very good conditions , namely , as a special reporter for the New- York Herald . And however erratic and reprehensible the course of that paper with regard to some other things , in all that relates to the rights of the South , and the character of the crusade against them sought to be set on foot by northern agitators , it has been uniformly just , wise , and consistent ; and its services in the cause of honesty and good government have been of a character to deserve the warmest praise . We give it , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . That is not the practice of this Review . We are enlisted as soldiers in a war which is all the more deadly because its weapons are those which the brains of busy and profligate schemers frame : a war in which every man who is not for us is against us-in which there can be no medium . On the one side in that war are ranged all the " Isms " - banded together , like those who fell with Lucifer , by a common hatred-some lesser fiends , some greater , but united by a community of evil . The Constitution of the United States and the rights of the several States are the objects of their hatred . On the other side , and around the sacred ark of the common safety , sweep the long lines of the Democracy  --  the Old Guard  --  the true conservative power of the Republic . In many important par . ticulars the New . York Herald has done that conservative power yeoman service , and whatever we may think of its course in other things , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our traveller gets away from New.York , and into Kansas , with the usual number of disappointments and hard knocks . In passing through Canada , he is benevolently informed by a " fugitive , " who has there come out into the full bloom of African conceit , " that a white man may be as good as * nigger , if he chooses to exert himself . " Consoled by this naturally elevating sentiment , he gets back into the States as fast as pos. sible , and from them to the territories , He reaches Lawrence , and is mistaken by a violent Abolitionist for one of the same kidney . The missionary of freedom , and Brother Beecher 's new gospel of murder , proceeds to indoctrinate his supposed sympathizer , as follows , namely : " That the so-called settlement of the difficulties at Lawrence , between the Free State and Pro-slavery leaders , was , on the part of the Free State people , nothing more than a cute Yankee trick , ' amounting simply to this // - that the citizens of Lawrence , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might be overpowered by a superior force , avoided a fight , by intimating to Governor Shannon that they were willing to submit themselves to the laws , and permit the Sheriff of Douglas County to arrest the persons against whom he held writs , and whom they had hitherto been harboring  --  a settlement was accordingly made , but not until the fugitives in question had been warned by the Free State party , and allowed time to make good their escape , which they were not slow to do . " But , ' queried we , are the Lawrence people going to back down , and give it up so-wo n't they try it again ? ' " They 're bound to , ' was the reply , and so our conference ended . " Sharp 's rifles being the religious tracts of the new Free Soil system , and murder one of its cardinal virtues , we suppose this , which in other times we should have called simply " the lie direct and with circumstance , " is now a grace of Christian eb character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Senator Seward and his friends can reconcile the little vagaries of the gentleman described with their theory of illegal voting , by which the " Border iRuffians " are made to play always the " pipelaying " part , whilst honest Free-soilers look on with holy tears , we leave them to settle with their own consciences : " Apropos to would-be preachers  --  but not always to such like-Governor Shannon afterwards related to us a good story , which , though it be a digression , may as well find its way into these pages before we enter upon the grand theatre of events . ' " There is now living at what is called the Quaker Indian Mission , which is located on the Indian Reserve and within three miles of the Shawnee manual labor school , where the Governor has established his temporary residence , an old Quaker who is , for aught we know to the contrary , every thing which a disciple of William Penn-even of the straightest sect ' - ought to be . But we all have our little failings-as somebody once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in our Broad Brim 's case , politics were an amiable weakness . ' He went in for Reeder , to speak figuratively , body and boots ; and not only to the extent of his own body and boots , but even to those of his neighbors , as what we are about to state , on Shannon 's authority , will abundantly prove . The election for delegate to Congress-we think it was-came on ; and the backers of Reeder were not backward in casting in their paper mites at the ballot-box ; among others friend Broad Brim , as we shall call him , came also , even as did Satan of old . He voted once ; he voted twice ; he voted thrice ; yea , a fourth time ; and , verily , a fifth ; and every time for Reeder , and nary lick ' for any body else . Now , how did he , a pious and a God-fearing man , manage it ? or , how could he do this thing ' and still compound with his conscience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear his skirts before his brother Broad Brims of the meeting ? ' Reader , he did it thus : he voted once for himself , and on four other occasions , at the same ballot-box and for the same candidate , as a proxy for his particular friends , Messrs . A. , B. , C. , and // D. , all of whom , as he affirmed , would have voted for Reeder , but unfortunately wcs'nt there to do so . " As a pendant to this , and by way of delicately hinting in whose court we should be most disposed to bring our action against the peaceable and rifte.ab*ding emigrants from NewEngland to Kansas , we quote the following morsel of history : " Lynch law owes its title to a certain Squire Lynch , a stern and uncompromising old patriot , who lived during the times that tried men 's souls , ' on his plantation , distant some three miles from the present site of Lynchburg , Va . It was the custom in those stirring days of the Revolution , for his neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlucky culprit before Squire Lynch , who at once organized a court of his own selection , in which he himself was judge , jury , and counsel for the prisoner . If the crime were proved , he would proceed to pass sentence , by awarding from fifty to one hundred stripes , to be well laid on ; or , it may be , even a graver penalty , in proportion to the magnitude of the offence . And it is noteworthy , that as this was a court from whence there was no appeal , few thought of preaching higher law , ' or taking exception to his Honor 's findings . " Our informant adds , that the old man 's memory is still greatly revered in that section of the Old Dominion , ' while his descendants are justly reckoned among those highly respectable people , the first families of Virginia . ' A grandson of the Judge , Charles H. Lynch , Esq. , still resides upon the paternal estate ; and a venerable oak-one of the real old settlers-is even now pointed out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his rough and ready court ; those who have seen it , say that the notches are still visible upon its moss-grown trunk , which , in old lang syne , ' kept the cords from slipping , while the tory got his dose . The town of Lynchburg takes its name from the Judge , and it is rumored that the grandson would sooner lose an arm than part with the old homestead and its tory-haunted tree . " Perhaps the most important part of the book consists in the following statement " in relation to the rise and progress of the unhappy difficulties in the territories . " It was made to him* , Mr. Brewerton says , by Governor Shannon himself : " On or about the 24th of November , 1855 , a difficulty occurred between a Pro-slavery man of the name of Coleman , and a Free State man named Dow , in relation to " a claim ; " this resulted in a rencounter , in which Coleman killed Dow . This gave rise to considerable excitement among the Free State people in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this place , there are about one hundred Free State , and fifteen or sixteen Pro-slavery , families . The excitement ran high , and the Free State men threatened to take Coleman , try , and hang him , without any legal judicial investigation , by a court and jury of their own . " There were also among the settlers at Hickory Point two men , named Buckley and Hargis . They were Pro-slavery men , friends of Coleman , and witnesses to the difficulty between himself and Dow . Some two days after the killing of Dow , a party of seventy-five men  --  a majority of whom resided // 402 May , in and about Lawrence-went to Hickory Point , to the residence of Hargis , and demanded of these friends of Coleman what their testimony in the matter would be . They repeated the circumstances as they intended to relate them . To this these Free State men , who were all armed with Sharpe 's rifles , replied ( at the same time cocking their guns and pointing them at the breasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false ; the circumstances are not so . We give you until Monday to make a correct statement of the facts . If you refuse we will kill you . " This was on Saturday . Before the time given had expired , the Free State men burned down the houses of Buckley , Hargis and Coleman . In so doing they turned the family of Buckley out of doors . This family saved nothing of their wardrobe or furniture but the clothes in which they fled . " Terrified by these lawless proceedings , the sixteen Pro-slavery families residing at Hickory Point fled with their women and children into Missouri , where their accounts of the treatment to which their friends had been subjected excited the most intense indignation among the slaveholders of that State . From these stories , exaggerated as they spread , and it may be too highly colored by their original narrators , the impression became current throughout Missouri that the Free State party of Kansas , armed with Sharpe 's rifles and revolvers , intended to expel the Pro-slavery men from that Territory . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Free State party ; but as they do not appear to have come from responsible persons , it would be unfair to infer that this is the avowed purpose of their party . In the mean time , Buckley , Hargis and Coleman-who had fled so soon as they could escape from the band who were threatening their execution-made their way to the Executive office at Shawnee Mission , K. T. , to have an interview with myself . I was absent at the time . When I returned , Coleman had surrendered himself to the Sheriff of Douglas County ( Jones ) , who happened to be at the mission . Buckley and Hargis stated their grievances to me , and informed me that a man named Branson , of the Free State party , and one of the residents at Hickory Point , with whom Dow ( the person killed ) had resided , was the leader of the band who had threatened and endeavored to extort false evidence from them . Upon these representations , I advised Buckley to go before a magistrate or any judicial officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded the threats of Branson , obtain a peace-warrant against him , and thus have him bound over to keep the peace . As Sheriff Jones was about starting with Coleman in custody , and Buckley and Hargis in company , on their way to obtain a peace-warrant against Branson , an express arrived from Hickory Point , which had ridden all night , advising Coleman and his two friends not to return to that settlement , as they would certainly be killed by the Free State party . Sheriff Jones , with much difficulty , and by guaranteeing their safety , at length succeeded in persuading them to accompany him to Lecompton , the county seat of Douglas County , in which all these difficulties had occurred , and from whence it was of course necessary that the peacewarrant should be issued . On his arrival there , Buckley , in pursuance with my advice , went before a justice of the peace-Mr . Cameron-made affidavit against Branson , and obtained a peace-warrant , which the justice placed in the hands of Sheriff Jones for execution , who immediately summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to serve the writ .

The rescuing party then re // turned to Lawrence , where they held a meeting , at eight o'clock , A. M. , on the same day . Branson , the prisoner , presided , dressed , as it is said , in a military uniform , while S. N. Wood , the leader and spokesman of the rescuing party , made speeches of an incendiary character , glorying in the triumph of the Free State men over the laws of the Territory . " From this day forth the Free State party in Lawrence openly commenced their military organization , by drilling , sending out their runnersas is proven by the fact that they collected men from points even as far distant as eighty miles  --  and otherwise putting their town in a position to resist , by force of arms , the legally.constituted authorities of Kansas Territory . " Upon the same night , about eight o'clock , I received a dispatch , by express , from the Sheriff of Douglas County ( Jones ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rescued by an armed mob . This dispatch was brought by Mr. Hargis , who stated verbally , at the same time , that the Free State party had that day threatened to take Coleman ( then in the custody of Sheriff Jones ) from the sheriff , hang him , and also kill Jones . The sheriff 's letter asked for three thousand troops , to protect him in the execution of the law . It was evidently written under a state of considerable excitement and apprehension . " As these facts had reached me in an official manner , from a source of undoubted reliability , and were , moreover , corroborated by much verbal testimony as well as written evidence ; and as these latter acts of outrage ( upon the part of the Free State party of Lawrence ) seemed but the carrying out of their previously-declared intentions , as expressed in the incendiary resolutions passed at their public meetings , which have from time to time been held in different parts of this Territory , and of which the following may be quoted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolved* That we owe no allegiance or obedience to the tyrannical enactments of this spurious Legislature ; that their laws have no validity or binding force upon the people of Kansas , and that every freeman amongst us is at full liberty , consistently with all his obligations as a citizen and a man , to defy and resist them , if he chooses so to do . * * * * * * * " Resoired , That we will endure and submit to these laws no longer than the best interests of the Territory require , as the least of two evils , and will resist them to a bloody issue so soon as we ascertain that peaceable remedies shall fail and forcible resistance shall furnish any reasonable prospect of success ; and that , in the mean time , we recommend to our friends throughout the Territory , the organization and disciplining of volunteer companies , and the procurement and preparation of arms . * * a * * * * " I therefore deemed it incumbent upon me , as the chief executive of Kansas Territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner Coleman , from the violence and rescue which had been threatened and in part carried out by this mob , for I firmly believed ( being in possession of the facts ) , that the overt acts just committed by the Free State party were but the commencement of a settled plan and determination to resist and bid defiance to the Territorial laws , in accordance with the resolutions already quoted . " Under all these circumstances , I felt that I must either furnish Sheriff Jones with a sufficient posse to carry out his instructions , or be forced into // the disgraceful alternative of surrendering the Territorial government into the hands of an armed and lawless mob . " And it may here be stated that the militia of Kansas were at this time ( and are still ) totally unorganized . The Legislature had , it is true , elected two major generals in the Southern and one in the Northern division , as well as some brigadiers ; but so far as the rank and file are concerned , the organization was not even commenced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient force to serve his writs , as well as to protect himself and his prisoner Coleman against the threatened violence of the Free State* mob in Lawrence , I issued orders to Major General William P. Richardsmn ( then residing in Doniphan County ) , K. T. , to collect as large a force as he could in his division , and repair with his men , with all practical speed , to Lecompton , where he was desired to place his command under the orders of Sheriff Jones . " This order resulted in the collection of from one to two hundred men . Within six days from the date of my order , these men were at Lecompton , where General Richardson placed himself and his command under the orders of the sheriff . To the best of my belief these men were all citizens of Kansas . The Southern division of the militia being wholly unorganized , I simply requested Brigadier General Strickler , then residing at fecumseh , distant only twelve miles from Lecompton , to gather as many men as possible , and report himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These instructions bore the same date as General Richardson 's order and resulted in the collection of from fifty to one hundred men . " I presumed as a matter of course , and intended , that all these men should be drawn entirely from the citizens subject to militia duty in Kansas Territory . At that time-as the seat of difficulties ( Lawrence ) is distant some forty miles from the State line of Missouri-it never for a moment occurred to me that the citizens of that State would cross into Kansas or volunteer their aid to carry out her laws . I at first presumed that the forces collected under the orders issued to Generals Richardson and Strickler would have been sufficient to have protected the sheriff in the performance of the duties intrusted to him . But upon the concentration of the forces under these officers at Lecompton , which gave us a total of but two hundred and fifty men , the Free Stste faction collected their people in the town of Lawrence , until their reported strength reached an aggregate of six hundred men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles and revolvers . " This would have given the Free State faction a superiority over the militia of three hundred and fifty men , without reckoning that which they would derive from the immense superiority of ' the repeating arms with which they were amply furnished ; while General Richardson 's command were principally supplied with fowling-pieces , some having pistols and bowieknives . " I can thus account for the intense excitement which was generated among the Pro-slavery men of the Missouri frontier by these events , and which finally resulted in their flocking to the aid of the upholders of Territorial Jaw in Kansas . " Missouri has fifty thousand slaves in that portion of her territory which bord*ri upon the frontiers of Kansas . By estimating the average value of each of those slaves at $600 ( a low rate ) , we have a total of $80,000,000 ' Now , should Kansas become a Free State it would be ruinous to the slaveholding // interests of Missouri . Her negroes have in several instances already been tampered with and run oft ' by Abolitionists ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call forth , must sooner or later result in a deadly feud between the Free State and Pro-slavery factions , which , if Kansas becomes a non-slaveholding State , would finally be handed down from father to son , and thus engender feelings of bitter and uncompromising hate on both sides . " These facts are well known to every planter in Missouri . Nor is this all . The mere pecuniary consideration was the least exciting motive to move in this matter-their feelings had been worked upon ; they had listened to the stories of men , women , and children , who had fled from homes in Kansas , made desolate by the threatened and actual violence of the Free State party . What , then , was my policy ? Certainly this : to mitigate an evil which it was impossible to suppress , by bringing under military control these irregular and excited forces . This was only to be accomplished by permitting the continuance of the course which had already been adopted , without my knowledge , by Generals Richardson and Strickler-that is , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized command . A portion of these men , who were mostly from Jackson County , Mo. , reported themselves to Sheriff Jones-by giving in a list of their names - as willing to serve in his posse , and he , after taking legal advice upon the question , decided to receive them . They were accordingly so enrolled . It was decided that he had a right to employ them , from the fact that as they were present in the county , the sheriff had a right to call upon them to aid in the preservation of law and order within said county , even though they might be citizens of another State , in which case , if they chose to act , their services would be legal . " The Pro-slavery forces thus collected , including the militia , amounted on the 1st or 2d of December , 1855 ( as it was then stated to me at the Shawnee Mission ) , to about 1fi00 men and it was also reported that about an equal number of Free State men had concentrated at Lawrence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place , and that the only way to avoid that collision was to request the aid of the general government . I was , moreover , in the receipt of a communication from Brigadier-General Eastin , of the Northern Brigade , K. M. , putting me in possession of information from Lawrence , and recommending the employment of the United States forces at Fort Leavenworth . " To obtain the cooperation of the general government , I telegraphed on the 1st of December from Kansas City , Missouri , to President Pierce , that I requested authority to call upon Colonel Sumner , commanding at Fort Leavenworth , for such military aid as should enable me to protect the sheriff of Douglas County in executing the laws , and preserving peace and good order in the Territory . " I also dispatched a messenger to Colonel Sumner , 1st Cavalry , U. S. A. , at Fort Leavenworth , notifying him of what I had done , and requesting him to hold himself and command in readiness , in case the orders should be received ; to which he promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men at a moment 's warning , as soon as the requisite instructions should come . " On the 4th of December , the telegraph lines being down between Lexington and Jefferson City , Missouri ( my dispatch being therefore sent by special messenger during the interval ) , I received a reply , dated December 3d , from the President , stating that the Executive would use all the power // at his command to preserve order in the Territory , and to enforce the execution of the laws , and as soon as the proper orders could be made out at the War Department , they would be transmitted . I immediately forwarded a copy of the President 's telegraphic dispatch to Colonel Sumner , requesting him to march ( on the strength of that dispatch ) with his men to the Delaware crossing of the Kansas-twelve miles above its mouth , at which post I would meet and accompany his command to the scene of difficulty . " Colonel Sumner replied that he would do so , as it was a case of extreme emergency . ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were rapidly coming to a crisis . ) " About this time a committee waited upon me from Lawrence , of Free State men-claiming to represent the citizens of that town ( Messrs . Lowry and Babcock ) . They stated that the people of Lawrence were surrounded by a body of armed men , who were threatening to demolish their town , and requested me to exercise my authority to preserve peace and save their city . They produced a letter signed by the leading men of Lawrence . " Finding that affairs in Lawrence and its vicinity were fast coming to a crisis , I determined to repair there immediately , in person . " At half-past three o'clock , P. M , on the 5th of December , I left Shawnee Mission , went to Westport , Mo . ( distant some two and a half miles from the Mission ) , and requested Colonel Boone  --  a grandson of Colonel Boone of frontier memory , and the Postmaster at Westport  --  to accompany me to Lawrence , and , as his acquaintance with the leading Pro-slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive , give me the benefit of his influence in keeping down an excitement and preventing any rash act upon the part of the troops then threatening that town . This he instantly agreed to do , and I owe much to his valuable assistance in restraining the volunteers . " We then proceeded as rapidly as possible to the Wakarusa camp ( within six miles of Lawrence ) , which was occupied by that portion of the Pro-slavery forces under the command of General Strickler , and reached it about three o'clock , A. M. , on the 6th . " Early on the morning of the 6th , I sent a request to Major-General Richardson to meet me at the Wakarusa camp , and bring with him the leading men of the Lecompton camp . One of the obje'cts in dividing the Pro-slavery forces into the two camps of Lecompton and Wakarusa , distant from each other by eighteen miles , was to prevent those men in Lawrence against whom the sheriff had writs , from escaping ; another was to take advantage of the very favorable camping ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining fuel , water , and sheltering timber , rendered it a desirable location for the troops . " About 3 P. M. , General Richardson , with a number of the most prominent men from the Lecompton camp , arrived at my quarters ( which I had established at an Indian house on the east side of the Wakarusa , and about a quarter of a mile from the Wakarusa camp ) . I had been engaged during the day up to the very moment of General Richardson 's arrival , in conference with the leading men of the Wakarusa camp , with the view of ascertaining their feelings and intentions , and if possible prevailing upon them to cooperate with me in carrying out my views . For myself , I had two leading objects , which I had determined to use every exertion to accomplish : one , to prevent the effusion of blood ; the other , to vindicate the supremacy of the laws . I found in the Wakarusa camp a strong disposition , which appeared to be almost universal , to attack Lawrence . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view , I invited between thirty and forty of their leading men from the two camps to meet me on the night of the 6th , at my quarters , with the intention of explaining to them my desires and purposes , and inviting a similar confidence on their part , in return . " They convened at my quarters , accordingly , at eight o'clock , P. M. , when I addressed them at length , defining the position which I intended to occupy and the ends which I hoped to gain , and finally begged them to explain freely , their wishes and expectations as to the settlement of the existing difficulties . I soon discovered that there was but one person present who fully approved of the course which I desired to pursue . The others wished to go further ; some would hear of nothing less than the destruction of Lawrence and its fortifications , the demolition of its printing-presses , and the unconditional surrender of the arms of the citizens ; others , more moderate , expressed a willingness to be satisfied , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and revolvers . Under these unfavorable circumstances the conference broke up at midnight , having accomplished nothing beyond the interchange of opinions on either side . Before its adjournment , however , I informed them that I would enter Lawrence upon the ensuing day ( the 7th ) , and ascertain what arrangements the Free State party were willing to make , and what terms they would accede to . On the part of the Pro-slavery men there seemed to be so fixed a purpose to assault the town that I almost despaired of preventing it , unless I could obtain the services of the United States troops at Fort Leavenworth . With the intention of communicating my wishes to Colonel Sumner , the commandant of that post , I made arrangements with General Strickler , commanding in the Wakarusa camp , to furnish me with an express rider at daybreak , to start immediately for Fort Leavenworth . I at once wrote a pressing letter to Colonel Sumner . " On the morning of the 7th I repaired to the town of Lawrence , having on the evening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that town , to visit their place , for the purpose of arranging , if possible , the difficulties which then threatened them . On my road to Franklin , which lies midway upon the route , I was met by a committee of ten citizens of Lawrence , who escorted me into their town , where I was courteously received . I was conducted to an upper chamber in the Emigrant Aid Society 's Hotel , and had a long interview with Generals Charles Robinson and James H. Lane , the commanders of the Free State forces , who were appointed on the part of the Lawrence people to confer with me in relation to the then existing difficulties . " I explained to them the difficulty of prevailing upon the highly-incensed forces then surrounding Lawrence to retire without attacking the place or demanding the surrender of the Sharpe 's rifles and revolvers , with which they were well known to be armed . I added , moreover , that the idea was universally prevalent , both in the Lecompton and Wakarusa camps , that these weapons had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of the Territorial laws of Kansas , and making her a free State . The committee declared that these weapons had neither been procured nor distributed for any such end , but simply to defend the ballot-box from invasion . Yet it can not be denied that they admitted to me that these arms were forwarded in boxes from the East , having been written for by General Robinson for the purpose aforesaid . It was also claimed by General Robinson that these arms were now the property of individuals , as // they had been distributed to , and a certain amount of moneys paid for them by the persons in whose hands they then were ; that is to say , each man who received a Sharpe 's rifle paid something as an equivalent ; but , from what has transpired , it is my belief that the amount so paid bore no proportion to the real cost or value of the arms ; in fact , it is currently reported that the sum paid for these Sharpe 's rifles by their receivers did not average over three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in this Territory 1200 Sharpe 's rifles , which have been brought into it for the purpose of arming the Free State faction . The cost of these arms , calculating them at $30 each , would give a total of $36,000 . Now , supposing that this rumor be true , that each of these deadly weapons bring but $3 in Kansas , or a total for the 1200 of but $3600-who , let me ask , loses the difference of $32,400 ? And it will be perceived that this calculation makes no allowance for the expenses of transportation from the East . " At 1 A. Mi. , December 7th , I learned from a reliable source that a plan was on foot to raise the " black flag , " with the view of throwing off the authority of the Territorial executive and its officers and attacking Lawrence upon their own responsibility . I renewed my endeavors for peace , and with the leading men did all in my power to dissuade these hot-headed people from so unauthorized a movement . " On the morning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was advised by a prominent man that unless the citizens of Lawrence gave up their arms , the place would be attacked , and I had better consult my own safety and keep out of danger . My reply was , that I should consider any such attack , after the declarations which had been made by the people of Lawrence , as wholly unjustifiable , and that I should use every means in my power to prevent it . This I at once made preparations to do . " When I entered that town I found that the people had held a meeting the night before , and had reduced to writing the terms on which they proposed to treat . " After a conference of three hours , during which opinions were freely interchanged on both sides , the committees concluded to withdraw and report to the men of both parties that they were satisfied , and would settle matters as I wished . We then returned to the Wakarusa camp , which we reached at 10 P. M. , where I still continued to press upon the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceding to the terms offered . It was not , however , until daybreak on the 9th , that I felt safe in issuing my orders , as Chief Executive of Kansas Territory , to Sheriff Jones and Generals Richardson and Strickler , to disband their forces . I did so ; my instructions were complied with , and the forces assembled in camps Lecompton and Wakarusa retired without committing any depredation or act of violence , so far as I have heard . " ' And thus these terrible and blood.thirsty Pro.slavery men , these " Border Ruffians , " the very moment the Free State men indicated the slightest determination to abide by the law and conduct themselves in a manner becoming good citizens , yielded a ready and cheerful obedience to the constituted authority of the territorial government . But the real crime of the Proslavery men in the territory is this-that they have outvoted // the Free-soilers . There are too many of them in Kansas for their opponents ' fancy , hence the howl of border-ruffianism is raised , just as in old times the Whigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascally " Democrats , as they called them ; and wonder where they came from , since nobody knew where they were before the election . That kind of bluster , with all its charges of corruption , pipe-laying , colonizing , etc. , being played out in the older States , and the fact finally ascertained that the majority of the inhabitants of the United States are and always have been Democrats , a new scene of action is looked for where the old Federal game may be played over by factions , copying all its weakness , but forgetting all that was really true and honest in the principles of the Whig party . It is found in Kansas , and for the word " Democrat " we merely have " Border Ruffian " substituted . As a proof ; look at this . In the " Lawrence " district about one thousand votes were polled , of which two hundred and twenty-five were Free &amp;d* and over seven hundred Pro-slavery . What did the Free-soilers do ? Did they protest ? did they deny the legality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates to the persons so elected . So , when the Legislature came to assemble at Pawnee , the Pro-slavery men were largely in the majority . Here was an admirable chance for the Free-soilers to prove how much they love order , law , and regulated freedom . It could hardly be supposed that they would miss so fine a chance to immortalize their law-abiding tendencies . But really and truly they let it slip . They were drowsy over it . Jupiter nodded . They gave themselves the lie direct , and confessed judgment to Pro-slavery . For , after their own Governor had certified , and their own months confessed , the legality of the election and the acts of the territorial Legislature , they jumped into the balloon of Mr. Seward 's " higher law , " and floated away , and have been floating ever since in the airy regions of Anti-slavery hyperbole They and their Governor ( Reeder ) first certify that the members of a Legislature are duly and legally elected , and then whip around , and because they have not a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one , and push things in the territory to the verge of revolution . What a valuable precedent ! What if every State should imitate it ? What if ; when a political party in any State found itself in a minority , it should pursue the same course-cry out that the majority was " bogus , " and rush into revolution . Would not the whole Union soon be in a blaze of war ? The doctrine of Free-soilism , however , is evidently this : When the majority is on our side , the prin // ciple that " the majority governs " is sacred ; when we are in the minority , the principle of a " higher law " takes its place ; but majority or minority- .. right or wrong-per fas aut nefasAbolitionism for ever ! There we think we have Seward , Greeley , African-Republicanism , Abolitionism , very succinctly and fairly stated . And in it will be found the key of the whole Kansas difficulty . Mr. Brewerton 's book contains the statements made upon both sides . He constitutes himself neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , and leaves the reader to draw his own conclusions . It is written in a lively , sketchy , off-hand way , and , aside even from the interest of the subject , would amply repay perusal . A good deal of keen observation of frontier habits and manner is evident in it , and some of the pictures are drawn with a boldness of outline indicative of genius . We own great obligations to him , and think every man in the Union should read his book carefully .
