Boston : Ticknor &amp; Co. 1850. 2 vols. l2mo , pp. 617 . PERHAPS Mr. Emerson , or if not he , perhaps some one of his devoted admirers , may be still so far short of absorption into the Budhist heaven of indifferentism to all human concerns and opinions , as to have some little curiosity to know what impression is made by his oracular " utterances , " upon a mind not gifted with sufficient insight to trace in them the undoubted evidences of their inspiration . Supposing some such curiosity to exist , we wilt endeavor to satisfy it as fully as possible in the outset , only premising that we judge of Mr. Emerson entirely by what he exhibits of himself in the volume before us , and that as thus exhibited , he must appear to " eyes that have not been opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is acknowledged to be the most nearly rational of all that he has yet published . We will state our impressions of the author in the terms in which his book has engraven them upon our mind as we have read . We have been reminded constantly of a " promising boy , " who has been brought up to some sixteen or eighteen years of age , in a quiet country town , according to the most approved maxims prescribed and traditional , of the most strict puritanic orthodoxy . He has thus far profited by his instructions , obeyed his parents , respected the aged , believed what those wiser than himself told him , learned the Assembly 's Catechism , repeated a verse from the Bible at the breakfast table , traveled three miles , in all weather , the year round , to attend meeting on the Sabbath , listened to what the preacher said , remembered the text and looked it out for his blind old grandmother when he reached home . The subject of many hopes and prayers , his own as well as others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . There he soon becomes // known as a virtuous , industrious , and successful student . Gradually the treasures of literature and science are disclosed before his expanding and enraptured vision , and he sees a new world , the glorious and boundless creation of human thought , of the existence of which , he before knew nothing . He enters with irrepressible ardor upon the study of the great masters in his mother tongue . By the aid of reviews , translations and histories of literature , as well as by that of his own rapidly increasing knowledge of language , he learns something of what has been thought and done by men of other times , other lands and other tongues than his own . He is at first startled and bewildered by the extent and contrariety of their speculations , the seeming facility with which they overthro*v opinions which he had thought could never be shaken , the freedom , the self-possession with which they question the reality of what had been to him the most sacred and awful truths , the halo with which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard as most fiendish and despicable . By degrees his admiration for genius , and his interest in the study of his ideal creations , predominate over his respect for simple unadorned truth , and his horror of treating even the rudest semblance of truth with irreverence . He sees that he was ignorant of the objections that could be brought against his most fondly cherished opinions , and of the irresistible fascination that might invest , upon a nearer view , characters which he had been taught to regard with irreconcilable aversion . He becomes ashamed of his former self , and in his haste to disown and then to despise his former narrow views of truth , he loses his respect for truth herself . In his eagerness to walk by the new light that has broken upon his unsealed vision , he mistakes an ignis fatuns for the sun , and while he thinks himself preparing for a swift ascent to the mid heaven of emancipated thought , he is only wandering hopelessly , amid bogs , and fens , and pitfalls , in chase of a meteor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already girded , and which seems to him above the brightness of the sun , is nothing but the blinding mist , hovering over the marsh , made visible by the kindling of a transient and gaseous light , and liable to be changed as suddenly , by the extinction of the brief meteor , into the blackness of darkness . But in the mean time , the young Illuminatus becomes exalted above measure in his own estimate , by his new initiation into the society of the great " thinkers , " the seers , and the prophets ; the creators and the regenerators , who rule the development and destiny of mankind by their mighty words . He strives laboriously to perfect himself in the difficult art of compounding their mystic and meaningless utterances , with the obstinately expressive terms of his own language . He treats his own mother tongue with the most relentless barbarity , in order if possible to make it rival the // indefiniteness and obscurity of that of another land , where mist and cloud are native to the earth and the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from the reflections of the day . His superior talents , and scholarship , even when so perversely employed , enable him to display unusual vigor , and an apparent originality , in all that he writes . His compositions call forth the censure of some , the admiration of many , and the curiosity of all . And by each he feels himself equally flattered . And thus vanity induces him to persevere in the cultivation of a forced and unnatural style of thought and expression , which his own sincere admiration for even the deformed offspring of undoubted genius , led him inconsiderately to begin . The mingled wonder and applause with which the bold expression of some of his newly acquired convictions is received , tempts him to go even beyond himself , and to affect a more entire renunciation of all commonly received opinions , than he has actually attained in his own mind ; to make himself appear more of a skeptic and doubter than lie really is , only to see the excess of surprise and horror he can call forth from less venturesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson 's history " subjective " or " objective . " We know nothing of the process by which his mind has been made physically and morally capable of producing such a book as the one before us . Of course we shall not hint a suspicion that our supposed case is anything more thin supposed , so far as he is concerned , however true it may be as a narrative of the process by which many a brilliant and inquisitive mind , has been led , first by the sincere spirit of inquiry , and subsequently by its own vanity , into a state of the most hopeless aberration . We do not charge Mr. Emerson with deliberately affecting , now in his advanced state of " cultivation , " extravagances of sentiment or of expression , merely to make simple minded people stare . All we say is , this book of his constantly makes the impression upon our mind , that its author is one , who has been made what he is , by just such a process as we have sketched in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental and moral habits thus formed , is led to deal in extravagant paradoxes and contradictions , by the gaping wonder and the inconsiderate admiration which they elicit so profusely . We do not charge him with insincerity . We are told that his personal appearance is that of a man altogether innocent of any such thing . But we judge him now only as he appears in his printed book , and that is very far from satisfying us , that the charge , if made , would be unjust . At any rate , if he does not express , so far as his own distorted forms of language can be made to express any thing intelligibly , sentiments which have little or no practical influence upon his own mind , which are not sustain .. // ed by his own convictions , then surely what is sincerity in him , must be affectation in other men . But however unwilling he might be to be judged by the same rules of right and reason that are employed in condemning or acquitting his fellow mortals before the bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him an exception , by the fact , that underneath his monstrous accumulation of barbarism in diction and absurdity in sentiment , there seems to be a firm substratum of good old Saxon English and of genuine New England common sense . So that to whatever depth of absurdity , mysticism or contradiction he may descend , in his oracular utterances , we must still read with the conviction that he knows better , and is himself conscious that he does . Thus , to speak in a style more strictly in sympathy with our subject , if Mr. Emerson dramatizes himself upon the great " world stage , " he would be philosopher enough to do it for his own amusement as well as that of his audience . And hence this book presents its author to our mind , as one who has traveled out of the beaten track of human experience and inquiry , has peeped over those precipices along the pathway of life , which most travelers think it prudent to avoid , and has groped his way into the dark caverns that open , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight , or else in exposed situations , and yet seldom so far off as not to hear the repeated expression from the great body of his fello*v pilgrims , " What a venturesome fellow he is ! " He would purchase the applause of mankind , by braving what they fear , and despising what they most esteem , even themselves . Thus his whole manner and bearing seem to say to them- " What miserable little souls you all are ! What an everlasting whining , and whimpering , you do make about your own petty ideas of happiness arid misery , benevolence and selfishness , duty and desert , right and wrong , life and death . How terribly you are frightened at bugbears , and scarecrows . Do as I have done . Emancipate yourselves from your childish superstitions . Do not vex and torment yourselves about the antiquated Hebraisms of heaven and hell , Jehovah and Jesus . Such things may have been well enough in their time . When they come as the fresh utterances of great , sincere souls , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race , what have you to do with poetry or philosophy or religion . Such high things are altogether above the reach of your understanding ; and if you could attain to them , it would be of no possible consequence to yourselves ; for , do what you will , you are ever on your way to all that is good and true . ' The truest faith is the belief that all things are good , the veriest atheism is the belief that malignity is possible , or that any thing but love and truth can last . And the more you stare and shudder , with your pietistic horror , at the utterance of such essential // facts in the system of things , the greater fools you are . And yet , do not think I shall grieve over your folly ; for it is all one with the highest *visdom . You may be afraid of devils , and punishmerit ; you may torture yourselves with repentance and sorrow ; still I shall be infinitely delighted with your weakness ; for if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanatic as you are , and not a philosopher as I am . My pleasure at the spectacle of your folly is all the more exquisite , from the fact that you are all as good and happy as gods , and yet do not know it . The very nndesignediiess and unconsciousness of your innocence and bliss , give them that genuineness which alone can make them fit subjects for philosophic contemplation . " IC Mr. Emerson does not , in his own reflections , apply to mankind terms as contemptuous as we suppose him to use , then he is chargeable with affectation , or his own books most essentially misrel ) resent him . I 'Ve suppose that each is true in part or by turns . His own language at times , taken for what it means , if it means any thing , must make him appear in the character of a much more false philosopher , and pernicious moralist , than he really is in his own convictions , and his own practice . For when at other times , the heart and intellect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for abstractions and paradoxes , he shows that he estimates the realities of life like other men , and can speak of them sensibly and intelligibly . And so also a part of what he has written , must be little else than a caricature of himself as well as of every thing which it pretends to represent , for another portion shows conclusively , that when the mood of his own inspiration is not upon him , he thinks and feels like the rest of men . We must conclude then that his labored misrepresentations of truth and duty are equal misrepresentations of the sounder philosophy by which he regulates his daily life , and that his ostentatious indifferentism to all human concerns and opinions is little else than affected non-affectation . Our estimate of Mr. Emerson , will of course appear to some , exceedingly " shallow . " But if we have succeeded in our endeavor to write ititelligibly , that alone will be sufficient to incur the charge of " hal fness " and " superficiality " from those to whose minds profundity and obscurity are identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in their own most admired oracular sentences , is stated in plain language , it appears shallow and contemptible in their estimate . In proportion as any thing comes within the range of ordinary experience , or makes its appeal to the common convictions of mankind , it must be to them altogether " flat , stale and unprofitable . " And whatever may be Mr. Emerson 's private judgment of such a taste , he is himnself responsible for encouraging , to the full extent of his influence , its cultivation by others . With all his pretensions to // nature , all his contempt for cant and affectation , the direct tendency of his influence must be to make his admirers as affected and unnatural as possible in their style and sentiments . And it would seem that if the equanimity of so exalted a philosopher could ever be disturbed by any symptoms of distrust in his own infallibility , he would at times suspect , that he does not make himself natural in proportion as he succeeds in his efforts to make himself most unlike the majurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his superior earnestness and " insight " in proportion as he treats their most commonly received opinions with contempt . The most original and comprehensive mind is surely best able to express itself without stumbling continually upon solecism , paradox or contradiction , and it will most intensely disdain to court attention by such perverse devices . The " great thinker " has least occasion to prove his own exemption from narrow and prejudiced views by fiercely satirizing those of others . He will not be found dealing perpetually in implied comparisons between himself and all other great " thinkers , " correcting their opinions , and thus showing himself wiser than they , or finding in their lives and writings a meaning which nobody else has found , and thus showing himself wiser than all the rest of mankind . A great mind moves on its way in the performance of its work like the great powers of nature , ever silent , progressive , irresistible . The light which the greatest and truest philosophers shed upon our world , appears and accomplishes its results like the light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every living thing with its influence , arid diffuses itself so quietly and uniformly , as to seem to man the most common and comprehensible of all physical agencies . That light is more gentle than the zephyr , and it is mightier than a thousand storms . It gives forth no sound , it has no perceptible motion , yet it gives voice to the thunders and the harmonies of nature , and it wakes to life and motion the dead world of material elements , as well as the whole organized and sensitive creation . So , to compare small things with great , is the influence exerted by the greatest of men upon their age and the world . They speak the language of other men . They do not study to startle or to attract attention to themselves , but to the truths which they would enforce . And they bring forward " things new and old , " so naturally , so fitly illustrated and combined , as that the new shall seem old from its perfect coincidence with universal convictions , and the old shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laboratory of creative and industrious thought . The truest reformer , the teacher , who , in Mr. Emerson 's sense of the term , is most " divinely inspired , " does not " strive nor cry . " He mingles with men so as to seem one of them . He infuses his influence and instruction into the turbid current of theirs , in so natural a // manner , that when they become purified and enlightened through his ministrations , they seem to themselves almost to have effected their own regeneration . But our " Sage of Concord , " ( for such he has been called , and such it would seem he aspires to be considered among men , ) ap-. pears to act upon the conviction , that he shall make his own heroes , his " representative men , " and by implication himself also , great in proportion as he makes them speak another language than that of this world , occasionally bringing them within the range of human intelligence , only to overthrow and confound all previously received ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own , he has set forth a great truth , in clear and appropriate colors , he must next show his artistic skill by giving it a stygian back ground of as decided falsehood . Thus it is by alternate steps in opposite directions , that he endeavors to " keep on his way " towards his own ideal of all perfection , " of which every thing can be affirmed arid denied . " At one time he takes to himself the credit of the most eiilarged and indiscriminate faith , professing to believe in all creeds , all philosophies , all mythologies ; finding equally " high truths " in tlieogonies , cosmogonies , purgatories , meternpsychoses , nirvanas ; quoting with equal reverence , the Mohammedan Koran , the Parsee Zendavesta , the Hindoo Vedas and Puranas , and the Hebrew Bible . And then anon he renounces all faith , even in himself ; gives all others fair warning not to believe in him , and seeks to dissuade all from believing in anything else . Now he professes to eml ) race all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt , in his most catholic and constant love . Arid then again , ere you can reciprocate such generous affection , he sneers at the very idea of loving at all . On this page we find him representing truth , as if it were immutable , everlasting , ever attainable , ever to be sought , ever to be relied upon as a sure dependence . On that , truth and error seem to have become convertible terms , or " one as the other , " the greater the truth the greater the falsehood ; the more devout the saint , the more abandoned the sinner . Here he talks of man as if he were the creature of circumstances , helplessly subject to material laws , himself " animated chlorine , " " a chemic lump , " endowed with the capacity of thinking , of the same substance with the dust which he treads upon , all of which vill , like him , " iii its turn speak and reason , " when he has gone to mix forever with the " elements . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to subdue all things to himself , represents him as " eudogenons , " producing all external things from within himself , ruling his own destiny in spite of the gods or the " fatal sisters . " And so swings the perpetual antithetic see-saw ; from truth to error , from reason to folly , from light to darkness . // It is much to be regretted that a mind , possessing so great flat . ural and acquired superiority , should spend its strength so uselessly , not to say perversely . It is much to be regretted that one , so little predisposed by taste or constitutional temperament to the grossness and reckless malignity of vulgar skepticism , should yet be led by mere caprice , to affirm at times the truth of many of its most monstrous and pernicious maxims . But however much error and absurdity may be found in all that Mr. Emerson writes , we are not apprehensive that any very extensive or permanent evil results , xviii spring from the influence of his publications . When we first heard of his delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to elicit from crowded audiences ; when we saw reported particular sentences , which were said to have been received with the clearest tokens of favor ; especially , the some what famous " utterance , " that " man though in brothels or jails , or 01 ) gibbets , is on his way to all that is good and true ; " we were disposed to share in the fears that were felt and expressed in various ( Juarters , as to the disorganizing and corrupting influence which such lectures must exert . But reading them as they are now presented to us on the printed page , has almost entirely dissipated such apprehensions. if the pure ridiculousness of laboriously writing out , and gravely reading to large assemblies , such gratuitous absurdities as may be found strewed profusely all through the first four of these lectures , arid occasiotially in the remaining three , could not call forth seine exhibitions of noisy emotion from a " Boston audience , " then certainly the good people of our American Athens must surpass all others in the imperturbability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , scarcely possible that any hearer could have so far forgotten himself as to suppose for a moment , that the lecturer was entuiciating truths , which should have a bearing upon his belief , practice , or obligations . Atid the applause elicited by these feats of daring in moral gymnastics , may indicate just as little danger that the hearers would be prevailed on to put in practice what the lecturer said , but could not have convinced them that he believed , as the redoubled cheering with which fool-hardy feats of strength and daring in the circus are received , indicates a danger that the crowd , occupying the seats of the amphitheater , may be led by admiration of such exploits , to descend ituto the arena arid enroll themselves as apprentices tinder the master of the ring . However sincere or unaffected Mr. Emerson may be in his personal appearance , or in his own consciousness , he chooses suich a way to exhibit himself in what he writes , that his readers , at least , if not his hearers , are fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual Sam Patch , who makes it his profession to go about the world , leap .. ing down precipices , plunging into abysses , in every deep seeking // a still lower in which to expose himself for the sake of the applause and the pay , which men are always willing to bestow bn any one who is fool-hardy enough to entertain them with such extravagances . And as the veritable Sam Patch has had an occasional imitator , so our oracular Sage , may sometimes secure a hearer who is simple-minded enough to suppose he is listening to the words of a prophet . But the great majority of both hearers and readers , though they may smile or wonder or even inconsiderately applaud , will yet look upon these " orphic sayings , " as compared with the firm , urgent , and intelligible truths , which bear upon men 's duty and destiny , very much as they look upon the feats of strength and daring exhibited in the arena , as compared with the quiet , yet constant and energetic toil of that honorable industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is much folly , if we judge the author as we do other men we must say there is much wickedness , in his book ; yet , considering the extent and intensity of each , the folly is the most harmless , and the wickedness is the most inconsequential , that we have recently observed . The chief injury which it will effect , must be produced in very much the same way , that bear-baiting , prize-fighting , and public executions tend to corrupt the general morality , by familiarizing the minds of many with things horrible and revolting . The moral sense of the reader is in danger of suffering from the influence of this book , mainly because he can not easily even see the divine majesty of truth treated with such irreverence and indignity , and not himself be made less sensitive to her wrongs . We must however , in strict justice to Mr. Emerson , admit , that with all that is absurd , and all that is false , iu his book , there is much that is of an entirely opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account some characteristic attempts at a far-fetched theory , is quite as good as any thing we have seen in the way of efforts to delineate the prominent features of that most extraordinary character . And we are inclined to attribute Mr. Emerson 's success in that instance mainly to the fact , that he seems to have regarded his subject as one , which even he , consistently with his reputation as a philosopher , might make intelligible to the common mind . However that may be , that lecture alone is sufficient to show that its author is altogethcr strongest , not when the phrensy of his moon-struck madness is upon him ; but when he yields himself most fully to the guidance of his still remaining reason . Unlike this however , most of the sketches seem to have been drawn , not from any distinct impression of what the individuals themselves were , but from a dim , uncertain , conception of an ideal character . In all that is said of Plato , there is scarcely personality enough to excuse the introduction of the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd ideal of a philosopher , and then named the picture , Plato . And surely , if we are to receive it as a likeness rather than a fancy-piece , there was much need that he should keep constantly before our eyes the inscription- " this is Plato . " He speaks of the Grecian philosopher , and of our English Shakspeare , very much as it has come to be the fashion with many of the critics , essayists , and lecturers of the times to speak , not only of those two greatest , least understood , masters , but also of any other minor hero on the field of fhought or action , whom they may choose to emblazon with the splendors of their " intense " rhetoric , and in describing whose miuntest trait or deed , they would throw open the " unchoked channels and flood gates of expression . " They would represent their hero , of *vhatever name , as great above all men , in every thing which is to them a conceivable human excellence or power ; and thus , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribe it to hini , without reserve or discrimination . And they repeat , in so many disconnected , indefinite , and irrational forms , their ascriptions of greatness , that the consistency and intelligibility of one of their essays or lectures , remind the reader of the scene at Ephesus , when " the whole city rushed together into the theater , the more part not knowing wherefore they had come together , yet all with one voice , about the space of two hours , cried out great is Diana of the Ephesians. " the reader or hearer rises from his two hours sitting . with the impression that his essayist or lecturer has beet struggling to make the subject of his criticism appear great , great , GREAT . And his enlightenment , from the patient perusal or hearing of so many intense epithets and rugged or rounded periods , " bath this extent no more . " Thus Mr. Emerson , without any attempt at proof or argument , piles assertion upon assertion , that all subsequent products of the human mind , were first generated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are still written and debated among men of thought . " All subsequent advances made in science , art , literature ; philosophy , morals , religion , are but developments of what existed in the mind of the world 's first and sole philosopher . " Christianity , " " Calvinism , " " Mohammedanism , " were all in Plato . So thoroughly I ) repared is the reader , as he advances , to find asserted in the same strain , any thing which could be made the subject of an assertion , that he is a little inclined to feel that his author is falling below himself , in not declaring that gunpowder , printing , the steam-engine , railroad , cotton gin , electric telegraph , were also in the mind of Plato . For Plato was great , and the ambitious eulogist , of Mr. Emerson 's stamp , seems to suppose , that he shall make greatness apparent and impressive , in proportion as he loads it with the most startling and incongruous epi // thets , and ascribes to it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to delineate character , Mr. Emerson seems to be governed by a conviction , that there is a peculiar dramatic element in the constitution of his own mind , which enables him to speak infallibly the sentiments of another ; for the time , " to become him . " But the reader " must have a most uncommon skull , " who can for a moment forget , that it is the same Sir Oracle who speaks , whether it be by the mouth of Plato or Swedenborg , Montaigne or *3oethe . And it seems to be this confidence in his Protean " many sidedness , " his fancied ability to sustain the most varied impersonation , which leads the author in the present volume , into most of his extravagances . While he conceives himself to be speaking appropriately in the character of another , to have become for the time , the skeptic , the mystic , or the philosopher , he is only giving utterance to the fondly cherished conceits of his own mind . And the reader is to be pardoned , if many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lended to be , as they really are , the writer 's own . For it is indeed not easy to tell when Mr. Emerson is himself , if he is not so throughout . Yet if he should ever experience a return of so much reason and conscience , as would lead him to feel responsible for his opinions , and consequently to deny or to defend any that might be ascribed to him , this transparent figment of dramatizing himself in the several incarnations of philosopher , mystic , skeptic , might serve him very elfectually for the purpose of self-defense . There are very few of what seem to be his favorite passages , which he might not acknowledge , or deny , at pleasure , on that principle . Bit whether the sentiments thus renounced would rightly represent the persons to whom they were transferred , or whether those acknowledged would be such as the writer would safely hold himself accountable for , is a question , the right decision of which , we fancy , would place Mr. Emerson 's reputation , both as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Passing from the first of the books named at the head of this article to the second , is like awakening from the darkness , the confusion , the blind and baffling struggle of some horrible nightmare dream , and seeing , on the sudden recovery of consciousness , by the first glance through the curtainless window , that the day has broken , and that the sun , coming forth from the chambers of the morning , is illumining a world which is as fair , and firm , and real , as it was when last seen bathed in the light of his setting beams . While we are endeavoring to obtain some views of the world and of mankind by Mr. Emerson 's aid , we are but as the half recovered blind , seeing " men as trees walking . " And the dimness or the distortion of our vision is so com // plete , that men and things appear , interchangeably , now as monsters of glaring hideousness , arid now as the shifting outline of impalpable shadows . And so all forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human face divine , " as well as eternal laws and unchanging truths , distorted , jostled . turned upside down in the giddy phantasmagoria of our borrowed vision , are made to reel to and fro in delirious or intoxicated dance , " alternating Elysian brightness with deep dreadful night . " Such is the world , stich is the universe to us , so long as we look for the interpretation of their realities and their mysteries , to a prophet , who himself seems to be possessed by a blind and dumb devil . We need no borrowed lens , in order to see the world as it is exhibited in the perspicuous style , and the generally rational sentiments , which fill these two volumes by Mr. Giles . He affects to possess no more of the " vision and the faculty divine , " than mortals may ssess consistently with the maintenance of their reason , their faculty of speech , and their sympathy with the joys and sorrows of this earthly life . And by the aid of that vision , we see the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truths which affect man 's duty and destiny , clear as the sun in heaven and unshaken as the throne of the Eternal . Mr. Giles can not be said to express his thoughts entirely in " that colorless language which like the cloudless atmosphere exliibits objects without exhibiting itself . " But his style approaches quite as near that only perfect standard , as that of the author to whom he applies so elegant and appropriate a description . He is content to express his thoughts clearly and elegantly , just as they lie in his own mind , not disturbed by the fear , that because their full meaning is understood by the reader , they will be thought less profound . It is indeed nothing to his discredit that he has neither strength nor depth of thought , as many writers and readers understand those qualities . In their estimate , strength consists in little else than the reduplication of certain constantly recurring epithets of intensity ; and what seems to them , depth , even beyond the reach of ordinary perception , is as readily secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , to express thoughts that are still more indefinite in the writer 's own mind . We have said that Mr. Giles 's language does not perfectly exhibit the thought without exhibiting itself . But it is questionable whether that perfect standard be the one best adapted to the purpose of popular lecturing . It is very doubtful whether the attention of any audience , could be chained to a stibject , in which they had before felt no special interest , by a written discourse , the style of which did not occasionally betray , to a critical observer , the labor and the art of composition . The studied comparison , the brilliant antithesis , the well turned period , the unaf // fected alliteration , the carefully worded apothegm , the occasional sentence modulated with all the grace of poetic numbers , are perhaps some of " the faults " to which Mr. Giles refers in his preface , as marking this class of compositions , and which he admits his own to have " in full measure . " But when they are used not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes , and when the main interest of the composition is made to depend upon far higher qualities , even such as have 1 ) 0 need of studied ornament or labored exaggeration to ensure attention , then the sound good sense of the writer is all the more accel ) tal ) le , because it is expressed in language which by its very structure is perceived to have been carefully chosen . We have been the more gratified in reading these volumes , from the fact that we opened them in the outset , with an unfavorable impression , derived from what was designed to be a decidedly favorable notice of the author , by some ne*vspaper critic who quoted , in cotifirmation of his criticism , the passage on " fat men " in general introductory to the lecture on Falstaff . That passage is indeed labored and ingenious ; but considered either in itself , or more especially in connection with the earnest , practical tone of each succeeding article , it is , to our mind , more decidedly in bad taste than any thing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage in which the heart of the writer seems to be wanting . It is little else than sentence making , where the labor of the composition effectually kills the designed humor of the sentiment . The gross conception of obesity is so denuded and draggled out , that the author will hardly win our thatiks or provoke our laughter , by making a " tun of man " our " companioti . " And as to Falstaff himself , leaving out of the account all the fine spun theories arid acute speculations of Mr. Giles , atid of every other critic upon the transcendent genius of Shakspeare , we much prefer that the great dramatist should be his own interpreter . " Falstaff , a type of Epicurean life , " has a classical and philosophic air , and may therefore arrest the attentim of the curious and the speculative ; but Shakspeare himself was not such , nor did he write for such . Ask hitn what is the abstract idea of Falstaff , and he would answer , by the mouth of Prince Henry , in terms which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That reverend vice , that grey iniquity , that father ruffian , that vanity in years . " Mr. Giles indeed etideavors to bring his speculations upon Falstaff to a safe moral conclusion ; but the speculatiomis themselves , though ingenious and for that reason attractive , are founded upon an implied faith in the infallibility of Shakspeare s genius ; upon the assumption that one of his characters is equivalent to one of nature 's , and may be dissected and reasoned upon as such . But unfortunately , that degree of faith in the great dramatist , is mostly confined to those who have oc // casion to write lectures , essays , or reviews , upon subjects that have been already a thousand times exhausted , and out of which they must yet endeavor to evolve something new . If these volumes are a fair exhibition of Mr. Giles 's tniI ) d , he is certainly far more brilliant , sensible , and effective as a writer , when , avoiding all speculation upon the world of books that have been written by others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nature as it is . Thus those portions of these lectures , especially of those upon Crabbe and Elliot , in which the works of the writers themselves are lost sight of ; are incomparably the best . His forms of expression are most happily chosen , and his vein of thought is most rich and suggestive , not when he attempts to criticise or commend the manner in which Elliot and Crabbe have described the condition of the laboring and suffering poor , but when he describes that condition himself . And this observation brings us directly to the leading object which we had before us , in classing together for the purpose of review , two authors so unlike each other as Mr. Emerson and Mr. Giles . Unlike as they are in other respects , they agree very n the several part iculars , of being " popular lecturers , " and writing mostly on what others have written , yet writing best , when attempting to expound or criticise or commend other writers least . Even Mr. Emerson can keep himself mostly within the bounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite and practical as " The Man of the World . " But Jet him give out , that he is to expound some great philosopher , to detect the hidden sense of some night walking mystic , rendered a sleep-talker and a sleep-writer by coffee and tobacco , and then we may expect a visitation from the east wind accompanied with fog . And Mr. Giles , with all his genuine good sense , clearly and elegantly expressed , can never find his way to the heart of " mixed and l ) OPular assemblies , " so long as he addresses to them refiuied criticisms upon authors , whom not one-tenth of the reopIe have ever read . And hence we consider it little better than entire loss of labor on the part of the lecturer , and of time and money on the part of hearers , when the Lyceums of our New England towns are induced to give their valuable winter evenings to attendance upon the recital of such fine spun criticisms , upon the thousand times criticised works of the great masters in literature from Shakspeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sensibilities to read as well as Mr. Giles writes , and having spent as much study in the endeavor to master an effective style in elocution as he doubtless has to master a perfect style in composirion , were to read portions of our great authors , accompanied with brief and appropriate explanations , before such Lyceums , the audience would be more entertained and instructed by the thoughts of the master himself ; than by the elaborate exposition of any aspiring critic . // But be that as it may , there is , as we believe , a still better course . And we justify ourselves for attempting to show it , b'y the fact , that the interest in popular lectures has to so great a degree subsided within the last few years , that in numberless instances , they have been abandoned altogether ; and where they have been sustained , they have been not unfrequently , nor perhaps unjustly , regarded as a wearisome infliction upon the patience and judgment of hearers . The volumes of printed lectures issued from the Boston press , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyceums elsewhere , sufficiently show that there is no want of ability in the writers . And yet we know very well from personal observation , that these same lectures , which are most highly wrought as literary productions , and which have elicited the most flattering encomiums from the daily and weekly press , have l ) roved entire failures when delivered to any other audience than the select one at a college commencement , or the few hundreds of a somewhat literary taste who can be gathered in a larg&amp; city . The audiences have sat through their delivery with listless inattention , and have gone away neither wiser nor better . The majority may perhaps have praised the lecture in some indefinite terms , but they have done it , more from the fear that if they did not thny should be thought deficient in taste or judgment , than because it has stirred them lip to more active thought , or increased the amount of their practical knowledge . And the failure has been owing , not to want of intelligence on the part of the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to the inappropriateness of the style and subject of discourse . The lecture miaht have been read before a literary club , or published in some literary magazine or review , and then , the bond of interest which had gathered the hearers or selected the readers , being the same as that which had influenced the writer in the choice of his subject and the finish of his periods , he would , of course , have found rio want of attention or of applanse from either . But farmers and mechanics , village tradesmcii and factory operatives , amid the la*vyers and physicians and clergymen , who work among them with an industry worthy of their profession , are too much absorbed in the practical realities of life , to spend the few l ) reciOus hours of their leisure , in attendance upon the carefully modulated recitations of a merely literary critic , who may justly be esteemed by them little else than an ambitious phrasemaker . They will consider it of very little consequence how skillfully one of Shakspeare 's characters may be dissected , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strung together in the form of an essay on " Genius , " if they remain uninstructed in the more pressing realities of life . They would rather have the lecturer dilate upon the structure of their own frames , than upon that of a sentence . They would // rather be made to understand the living man as he is , body and soul together , with all his " senses , dimensions , affections , passions , " than to be present at the nicest and most graceful dissection of an ideal personage , which " nature s journeyman has made and not herself . " And who shall say that they are not wise in their preferences ? Who shall say that they are not more competent judges of their own wants , than the mere essayist , who criticises only for the sake of criticism , avoiding all reference to the real sources of human subsistence and enjoyment , lest he shall seem utilitarian ; and who speaks of literature , as if in that alone , could be found the end and aim of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-gratulatiou to which such a lecturer resorts , when he charges the want of attention at his recitations , and the obstinate refusal to applaud his studied wit and rhythmical sentences , upon a want of mental cultivation amoug his hearers . They ask to be instructed in sound practical truths , not amused by prettiness of speech , or the forced conceits of cloister criticism . Men , whose daily music is the clanging of the hammer and the groan of the engine , or who have been accustouned from boyhood , in the open country , to the sound of winds and waters , to the thunders of the storm , and the more awful silence of the cloudless night , are not to be pronounced dull of hearing , if they refuse to give attention to any thing else , than the good old Saxon of their mother tongue , the strong , iron bound vehicle of just and practical thought , which can be doubly loaded with its appropriate burden and not break down . When the lecturer addresses them in that language , they know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that his words will not serve him in the endeavor to conceal thought or the want of it . They know too , that when men use such language , they must speak of things that belong to the realities and necessities of human life . In order then that popular lectures may actually secure to the community at large any considerable portion of the good tha$ was once anticipated from them , and may consequently be sustained with a corresponding interest and liberality ; lecturers must be employed who can give a good answer for themselves when they are asked , " What can you teach us ? " It is instruction that our people want on such occasions , not an hour 's rehersal of tinisms and paradoxes ; not high wrought eulogiurns upon authors that are never read , or minute analyses of characters that never existed . They wish to learn truths which are sufficiently ponderable to be weighed in the balance of their own judgments ; which may be tested by their own observation , and confirmed by their own study ; and which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily life . And there is no want of subjects , from which such truths can be drawn , and so presented , // as to be perfectly understood and appreciated by any audience convened as a New England Lyceum . The whole domain of the physical sciences , embracing within the compass of its hivestigations , all objects , all agencies , all laws , existing or acting , in " the heavens above , the earth beneath , and the waters under the earth "  --  the countless orders of animal and vegetable life , spread through every zone-all the elements of the material world , from the mightiest and most mysterious , down to the " dull clod which the rude swain turns with his share and treads upon " - all the multiplied , and constantly developing methods of bringing those original sources of exhaustless power and productiveness into subjection to man 's convenience and advantage-all that is known , and all discoveries that may be made . in reference to the physical conformation , productions , climate , inhabitants , manners , customs , history , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the useful arts , every chemical combination , every new application of the mechanic powers for the purpose of increasing and perfecting the amount of useful production-all reasonings and investigations , which bring to view the imperfections and tiecessities , together with the means of remedying the evils , of the social state-all judicious modes of bririgin g professional knowledge within the reach of all , stripped of unnecessary technicalities , clothed in the clear , intelligible language of everyday life , showing the relation of the citizen to the state , and to his fellow citizen ; making man acquainted with his own constitution , dissipating the numberless errors and superstitions in respect to the means of preserving life , and recovering from disease ; explaining natural phenomena as well as mental laws and obligations-every fact , priticil ) le or argument which shall make man understand what he is , and by what means he can most surely attain the end of his existence here arid hereafter-all these and all other subjects like them can be made plain , comprehensible , and instructive to any audience ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that though he , who aspires to bring its riches within the reach of all , concentrates all his efforts and abilities upon it , he can not exhaust his theme , and need not tire his hearers . And whenever popular lecturers are willing to go through with the study necessary to prepare themselves to write and speak appropriately upon such subjects , arid whenever Lyceum committees are resolved to employ only such as are thus prepared ; then lecturers and committees will no longer have occasion to condole with each other over the want , on the part of the public , of a disposition to sustain , or an ability to appreciate , their efforts in the work of general instruction .
