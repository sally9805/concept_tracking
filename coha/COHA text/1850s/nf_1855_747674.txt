A true bill . ENOCH PATTERSON , JR. , Foreman . B. F. HALLETT , United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts . Similar indictments were found against Mr. Phillips , Mr. S towell , Rev. T. W. Higginson , John Morrison , Samuel T. Proudman , and John C. Cluer . Mr. Parker was arraigned on Wednesday , November 29th , and ordered to recognize in bonds of 1,500 for his appearance at that Court , on the 5th of March , 1855 . His bondsmen were Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manley ; his counsel were Jlon . John P. Hale , and Charles M. Ellis , Esq . The other gentlemen were arraigned afterwards at different times . After considerable uncertainty about the engagements of Hon. Justice Curtis , Tuesday , April 3d , was fixed for the commencement of the trials . At that time there appeared as counsel for the govern ment , Hon. Benjamin F. Hallett , District Attorney , and Elias Merwin , Esq. , formerly a law partner of Judge Curtis ; on the other side were Hon. John P. Hale , and Charles M. Ellis , Esq. , for Mr. Parker ; Wm . L. Burt , Esq. , John A. Andrew , Esq. , and H. F. Durant , Esq. , counsel for Messrs . Phillips , Higginson , Stowell , Bishop , Morrison , Proudman , and Cluer . Mr. Hale , as senior counsel , stated to the court that the counsel for the defendants in several of the cases had conferred , and concluded on the supposition that the Court and Government would assent to the plan as most for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel to file the like motion on the different cases ; and , instead of each counsel going over the whole ground for each case , to divide the matter presented for debate , and for each to dis cuss some particular positions on behalf of them all . This was /z/ assented to ; and motions , of which the following is a copy , were filed in the several cases : CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES , MASSACHUSETTS DISTRICT , ss . United States by Indictment v. Theodore Parker . And now said Theodore Parker comes and moves that the indictment against him be quashed , because , " 1 . The writ of venire for the jury that found said indictment was directed to and returned by Watson Freeman , the Marshal , who was not an indifferent person , and it was not served and returned as the law directs . " 2 . Because said Jury was not an impartial Jury of the District , designated as the laws require , but the jury Districts for this court embrace but a portion of the District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact chosen and designated from but a frac tion of the District and contrary to law . " 3 . Because the matters and things alleged in said indictment do not constitute any crime under the statute on which said indictment is framed , the said statute not em bracing them , or being , so far as it might embrace them , repealed by the statute of eighteen hundred and fifty . " 4 . Because said indictment does not allege and set forth fully and sufficiently the authority and the proceedings whereon the alleged warrant and order were based , or facts sufficient to show that the alleged process and order were lawfully issued by any person duly authorized , and his authority and jurisdiction , and that the same were within such jurisdiction , and issued by the authority of the law , and originated , issued , and directed as the law prescribes ; said warrant and order not being alleged to have issued from any court or tribunal of general or special jurisdiction , but by a person vested with certain specific statute authority . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bad on the face of them , as follows , viz. : " First , it nowhere appearing that the same were found by a grand-jury , because the second and third counts do not conclude , against the form of the statute , and have no conclusion , because the third and fourth counts do not set forth the estate , degree , or mystery of the person therein charged . " Because said indictment and the counts thereof are repugnant and inconsistent , the same being based on an alleged obstruction , resistance , and opposition to the service of an action , order , or warrant , which is therein averred to have been already served , executed , and returned . " Because the first and fifth counts are double . " Because the alleged order of May 25th , referred to therein , was a void and illegal , order . " Because , if the alleged warrant was served as therein alleged , said Watson Free man did not , and by law could not thereafter , hold the person described therein , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not set forth and allege fully and specifically the acts /z/ charged to be offences against the statute , so as to inform said party charged , of the nature and cause of the accusation . " C. Because the warrant set forth and referred to therein was void on its face , and issued from and ran into a jurisdiction not authorized by law , and directed the arrest of a person without legal cause , and because said indictment is otherwise bad , uncer tain , and insufficient. * Mr. Wm . L. Burt commenced the argument of the motions , and presented several of the points . He was followed by Mr. C. M. Ellis , J. A. Andrew , and H. F. Durant , who severally discussed some of the grounds of the motions . Elias Merwin , Esquire , and Mr. Attorney Hallett , replied . The Court stated that they did not wish to hear Hon. John P. Hale , who was about to rejoin and close in support of the motion , and decided that the allegation , on the indictment , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States for said District , was not a legal averment that he was such a Commissioner as is described in the bill of 1850 , and therefore the indictments were bad . The Court said they supposed it to be true that Mr. Loring was such a Commissioner , and that his authority could be proved by producing the record of his appointment ; that they did not suppose the absence of this averment could be of any practical consequence to the defendants , so far as respected the substantial merits of the cases ; and it was true the objection to the indictment was " tech nical ; " but they held it sufficient , notwithstanding the averment that the warrant was " duly issued " and ordered the indictment against Stowell to be quashed . On every other point , save that that the Court could properly construct the Jury roster and return the Jury from a portion of the District , the Judge said they would express no opinion . Mr. Hallett insisted on his right to enter a nolle prosequi in the other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases had been heard upon the motion , yet as it could make no difference whether an entry were made that this indictment be quashed , or an /z/ entry of nolle prosequi , the Attorney might enter a nolle prosequi if he chose to do so then , before the Court passed any order on the motions . Mr. Hallett accordingly entered a nolle prosequi in all the other cases , and the whole affair was quashed . 1 /z/ GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . It is no trifling matter which comes before you this day . You may hereafter decide on millions of money , and on the lives of your fellow men ; but it is not likely that a ques tion of this magnitude will ever twice be brought before the same jurymen . Opportunities to extend a far-reaching and ghastly wicked ness , or to do great service for mankind , come but seldom in any man s life . Your verdict concerns all the people of the United States ; its influence will reach to ages far remote , blessing or cursing whole generations not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reach , its consequences of immense duration . In addressing you , Gentlemen , my language will be more didactic than rhetorical , more like a lecture , less like a speech ; for I am not a lawyer but a minister , and do not aim to carry a Measure , which with you will go of its own accord , so much as to set forth a Principle that will make such prosecutions as impossible hereafter , as a convic tion now is to-day . Gentlemen , I address you provisionally , as Representatives of the People . To them , my words are ultimately addressed , to the People of the Free States of America . I must examine many things minutely , not often touched upon in courts like this . For mine is a Political Trial ; I shall treat it accordingly . I am charged with no immoral act with none even of selfish ambition . It is not pre tended that I have done a deed , or spoken a word , in the heat of passion , or vengeance , or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor , to myself or any friend . I am not suspected of wishing to do harm to man or woman ; or with disturbing any man s natural rights . Nay , I am not even charged with such an offence . The Attorney and the two Judges are of one heart and rnind in this prosecution ; Mr. Hallett s " Indictment " is only the beast of burthen to carry to its own place Mr. Curtis s " Charge to the /z/ Grand- Jury , " fit passenger for fitting carriage ! The same tree bore the Judge s blossom in June , and the Attorney s fruit in October , both reeking out the effluvia of the same substance . But neither Attorney nor Judge dares accuse me of ill-will which would harm another man , or of selfishness that seeks my own private advantage . No , Gentlemen of the Jury , I am on trial for my love of Justice ; for my respect to the natural Rights of Man ; for speaking a word in behalf of what the Declaration of Independence calls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural , equal , and unalienable Right to Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . I am charged with words against what John Wesley named , the " Sum of all Villanies , " against a national crime so great , that it made freethinking Mr. Jefferson , with all his " French Infidelity , " " tremble " when he remembered " that God is just . " I am on trial for my manly virtue , a Minister of the Christian Religion on trial for keeping the Golden Rule ! It is alleged that I have spoken in Boston against kidnapping in Boston ; that in my own pulpit , as a minister , I have denounced Boston men for stealing my own parishioners ; that as a man , in Faneuil Hall , the spirit of James Otis , of John Hancock , and three Adams s about me , with a word I " obstructed " the Marshal of Bos ton and a Boston Judge of Probate , in their confederated attempts to enslave a Boston man . When the Government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " misdemeanor " of appealing from the Atheism of purchased officials to the Conscience of the People ; and with rousing up Christians to keep the golden rule , when the Rulers declared Religion had nothing to do with politics and there was no Law of God above the fugitive slave bill ! Such are the acts charged . Gentlemen of the Jury , you are sum moned here to declare them a Crime , and then to punish me for this " offence ! " You are the Axe which the Government grasps with red hand to cleave my head asunder . It is a trial where Franklin Pierce , transiently President of the United States , and his official coadjutors , Mr. Caleb Gushing , Mr. Benj . R. Curtis , and Mr. Benj . F. Hallett , are on one side , and the People of the United States on the other . As a Measure , your decision may send me to jail for twelve months ; may also fine me three hundred dollars . To me per sonally it is of very small consequence what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imprisonment for twelve months Gentle men , I laugh at it ! Nay , were it death , I should smile at the official gibbet . A verdict of guilty would affix no stain to my reputation . I am sure to come out of this trial with honor it is the Court that is sure to suffer loss at least shame . I do not mean the Court will ever feel remorse , or even shame , for this conduct ; I am no young man now , I know these men , but the People are sure to burn the /z/ brand of shame deep into this tribunal . The blow of that axe , if not parried , will do me no harm . But it is not I , merely , now put to trial . Nay , it is the unalienable Rights of Humanity , it is truths self-evident . For on the back of that compliant Measure , unseen , there rides a Principle . The verdict expected of you condemns liberal institutions : all Religion but priestcraft the abnegation of religion itself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . The word which fines me , puts your own purse in the hands of your worst enemies ; the manywarded key which shuts me in jail , locks your lips forever your children s lips forever . No complaint against oppression hereafter ! Kidnapping will go on in silence* but at noonday , not a minister stirring . Meeting-houses will be shut ; all court houses have a loaded cannon at their door , chains all round them , be stuffed with foreign soldiers inside , while commissioners swear away the life , the liberty , and even the Estate of the subjected " citizens . " All Probate Judges will belong to the family of man-stealers . Faneuil Hall will be shut , or open only for a " Union Meeting , " where the ruler calls together his menials to indorse some new act of injustice , only creatures of the Government , men like the marshal s guard last June , allowed to speak words paid for by the People s coward sweat and miserable blood . The blow which smites my head will also cleave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to vindicate Religion with Freedom of Speech , and condemn the stealing of men ; or else to confirm Kidnapping and condemn Religion with Freedom of Speech . You are to choose whether you will have such men as Wendell Phillips for your advis ers , or such as Benjamin F. Hallett and Benjamin R. Curtis for your masters , with the marshal s guard , for their appropriate servants . Do you think I doubt how you will choose ? Already a power of iniquity clutches at your children s throat ; stabs at their life at their seal s life . I stand between the living tyrant and his living victim ; aye , betwixt him and expected victims not yet born , your children , not mine . I have none to writhe under the successful lash which tyrants now so subtly braid there with , one day , to scourge the flesh of well-descended men . I am to stand the champion of human Rights for generations yet unborn . It is a sad distinction ! Hard duties have before been laid on rne , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look up for inspiring aid ? Only to Him who gave words to the slow tongue of Moses and touched with fire Esaias hesitating lips , and dawned into the soul of tent-makers and fishermen with such great wakening light , as shining through them , brought day to na tions sitting in darkness , yet waiting for the consolation . May such /z/ Truth and Justice enable me also , to speak a testimony unto the Gentiles ; He who chose the weak things , to bring to nought the mighty , may not despise such humble services as mine . Gentlemen of the Jury , my ministry deals chiefly with the Laws of God , little with the statutes of men . My manhood has been mainly passed in studying absolute , universal truth , teaching it to men , and applying it to the various departments of life . I have little to do with courts of law . Yet I am not now altogether a stranger to the circuit court room of the United States , having been in it on five several occasions before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , ancient and patri cian before Christendom had laid eyes on America , once also of great individual wealth , a man of high rank alike acquired and inherited , once holding a high place at the court of the Czar , became a fugi tive from Russian despotism , seeking an asylum here ; he came to the circuit court room to lecture on the Roman Law . I came to contribute my two mites of money , and receive his wealth of learning . 2 . The next time , I came at the summons of Thomas Sims . For a creature of the slave-power had spontaneously seized that poor and friendless boy and thrust him into a dungeon , hastening to make him a slave , a beast of burthen . He had been on his mock trial seven days , and had never seen a Judge , only a commissioner , nor a Jury ; no Court but a solitary kidnapper . Some of his attendants had spoken of me as a minister not heedless of the welfare and unalienable rights of a black man fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court house . Outside it was belted with chains . In des potic Europe I had seen no such spectacle , save once when the dull tyrant who oppressed Bavaria with his licentious flesh , in 1844 put his capital in a brief state of siege and chained the streets . The official servant of the kidnapper , club in hand , a policeman of this city , goaded to his task by Mayor Bigelow and Marshal Tukey , men congenitally mingled in such appropriate work , bade me " Get under the chain . " I pressed it down and went over . The Judges of our own Supreme Court , they went under , had gone out and in , beneath the chain ! How poetry mingles with fact ! The chain was a symbol , and until this day rernaineth the same chain , untaken away in the reading of the fugitive slave bill ; and when the law of Massachusetts is read , the chain is also upon the neck of that court ! Within the court house was full of armed men . I found Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts law , converted into a jail to hold men charged with no crime . Ruf fians mounted guard at the entrance , armed with swords , fire-arms , /z/ and bludgeons . The door was locked and doubly barred besides . Inside the watch was kept by a horrid looking fellow , without a coat , a naked cutlass in his hand , and some twenty others , their mouths nauseous with tobacco and reeking also with half-digested rum paid for by the city . In such company , I gave what consola tion Religion could offer to the first man Boston ever kidnapped , consolations which took hold only of eternity , where the servant is free from his master , for there the wicked cease from troubling . I could offer him no comfort this side the grave . 3 . I visited the United States court a third time . A poor young man had been seized by the same talons which subsequently griped Sims in their poison , deadly clutch . But that time , wickedness went off hungry , defeated of its prey ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Shadrach escaped from that Babylonish furnace , heated seven times hotter than its wont : no smell of fire had passed on him . But the rescue of Shadrach was telegraphed as " treason . " The innocent lightning flashed out the premeditated and legal lie , " it is levying war ! " What offence it was in that Fourth One who walked with the Hebrew children , " making their good confession , " arid sustained the old Shadrach , Meshech , and Abednego , I know not . But the modem countrymen of the African Shadrach , charged with some great crime , were haled into this court to be punished for their humanity ! I came to look on these modern Angels of the Deliverance , to hear counsel of Mr. Dana , then so wise and humane , and to listen to the masterly eloquence which broke out from the great human heart of my friend , Mr. Hale , and rolled like the Mississippi , in its width , its depth , its beauty , and its continuous and unconquer able strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had been kidnapped , also at night , and forced into the same illegal jail . He sat in the dock an inno cent man , to be made into a beast . The metamorphosis had begun ; he was already in chains and his human heart seemed dead in him ; sixty ruffians were about him , aiding in this drama , hired out of the brothels and rum-shops for a few days , the lust of kidnapping serving to vary the continual glut of those other and less brutal appe tites of unbridled flesh . While that " trial " lasted , whoredom had a Sabbath day , and brawlers rested from their toil . Opposite sat the Boston Judge of Probate , and the Boston District Attorney , the Moses and Elias of this inverted transfiguration ; there sat the mar shal , tvo " gentlemen " from Virginia , claiming that a Boston man was their beast of burthen , owing service and labor in Richmond ; two " lawyers , " " members of the Suffolk bar , " pistols in their coats , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men stood up to defend him . There is one of them , to defend /z/ me Charles M. Ellis . You know very well the rest of that sad story , the mock trial of Anthony Burns lasted from May 25th till June 2d . I was here in all the acts of that Tragedy . My own life was threatened ; friend and foe gave me public or anonymous warn ing . I sat between men who had newly sworn to kill me , my gar ments touching theirs . The malaria of their rum and tobacco was an offence in my face . I saw their weapons , and laughed as I looked those drunken rowdies in their coward eye . They touch me ! 5 . The fifth time I came here at the summons of an officer of this court , very politely delivered , let me say it to his credit , indicted and arrested for a " misdemeanor . " I gave bail and withdrew . 6 . The sixth time , Gentlemen , it is the present , whereof I shall erelong have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only scholarly and philanthropic gentle men , coming out of sympathy with a Polish exile , a defeated soldier of freedom , from his broken English to learn sound Roman Law . On each of the other visits I have been in quite different company . I have invariably met this Honorable Court , its kinsfolk and its most intimate friends , some member of the family of the distinguished Judge , now fitly presiding over this trial . 1 . It was Mr. George T. Curtis , the only brother of the honorable Justice now on the bench , born of the same mother and father , who had the glory of kidnapping Mr. Sims ; it was he who seized Shadrach , and gave such witness against one of the Angels of the Deliv erance , and then came back and enlarged his testimony ; it was he who declared the rescue an act of " treason ; " he who hung the court house in chains , and brought down the pliant neck of the Massachusetts Judges beneath that symbolic line of linked fetters long drawn out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands ! 2 . It was the honorable Judge now on the distinguished bench who tried men for the rescue of Shadrach . How he tried them is well known . 3 . It was Edward G. Loring , another of this family so distin guished , who kidnapped Mr. Burns and held him in irons ; he whose broom swept up together the marshal s guard ; he who advised Mr. Burns s counsel to make no defence , " put no obstructions in the way of his going back , as he probably will ; " he who , in the dark ness of midnight , sought to sell his victim , before he had examined the evidence which might prove him a free man ; he who delivered him up as a slave , against evidence as against law . 4 . Another of the same family , William W. Greenough , brotherin-law of Hon. Judge Curtis , was one of the grand-jury which /z/ found the indictment against me , and " the most active of all in that work . " 5 . When I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Curtis sat on the bench and determined the amount of my bail , and the same eye which had frowned with such baleful aspect on the rescuers of Shadrach , quailed down underneath my look and sought the ground . * In thus mentioning my former visits to the court , I but relate the exploits of the Hon. Justice Curtis , of his kinsfolk and friends , adding to their glory and their renown . Their chief title to distinction rests on their devotion to the fugitive slave bill . It and their honor are " one and inseparable . " Once only humanity and good letters brought me here , I met only scholars and philanthropists ; on five other occasions , when assaults on freedom compelled my attendance , I have been confronted and surrounded with the loyalty of the distin guished Judge and his kinsfolk and friends , valiantly and disinterest edly obeying the fugitive slave bill " with alacrity ; " patriotically conquering their prejudices against man-stealing if such they ever had ; and earning for themselves an undying reputation by " sav ing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare , and the Blessings of Liberty . If I am to be arraigned for any act , I regard it as a special good fortune that I am charged with such deeds , with seeking to arouse the noblest emotions of Human Nature ; and by means of the grand est Ideas which Human History has brought to light . I could not have chosen nobler deeds in a life now stretching over nearly half a hundred years . I count it an honor to be tried for them . Nay , it adds to my happiness to look at the Court which is to try me for if I were to search all Christendom through , nay , throughout all Hea thendom , I know of no tribunal fitter to try a man for such deeds as I have done . I am fortunate in the charges brought ; thrice fortunate in the judges and the attorney , the Court which is to decide ; its history and character are already a judgment . 6 . For my sixth visit , I was recognized to appear on the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massacre . I might have been bound over to any other of the great days of American history 22d of December , 19th of April , 17th of June , or the 4th of July . But as I am the first American ever brought to trial for a speech in Faneuil Hall against kidnapping ; as I am the first to be tried under the act of 1790 for " obstructing an officer " with an argument , committing a " misdemeanor " by a word which appeals to the natural justice of mankind , so there could not perhaps be a fitter time chosen . For on the fifth of March , 1770 , British /z/ despotism also delivered its first shot into the American bosom . Not far from this place the hand of George III . wounded to death five innocent citizens of Boston , one of them a negro . It was the first shot Britain ever fired into the body of the American people , then colonial subjects of the king-power . That day the fire was not returned , only with ringing of bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next day that American blood lay frozen in the street . Soon after the British government passed a law ex empting all who should aid an officer in his tyranny from trial for murder in the prace where they should commit their crime . Mr. Toucey has humbly copied that precedent of despotism . It was very proper that the new tyranny growing up here , should select that anniversary to shoot down freedom of thought and speech among the subjects of the slave-power . I welcomed the omen . The Fifth of March is a red-letter day in the calendar of Boston . The Court could hardly have chosen a better to punish a man for a thought and a word , especially a Boston man , for such a word in Faneuil Hall a word against man-stealing . But I knew the case would never o o come to trial on that day of course it was put off . Mr. Sims and Mr. Burns were accused of no crime but birth from a mother whom some one had stolen . They had only a mock trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no jury , no judicial officer . But I , accused of a grave offence , am to enjoy a trial with due process of law . It is an actual judge before me and another judge at his side , both judicial officers known to the constitution . I know beforehand the decision of the court its history is my judg ment . Justice Curtis s Charge of last June , would make my daily talk a " misdemeanor , " my public preaching and my private prayers a " crime , " nay , my very existence is constructively an " obstruc tion " to the marshal . On that side my condemnation is already sure . But there is another element . Gentlemen of the Jury , the judges and attorney can not lay their hand on me until you twelve men with one voice say , " Yes ! put him in jail . " In the mock trial of Sims and Burns it was necessary to convince only a single official of the United States Court , a " ministerial " officer selected and appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conviction , no evi dence but the oath of a slave-hunter and the extorted " admission " of his victim , an official who was to have ten dollars for making a slave , five only for setting free a man ! But you are a Massachusetts Jury , not of purchased officials , but of honest men . I think you have some " prejudices " to conquer in favor of justice . It has not appeared that you are to be paid twice as much for sending me to jail , as for acquitting me of the charge . I doubt that you have yet /z/ advised my counsel to make no defence , " put no obstructions in the way " of my being sent to jail as " he probably will . " Gentlemen , a United States Commissioner has his place on con dition that he performs such services as his masters " require . " These United States Judges have their seat in consequence of services ren dered to the ruling power of America , and for others of like sort yet to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them alluring to new service , additional salary can pay additional alac rity . But you , Gentlemen , are not office-holders nor seekers of office , not hoping to gain money , or power , or honor , by any wickedness . You are to represent the unsophisticated Conscience of the People , not the slave-power , but the power of Freedom . It is to you I shall address my defence ! MY defence ? No , Gen tlemen , YOUR defence , the defence of your own Rights , inherent in your national Institutions as Americans , ay , in your Nature as Men . It is a singular good fortune that to you , as judges , I am pleading your own cause . You have more interest at stake than I. For at death my name will perish , while children and children s children , I trust , will gently mingle your memories in that fair tide of human life which never ends . So much have I said by way of introduction , treating only of the accidents pertaining to this case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof . This is a Political Trial . In form , I am charged with violating a certain statute never before applied to actions like mine ; never meant to apply to such actions ; not legally capable of such applica tion . But in fact , my offence is very different from what the indict ment attempts to set forth . The judges know this ; the attorney knows it , and " never expected to procure a conviction . " It is your cause , even more than mine , that I plead . So it concerns you to understand the whole matter thoroughly , that you may justly judge our common cause . To make the whole case clear , I will land it out into four great parcels of matter , which your mind can command at once , and then come to the details of each , ploughing it all over before your face , furrow by furrow . I shall speak , I. Of the State of Affairs in America which has led to this prose cution , the Encroachments of a Power hostile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operation pursued by this Encroaching Power , in other times and in our own , of Systematic Corruption of the Judiciary . III . Of the great Safeguard which has been found serviceable in protecting Democratic Institutions and the Rights of Man they are designed to defend . of the Trial by Jury . /z/ IV . Of the Circumstances of this special case , UNITED STATES ver sus THEODORE PARKER . I shall speak of each in its order , and begin at the head . /z/ In a republic where all emanates from the People , political institu tions must have a Basis of Idea in the Nation s Thought , before they can acquire a Basis of Fact in the Force of the Nation . Now in America there are two diverse Ideas recognized as principles of Action the Idea of Freedom and the Idea of Slavery . Allow me to read my analysis and description of each . The Idea of Freedom first got a national expression on the Fourth of July , 1776 . Here it is . I put it in a philosophic form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed by their Creator with certain natural rights , amongst which is the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Second , These rights are unalienable ; they can be alienated only by the possessor thereof ; the father can not alienate them for the son , nor the son for the father ; nor the husband for the wife , nor the wife for the husband ; nor the strong for the weak , nor the weak for the strong ; nor the few for the many , nor the many for the few ; and so on . Third , In respect to these , all men are equal ; the rich man has not more , and the poor less ; the strong man has not more , and the weak man less : all are exactly equal in these rights , however unequal in their powers . Fourth , It is the function of government to secure these natural , unalienable , and equal rights to every man . Fifth , Government derives all its divine right from its conformity with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governed . That is the Idea of Freedom . I used to call it " the American Idea ; " that was when I was younger than I am to-day . It is derived from human nature ; it rests on the immutable Laws of God ; it is part of the natural religion of mankind . It demands a government after natural Justice , which is the point common between the conscience of God and the conscience of mankind ; it is the point common also between the interests of one man and of all men . Now this government , just in its substance , in its form must be democratic : that is to say , the government of all , by all , and for all . You see what consequences must follow from such an idea , and the attempt to reenact the Law of God into political in stitutions . There will follow the freedom of the people , respect for every natural right of all men , the rights of their body and of their spirit the rights of mind and con science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of children by their parents , as of bad men by good men ; but it will be restraint for the joint good of all parties concerned ; not restraint for the exclusive benefit of the restrainer . The ulti mate consequence of this will be the material and spiritual welfare of all riches , comfort , noble manhood , all desirable things . That is the Idea of Freedom . It appears in the Declaration of Independence ; it /z/ reappears in the Preamble to the American Constitution , which aims " to establish Justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of Liberty . " That is a religious idea ; and when men pray for the " Reign of Justice " and the " Kingdom of Heaven " to come on earth politically , I suppose they mean that there may be a Commonwealth where every man has his natural rights of mind , body , and estate . Next is the Idea of Slavery . Here it is . I put it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make . First , There are no natural , unalienable , and equal rights , wherewith men are en dowed by their Creator ; no natural , unalienable , and equal right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Second , There is a great diversity of powers , and in yirtue thereof the strong man may rule and oppress , enslave and ruin the weak , for his interest and against theirs . Third , There is no natural law of God to forbid the strong to oppress the weak , and enslave and ruin the weak . That is the Idea of Slavery . It has never got a national expression in America ; it has never been laid down as a Principle in any act of the American people , nor in any single State , so far as I know . All profess the opposite ; but it is involved in the Measures of both State and Nation . This Idea is founded in the selfishness of man ; it is atheistic . The idea must lead to a corresponding government ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will depend not on natural right , but on personal force ; not on the Constitution of the Universe , but on the compact of men . It is the abnegation of God in the universe and of conscience in man . Its form will be despotism , the govern ment of all , by a part , for the sake of a part . It may be a single-headed despotism , or a despotism of many heads ; but whether a Cyclops or a Hydra , it is alike " the abomination which maketh desolate . " Its ultimate consequence is plain to foresee poverty to a nation , misery , ruin . These two Ideas are now fairly on foot . They are hostile ; they are both mutually invasive and destructive . They are in exact opposition to each other , and the nation which embodies these two is not a figure of equilibrium . As both are active forces in the minds of men , and as each idea tends to become a fact a universal and exclusive fact , as men with these ideas organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact , it follows that there must not only be strife amongst philosophical men about these antagonistic Principles and Ideas , but a strife of practical men about cor responding Facts and Measures . So the quarrel , if not otherwise ended , will pass from words to what seems more serious ; and one will overcome the other . So long as these two Ideas exist in the nation as two political forces , there is no national unity of Idea , of course no unity of action . For there is no centre of gravity common to Freedom and Slavery . They will not compose an equilibrious figure . You may cry " Peace ! Peace ! " but so long as these two antagonistic Ideas remain , each seeking to organize itself and get exclusive power , there is no peace ; there can be none . The question before the nation to-day is , Which shall prevail the Idea and Fact of Freedom , or the Idea and the Fact of Slavery ; Freedom , exclusive and universal , or Slavery , exclusive and universal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond or free ? but , Shall America be a Democracy or a Despotism ? For nothing is so remorseless as an idea , and no logic is so strong as the historical development of a national idea by millions of men . A measure is nothing without its Principle . The Idea which allows Slavery in South Carolina will establish it also in New England . /z/ The bondage of a black man in Alexandria imperils every white woman s daughter in Boston . You can not escape the consequences of a first Principle more than you can " take the leap of Niagara and stop when half-way down . " The Principle which recognizes Slavery in the Constitution of the United States would make all America a Despotism , while the Principle which made John Quincy Adams a free man would extirpate Slavery from Louisiana and Texas . It is plain America can not long hold these two contradictions in fhe national consciousness . Equilibrium must come . 1 These two ideas are represented by two parties which aim at the ultimate organization of their respective doctrines , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Party of Freedom is not yet well organized ; that of Slavery is in admirable order and discipline . These two parties are continually at war attended with various success . 1 . In the individual States of the North , since the Revolution , the Party of Freedom has gained some great victories ; it has abolished Personal Slavery in every northern State , and on a deep-laid founda tion has built up Democratic Institutions with well proportioned beauty . The Idea of Freedom , so genial to the Anglo-Saxon , so welcome to all of Puritanic birth and breeding , has taken deep root in the consciousness of the great mass of the People at the North . In the severe simplicity of national deduction they will carry it to logical conclusions not yet foreseen by human providence . The free States are progressively democratic . But in all the Northern States , and more especially in its cities , and here chiefly among the men of exclusive intellectual culture and the votaries of commerce and its riches , there are exceptional men who embrace the Idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no law higher than the transient interest of their politics or their commerce , their ease or ambition . They may not theoretically hate the People , but they so love their own money , their own ease or pleasure , that practically they oppose what promotes the welfare of mankind , and seek their own personal advancement to the injury of the human race . These are Northern men with Southern " Prin ciples . " They have their Journals too well known in Boston to need mention here . 2 . In the individual States of the South , the Idea and Party of Slavery has also gained great victories and been uniformly success ful ; it has extended and strengthened personal slavery , which has now a firmer hold in the minds of the controlling classes of Southern men , the rich and " educated , " than in 1776 , or ever before . The Southern States are progressively despotic . Still , in all the Southern States there are exceptional men , hostile 1 See this statement in Mr. Parker s Additional Speeches , Addresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 250 , et seq . /z/ to slavery , the intelligent and religious from conviction , others from mere personal interest . These are Southern men with Northern Principles . They are much oppressed at home kept from political advancement or social respectability , as much as democrats would be at Rome or Naples , have no journals and little influence . 3 . In the Federal Government , the warfare goes on , each party seeking for mastery over the whole United States the contest is carried on in Congress , in all the local legislatures ; newspapers , speeches , even sermons , resound with the din of battle . See what forces contend and with what results . The nation lives by its productive industry , whereof there are these five chief departments : Hunting and Fishing , the appropriation of the spontaneous live products of the land and sea ; Agriculture , the use of the productive forces of the earth s surface ; Mining , the appro priation of the metallic products of her bosom ; Manufactures , the application of toil and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Agriculture ; Commerce , the exchange of value , distribution of the products of these four departments of industry , directly productive . Hunting and Fishing , Mining , Manufactures , Commerce , are mainly in the hands of Northern men the South is almost wholly Agricul tural . Her wealth consists of land and slaves . In 1850 the fifteen slave States had not fourteen hundred millions of other property . In the South property , with its consequent influence , is in few hands in the North it is wide spread . Now the few controlling men of the South , the holders of land and slaves , have Unity of pecuniary Interest the support of Slavery as a local measure , for it is the source of their material wealth , and also a consequent Unity of political Idea , the support of Slavery as a universal Principle , for it is the source likewise of their political power . Accordingly the South presents against the North an even and well-disciplined front of veteran soldiers , is always hostile to Freedom , and as her " best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the profession of their whole lives , it is plain they become formidable antagonists . But the North has a great variety of conflicting interests , a great amount of intellectual activity , where education and its consequent habits of reading and thinking are so wide spread , and therefore a great variety of opinion . Accordingly there is not the same Unity of pecuniary Interest and of political Idea , which distinguishes the South . Besides , in the North the ablest and best educated men do not devote their time to the thankless and stormy calling of politics ; Virginia cares for nothing but Negroes and Politics , her loins and her brains gender but this twofold product : Massachusetts and . New /z/ York care for much beside . So the North does not present against the South an even and well-disciplined front of veteran soldiers , but a ragged , discordant line of raw recruits , enlisting for a short time with some special or even personal local interest to serve . What makes the matter yet worse for us , Gentlemen of the Jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the North , engrossed in direct productive industry , are really hostile to slavery , those ab sorbed in the large operations of commerce , taken as a whole class , feel little interest in the Idea of Freedom ; nay , they are positively opposed to it . Before the African Slave-trade was treated like other kindred forms of piracy , as a capital crime , they had their ships in that felonious traffic ; and now their vessels engage in the American Slave-trade and their hand still deals in the bodies of their fellow men . In all the great commercial cities , like Philadelphia , New York and Boston these men prevail , and are the " eminent citi zens , " overslaughing the press , the pulpit , the bar , and the court , with the Ideas of their lower law , and sweeping along all metropol itan and suburban fashion and respectability in their slimy flood . Hence the great cities of the North , governed by the low maxims of this class , have become the asylum of Northern men with Southern " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And hitherto these great cities have controlled the politics of the Northern States , crowd ing the Apostles of Freedom out from the national board , and helping the party of slavery to triumph in all great battles . Thus aided , for many years the South has always elected her candidate for the Presidency by the vote of the people . But the American Executive is twofold , part Presidential , part Senatorial . Sometimes these two Executives are concordant , sometimes discord ant . The Senatorial Executive has always carried the day against the less permanent Presidential power , except in the solitary case where General Jackson s unconquerable will and matchless popular ity enabled him to master the senate itself , who " registered " his de crees , or " expunged " their own censure , just as the iron ruler gave orders . Now by means of the control which the Northern Cities have over the Northern States , and such Commercial Men over those cities , it has come to pass that not only the Presidential , but also the Sena torial Executive , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jury , the direct consequence is obvious , the Party of Slavery has long been the conqueror in the field of Federal politics . In the numerous and great conflicts between the two , Freedom has prevailed against Slavery only twice since the close of the Revolutionary War , in prohibiting involuntary servitude in the North-west Territory in 1787 , and in the abolition of the African /z/ Slave-trade in 1808 . Her last triumph was forty-seven years ago , nay , even that victory was really achieved twenty years before at the adoption of the constitution . In this warfare we have not gained a battle for freedom since 1788 ! For a time it seemed doubtful which would triumph , though Sla very gained Kentucky and Tennessee , and Louisiana was purchased as slave soil in 1803 . But in 1820 slavery became the obvious and acknowledged master in the Federal Territory , marched victorious over the Mississippi , planted itself in Missouri , and has subse quently taken possession of Mississippi , Alabama and Arkansas , all slave States ; has purchased Florida ; " reannexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , all slave soil ; and from Freedom and the North has just now reconquered Kanzas and Nebraska . Ever since the Missouri Compromise in 1820 Slavery has been really the master , obviously so since the annexation of Texas in 1845 , The slave-power appoints all the great national officers , executive , diplomatic , judicial , naval and military , it controls the legislative departments . Look at this Honorable Court , Gentlemen , and recognize its power ! The idea of Slavery must be carried out to its logical consequence , so our masters now meditate two series of Measures , both necessary to the development of Slavery as a Principle . ( I. ) African Slavery is to be declared a Federal Institution , national and sectional , and so extended into all the Territories of the United States . New soil is to be bought or plundered from Hayti , Spain , Mexico , South America " and the rest of mankind , " that slavery may be planted there ; that is the purpose of all the Official Filibustering of the Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quitman " Enterprises , " Kinney " Ex peditions , " Black Warrior and El Dorado " difficulties , " all point to this ; the " Ostend Conference " is a step in that direction ; Slavery is to be restored to the so called " Free States , " reestablished in all the North . That is the design of the fugitive slave bill in 1850 , and the kidnapping of northern men consequent thereon for the last five years ; of President Pierce s inaugural declarations in behalf of slavery in 1853 ; of Mr. Toombs s threat in 1854 , that " soon the master with his slaves will sit down at the foot of Bunker Hill Monument ; " of Mr. Toucey s Bill in 1855 , providing that when a kidnapper vio lates the local laws of any State , he shall be tried by the fugitive slave bill court . Then the African Slave-trade is to be restored by federal enactments , or judicial decisions of the " Supreme Court of the United States . " All these steps belong to Measure number One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its lord . Soon you will see more " decisions " adverse to humanity . /z/ ( II . ) The next movement is progressively to weaken and ulti mately to destroy the Democratic Institutions of the North , yes , also of the South . This design is indicated and sustained by some of the measures already mentioned as connected with the first pur pose . To this point tend the words of President Pierce addressed to the soldiers of 1812 on the 8th of January 1855 , in which he speaks of such as " disseminate political heresies , " that is , the Idea of Free dom ; " revile the government , " expose its hostility against the unalienable Rights of man ; " deride our institutions , " - to wit , the patriarchal institution of Slavery ; " sow political dissensions , " ad vise men not to vote for corrupt tools of the government ; " set at defiance the laws of the land , " meaning the fugitive slave bill which commands kidnapping . There belong the attempts of the Federal courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the cry , " Union first and Liberty afterwards ; " the shout " No higher law , " " Religion nothing to do with Politics . " Thence come the attacks made on the freedom of the pulpit , of the press , and all freedom of speech . The Individual State which pre serves freedom must be put down , the individual person who pro tests against it must be silenced . No man must hold a federal office , executive , diplomatic , judicial , or " ministerial , " unless he has so far conquered his " prejudices " in favor of the natural Rights of man that he is ready to enslave a brother with alacrity . All these steps belong to Measure number Two . This latter Measure advances to its execution , realizing the Idea of Slavery , with subtle steps , yet creeps on rapid-moving feet . See how it has gained ground latterly . Obviously the fugitive slave bill struck only at the natural Rights of Colored men as valuable as those of white men , but the colored are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the feebler body . But this despotism can not enslave a black girl without thereby putting in peril the liberty of every white man . At first our masters only asked of Boston a little piece of chain , but just long enough to shackle the virtuous hands of Ellen Craft , a wife and mother , whom her Georgian " owner " wished to sell as a harlot at New Orleans ! A meeting was summoned at Faneuil Hall , and Boston answered , " Yes , here is the chain . Let the woman-hunter capture Ellen Craft , make her a Prostitute at New Orleans . She is a virtuous wife and mother , but no matter . Slavery is king and commands it . Let the owner have his chain . " There is no escaping the consequence of a first Principle . Soon that little chain lengthened itself out , and coiled itself all round the /z/ court house , and how greedily your judges stooped to go under ! This Anaconda of the Dismal Swamp wound its constricting twists about the neck of all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when questioned of law , they could not pronounce " Habeas Corpus , " " Trial by Jury , " nor utter a syllable for the Bible or the Massachusetts Constitution , but only wheeze and gurgle and squeak and gibber out their defences of Slavery ! No , Boston could not bewray a woman wandering towards freedom , without chaining the court house and its judges , putting the town in a state of siege , in solent soldiers striking at the people s neck . Now the attempt is making by this Honorable Court to put the same chain round Faneuil Hall , so that the old Cradle of Liberty shall no more rock to manhood the noble sons of freedom , but only serve as a nest that the spawn of Bondage may hibernate therein . I am on trial because I hate Slavery , because I love freedom for the black man , for the white man , and for all the human Race . I am not arraigned because I have violated the statute on which the indictment is framed no child could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because my Word , my Thoughts , my Feelings , my Actions , nay , all my Life , my very Existence itself , are a protest against Slavery . Despotism can not happily advance unless I am silenced . It is very clear logic which indicts me . Private per sonal malice , deep , long cherished , rancorous , has doubtless jagged and notched and poisoned too the public sword which smites at my neck . Still it is the public sword of Slavery which is wielded against me . Against ME ? Against YOU quite as much against your chil dren . For as Boston could not venture to kidnap a negro woman , without bringing down that avalanche of consequences connected with the Principle of Slavery , without chains on her Judges , false hood in her officers , blood in her courts , and drunken soldiers in her streets , and hypocrisy in her man-hunting ministers , no more can she put me to silence alone . The thread which is to sew my lips together , will make your mouths but a silent and ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ; Freedom Defendant . Be fore you as Judges , I plead your own cause for you as defendant . I will not insult you by the belief or the fear that you can do other than right , in a matter where the law is so plain , and the Justice clear as noonday light . But should you decide as the wicked wish , as the court longs to instruct you , you doom your mouths to silence ; you bow your manly faces to the ground , destine your memories to shame , and your children to bondage worse than negro slavery . Such , Gentlemen of the Jury , is the state of affairs leading to this Prosecution such the past , present , and prospective Encroachments /z/ of a Power hostile to Democratic Institutions and the tmalienable Rights they were designed to protect . Such also are the two Meas ures now in contemplation , the Extension of African Bondage , and the Destruction of American Freedom . /z/ Here I shall show the process by which that Principle of Slavery becomes a Measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the same , Spanish or Caro linian , but the form varies to suit the ethnologic nature and histori cal customs of different people . I shall mention two forms one to illustrate , the other to warn . ( I. ) The open Assumption of Power by military violence . This method is followed in countries where love of Individual Liberty is not much developed in the consciousness of the people , and where democratic institutions are not fixed facts in their history ; where the nation is not accustomed to local self-government , but wonted to a strong central power directed by a single will . This form prevails in Russia , Turkey , and among all the Romanic tribes in Europe , and their descendants in America . Military usurpation , military rule is indigenous in France , where two Napoleons succeed thereby , in Italy , in Spain , and most eminently in Spanish America . But no people of the Teutonic family for any length of time ever tolerated a usurping soldier at the head of affairs , or submitted to martial arbirary rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against our habit and disposition . Neither Cromwell nor William of Orange could do with the AngloSaxon what it would have been impossible not to do with Spaniards or Italians . Even warlike Swiss Teutonic tribes will have a government with due process of law , not by the abrupt violence of the soldier . Washington could not have established a military mon archy in America had he been so wickedly disposed . Even William the Conqueror must rule the Saxons by Saxon law . ( II . ) The corruption of the acknowledged safeguards of public security . This is attempted in nations who have a well-known love of individual liberty , and institutional defences thereof , the habit of Local Self-government by Democratic Law-making and Law-admin istering . For example , this experiment has been repeatedly made in England . The monarch seeking to destroy the liberty of the people , /z/ accomplishes his violent measure by the forms of peaceful law , by getting the judicial class of men on the side of despotism . Then all the wickedness can be done in the name , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by regular officers thereof done solemnly with the assistance of slow and public deliberation . Gentlemen of the Jury , this is a matter of such importance to the People of America just now , that I must beg you to bear with me while I explain this subtle operation . I will select examples from the history of England which are easy to understand , because her blood is kindred to our own , and the institutions of the two countries are related as parent and child . And besides , her past history affords alike warning and guidance in our present peril . ( 1 . ) The first step in this process of political iniquity is , to appoint men for judges and other officers of the court , who know no law higher than the selfish will of the hand that feeds them , mere crea tures of the rest . I will select instances of this from the reign of the Stuart kings and one of their successors , from a period full of melancholy warning to America . I will begin with James I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At his very accession he had high notions of his royal Prerogative , and maintained that all the privileges of the House of Commons were derived from his royal grant . " I am your King , " said he , " I am placed to govern you , and I shall must answer for your errors . " It was quite enough to answer for his own , poor man . " Let me make the Judges , " said he , " and I care not who makes the laws . " Accordingly for judicial officers he appointed such men as would execute his unlawful schemes for the destruction of public liberty . To such considerations was Francis Bacon mainly indebted for his elevation from one legal rank to another , until he reached the seat of the Lord Chancellor . A man whom Villers declared , " of excellent parts , but withal of a base and ungrateful temper , and an arrant knave , yet a fit instrument for the purposes of the government . " He did not receive his appointment for that vast , hard-working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , but only for his sycophantic devotion to the royal will . Sir Edward Coke was promoted rapidly enough , whilst wholly subservient to the despotic court , but afterwards , though a miracle of legal knowledge , not equalled yet perhaps , he must not be appointed Lord Chancellor on account of " his occasional fits of independence . " Chief Justice Ley was one of the right stamp , but it was thought " his subserviency might prove more valuable by retaining him to preside over the Court /z/ of King s Bench . " " For in making the highest judicial appointments the only question was , what would suit the arbitrary schemes of gov erning the country . " l Hobart had resisted some illegal monopolies of the all-powerful Buckingham , and he was " unfit for promo tion . " James thought the Prerogative would be strengthened by the ap pointment of clergymen of the national church , perhaps the only class of men not then getting fired with love of liberty , and made Wil liams , Bishop of Lincoln , Lord Keeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper , and of selfish , temporizing , and trimming political cal conduct , " who at that time had never acted as " a judge except at the Waldegrave Petty Sessions in making an order of bastardy or allowing a rate for the Parish poor , " and was " as ignorant of the questions coming before him as the door-keepers of his court , " But he was subservient , and had pleased the King by preaching the courtly doctrine that " subjects hold their liberties and their property at the will of the Sovereign whom they are bound in every extremity pas sively to obey . " 2 Men like Fleming and other creatures of the throne , sanctioning the King s abundant claim to absolute power , were sure of judicial distinction ; while it was only the force of public opinion which gave the humblest place of honor to such able and well-studied lawyers as would respect the constitutional Rights of the People and the just construction of the laws , and at all hazards main tain their judicial independence . Ecclesiastics who taught that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " may quash any law passed by Parliament , " were sure of rapid preferment . Thus Bancroft was promoted ; thus Abbot was pushed aside ; and for his mean , tyrannical and subservient disposition Rev. William Laud was continually promoted in expectation of the services which , as Arch bishop , he subsequently performed in the overthrow of the Liberty of the People . But time would fail me to read over the long dark list of men whose personal shame secured them " official glory . " In his address to the Judges in the Star- Chamber in 1616 James gave them this charge , " If there falls out a question which concerns any Prerogative or mysterie of State , deals not with it till you consult with the King or his Council , or both ; for they are Transcendent Matters , and must not be slibberly carried with over rash wilfullnesse . " " And this I commend unto your special care , as some of you of late have done very much , to blunt the edge and vaine popular humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not eloquent and boldspirited enough , except they meddle with the King s Prerogative " " That which concerns the mysterie of the King s Power is not lawful /z/ to be disputed " l Gentlemen , that was worthy of some judicial charges which you and I have heard . Charles I. ( 1625-1659 , ) pursued the same course of tyranny by the same steps . Coventry could be implicitly relied on to do as commanded , and was made Lord Keeper in 1625 . When the ques tion of Ship-money was to be brought forward in 1636 , Chief Justice Heath was thought not fit to be trusted with wielding the instrument of tyranny , and accordingly removed ; " and Finch , well known ta be ready to go all lengths , was appointed in his place . " For he had steadfastly maintained that the King was absolute , and could dis pense with law and parliament , a fit person to be a Chief Justice , or a Lord Chancellor , in a tyrant s court , ready to enact iniquity into law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first prin ciple of Magna Charta , " endeared him to the Court , and secured him further preferment as soon as any opportunity should occur . " So he was soon made Lord Chancellor and raised to the peerage . Littleton had once been on the popular side , but deserted and went over to the Court he was sure of preferment ; and as he became more and more ready to destroy the liberties of the People , he was made Chief Justice , and finally Lord Chancellor in 1641 . Lane was a " steady friend of the prerogative , " and so was made AttorneyGeneral to the Prince of Wales , and thence gradually elevated to the highest station . Other Judicial appointments were continually made in the same spirit . Thus when Sir Randolf Crewe was Chief Justice of the King s Bench , the government questioned him to ascertain if he were " sound , " and were shocked to hear him declare that the King had no right to levy taxes without consent of Parliament , or imprison his sub jects without due process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , " ( 1626 , ) and Sir Nicolas Hyde appointed in his place . By such means the courts were filled with tools of the King or his favorites , and the pit digged for the liberties of the People , into which at last there fell the head of the King ! Charles II . and James II. , ( 1655-1686 , ) did not mend the evil , but appointed for judges " such a pack as had never before sat in West minster Hall . " Shaftesbury and Guildford had the highest judicial honors . Lord Chancellor Finch , mentioned already , had been ac cused by the Commons of High Treason and other misdemeanors , but escaped to the continent , and returned after the Restoration . He was appointed one of the Judges to try the Regicides . Thus he " who had been accused of high treason twenty years before by a full /z/ parliament , and who by flying from their justice saved his life , was appointed to judge some of those who should have been his Judges .

" /z/ In these reigns such men as Saunders , Wright , and Scroggs , were made Judges , men of the vilest character , with the meanest appetites , licentious , brutal , greedy of power and money , idiotic in the moral sense , appointed solely that they might serve as tools for the oppres sion of the People . Among these infamous men was George Jef freys , of whom Lord Campbell says , " He has been so much abused that I began my critical examination of his history in the hope and belief that I should find that his misdeeds had been exag gerated , and that I might be able to rescue his memory from some portion of the obloquy under which it labors ; but I am sorry to say that in my matured opinion his cruelty and his political profligacy have not been sufficiently exposed or reprobated ; and that he was not redeemed from his vices by one single solid virtue . " 3 But in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law , he was made a Judge , a Peer , and a Lord Chancellor ! Wright , nearly as infamous , miraculously stupid and ignorant , " a detected swindler , knighted and clothed in ermine , took his place among the twelve judges of England . " 4 He also was made Chief Justice successively of the Common Pleas and the King s Bench ! Lord Campbell , himself a judge , at the end of his history of the reign of Charles and James , complains of " the irksome task of relat ing the actions of so many men devoid of political principle and ready to suggest or to support any measures , however arbitrary or mischievous , for the purpose of procuring their own advancement . " 5 It was the practice of the Stuarts " to dismiss judges without seeking any other pretence , who showed any disposition to thwart govern ment in political prosecutions . " 6 Nor was this dismissal confined to cases where the judge would obey the law in merely Political trials . In 1686 four of the judges denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of the land and change the form of religion : the next morning they were all driven from their posts , and four others , more compliant , were appointed and the judicial " opinion was unanimous . " Hereupon Roger Coke says well , " the king . . . will make the judges in Westminster Hall to murder the common law , as well as the king and his brother desired to murder the parliament by itself ; and to this end the king , when he would make any judges would make a bargain with them , that they should declare the king s 1 Ludlow , quoted in 2 Campbell , 470. 2 4 Parl . Hist. 162. 3 3 Campbell , 394. /z/ power of dispensing with the penal laws and tests made against re cusants , out of parliament . " 1 Here , Gentlemen of the Jury , I must mention three obscure judges who received their appointments under Stuart kings . Before long I shall speak of their law and its application , and now only introduce them to you as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . The first is Sir William Jones , by far the least ignoble of the three . He was descended from one of the Barons who wrung the Great Charter from the hands of King John in 1618 , and in 1628 dwelt in the same house which sheltered the more venerable head of his Welsh ancestor . In 1628 he was made judge by Charles I. He broke down the laws of the realm to enable the king to make forced loans on his subjects , and by his special mandate ( Lettre de Cachet ) to imprison whom he would , as long as it pleased him , and without showing any reason for the commitment or the detention ! Yes , he supported the king in his attempt to shut up members of parliament for words spoken in debate in the house of commons itself ; to levy duties on imports , and a tax of ship-money on the land . He was summoned before parliament for his offences against public justice , and finally deprived of office , though ungratefully , by the king himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1655 , a London merchant who refused to pay an illegal tax levied on him by Cromwell who followed in the tyrannical footsteps of the king he slew . Twysden was thrown into the Tower for defending his client as Mr. Sloane , at Sandusky , has just been punished by the honor able court of the United States for a similar offence , but after a few days made a confession of his " error , " defending the just laws of the land , , promised to offend no more , and was set at liberty , ignominiously leaving his client to defend himself and be defeated . This Tw r ysden was made judge by Charles II . The reporters record ing his decisions put down " Twysden in furore " thinly veiling the judicial wrath in modest Latin . He was specially cruel against Quakers and other dissenters , treating George Fox , Margarett Fell , and John Bunyan with brutal violence . 3 3 . Sir John Kelyng is another obscure judge of those times . In the civil war he was a violent cavalier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roundheads under Prince Rupert , he was very unfit to 1 8 St. Tr. 195 , note . 2 Account of him in Preface to his Reports , ( 1675 ) ; 3 St. Tr. 162 , 293 , 844 , 1181 /z/ charge a jury in Westminster Hall . " In 1660 he took part in the trial of the Regicides and led in the prosecution of Colonel Hacker , who in 1649 had charge of the execution of Charles I. In 1662 he took part in the prosecution of Sir Henry Vane , and by his cruel subtlety in constructing law , that former governor of Massachusetts , one of* the most illustrious minds of England , innocent of every crime , was convicted of high treason and put to death . 1 For this service , in 1663 Kelyng was made a judge ; and then , by loyal zeal and judicial subserviency , he made up " for his want of learning and sound sense . " But he was so incompetent that even the court of Charles II . hesitated to make him more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valiant cavalier , " and had done good service already in making way with such as the king hated , and so after the death of Sir Nicolas Hyde , he was made Lord Chief Justice in his place . " In this office , " says Judge Campbell , he " exceeded public expecta tion by the violent , fantastical , and ludicrous manner in which he conducted himself . " 2 But I will not now anticipate what I have to say of him in a subsequent part of this defence . Gentlemen of the Jury , we shall meet these three together again before long , and I shall also speak of them " singly or in pairs . " In the mean time I will mention one similar appointment in the reign of George the III . the last king of New England . In 1770 Sergeant Glynn , in Parliament , moved for an inquiry into the administration of criminal justice . Edmund Thurlow , a rough venal man , then recently appointed solicitor-general , proposed that a severe censure should be passed on him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all cases of libel , so that the liberty of the people should be in the exclusive care of government attorneys and judges appointed by the crown . Hear him speak on the 6th of December , 1770 . " In my opinion no man should be allowed with impunity to make a wanton attack upon such venerable characters as the judges of the land . We award costs and dam ages to the aggrieved party in the most trifling actions . By what analogy , then , can we refuse the same justice in the most important cases , to the most important person ages ? If we allow every pitiful patriot thus to insult us with ridiculous accusations , without making him pay forfeit for his temerity , we shall be eternally pestered with the humming and buzzing of these stingless wasps . Though they can not wound or poison , they will tease and vex . They will divert our attention from the important affairs of State to their own mean antipathies , and passions , and prejudices . Did they not count upon the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by the libellers is here allowable , they would not have dared to offer so gross an outrage . I hope we shall now handle them so roughly as to make this the last of such /z/ audacious attempts . They are already ridiculous and contemptible . To crown their disgrace , let us inflict some exemplary punishment . Else none of us is safe . Virtue and honor , you see from this instance , are no safeguard from their attacks . " " The nature , the direct effect , and the remote consequences of a State libel , are so complicated and involved with various considerations of great pith and moment , that few juries can be adequate judges . So many circumstances are at once to be kept in view , so many ponderous interests are to be weighed , so many comparisons to be made , and so many judgments formed , that the mind of an ordinary man is distracted and confounded , and rendered incapable of coming to any regular conclusion . None but a judge , a man that has from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a difficult task . If we even suppose the jury sufficiently enlightened to unravel those knotty points , yet there remains an insuperable objection . In State libels , their passions are frequently so much engaged , that they may be justly con sidered as parties concerned against the crown . " " In order , therefore , to preserve the balance of our constitution , let us leave to the judges , as the most indifferent persons , the right of determining the malice or innocence of the intention " " It is not that I think the intention a matter of fact ; no , in the sense put upon it by the judges , it is a matter of law . " " Much dust has been raised about civil and criminal actions . But to what purpose ? Is not reparation to be made to the public for any injury which it may have sustained , as much as to an individual ? Is the welfare of the nation in general , of less conse quence than that of a single person ? Where then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malice or innocence of the intention ? The injury done is the only proper measure of the punishment to be inflicted , as well as of the damage to be assessed . Since you can not plead the intention as a mitigation in the latter case , neither can vou in the former . " 1 What followed ? On the 23d of July , 1771 , he was made AttorneyGeneral . His subsequent history did not disappoint the prophecy uttered above by his former conduct and his notorious character . " In truth his success was certain , with the respectable share he possessed of real talents and of valuable requirements strongly marked features , piercing eyes , bushy eyebrows , and a sonorous voice , all worked to the best effect by an immeasurable share of self-confi dence he could not fail . " 2 He hated America with the intense malignity of a low but strong and despotic nature , and " took a most zealous part and uttered very violent language against the colonists . He scorned the very notion of concession or conciliation ; he con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) the peculiar plants of the American soil . The natives of these regions he thought were born to be taxed . " 3 He favored the Stamp Act , the Coercion Bill , quartering soldiers upon us , sending Americans beyond seas for trial , the Boston Port Bill , and all the measures against the colonies . " To say that ve have a right to tax America and never exercise that right , is ridiculous , and a man must abuse his /z/ understanding very much not to allow of that right ; " " the right of taxing was never in the least given up to the Americans . " 1 On another occasion he said , that " as attorney-general he had a right to set aside every charter in America . " 2 " What followed ? Notwith standing his youthful profligacy , the open profanity of his public and private speech , and his living in public and notorious contempt of matrimony , he was made Lord Chancellor and elevated to the peerage in 1778 ! Him also we shall meet again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bale all the salt water out of the sea as to mention every glaring and notorious in stance where an oppressive government has appointed some discarder of all Higher Law for its servant in crushing the People . Come therefore to the next point . ( II . ) The next step is by means of such Judges to punish and destroy or silence men who oppose the wickedness of the party in power , and the encroachments of despotism . Let me describe the general mode of procedure , and then illustrate it by special examples . 1 . In the Privy Council , or elsewhere , it is resolved to punish the obnoxious men , and the business is intrusted to the law-officers of the crown , appointed for such functions . 2 . They consult and agree to pervert and twist the law statute or common for that purpose . By this means they gratify their master , and prepare future advancement for themselves . 3 . The precedent thus established becomes the basis for new oper ations in the future , and may be twisted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gentlemen , look at some examples taken from British his tory , in times of the same Kings mentioned before . 1 . In 1610 two Puritans for refusing the ex officio oath , were clapped in Jail by the commissioners . They were brought on habeas corpus before a court , and Mr. Fuller , their counsel , a learned lawyer , insisted that they were imprisoned without due process of law . For this " contempt of court " he was thrown into jail by Archbishop Bancroft , whence he was rescued only by death . 3 2 . In 1613 there were many murmurs among the People of Eng land at the tyranny of James . Fine and imprisonment did not quell the disturbance ; so a more dreadful example was thought needful . The officials of Government broke into the study of Rev. Edmund Peacham , a Protestant minister , sixty or seventy years old . In an /z/ uncovered cask they found a manuscript sermon , never preached , nor designed for the pulpit or the press , never shown to any one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was arrested , and thrown into Jail , all his papers seized . The Government resolved to prosecute him for high treason . Francis Bacon , the powerful and corrupt Attorney-General , managed the prosecution . Before trial was ventured upon , he procured an extrajudicial opinion of the Judges appointed for such services , irregu larly given , out of court , that they would declare such an act high treason . But a manuscript sermon , neither preached nor designed for the public , was hardly evidence enough of treason even for such Judges so purchased , for such an Attorney so greedy of preferment , with such a Cabinet and such a King . For all those , like the Pharisees of old , " feared the People . " So their victim was tortured on the rack , and twelve leading questions prepared by the Government officials , were put to him there . I quote Secretary Winwood s record still extant in his own handwriting " He was this day examined be fore torture , in torture , between torture , and after torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still persisting in his obstinate and insensible denials and former answers . " Bacon was present at the torture , which took place in the Tower , Jan. 19 , 1614 , O. S. ( 30th Jan. 1615 , N. S. ) . In August he was tried for high treason " compassing and imagining the King s death " before a packed jury ; against law , and without legal evidence . He was of course found guilty under the ruling of the Court ! But public opinion , even then making tyrants " tremble in their capitals , " was so indignant at the outrage that the execution was not ventured on , and he was left to languish in Jail , till on the 27th of March , 1616 , a King more merciful took the old minister where the wicked cease from troubling . 1 In this case , Gentlemen of the Jury , you will notice three violations of the law . ( 1 . ) The opinion of the Judges before the trial was extrajudicial and illegal . ( 2 . ) The application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The statute of Treason was wrested to apply to this case and a crime was constructed by the servants of the court . It is curious to read the opinion of James himself . " The British Solomon " thus wrote : " So the only thing the Judges can doubt of is of the delinquent s intention , on his bare denial to clear him himself , since nature teaches every man to defend his life as he may ; and whether incase there was a doubt herein , the Judges should not rather incline to that side namely , the side of the Government , wherein all proba- 12 St. Tr. 869 ; 16 Montagu s Bacon , clxvL ; 2 Campbell , 291. /z/ bilitylies : but if Judges will needs trust rather the bare negative of an infamous de linquent then all the probabilities , or rather infallible consequences upon the othtfr part , caring more for the safety of such a monster than the preservation of a crown in all ages following , whereupon depend the lives of many millions , happy then are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown is more than miserable . Which God forefend. " l 3 . Iii 1633 , Laud , a tyrannical , ambitious man , and a servile creature of the King , mentioned before , was made Archbishop of Canterbury , continuing Bishop of London at the same time . Charles I. was strongly inclined to Romanism , Laud also leaned that way , aiming to corne as near as possible to the Papal and not be shut out of the English Church . He made some new regulations in regard to the Communion Table and the Lord s Supper . John Williams , before mentioned , Dean of " Westminster and Bishop of Lincoln , who had been Lord Keeper under King James , wrote a book against those innovations ; besides , in his episcopal court he had once spoken of the Puritans as " good subjects , " and of his knowing " that the King did not wish them to be harshly dealt with . " In 1637 Laud directed that he should be prosecuted in the Star- Chamber for " publishing false news and tales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for revealing counsels of State contrary to his oath of a Privy Counsellor . " He was sentenced to pay a fine of 10,000 , equal to $50,000 , or thrice the sum in these times ; to be suspended from all offices , and kept a close prisoner in the Tower during the King s pleasure whence the Revolution set him at liberty . Besides he wrote private letters to Mr. Osbalderston , and called Laud " the little great man , " for this he , in 1639 , was fined 5,000 to the King , and 3,000 to the Archbishop . Osbalderston in his letters had spoken of the " great Leviathan " and the " little Urchin , " and was fined 5,000 , to the King , and the same to the Archbishop , and sentenced also to stand in the pillory with his ears nailed to it ! 2 4 . In 1629 Richard Chambers , a merchant of London , complained to the Privy Council of some illegal and unjust treatment , and de clared " that the merchants in no part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that in Turkey they have more encourage ment . " Laud , who hated freedom of speech and liberal comments on the government as much as " eminent citizens " nowadays , is said to have told the king , " If your majesty had many such Cham bers , you would soon have no Chamber left to rest in . " The merchant was tried before the " commissioners " at the Star-Chamber , and fined 2,000 , and condemned to make a " submission for his great offence , " 3 which the stout Puritan refused to do , and was kept in /z/ prison till the Court of King s Bench , faithful to the law , on Habeas Corpus , admitted him to bail : for which they were reprimanded . Laud and all the ecclesiastical members of the " commission " wished his fine 3,000. 5 . In his place in Parliament in 1629 , Sir John Eliot , one of the noblest men in England s noblest age , declared that " the Council and Judges had all conspired to trample underfoot the liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as notorious as the advance of the Slave Power now is in America . But a few days after the king ( Charles I. ) had dismissed his refractory Parliament , Eliot , with Hollis , Long , Selden , Strode , and Valentine , most eminent members of the commons , and zealous for liberty and law , was seized by the king s command and thrown into prison . The Habeas Corpus was de manded it was all in vain , for Laud and StrafTord were at the head of affairs , and the priests and pliant Judges in Westminster HallJones was one of them clove down the law of the land just as their subcatenated successors did in Boston in 1851 . The court de creed that they should be imprisoned during the king s pleasure , and not released until making submission and giving security for good behavior . Eliot was fined X2,000 , Hollis and Valentine in smaller sums . Eliot the brave man refused submission , and died in the Tower . Thus was the attack made on all freedom of speech in Par liament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first settlement of Boston , on the 4th of June , Rev. Dr. Alexander Leighton was brought before the Court of High Commission , in the Star-Chamber , to be tried for a seditious libel . He had published " An Appeal to the Parliament , or a Plea against Prelacy , " a work still well known , remonstrating against certain notorious grievances in church and State , " to the end the Parliament might take them into consideration and give such redress as might be for the honor of the king , the quiet of the people , and the peace of the church , " the court of commissions accounted it " a most odious and heinous offence , deserving the most serious pun ishment the court could inflict , for framing a book so full of such pestilent , devilish , and dangerous assertions . " The two Chief Justices declared if the case had been brought to their courts , they would have proceeded against him for Treason , and it was only " his majesty s exceeding great mercy and goodness " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10,000 , to be set in the pillory , whipped , have one ear cut off , one side of his nose slit , one cheek branded with S.

Before the punishment could be inflicted he escaped out of prison , but was recaptured and the odious sentence fully executed . Those who " obstructed " the officer in the execution of that " process " were fined .500 a piece . 1 Gentlemen of the Jury , which do you think would most have aston ished the Founders of Massachusetts , then drawing near to Boston , that trial on the 4th of June , 1630 , or this trial , two hundred and twenty-five years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor to mutilate the body of a Puritan minister . But not only did such judges thus punish the most noble men who wrote on political matters , there was no freedom of speech allowed so logical is despotism ! 7 . William Prynn , a zealous Puritan and a very learned lawyer , wrote a folio against theatres called " a Scourge for Stage-Players , " dull , learned , unreadable and uncommon thick . He was brought to the Star-Chamber in 1632-3 , and Chief Justice Richardson who had even then " but an indifferent reputation for honesty and veracity " gave this sentence : " Mr. Prynn , I do declare you to be a Schism-Maker in the Church , a Sedition-Sower in the Common wealth , a wolf in sheep s clothing ; in a word omnium malorum nequissimus - - the wickedest of all scoundrels . I shall fine him 10,000 , which is more than he is worth , yet less than he deserveth ; I will not set him at liberty , no more than a plagued man or a mad dog , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is so far from being a sociable soul that he is not a rational soul ; he is fit to live in dens with such beasts of prey as wolves and tygers like himself ; therefore I do condemn him to perpetual Imprisonment , as those monsters that are no longer fit to live among men nor to see light. * " I would have him branded in the forehead , slit in the nose , and his ears cropped too . " The sentence was executed the 7th and 10th of May , 1633. 2 But nothing intimidated , the sturdy man committed other offences of like nature , " obstructing " other " officers , " and was punished again , and banished . But on the summoning of Parlia ment returned to England , and became powerful in that Revolution which crushed the tyrants of the time . 8 . In 1685 , James II . was in reality a Catholic . He wished to restore Romanism to England and abolish the work of the Reforma tion , the better to establish the despotism which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to punish such as spoke against the Papal Church , though no law prohibited such speaking .

The pious and venerable Richard Baxter was selected for the victim . Let Mr. Macaulay tell the story .

That men , who , for not using the Prayerbook , had been driven from their homes , stripped of their property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter a murmur , was then thought a high crime against the State and Church . Roger Lestrangc , the champion of the government , and the oracle of the clergy , sounded the note of war in the Observator . An information was filed . Baxter begged that he might be allowed some time to prepare for his de fence . It was on the day on which Gates was pilloried in Palace Yard that the illus trious chief of the Puritans , oppressed by age and infirmities , came to Westminster Hall to make this request . Jeffreys burst into a storm of rage . Not a minute , he cried , to save his life . I can deal witfi saints as well as with sinners . There stands Gates on one side of the pillory ; and if Baxter stood on the other , the two greatest rogues in the kingdom , would stand together .

This is an old rogue , a schismatical knave , a hypocritical villain . He hates the Liturgy . He would have nothing but longwinded cant without book ; and then his lordship turned up his eyes , clasped his hands , and began to sing through his nose in imitation of what he supposed to be Baxter s style of praying , Lord , we are thy people , thy peculiar people , thy dear people . Pollexfen gently reminded the court that his late majesty had thought Baxter deserving of a bishopric . And what ailed the old blockhead then , cried Jeffreys , that he did not take it ?

The advocate made another attempt to ob tain a hearing , but to no purpose . If you do not know your duty , said Jeffreys , I will teach it you . " Wallop sat down , and Baxter himself attempted to put in a word ; but the chief justice drowned all expostulation in a torrent of ribaldry and invective , mingled with scraps of Hudibras . My lord , said the old man , I have been much blamed by Dissenters for speaking respectfully of bishops . " Baxter for bishops ! cried the judge ; that s a merry conceit indeed . I know what you mean by bishops rascals like yourself , Kidderminster bishops , factious , snivelling Presbyterians !

But , by the grace of God Almighty , I will crush you all ! /z/ " Baxter held his peace . But one of the junior counsel for the defence made a last effort , and undertook to show that the words of which complaint was made , would not bear the construction put on them by the information . With this view he began to read the context . In a moment he was roared down . You sha n t turn the court into a conventicle !

Jeffreys , it is said , wished him also to be whipped at the tail of a cart . 2 But the King remitted his fine . Throughout the reign of James II . the courts of law became more and more contemptible in the eyes of the people . " All the three common law courts were filled by incompetent and corrupt Judges . " 5 But their power to do evil never diminished . 9 . James II . wished to restore the Catholic form of religion , rightly looking on Protestantism as hostile to his intended tyranny ; so he claimed a right to dispense with the laws relating thereto , put a Jesuit into his Privy Council , expelled Protestants from their offices , and filled the vacancy thus illegally made with Papists ; he appointed Catholic bishops . 4 In 1688 he published a proclamation . It was the second of the kind , dispensing with ail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be read on two specified Sun days during the hours of service in all places of public worship . This measure seemed to be a special insult to the Protestants . The declaration of indulgence was against their conscience , and in viola tion of the undisputed laws of the land , but Chief Justice Wright declared from the bench his opinion that it was " legal and obliga tory , " and on the day appointed for reading the decree attended church " to give weight to the solemnity , " and as it was not read for the clerk " had forgot to bring a copy , " he " indecently in the hearing of the congregation abused the priest , as disloyal , seditious , and irreligious . " But the clergy thought differently from the Chief Justice Episco palians and Dissenters agreeing on this point . Seven bishops peti tioned the King that they might not be obliged to violate their con science , the articles of their religion , and the laws of the realm , by reading the declaration . They presented their petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with insolence and wrath . " The king , says Kennet , was not contented to have this declaration published in the usual manner , but he was resolved to have it solemnly read in all churches as the l 1 Macaulay , ( Harper s Ed. ) 456-8. - i Macanlay , 456 ; 11 St. Tr. 493. /z/ political gospel of his reign . The bishops and clergy were , of all others the most averse to the subject-matter of the declaration , as being most sensible of the ill design and ill effects of it ; and therefore the court seemed the more willing to mortify these their enemies , and make them become accessory to their own ruin ; and even to eat their own dung , as father Petre proudly threatened , and therefore this order of coun cil was made and published .

So that I lay down that , in the first place , the government ought not to be impeached by argument , nor the exercise of the government shaken by argument ment ; because I can manage a proposition , in itself doubtful , with a better pen than another man ; this , say I , is a libel . " Then I lay down this for my next position , that no private man can take upon him to write concerning the government at all ; for what has any private man to do with the government , if his interest be not stirred or shaken ? It is the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is the business of subjects to mind only their own properties and interests .

If the govern ment does come to shake my particular interest , the law is open for me , and I may redress myself by law ; and when I intrude myself into other men s business that does not concern my particular interest , I am a libeller . " These I have laid down for plain propositions ; now , then , let us consider further , whether , if I will take upon me to contradict the government , any specious pretence that I shall put upon it , shall dress it up in another form and give it a better denomi nation ?

Truly , in my opinion , I do not think he should , or ought ; for by this rule may every act of the government be shaken , when there is not a parliament de facto sitting . " When the house of lords and commons are in being , it is a proper way of applying to the king ; there is all the openness in the world for those that are members of parlia ment , to make what addresses they please to the government , for the rectifying , alter ing , regulating , and making of what law they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpose his advice , I think there can never be an end of advising the /z/ " We are not to measure things from any truth they have in themselves , Init from that aspect they have upon the government ; for there may lie every tittle of a libel true , and yet it may be a libel still ; so that I put no great stress upon that objection , that the matter of it is not false ; and for sedition , it is that which every libel carries in itself : and as every trespass implies vi and annis , so every libel against the government carries in it sedition , and all the other epithets that are in the information . This is my opin ion as to law in general . I will not debate the prerogatives of the king , nor the privi leges of the subject ; but as this fact is , I think these venerable bishops did meddle with that which did not belong to them ; they took upon them , in a petitionary , to con tradict the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , or singular body , may do .

No man is all o wed to accuse even the most inferior magistrate of any misbehavior in his office , unless it be in a legal course , though the fact is true . No man may say of a justice of the peace , to his face , that he is unjust in his office . No man may tell a judge , either by word or petition , you have given an unjust , or an ill judgment , and I will not obey it ; it is against the rules and law of the kingdom , or the like .

" 2 Hearken to the law of Solicitor- General Williams : " If any person have slandered the government in writing , you are not to examine the truth of that fact in such writing , but the slander which it imports to the king or gov ernment ; and le it never so true , yet if slanderous to the king or the government , it is a libel and to be punished : in that case , the right or wrong is not to be examined , or if what , was done by the government be legal , or no ; but whether the party have done such an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I keep to that ) , to issue forth proclamations to his subjects , and to make orders and constitutions in matters ecclesiastical , if he do issue forth his proclamation , and make an order upon the matters within his power and prerogative ; and if any one would come and bring that power in question otherwise than in parliament , that the matter of that proclamation be not legal , I say that is sedi tion , and you are not to examine the legality or illegality of the order or proclamation , but the slander and reflection upon the government . " " If a person do a thing that is libellous , you shall not examine the fact , but the con sequence of it ; whether it tended to stir up sedition against the public , or to stir up strife between man and man , in the case of private persons ; as if a man should say of a judge , he has taken a bribe , and I will prove it . u They tell the king it is inconsistent with their honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have them to do .

They were presently thrust from their offices . Gentlemen of the Jury , the Stuarts soon filled up the measure of their time as of their iniquity , and were hustled from the throne of England . But , alas , I shall presently remind you of some examples of this tyranny in New England itself . Now I shall cite a few simi lar cases of oppression which happened in the reign of the last King of New England . I just now spoke of Edmund Thurlow , showing what his character was and by what means he gained his various offices , ministerial and judicial . I will next show you one instance more of the evil which comes from putting in office such men as are nothing but steps whereon despotism mounts up to its bad eminence . 10 . On the 8th of June , 1775 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Curtis s charge to the graYid-jury , John Home , better known by his subsequent name John Home Tooke , formerly a clergyman but then a scholarly man devoting himself to letters and politics published the following notice in the Morning- Chronicle and London Advertiser , as well as other newspapers : " King s- Arms Tavern , Cornhill , June 7 , 1775 . At a special meeting this day of several members of the Constitutional Society , during an adjournment , a gentleman proposed that a subscription should be immediately entered into by such of the mem bers present who might approve the purpose , for raising the sum of 100 , to be ap plied to the relief of the widows , orphans , and aged parents of our beloved American fellow-subjects , who , faithful to the character of Englishmen , preferring death to slavery , were for that reason only inhumanly murdered by the king s troops at or near Lexington and Concord , in the province of Massachusetts , on the 19th of last April ; which sum being immediately collected , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of Mess . Brownes and Collinson , on account of Dr. Franklin , the saidsum of 100Z. and that Dr. Franklin be requested to apply the same to the above-mentioned purpose . " /z/ At that time Thurlow , whom I introduced to you a little while ago , was Attorney-General , looking for further promotion from the Tory Government of Lord North . Mansfield was Chief Justice , a man of great ability , who has done so much to reform the English law , but whose hostility to America was only surpassed by the hatred which he bore to all freedom of speech and the rights of the Jury . The Government was eager to crush the liberty of the Ameri can Colonies . But this was a difficult matter , for in England itself / o there was a powerful party friendly to America , who took our side in the struggle for liberty . The city of London , however , was hostile to us , wishing to destroy our merchants and manufacturers , who dis turbed the monopoly of that commercial metropolis . The govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose their tyranny and sympathize with America . Accordingly it was determined that Mr. Home should be brought to trial . But as public opinion , stimulated by Erskine , Camden and others , favored the rights of the Jury , it seems to have been thought dangerous to trust the case to a Grand-Jury . Perhaps the Judge had no brother-in-law to put on it , or the Attorney-General though famous also for his profanity. doubted that any swearing of his would insure a bill ; nay , perhaps he did not venture to " bet ten dollars that I will get an indictment against him . " Be that as it may , the Attorney-General dispensed with the services of the Grand-Jury and filed an information ex offi-cio against Mr. Home , therein styling him a " wicked , malicious , sedi tious , and ill-disposed person ; " charging him , by that advertisement , with " wickedly , maliciously , and seditiously intending , designing , and venturing to stir up and excite discontents and sedition ; " " to cause it to be believed that divers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhumanly murdered by ... his Majes ty s troops ; and unlawfully and wickedly to encourage his Majesty s subjects in the said Province of Massachusetts to resist and oppose his Majesty s Government . " He said the advertisement was " a false , wicked , malicious , scandalous , and seditious libel ; " " full of rib aldry , Billingsgate , scurrility , balderdash , and impudence ; " " wicked is a term too high for this advertisement ; " " its impudence disarmed its wickedness . " In short , Mr. Home was accused of " resisting an officer , " obstructing the execution of the " process " whereby the American Provinces were to be made the slave colonies of a metro politan despotism . The usual charge of doing all this by " force and arms , " was of course thrown in . The publication of the adver tisement was declared a " crime of such heinousness and of such a size as fairly called for the highest resentment which any court of justice has thought proper to use with respect to crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is impossible by any artifice to aggra- /z/ vate it ; " " It will be totally impossible for the imagination of any man , however shrewd , to state a libel more scandalous and base in the fact imputed , more malignant and hostile to the country in which the libeller is bom , more dangerous in the example if it were suffered to pass unpunished , than this : " " It is in language addressed to the lowest and most miserable mortals , ... it is addressed to the lowest of the mob , and the bulk of the people , who it is fit should be otherwise taught , who it is fit should be otherwise governed in this country . " Mr. Home was brought to trial on the 4th of July , 1777 . He de fended himself , but though a vigorous writer , he was not a good speaker , and was in a strange place , while " Thurlow fought on his own dunghill , " says Lord Campbell , " and throughout the whole day had the advantage over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose by the hireling sheriff , a " London jury " famous for corrup tion , a tyrannical and powerful judge , ready to turn every weapon of the court against the defendant and to construct law against the liberty of speech . Of course Mr. Home was convicted . But how should he be punished ? Thurlow determined . " My Lords , the punishments to be inflicted upon misdemeanors of this sort , have usually been of three different kinds ; fine , corporal punishment by imprisonment , and infamy by the judgment of the pillory . With regard to the fine , it is impossible for justice to make this sort of punishment , however the infamy will always fall upon the offender ; because it is well known , that men who have more wealth , who have better and more respectful situations and reputations to be watchful over , employ men in des perate situations both of circumstances and characters , in order to do that which serves their party purposes ; and when the punishment comes to be inflicted , this court must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed , that is , of the man convicted , with regard to the punishment . " With regard to imprisonment , that is a species of punishment not to be considered alike in all cases , but . . . , that it would be proper for the judgment of the court to state circumstances which will make the imprisonment fall lighter or heavier , . . . that would be proper , if I had not been spared all trouble upon that account , by hear ing it solemnly avowed ... by the defendant himself , that imprisonment was no kind of inconvenience to him ; for that certain employments , . . . would occasion his con finement in so close a way , that it was mere matter of circumstance whether it hap pened in one place or another ; and that the longest imprisonment which this court could inflict for punishment , was not beyond the reach of accommodation which those occasions rendered necessary to him . In this respect , therefore , imprisonment is not only , . . . not an adequate punishment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . that it will be no punishment . " I stated in the third place to your Lordships , the pillory to have been the usual punish ment for this species of offence . I apprehend it to have been so , in this case , for above two hundred years before the time when prosecutions grew rank in the Star-Cham ber .... the punishment of the pillory was inflicted , not only during the time that such prosecutions were rank in the Star-Chamber , but it also continued to be inflicted upon this sort of crime , and that by the best authority , after the time of the abolishing the Star-Chamber , after the time of the Revolution , and while my Lord Chief Justice Holt sat in this court . /z/ " I " would desire no better , no more pointed , nor any more applicable argument than what that great chief justice used , when it was contended before him that an abuse upon government , upon the administration of several parts of government , amounted to nothing , because there was no abuse upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they amounted to much more ; they are an abuse upon all men . Government can not exist , if the law can not restrain that sort of abuse . Government can not exist , unless ... the full punishment is inflicted which the most approved times have given to offences of much less denomination than these , of much less . I am sure it can not be shown , that in any one of the cases that were punished in that manner , the aggravations of any one of those offences were any degree adequate to those which are presented to your Lordship now . If offences were so punished then , which are not so punished now , they lose that expiation which the wisdom of those ages thought proper to hold out to the public , as a restraint from such offences being committed again . " I am to judge of crimes in order to the prosecution ; your lordship is to judge of them ultimately for punishment . I should have been extremely sorry , if I had been in duced by any consideration whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was ( of the magnitude which this was when I first stated it ) into a court of justice , if I had not had it in my contemplation also that it would meet with an adequate restraint , which I never thought would be done without affixing to it the judgment of the rillory ; I should have been very sorry to have brought this man here , after all the aggravations that he has superinduced upon the offence itself , if I had not been per suaded that those aggravations would have induced the judgment of the pillory ! l But Mansfield thought otherwise , and punished him with a fine of &lt;200 and imprisonment for twelve months . 2 " Thus , " says Lord Brougham , " a bold and just denunciation of the attacks made upon our American Brethren , which nowadays would rank among the very mildest and tamest effusions of the periodical press , condemned him to prison for twelve months . " 3 Thurlow was a man of low intellect , of a fierce countenance , a saucy , swaggering , insolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indecent age , ostentatiously living in public concubinage , a notorious swearer in public and private . But he knew no law above the will of the hand that fed and could advance him , no justice which might check the insolence of power . And in less than a month after Mr. Home was sent to jail , Thurlow was made Lord Chancellor of England , and sat on the woolsack in the House of Lords . His chief panegyrist can only say , " in worse times there have been worse chancellors . " " But an age of comparative freedom and refinement has rarely exhibited one who so ill under stood , or at least so ill discharged , the functions of a statesman and legislator . " I will enrich this part of my argument with an example of the opinions of this Judge , which would endear him to the present ad- /z/ ministration in America , and entitle him to a high place among southern politicians . In 1788 a bill was brought into Parliament to mitigate the horrors of the African slave-trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : - " It appears that the French have offered premiums to encourage the African slave trade , and that they have succeeded . The natural presumption therefore is , that we ought to do the same . For my part , my Lords , I have no scruple to say that if the five days fit of philanthropy the attempt to abolish the slave-trade which has just sprung up , and which has slept for twenty years together , were allowed to sleep one summer longer , it would appear to me rather more wise than thus to take up a subject piece meal , which it has been publicly declared ought not to be agitated at all 111 next ses sion of Parliament . Perhaps , by such imprudence , the slaves themselves may be prompted by their own authority , to proceed at once to a total and immediate abolition of the trade . One witness has come to your Lordship s bar with a face of woe his eyes full of tears , and his countenance fraught with horror , and said , My Lords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have risked 30,000 on the trade this year ! It is all 1 hace been able to gain by my industry , and if I lose it 1 must go to the hospital ! I de sire of you to think of such things , my Lords , in your humane phrensy , and to show some humanity to the whites as well as to the negroes " * One measure of tyranny in the hands of such Judges is Construc tive Crime , a crime which the revengeful , or the purchased judge dis tils out of an honest or a doubtful deed , in the alembic he has made out of the law broken up ? nd recast by him for that purpose , twisted , drawn out , and coiled up in serpentine and labyrinthine folds .

" Here is an example . In 1668 some London apprentices com mitted a riot by pulling down some houses of ill-fame in Moorfields , which had become a nuisance to the neighborhood ; they shouted " Down with Bawdy Houses . " Judge Kelyng had them indicted for High Treason . He said it was " an accroachment of royal author ity . " It was " levying war . " He thus laid down the law . " The prisoners are indicted for levying war against the King . By levying /z/ war is not only meant when a body is gathered together as an army , but if a company of people will g-o about any public reformation , this is high treason . These people do pretend their design was against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down brothels , with a cap tain an apprentice walked about with a green apron on a pole " and an ensign and weapons , if this thing be endured , who is safe ? It is high treason because it doth betray the peace of the nation , and every subject is as much wronged as the King ; for if every man may reform what he will , no man is safe ; therefore the thing is of desper ate consequence , and we must make this for a public example . There is reason why we should be very cautious ; we are but recently delivered from rebellion Charles I. had been executed nineteen years before , and his son had been in peaceable possession of the throne for eight years , and we know that that rebellion first began under the pretence of religion and the law ; for the Devil hath always this viz ard upon it . We have great reason to be very wary that we fall not again into the same error . Apprentices for the future shall not go on in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messenger walked about Moorfields with a green apron on the top of a pole this was the " ensign " . What was done by one , was done by all ; in high treason all concerned are principals . " l Thereupon thirteen apprentices who had been concerned in a riot were found guilty of high treason , sentenced , and four hanged . All of the eleven Judges Twysden was one of them concurred in the sen tence , except Sir Matthew Hale . He declared there was no treason committed ; there was " but an unruly company of apprentices . " 2 This same Judge Kelyng , singularly thick-headed and ridiculous , loved to construct crimes where the law made none . Thus he de clares , " in cases of high treason , if any one do any thing by which he showeth his liking and approbation to the Traitorous Design , this is in him High Treason . For all are Principals in High Treason , who contribute towards it by Action or Approbation . " 3 He held it was an overt act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this , " The execution of Judgment and Justice is as well the people s as the magistrates duty , and if the magistrates pervert Judgment , the people are bound by the law of God to execute judgment without them and upon them . " 4 So the printer of the book , containing the " treasonable proposition , " was executed . A man , by name Axtell , who commanded th e guards which attended at the trial and execu tion of Charles L , was brought to trial for treason . He contended 1 1 Campbell s Justices , 404-5 ; Kelyng s Reports , 70. 2 G St. Tr. 879 , note 911. /z/ that he acted as a soldier by the command of his superior officer , whom he must obey , or die . But it was resolved that " that was no excuse , for his superior was a Traitor and all that joined with him in that act were Traitors , and did by that approve the Treason , and when the command is Traitorous , then the Obedience to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . The same rule of course smote at the head of any private soldier who served in the ranks ! 1 These wicked constructions of treason by the court , out of small offences or honest actions , continued until Mr. Erskine attacked them with his Justice , and with his eloquence exposed them to the indigna tion of mankind , and so shamed the courts into humanity and com mon sense . 2 Yet still the same weapon lies hid under the Judicial bench as well of England as of America , whence any malignant or purchased Judge , when it suits his personal whim or public ambition , may draw it forth , and smite at the fortune , the reputation , or the life of any innocent man he has a private grudge against , but dares not meet in open day . Of this , Gentlemen of the Jury , in due time . The mass of men , busy with their honest work , are not aware what power is left in the hands of judges wholly irresponsible to the people ; few men know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to administer . Let me take but a single form of this judicial iniquity the Use of Torture , borrowing my examples from the history of our mother country . In England the use of torture has never been conformable either to common or to statute lav ; but how often has it been practised by a corrupt administration and wicked judges ! In 1549 Lord Sey mour of Sudley , Admiral of England , was put to the torture ; 3 in 1604 Guy Fawkes was " horribly racked . " 4 Peacham w r as repeatedly put to torture as you have just now heard , and that in the presence of Lord Bacon himself in 1614. 5 Peacock was racked in 1620 , Bacon and Coke both signing the warrant for this illegal wickedness , " he deserveth it as well as Peacham did , " said the Lord Chancellor , mak ing his own " ungodly custom " stand for law . 6 In 1627 the Lord Deputy of Ireland wanted to torture two priests , and Charles I. gave him license , the privy council consenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests if he saw fit , and hang them if he found rea son ! " 7 In 1628 the judges of England solemnly decided that torture /z/ was unlawful ; but it had always been so , and Yelverton , one of the judges , was a member of the commission which stretched Peacharn on the rack . 1 Yet , spite of this decision , torture still held its old place , and a warrant from the year 1640 still exists for inflicting this illegal atrocity on a victim of the court . 2 Yet even so late as 1804 , when Thomas Pictou , governor of Trinidad , put a woman to tortures of the most cruel character , by the connivance of the court he entirely escaped from all judicial punishment . 3 Yes , torture was long con tinued in England itself , though not always by means of thumb screws and Scottish boots and Spanish racks ; the monstrous chains , the damp cells , the perpetual irritation which corrupt servants of a despotic court tormented their victims withal , was the old demon under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers furnish us with examples of Americans being put to the torture of the lash to force a confession of their alleged crime and this has been done by the power which this court has long been so zealous to support the Slave Power of America . It has been well said : " It must be owned that the Guards and Fences of the law have not always proved an effectual security for the subject . The Reader will . . . find many Instances wherein they who hold the sword of Justice did not employ it as they ought to in punishment of Evil-Doers , but to the Oppression and Destruction of Men more righteous than themselves . Indeed it is scarce possible to frame a Body of Laws which a tyrannical Prince , influenced by wicked Counsellors and corrupt Judges , may not be able to break through . . . . The Law itself is a dead letter . Judges are the interpreters of it , and if they prove men of no Conscience nor Integrity , they will give what sense they will to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are supported by superior authority , will for a while prevail , till by repeated iniquities they grow intoler able and throw the State into convulsions which may at last end in their own ruin . This shows how valuable a Blessing is an upright and learned Judge , and of what great concern it is to the public that none be preferred to that office but such whose Ability and Integrity may be safely depended on . " 5 Thus , Gentlemen of the Jury , is it that judges who know no law but the will of " the hand that feeds them , " appointed for services rendered to the enemies of mankind and looking for yet higher rewards , have sought to establish the despotism of their masters on the ruin of the People . But the destruction of obnoxious individuals is not the whole of their enormity ; so I come to the next part of the subject . 1 3 St. Tr. 371 . See 30 St. Tr. 892. 2 1 Jardine , 20 . See Emlyn , Preface to St. Tr. in 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 See case of Huggins in 17 St. Tr. 297 , 309. /z/ ( III . ) The next step is for such judges to interpret , wrest , and pervert the laws so as to prepare for prospective Acts of Tyranny . Here , Gentlemen of the Jury , I shall have only too many examples to warn you with . Early in his reign James I. sought to lay burthensome taxes on the people without any act of Parliament ; this practice was continued by his successors . 1 . In 1600 came " the great Case of Impositions , " not mentioned in the ordinary histories of England . The king assumed the right to tax the nation by his own prerogative . He ordered a duty of five shillings on every hundred pounds of currants imported into the king dom to be levied in addition to the regular duty affixed by Act of Parliament . This was contrary to law , nay , to the Constitution of England , her Magna Charta itself provided against unparliamentary taxation . Sir John Bates , a London merchant , refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information in the Star-Cham ber . " The courts of justice , " says Mr. Hallam , " did not consist of men conscientiously impartial between the king and the subject ; some corrupt with hopes of promotion , many more fearful of removal , or awe-struck by the fear of power . " On the " trial " it was abun dantly shown that the king had no right to levy such a duty . " The accomplished but too pliant judges , and those indefatigable hunters of precedents for violations of constitutional government , the great law-officers of the crown , " decided against the laws , and Chief Justice Fleming maintained that the king might lay what tax he pleased on imported goods ! The corrupt decision settled the law for years and gave the king absolute power over this branch of the revenue , involving a complete destruction of the liberty of the people , for the Principle would carry a thousand measures on its back . 1 The king declared Fleming a judge to his " heart s content . " Bacon s subserviency did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great seal , imposing heavy duties on almost all mer chandise " to be for ever hereafter paid to the king and his suc cessors , on pain of his displeasure . " 2 Thus the Measure became a Principle . 2 . James , wanting funds , demanded of his subjects forced contribu tions of money , strangely called " Benevolences , " though there was no " good-vill " on either side . It was clearly against the fundamental laws of the kingdom . Sir Oliver St. John refused to /z/ pay what was demanded of him , and wrote a letter to the mayor of Marlborough against the illegal exaction . For this he was prose cuted in the Star- Chamber in 1615 by Attorney- General Bacon . The court , with Lord Chancellor Ellesmere at its head , of course decided that the king had a right to levy Benevolences at pleasure . St. John was fined five thousand pounds , and punished by imprison ment during the king s pleasure . This decision gave the king abso lute power over all property in the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With such a court the king might well say , " Wheare any controversyes arise , my Lordes the Judges chosene betwixte me and my people shall discide and mile me. " 2 3 . Charles I. proceeded in the steps of his father : he levied forced loans . Thomas Darnel and others refused to pay , and were put in prison on a General Warrant from the king which did not specify the cause of commitment . They brought their writs of habeas corpus , contending that their confinement was illegal . The matter came to trial in 1627 . Sir Randolf Crewe , a man too just to be trusted to do the iniquity desired , was thrust out of office , and Sir Nicolas Hyde appointed chief justice in his place . The actual question was , Has the king a right to imprison any subject forever without process of law ? It was abundantly shown that he had no such right . But the new chief justice , put in power to oppress the people , remembering the hand that fed him , thus decreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it , and we trust him in great matters , and he is bound by law , and he bids us proceed by law ; . . . and we make no doubt but the king , if you look to him , he knowing the cause why you are imprisoned , he will have mercy ; but that we believe that . . . he can not deliver you , but you must be remanded " . Thus the judges gave the king absolute power over the liberties of any subject . 3 But the matter was brought up in Parliament and discussed by men of a different temper , who frightened the judge by threats of im peachment , and forced the king to agree to the PETITION OF RIGHT designed to put an end to all such illegal cruelty . Before Charles I. would sign that famous bill , he asked Judge Hyde if it would restrain the king " from committing or restraining a subject without showing cause " The crafty judge answered , " Every laiv , after it is made , hath Us exposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to deter mine ; and although the Petition be granted there is no fear of such a conclusion as is intimated in the question ! " That is , the court will interpret the plain law so as to oppress the subject and please the /z/ king ! As the judges had promised to annul the law , the king signed it . 1 Charles dissolved Parliament and threw into jail its most noble and powerful members one of whom , Eliot , never left the prison till death set him free . 2 The same chief justice gave an extrajudicial opinion justifying the illegal seizure of the members , " that a parlia ment man committing an offence against the King in Parliament not in a parliamentary course , may be punished after the Parliament is ended ; " " that by false slanders to bring the Lords of the Council and the Judges , not in a parliamentary way , into the hatred of the people and the government into contempt , was punishable out of Parlia ment , in the Star- Chamber , as an offence committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a parliament man . " 3 Thus the judges struck down freedom of speech in Parliament . 4 . In 1G34 Charles I. issued a writ levying ship-money , so called , on some seaport towns , without act of Parliament . London and some towns remonstrated , but were forced to submit , all the courts being against them . Chief Justice Finch , " a servile tool of the despotic court , " generalized this unlawful tax , extending it to inland towns as well as seaboard , to all the kingdom . All landholders were to be assessed in proportion to their property , and the tax , if not voluntarily paid , collected by force . The tax was unpopular , and clearly against the fundamental law of the kingdom . But if the government could not get the law on its side it could control its interpreters , for " every law hath its exposition . " So the Judges of Assize were ordered in their circuits to tell the people to comply with the order and pay the money ! The King got an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of court , in which they unanimously declared that in time of danger the King- might levy such tax as he saw fit , and compel men to pay it . He was the sole judge of the danger , and of the amount of the tax . 4 John Hampden was taxed twenty shillings he refused to pay , though he knew well the fate of Richard Chambers a few years be fore . The case came to trial in 1637 , in the Court of Exchequer before Lord Chancellor Coventry , a base creature , mentioned before . It was " the great case of Ship-money . " The ablest lawyers in Eng land showed that the tax was contrary to Magna Charta , to the fun damental laws of the realm , to the Petition of Right and to the practice of the kingdom . Hampden was defeated . Ten out of the twelve Judges sided with the King . Croke as the eleventh had made up his mind to do the same , but his noble wife implored him not to 1 1 Campbell , Justices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 373 , 408 , et nl ; 3 St. Tr. 59. 2 See above , p. 21 ) . 3 1 Campbell s Justices , 315. 4 3 St. Tr. 825 . See the opinion of the Judges with their twelve names , 844 , and note . /z/ sacrifice his conscience for fear of danger , and the Woman , as it so often happens , saved the man . 1 Attorney-General Banks thus set forth the opinion of the Government , and the consequent " decision " of the Judges . He rested the right of levying Ship-money on the " intrinsic , absolute authority of the King . " There was no Higher Law in Old England in 1634 ! Banks said , " this power of arbitrary and irresponsible taxation is innate in the person of an absolute King , and in the persons of the Kings of England . All-magistracy it is of nature ; and obedience and subjection to it is of nature . This power is not anyways derived from the people , but reserved unto the King when positive laws first began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute monarch ; nothing can be given to an abso lute prince but what is inherent in his person . He can do no wrong . He is the sole judge and we ought not to question him , whom the law trusts we ought not to distrust . " " The Acts of Parliament con tain no express words to take away so high a prerogative ; and the King s prerogative , even in lesser matters , is always saved , where express words do not restrain it . " 2 It required six months of judicial labor to bring forth this result , which was of " infinite disservice to the crown . " Thereupon Mr. Hallam says : " Those who had trusted to the faith of the judges were undeceived by the honest repentance of some , and looked with indignation on so prostituted a crew . That respect for courts of justice which the happy structure of our Judicial administration has in general kept inviolate , was exchanged for distrust , contempt , and a desire of vengeance . They heard the speeches of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . Ship-money was held lawful by Finch and several other Judges , not on the authority of precedents which must in their nature have some bounds , but on principles subversive of every property or privilege in the subject . Those paramount rights of monarchy , to which they appealed to-day in justification of Ship-money , might to-morrow serve to supersede other laws , and maintain more exer tions of despotic power . It was manifest by the whole strain of the court lawyers that no limitations on the King s authority could exist but by the King s suffer ance . This alarming tenet , long bruited among the churchmen and courtiers , now resounded in the halls of justice . " 3 Thus by the purchased vote of a corrupt Judiciary all the laws of Parliament , all the customs of the Anglo-Saxon tribe , Magna Charta itself with its noble attendant charters , were at once swept away , and all the property of the kingdom put into the hands of the enemy of the People . These four decisions would make the King of England as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czar . If the opinion of the Judges in the case of Impositions and Ship-money were /z/ accepted in law , then all the Property of the People was the King s ; if the courts were correct in their judgments giving the King the pover by his mere will to imprison any subject , during pleasure , and al. -o to Jo the same even with members of Parliament and punish them for debates in the House of Commons , then all liberty was at an end , and the King s Prerogative extended over all acts of Parlia ment , all property , all persons . 5 . One step more must be taken to make the logic of despotism perfect , and complete the chain . That work was delegated to cler gymen purchased for the purpose Rev. Dr. Robert Sibthorpe and Rev. Dr. Roger Main waring . The first in a sermon " of rendering all their dues , " preached and printed in 1627 , says , " the Prince who is the Head , and makes his Court and Council , it is his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; where the word of the King is there is power , and who may say unto him , What doest thou ? And again , " If Princes command any thing which subjects may not perform , because it is against the Laws of God , or of Nature , or impossible ; yet Subjects are bound to undergo the punishment , without either resisting , or railing , or reviling , and are to yield a Passive Obedience where they can not ex hibit an Active one , . . . but in all others he is bound to active obe dience. " 1 Mainwaring went further , and in two famous sermons preached , one on the 4th of July , 1628 , the other on the 29th of the same month declared that " the King is not bound to observe the Laws of the Realm concerning the Subject s Rights and Liberties , but that his Royal will and Command , in imposing Loans , and Taxes , without consent of Parliament , doth oblige the subject s conscience upon pain of eternal damnation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Law of God and the King s Supreme Authority , and became guilty of Impiety , Disloyalty , and Rebellion . And that the authority of Parliament is not necessary for the raising of Aid and Subsidies ; and that the slow proceedings of such great Assem blies were not fitted for the Supply of the State s urgent necessities , but would rather produce sundry impediments to the just designs of Princes . " " That Kings partake of omnipotence with God " 2 The nation was enraged . Mainwaring was brought before Par- 1 Cited in Franklyn , 208 ; 1 Rushworth , 422 , 436 , 444. - Franklyn , 208 , 592 . These two Sermons were published in a volume with the title " Religion and Allegiance . " ... " Published by his Majesty s special command . " ( London , 1628 . ) Prof. Stuart seems inspired by this title in giving a name to his remarkable publication written with the same spirit as Dr. Mainwaring s " Con science and the Constitution . " ( Andover , 1851 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 422 , 436 , 585 , et a/. ; 1 Hallam , 307 ; 2 Parl . Hist. 388 , 410. /z/ liament , punished with fine and imprisonment and temporary suspen sion from office and perpetual disability for ecclesiastical preferment . But the King who ordered the publication of the sermons , and who doubtless had induced him to preach them , immediately made him Rector of Stamford Parish , soon appointed him Dean of Worcester , and finally in 1645 made him Bishop of St. David s . A few years ago such clerical apostasy would seem astonishing to an American . But now , Gentlemen of the Jury , so rapid has been the downfal of public virtue , that men filling the pulpits once graced and dignified by noblest puritanic piety , now publicly declare there is no law of God above the fugitive slave bill . Nay , a distinguished American minis ter boldly proclaimed his readiness to send his own Mother ( or " Brother " ) into eternal bondage ! Thus modern history explains the old ; and the cheap bait of a republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of royal gifts once drew British churchmen into the same pit of infamy . Alas , hypocrisy is of no sect or nation . Gentlemen , the Government of England once decreed " that every clergyman , four times in the year , should instruct his parishioners in the Divine right of Kings , and the damnable sin of resistance/ l No Higher Law ! America has ministers who need no act of Parliament to teach them to do the same ; they run before they are sent . 6 . After the head of one Stuart was shorn off and his son had returned , no wiser nor better than his father , the old progress of des potism began anew . I pass over what would but repeat the former history , and take two new examples to warn the nation with , differing from the old only in form . In 1672 , Charles II . published a proclamation denouncing rigorous penalties against all such as should speak disrespectfully of his acts , or hearing others thus speak should not immediately inform the magis trates ! Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French king , and was in receipt of an annual pension therefrom , he had this testoath published for all to sign : " I do solemnly declare that it is not law ful upon any pretence whatever to take up arms against the king , .... and that 1 will not , at any time to come , endeavor the alteration of the government either in Church or State . " 2 o An oath yet more stringent was enforced in Scotland with the edge of the sword , namely , to defend all the prerogatives of the crown , never without the king s permission to take part in any delibera tions upon ecclesiastical or civil affairs ; and never to seek any reform in Church or State " /z/ Notwithstanding all that the Charleses had done to break down the liberty of Englishmen , still the great corporate towns held out , in trenched behind their charters , and from that bulwark both annoyed the despot and defended the civil rights of the citizen . They also must be destroyed . So summons of quo ivarranto were served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their charters . Jeffreys was serviceable in this wicked work , and on his return from his Northern Circuit , rich with these infamous spoils , as a reward for destroying the liberties of his countrymen , the king pub licly presented him with a ring , in token of " acceptance of his most eminent services . " This fact was duly blazoned in the Gazette , and Jeffreys was " esteemed a mighty favorite , * which , " together with his lofty airs , made all the charters , like the walls of Jericho , fall down before him , and he returned , laden with surrenders , the spoil of towns . " 1 London still remained the strong-hold of commerce , of the Prot estant Religion , and of liberal Ideas in domestic Government ; for though subsequently corrupted by lust of gain , which sought a monop oly , the great commercial estates and families of England were not then on the side of Despotism , as now strangely happens in America . When the king sought to ruin Shaftesbury , a corrupt man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the enemy of encroaching des potism , a London Grand-Jury refused to find a bill , and was warmly applauded by the city . Their verdict of IGNORAMUS was a " personal liberty bill " for that time , and therefor was the king s wrath exceeding hot , for " Ignoramus was mounted in Cathedra , " and there was a stop put to such wickedness . So London must be brought down . She refused to surrender her Charter . In 1682 the king proceeded to wrest it from her by the purchased hand of the courts of law . But even they were not quite adequate to the work . So Chief Justice Pemberton was displaced , and Saunders , a man as offensive in his personal habit of body as he was corrupt in conduct and character was put in his office . Dolbin , too just for the crime demanded of him , was turned out , and Withins made to succeed him . For " so great a weight was there at stake as could not be trusted to men of doubtful principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole matter , was struck with an apoplexy when sentence was to be given , but sent his opinion in writing . Thus on the judgment given by only two judges , who assigned no reasons for their decision , it was declared that the Charter of London was forfeit , 1 8 St. Tr. 1038 , and the quotations from North ( Examen . ) Sprat , and Roger Coke , in note on p. 1041 , et seq . See , too , Fox , James II . p. 48 , 54 , and Appendix , Barillon s Letter of Dec. 7th , 1684. /z/ and the liberties and franchises of the city should " be seized into the king s hands . " * Thus fell the charter of London ! Gentlemen of the Jury , the same sword was soon to strike at the neck of New England ; the charter of Massachusetts could not be safe in such a time . In 1686 James II . wished to destroy Protestantism , not that he loved the Roman form of religion , but that tyranny which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right by his royal preroga tive to dispense with any laws of the land . Of the twelve Judges of England eight were found on his side , and the four unexpectedly proven faithful were at once dismissed from office and their places filled with courtiers of the king , and the court was unanimous that the king had a constitutional right to destroy the constitution . Then he had not only command of the purses of his subjects and their bodies , but also of their mind and conscience , and could dictate the actual Religion of the People as well as the official " religion " of the priests . 2 One State-secret lay at the bottom of the Stuarts plans , to ap point base men for judges , and if by accident a just man came upon the bench , to keep him in obscurity or to hustle him from his post . What names they offer us Kelyng , Finch , Saunders , " Wright , Jef freys , Scroggs ! 3 infamous creatures , but admirable instruments to destroy generous men withal and devise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Historians commonly dwell on the fields of battle , recording the victories of humanity , whereof the pike and gun were instruments ; but pass idly over the more important warfare which goes on in the court house , only a few looking on , where lawyers are the champions of mankind , and the battle turns on a sentence ; nay , on a word which determines the welfare of a nation for ages to come . On such little hinges of law do the great gates hang , and open or shut to let in the happiness or the ruin of millions of men ! Naseby and Worcester are important places truly , venerable for great deeds . Cromwell and Blake are names not likely to perish while men can appreciate the heroism which sheds blood . But Westminster Hall has rung with more important thunder than cannon ever spoke , and Pym and Selden , St. John and Hampden nay , Penn , Bunyan , Fox , Lilburne have done great service for mankind . Gentlemen of the Jury , it is a matter of great magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day . You are to open or shut for Humanity . If the People make themselves sheep there will be wolves enough to eat you up . 1 2 Hallam , 333 ; Burnet , Own Times ( London , 1838 ) , 350 ; 8 St. Tr. 1039 , 1081 note , 1267 , et seq. ; 2 Campbell , Justices , 63 ; North s Examen. 626 ; Fox , 54. 2 11 St. Tr. 1165 ; 12 Ibid. 358. 3 This last name is thought to be extinct in Great Britain , but I find one Thomas Scruggs in Massachusetts in 1635 et post , 1 Mass .

Finch , Kelyng , Thurlow , Loughborough , and their coadjutors , must be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cruel , insolent Judge selecting the worst customs , the most oppressive statutes , and decisions which outrage human nature what an amount of evil he can inflict on groaning humanity ! Gentlemen of the Jury , in this long sad history of judicial tyranny in England there is one thing particularly plain : such judges hate freedom of speech , they would restrict the Press , the Tongue , yes , the Thought of mankind . Especially do they hate any man who exam ines the actions of the government and its servile courts , and their violation of justice and the laws . They wish to take exemplary and malignant vengeance on all such . Let me freshen your knowledge of some examples . 1 . In 1410 the government made a decree " that whatsoever they were that should rede the Scriptures in the mother tongue , they should forfeit land , catel , body , lif , and godes from their heyres for ever , and so be condempned for heretykes to God , enemies to the crowne , and most errant traiters to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-nine persons ivere first hanged and then burned for this " crime " 1 2 . In 1590 , Mr. Udall , a Puritan minister , published a book , " Demonstrations of Discipline , " not agreeable to the authorities . He was brought to a trial for a Felony , not merely a " misde meanor. * The jury were ordered by the judge to find him guilty of that crime if they were satisfied that he published the book , for the court were to judge whether the deed amounted to that crime ! He was found " guilty , " and died in jail after nearly three years of cruel confinement . 2 3 . In 1619 one Williams of Essex wrote a book explaining a pas sage in the book of Daniel as foretelling the death of James I. in 1621 . He inclosed the manuscript in a box , sealed it , and secretly conveyed it to the king . For this he was tried for high treason , and of course executed . " Panitur Affectus , licet non sequatur Effectus " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wish though the object be not reached , " for " writing is doing !

In 1664 Mr. Keach , a Baptist , published a " Childs Instructer , or a New and Easy Primmer , " in which he taught the doctrines of his sect , " that children ought not to be baptized " but only adults ; " that laymen may preach the gospel . " He was brought before Lord Chief Justice Hyde , who after insulting the prisoner , thus charged the grand-jury : " He is a base and dangerous fellow ; and if this be suf fered , children by learning of it will become such as he is , and there fore I hope you will do your duty . " Of course such a jury indicted him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jury were at first divided in opinion . " But , " said the Judge , " you must agree ! " So they found him guilty . He was fined " 20 , twice set in the pillory , and bound to make public submission . " l 5 . In 1679 George Wakeman and others were tried for high trea son before Scroggs , whose conduct was atrocious , and several pam phlets were published commenting on the ridiculous and absurd con duct of this functionary , " Lord Chief Justice Scroggs . " One Rich ard Radley in a bantering talk had bid another man " Go to Weal Hall , to my Lord Scroggs , for he has received money enough of Dr. Wakeman ! " Radley was indicted for " speaking scandalous words of Chief Justice Scroggs . " Whereupon at the opening of the court that eminent officer , who did not disdain to wreak public and judicial vengeance on heads that wrought his private and personal grief , made a speech setting forth his magisterial opinions on the liberty of the press . Doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but for your instruction , Gentlemen of the Jury , I will give you the chief things in the judicial speech of Scroggs , Lord Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of England in 1679. 2 " For these hireling scribblers who traduce it the fairness and equality of the trial in which he had been notoriously unfair and unequal , who write to eat , and lie for bread , I intend to meet with them another way ; for they are only safe while they can be secret ; but so are vermin , so long as they can hide themselves They shall know that the law wants not the power to punish a libellous and licentious press , nor I a resolution to exact it . And this is all the answer is fit to be given ( besides a whip ) to these hackney writers . " " However , in the mean time , the extravagant boldness of men s pens and tongues is not to be endured , but shall be severely punished ; for if once causes come to be tried with complacency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they go otherwise , public causes shall all receive the doom as the multitude happen to be possessed ; and at length any cause shall become public .... at every session the Judges shall be arraigned , the Jury condemned , and the verdicts overawed to comply with popular wish and indecent shouts . " " There are a set of men .... that too much approve and countenance such vul gar ways , .... that embrace all sorts of informations , true or false , likely or impos sible , nay though never so silly and ridiculous , they refuse none ; so shall all addresses be made to them , and they be looked on as the only patrons of religion and government ! " /z/ His associates chimed in with accordant howl . Puny Judge Jones declared , " We have a particular case here before us , as a matter of scandal against a great Judge , the greatest Judge in the kingdom , in criminal causes the Lord Chancellor Nottingham was greater in civil causes ; and it is a great and an high charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , I think , more licentious than this in aspersing gov ernors , scattering of libels and scandalous speeches against those that are in authority ; and without all doubt it doth become the court to show their zeal in suppressing it . " It was * resisting an officer . " That trial of Dr. Wakeman was managed with exact justice and perfect integrity . And therefore I do think it very fit that this person be pro ceeded against by an information , that he may be made a public example to all such as shall presume to scandalize the government , and the governors , with any false asper sions and accusations . " Accordingly Mr. Radley , for that act , was convicted of speaking scandalous words against the Lord Chief Justice Scroggs " and fined /z/ Mr. Hudson says of the Star- Chamber , " So tender the court is of upholding the honor of the sentence , as they will punish them who speak against it with great severity . " 2 6 . In 1680 Benjamin Harris , a bookseller , sold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city for the Preservation of his Majesty s Person , Liberty , Property , and the Protestant Religion . " He was brought to trial for a libel , before Recorder Jeffreys and Chief Justice Scroggs who instructed the jury they were only to inquire if Harris sold the book , and if so , find him " guilty . " It was for the court to determine what was a libel . He was fined five hun dred pounds and placed in the pillory ; the Chief Justice wished that he might be also whipped . 3 7 . The same year Henry Carr was brought to trial . He published a periodical " the Weekly Packet of advice from Rome , or the His tory of Popery " hostile to Romanism . Before the case came to court , Scroggs prohibited the publication on his own authority . Mr. Carr was prosecuted for a libel before the same authority , and of course found guilty . The character of that court also was judgment against natural right . Jane Curtis and other women were in like manner punished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 4 And it was held to be a " misdemeanor " to publish a book reflecting on the justice of the nation the truer the book the worse the libel ! It was " obstructing an officer , " and of course it was a greater offence to " obstruct " him with Justice and Truth than with wrong and lies . The greater the justice of the act the more /z/ dangerous the " crime ! " If the language did not hit any one person it was " malice against all mankind . " 8 . In 1684 Sir Samuel Barnardiston was brought to " trial charged with a " High Misdemeanor . " He had written three private letters to be sent it was alleged by post to his friend , also a private man . The letters do not appear designed for any further publication or use ; they related to matters of news , the events of the day and comments thereon , and spoke in praise of Algernon Sidney and Lord Russell who were so wickedly beheaded about the time the letters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any evil lurking there . Jeffreys presided at the trial , and told the jury : " The letters are factious , seditious , and malicious letters , and as base as the worst of mankind could ever have invented " " And if he be guilty of it the greater the man is the greater the crime , and the more understanding he has , the more malicious he seems to be ; for your little ordinary sort of people , that are of common mean under standing , they may be wheedled and drawn in , and surprised into such things ; but men of a public figure and of some value in the world that have been taken to be men of the greatest interest and reputation in a party , it can not be thought a hidden sur prise upon them ; no , it is a work of time and thought , it is a thing fixed in his very nature , and it shows so much venom as would make one think the whole mass of his Hood were corrupt . " " Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in it malice against the king , malice against the government , malice against both Church and State , malice against any man that bears any share in the government , indeed malice against all mankind that are not of the same persuasion with these bloody miscreants . " " Here is ... the sainting of two horrid conspirators ! Here is the Lord Russell sainted , that blessed martyr ; Lord Russell , that good man , that excellent Protestant , he is lamented ! And here is Mr. Sidney sainted , what an extraordinary man he was ! Yes , surely he was a very good man and it is a shame to think that such bloody miscreants should be sainted and lamented who had any hand in that horrid murder the execu tion of Charles I. and treason . . . who could confidently bless God for their being engaged in that good cause ( as they call it ) which was the rebellion which brought that blessed martyr to his death .

" Of course the packed jury found him guilty ; he was fined /z/ Gentlemen of the Jury , such judges , with such kings and cabi nets , have repeatedly brought the dearest rights of mankind into imminent peril . Sad indeed is the condition of a nation where Thought is not free , where the lips are sewed together , and the press is chained ! Yet the evil which has ruined Spain and made an Asia Minor of Papal Italy , once threatened England . Nay , Gentlemen of the Jury , it required the greatest efforts of her noblest sons to vindicate for you and me the right to print , to speak , to think . Milton s " Speech for /z/ the Liberty of unlicensed Printing " is one monument of the warfare which lasted from Wicliffe to Thomas Carlyle . But other monu ments are the fines and imprisonment , the exile and the beheading of men and women ! Words are " sedition , " " rebellion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in New England , a true word is a " Misde meanor , " it is " obstructing an officer . " At how great cost has our modern liberty of speech been purchased ! Answer John Lilburne , answer William Prynn , and Selden , and Eliot , and Hampden , and the other noble men who " in the public breach devoted stood , And for their country s cause were prodigal of blood . " Answer Fox and Bunyan , and Penn and all the host of Baptists , Puritans , Quakers , martyrs , and confessors it is by your stripes that we are healed ! Healed ! are we healed ? Ask the court if it be not a " misdemeanor " to say so ! A despotic government hates implacably the freedom of the press . In 1680 the Lord Chief Justice of England declared the opinion of the twelve judges " indeed all subscribe that to print or publish any neivsbooks , or pamphlets of news whatsoever , is illegal ; that it is a manifest intent to the breach of the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illegal thing . " " And that is for a public notice to all people , and especially printers and booksellers , that they ought to print no book or pamphlet of news whatsoever without authority ; " " they shall be punished if they do it without authority , though there is nothing reflecting on the government , " 1 Judge Scroggs was right it was " resisting an officer , " at least " obstructing " him in his wickedness . In England , says Lord Campbell , the name and family of Scroggs are both extinct . So much the worse for you and me , Gentlemen . The Scrogges came over to America ; they settled in Massachusetts , they thrive famously in Boston ; only the name is changed . In 1731 Sir Philip Yorke , attorney-general , solemnly declared that an editor is " not to publish any thing reflecting on the character and repu tation and administration of his Majesty or his Ministers ; " " if he breaks that law , or exceeds that liberty of the press he is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the third year of Edward I. , in A. D. 1275 ! But that statute of the Dark Ages was held good law in 1731 ; and it seems to be thought good law in 1855 ! And the attorney who affirmed the atrocious principle , soon became Chief Justice , a " con summate judge , " a Peer , Lord Hardwicke , and Lord Chancellor ! 2 Lord Mansfield had not a much higher opinion of the liberty of the press ; indeed , in all libel cases , he assumed it was exclusively the /z/ function of the judges to determine whether the words published contained malicious or seditious matter , the jury were only to find the fact of publication . 1 Thus the party in power with their Loughboroughs , their Thurlows , their Jeffreys , their Scroggs shall I add also American names are the exclusive judges as to what shall be published relating to the party in power their Loughboroughs , their Thurlows , their Jeffreys and their Scroggs , or their analogous American names ! It was the free press of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " this which stayed the tide of Papal despotism ; this which dyked the tyranny of Louis XIV . out from Holland . Aye , it was this which the Stuarts , with their host of attendants , sought to break down and annihilate for ever ; 2 which Thurlow and Mansfield so formidably attacked , and which now in America but the American aspect of the matter must not now be looked in the face . But spite of all these impediments in the way of liberty , the voice of humanity could not be forever silenced . Now and then a virtuous and high-minded judge appeared in office like Hale or Holt , Camden or Erskine . Even in the worst times there were noble men who lifted up their voices . Let me select two examples from men not famous , but whose names , borne by other persons , are still familiar to this court . In 1627 Sir Robert Phillips , member for Somersetshire , in his place in Parliament , thus spoke against the advance of despotism : 3 " I read of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had a solemn feast for their slaves ; at which they had liberty , without exception , to speak what they would , thereby to ease their afflicted minds ; which being finished , they severally re turned to their former servitude .

They have been well represented by divers worthy gentlemen before me ; yet one grievance , and the main one , as I conceive , hath not been touched , which is our Religion : religion , Mr. Sneaker , made vendible by commission , and men , for pecuniary annual rates , dispensed withal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ; each latter stepping forwarder than the former , upon the Rights of the Subject ; aiming , in the end , to tread and trample under foot our law , and that even in the form of law .

O unwise fore fathers ! To be so curious in providing for the quiet possession of our lands , and the liberties of Parliament ; and to neglect our persons and bodies , and to let them lie in prison , and that durante bene placito , remediless ! If this be law , why do we talk of liberties ? Why do we trouble ourselves with a dispute about law , franchises , property of goods , and the like ? What may any man call his own , if not the Liberty of his Person ? I am weary of treading these ways . " l In 1641 Sir Philip Parker , Knight of the Shire for Suffolk , in his place in Parliament , thus spoke : " The cries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole nation tingles in rny ears .

Mr. Speaker , excuse my zeal in this case ; for my mouth can not imprison what my mind intends to let out ; neither can my tongue conceal what my heart desires to promulge . Behold the Archbishop Laud , that great incendiary of this kingdom , lies now like a firebrand raked up in the embers ; but if ever he chance to blaze again I am afraid that what heretofore he had but in a spark , he will burn down to the ground in a full flame .

" a Six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This same threefold experiment of despotism which was attempted in England , was tried also in America by the same tyrannical hand . Here , also , the encroaching power put creatures of its arbitrary will in judicial offices ; they then by perverting the laws , punished the patriots , and next proceeded to destroy the best institutions of the land itself . Here I shall take but a few examples , selected from the colonial history of our own New England . After capturing the great fortress of freedom at home , by taking away the charter of London , Charles proceeded to destroy the free dom of the colonies ; the Charter of Massachusetts was wrested from us on a quo warranto in 1683 , 4 and the colony lay at the feet of the 1 2 Parl .

In privy council it had already been determined that our rights should be swept into the hands of some greedy official from the court . 1 In 1686 James II . sent Sir Edmund Andros to New England as a " Commissioner " to destroy the liberty of the people . He came to Boston in the " Kingfisher , a fifty gun ship , " and brought two companies of British soldiers , the first ever stationed in this town to dragoon the people into submission to an unrighteous law . Edward Randolph , the most determined enemy of the colony , greedily caressing the despotic hands that fed him , was his chief coadjutor and assistant , his secretary , in that wicked work . Andros was au thorized to appoint his own council , and with their consent enact laws , levy taxes , to organize and command the militia . He was to enforce the hateful " Acts of Trade . " He appointed a council to suit the purpose of his royal master , to whom no opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the people who appealed to Magna Charta , " they must not think the privileges of Englishmen would follow them to the end of the world . " Episcopacy was intro duced ; no marriages were to " be allowed lawful but such as were made by the minister of the Church of England . " Accordingly , all must come to Boston to be married , for there was no Episcopal min ister out of its limits . It was proposed that the Puritan Churches should pay the Episcopal salary , and the Congregational worship be prohibited . He threatened to punish any man " who gave two pence " toward the support of a Non-conformist minister . All fees to officers of the new government were made exorbitantly great . Only one Probate office vas allowed in the Province , that was in Boston ; and one of the creatures of despotic power was , prophetically , put in it .

" One of the Council said , " You have no privileges left you , but not to be sold as slaves " Even that was not likely to last long . The town of Ipswich refused to pay the tax , because invalid ; the governor having no authority to tax the people : " they will petition the King for liberty of an assembly before they make any rates . " The minister and five others were arrested ; they had " obstructed an officer . " The Rev. Mr. Wise was guiltiest of all ; he did it with a word , an idea . They were brought to Boston , and thrown into jail , " for contempt and high misdemeanors . " They claimed the habeas corpus ; Chief Justice Dudley refused it , on the ground that it did not extend to America !

They were fined from X15 to 50 a piece . The whole cost to the six was over X400 . " It is not for his majesty s interest that you should thrive , " said one of those petty tyrants , a tide-water of despotism . 1 Andros denied the colonial title to lands , claiming that as the charter was declared void , all the lands held under its authority escheated to the crown , " The calf died in the cow s belly .

Andros hated freedom of speech and of thought . He was to allow no unlicensed printing .

" There must be but one town meeting in a year , and no " deliberation " at that ; no " agitation , " no discussion of grievances . There must be no preaching on the acts of the government . Rev. Dr. Increase Mather , one of the ablest men in the Colonies , was the special object of his hate . Randolph advised the authorities to forbid any non-conformist minister to land in New England without the special consent of the governor , and that he should restrain such as he saw fit to silence . The advice was not lost on such willing ears . John Gold , of Topsfield , was tried for " treasonable words , " and fined fifty pounds a great deal more at Topsfield in 1687 , than " three hundred dollars " is now in Boston . Rev. Increase Mather had opposed the surrender of the Charter of Massachusetts , and published his reasons ; but with such prudence , for he was careful how he " evinced an express liking " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . So the friends of govern ment forged a letter with his name , to a person in Amsterdam . Randolph showed the letter to persons whom he wished to prejudice against the alleged writer . When Mr. Mather learned the facts , he wrote a letter to a friend , clearing himself , and charging the forgery on Randolph or his brother . Randolph brought his action for a libel , claiming 500 damages . But it came to nothing then . Now times are changed ! Col. Pynchon , of Springfield , one of the officers in this new state of things , was empowered to bind over all persons suspected of riots , " outrageous or abusive reflecting words and speeches against the government " " The spirit of justice was banished from the courts that bore the name . " 1 But notwithstanding the attempt to stifle speech , a great tall minister at Rowley , called Andros " a wicked man ! " For that offence he was seized and put in prison ! He , also , like Higginson , is represented in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same inextinguishable religious fire which burned in the bosom of Robert in Old England , and from Samuel in New England flashed into the commissioned face of Andros , now lightens at this bench from the eyes of WENDELL PHILLIPS , who confers new glory on his muchhonored ancestor . Gentlemen of the Jury , you know how this wickedness was brought to an end . If the courts would not decree Justice , there was a rougher way of reaching it , and having it done . Civil war , revolu tion by violence , came in place of the simple forms of equity , which /z/ the judges had set at nought . William of Orange , a most valiant son-in-law , drove the fool tyrant of Old England from that Island , where the Stuarts have ever since been only " Pretenders ; " and on the 19th of April , 1689 , the people of Massachusetts had the tyrant of New England put solemnly in jail ! We were rid of that func tionary for ever , and all such u commissioners " have been held odious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eighty-six years later came another 19th of April , also famous . Well said Secre tary Randolph , " Andros has to do with a perverse people , " they would not bow to such tyranny in 1689 . But he afterwards became a quite acceptable governor in Virginia , where , I doubt not , he has descendants in African bondage at this day . Catholic James II . sought to establish arbitrary power in America , as in England , by his prerogative the Omnipotence of the King ; he failed ; the high-handed despotism of the Stuarts went to the ground . The next attempt at the same thing was by the legislature the Omnipotence of Parliament for a several-headed despotism took the place of the old , and ruled at home with milder sway . It tried its hand in America ; there were no more requisitions from a king hostile to the Colonies , but acts of Parliament took their place . After the French power in North America had given way , the British government sought to tame down and break in the sturdy son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rough , as obstinate as his father . Here are three measures of subjugation , all flowing from the same fountain of Principle vicarious government by a feudal superior . 1 . All the chief colonial officers were to be appointed by the king , to hold office during his pleasure , to receive their pay from him . Such was the tenure of the executive officers who had a veto on all colonial legislation , and of the judicial officers . Thus the power of making and administering the laws fell from the people distributed every where , into the hands of the distant government centralized in the King . 2 . A standing army of British soldiers must be kept in the Colo nies to overawe the people , and enforce the laws thus made and administered . 3 . A revenue w r as to be raised from the Colonies themselves from which the King would pay his officers and provide for his army that enforced his laws . The eagle is to feather the arrow which shoots him in mid heaven . Thus law was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were not put out not then . Blindness came at a later day when he had laid his head in the lap of a not attractive Deli- /z/ lah . With such judges and governors , backed by a standing army of hirelings how soon would her liberty go down , and the AngloAmerican States resemble Spanish America ! In 1760 Francis Bernard was made governor of Massachusetts , and thus officially put at the head of the Judiciary , a man wholly devoted to the Crown , expecting to be made a baronet ! He did not wish an annual election of councillors , but wanted the sovereign power to enforce its decrees by violent measures . Thus Thomas Hutchinson was made Chief Justice in 1760 , and afterwards Lieu tenant-Governor , continually hostile to the constitution of his native land . Thus Andrew Oliver " Governor Oliver , " hungry for office and power , " was appointed Secretary , Commissioner of Stamps and Lieutenant- Governor ; and Peter Oliver " Judge Oli ver " though not bred a lawyer , was made Chief Justice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massa chusetts , preferring the money of the crown which owned him . In the revolutionary times of the five Judges of Massachusetts four were Tories ! Accordingly , when the Stamp Act was passed 22d March , 1765 there were Judicial officers in the Colonies ready to declare it " consti tutional ; " executive magistrates ready to carry out any measures intrusted to them . " I will cram the stamps down their throat with the end of my sword , " said an officer at New York . Governor Ber nard wanted soldiers sent to Boston to enforce submission ; so did Hutchinson and " Governor Oliver . " The Governor of New York thought , " if Judges be sent from England with an able attorneygeneral and solicitor-general to make examples of some very feu , the Colony will remain quiet . " In 1768 John Hancock was arrested at Boston for a " misde meanor ; " I suppose , " obstructing an officer , " or some such of fence . 2 The government long sought to procure indictments against James Otis who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other leading friends of the colony . But I sup pose the judge did not succeed in getting his brother-in-law put on the grand-jury , and so the scheme fell through . No indictment for that " misdemeanor " then . Boston had the right men to do any thing for the crown , but they did not contrive to get upon the grand-jury . The King , it was George III. , in his parliament , spoke of the Patriots of Boston , as " those turbulent and seditious persons . " In the House of Commons , Stanley called Boston an " insolent town ; " its inhabitants " must be treated as aliens ; " its " charter and laws /z/ must be so changed as to give the King the appointment of the Council , and to the sheriffs the sole power of returning jurors ; " then the Stamp Act could be carried out , and a revenue raised without the consent of the people . The plan was admirably laid ; an excellent counsel ! Suppose , as a pure conjecture , an hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave bill court , eager to kidnap men and so gain further advancement from the slave power , which alone distributes the federal offices ; suppose the court should appoint its creatures , relatives , nay , its uterine brother its brother in birth as fugitive slave bill commissioners to hunt men ; and then should get its matrimonial brother its brother-in-law on the grand-jury to indict all who resisted the fugitive slave bill ! You see , gentlemen , what an admirable opportunity there would be to accom plish most manifold and atrocious wickedness . This supposed case exactly describes what was contemplated by the British authorities in the last century ! Only , Gentlemen , it was so unlucky as not to succeed ; nay , Gentlemen , as to fail then ! Such accidents will happen in the best of histories ! It was moved in Parliament to address the king " to bring to con dign punishment " such men as Otis and Adams and Hancock . Chief Justice Hutchinson declared Samuel Adams " the greatest in cendiary in the king s dominions . " Hutchinson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will burn on Boston Common on the Fourth day of next July , Gentlemen , and on many other commons besides Boston . Aye , in the heart of many million men and keep on burning long after Hutchinson ceases to be remembered with hate , and Adams with love . " The greatest incendiary ! " so he was . Hutchinson also thought there must be " an Abridgment of what are called English Liberties , doubtless the liberty of speaking in Faneuil Hall , and other meeting-houses was one " of what are called English Liberties " that needed speedy abridgment . He wished the law of treason to be extended so that it might catch all the patriots of Bos ton by the neck . He thought it treasonable to deny the authority of Parliament . 1 Men suspected of " misdemeanors " were to be sent to England for trial ! What a " trial " it would have been Hancock and Adams in Westminster Hall with a jury packed by the govern ment ; Thurlow acting as Attorney-General , and another Thurlow growling on the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truly there would have been an " abridgment of English Liberties . " Gentlemen of the Jury , Mr. Phillips and Mr. Higginson in this case are charged with " obstructing an officer . " Suppose they were sent to South Carolina to be tried by a jury of Slave-holders , or /z/ still worse , without change of place , to be tried by a court deadly hostile to freedom , wresting law and perverting justice and " enlarg ing testimony , " personally inimical to these gentlemen ; suppose that the Slave-hunter whose " process " was alleged to be resisted , was kinsman to the court , and the judge had a near relation put on the jury what opportunity would there be for justice ; what expectation of it ? Gentlemen of the Jury , that is the state of things which the despots of England wanted to bring about by sending Hancock and Adams over seas for trial ! Bernard , Oliver , and Hutchinson were busy in getting evidence against the Patriots of New England , especially against Adams . Affidavits were sent out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transported for " trial " there . And an old statute was found from the enlightened reign of Henry VIII . authorizing that mode of trial in case of such " misdemeanor . Commissary Chew wished that two thirds of the lawyers and printers were shipped off to Africa " for at least seven years . " Edes and- Gill , patriotic printers in Boston , and " all the authors of number less treasonable and seditious writings , " were to go with them . 1 They were all guilty , very guilty ! Gentlemen of the Jury , they committed " misdemeanors , " they " obstructed officers , " they resisted the process of despotism ! But alas The Dog it was that died . " Edes and Gill never saw Africa ; the patriotic lawyers and printers made no reluctant voyage to England . " The Dog it was that died .

Commissary Chew learned a lesson at Saratoga in 1777 . And the Franklins , the Mayhews , the Hancocks , the Adamses , they also were tried at home , and not found wanting ; and the verdict ! Gentlemen of the Jury , you know what verdict America has pronounced on these men and their kinsfolk ! There is only one spot in the United States where the Hutchinsons , the Olivers , the Bernards are honored , that is where the Adamses , the Hancocks , the Mayhews , and the Franklins , with the principles of justice they gave their lives to , are held in contempt ! Where is the one spot , that speck of foreign dirt /z/ in the clean American garden ? It is where the Democratic Herod and the Whig Pilate are made friends that they may crucify the Son of Man , the Desire of all nations , the Spirit of Humanity it is the court of the Fugitive Slave Bill judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1765 it was too late to conquer America . What Andros and Randolph could accomplish in 1686 with their sixty soldiers , could not be done in 1768 with all the red coats Britain could send out : nor in 1778 with all the Hessians she could purchase . The lfth of April , 1689 , foretold another 19th of April as that many to-mor rows after to-day ! In the House of Lords Camden and Pitt thought Parliament not omnipotent. 1 Samuel Adams declared " Acts of Par liament against natural equity are void ; " prayed that " Boston might become a Christian Sparta , " and looked to the Law of an Omnipo tence somewhat higher than a king or a court . He not only had Justice , but also the People on his side . What came of that last attempt of the last king of New England to establish a despotism here ? The same , Gentlemen , which will ultimately come of all such attempts . Gentlemen of the Jury , there is one great obstacle which despotism has found in Anglo-Saxon lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the People . It is easy for the controlling power , which represents the Centripetal Tendency of the Nation , to place its corrupt and servile creatures in judicial offices , vested with power to fine , to imprison , and to kill ; it is then easy for them to de termine on the destruction of all such friends of Justice and Humanity as represent the Centrifugal Tendency of the Nation ; and with such judicial instruments it is not difficult to wrest and pervert law in order to crush the Patriots , and construct a word into " Treason , " or " evincing express approbation " into a " Misdemeanor , " " resisting an officer . " And if the final decision rested with such a court , it would be exceeding easy to make way with any man whom the judge s private malignity or the public vengeance of his master , wished to smite and kill . But in the Anglo-Saxon people there is one institu tion , old , venerable , and well-beloved , which has stood for two thou sand years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it still stands . Neither British Kings nor American Slave-drivers have yet brought it to the ground . Of this I must now say a word . /z/ III . Or THE GREAT SAFEGUARD WHICH HAS BEE : T POUND SERVICEABLE IN PROTECTING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE RlGHTS OF MAN THEY ARE DESIGNED TO DEFEND . OF THE TRIAL BY JuilY . This is an invaluable protection against two classes of foes to the welfare of mankind . 1 . Against such as would commit offences upon the property or persons of men , without law and contrary to the form of law , against common criminals of all denominations . Against such it is a sword to resist and punish . 2 . Against such as would commit offences upon the property or persons of men , with the form of law and by means of its machinery , against unjust legislators , corrupt Judges , and wicked magistrates : against such it is a shield defending the public head . In all the States of Anglo-Saxon origin there are two great popu lar institutions Democratic Legislation and Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical development the first has come to the representative form of democratic legislation , popular lawmaking by a body of sworn delegates met in an Assembly , local or federal , subject to a constitution , written or only traditional , which is the People s Power of Attorney , authorizing them to do certain mat ters and things pertinent to law-making . These are a Jury of gen eral Law-makers . In its process of historical development , the second has also come to a representative form r that of democratic application of law , popular law-applying , by a body of sworn delegates , that is a Court , subject to a constitution and laws , written or only traditional , which are the People s Power of Attorney authorizing them to do certain matters and things pertinent to law-applying . These are a Jury of special Law-appliers . Neither of them as yet has reached its perfect and ultimate form ; both are still in a state of transition . These two are the most valu able institutional safeguards against unorganized selfishness in the community , against thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; against the organized selfishness which gets into places of dele gated power , and would misuse the Form of law so as to prevent the People from attaining the Purpose of law . There is also a body of men intermediate between the two , the Law-Explainers , the Judges . Speaking theoretically they are not ultimately either Law-makers or Law-appliers , yet practically , in their legitimate function , they certainly have much to do with both the /z/ making and applying of laws . For it is their business , not only to preside at all trials , and determine many subordinate questions of mere form to expedite the process , but also from the whole mass of laws , oral or written , statutes and customs , to select such particular laws as they think require special attention , this is like the work of law-makers ; and also , in their charges to the grand and petty Juries , to suggest the execution thereof in such cases as the times may bring , this is like the work of the law-appliers . The good judge continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . lie leaves bad statutes , which aim at or would promote injustice , to sleep till themselves become obsolete , or parries their insidious thrusts at humanity ; he selects good statutes which enact natural Justice into positive law ; and mixes his own fresh instincts of humanity with the traditional institutions of the age . All this his official function requires of him for his oath to keep and administer the laws binds him to look to the Purpose of Law which is the Eternal Justice of Grod , as well as to each special statute . Besides , after the Jury declares a man guilty , the Judge has the power to fix the quantity and sometimes the quality of his pun ishment . And the discretion of a great noble man will advance humanity . Li this way a good Judge may do a great service to mankind , and correct the mistakes , or repel the injustice of the ultimate makers and appliers of law , and supply their defects . Thus in England those eminent Judges , Hale , Somers , Hobart , Holt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large service to mankind . Each had his personal and official faults , some of them great and glaring faults of both kinds , but each in his way helped enact natural Justice into positive law , and so to promote the only legitimate Purpose of human legislation , securing Natural Rights to all men . To such Judges mankind owes a quite considerable debt . But in America the Judge has an additional function ; he is to determine the Constitutionality of a law . For while the British King and Parliament claim to be legislatively omnipotent , supreme , the Ultimate human source of law , the Living Constitution of the realm , and therefore themselves the only Norm of law , howsoever illfounded the claim may be , in America it is the People , not their elected servants , who are the Ultimate human source of law , the Supreme Legislative power . Accordingly the People have prepared a written Constitution , a Power of Attorney authorizing their ser vants to do certain matters and things relating to the government of the nation . This constitution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . So in administering law the Judge is to ask , Is the statute constitutional ? does it square with the Norm of law /z/ which the People have laid down ; or have the legislative servants ex ceeded their Power of Attorney , and done matters and things which they were not empowered to do ? In deciding this question , the Judge is to consider not merely the Provisional Means which the Constitution designates , but also the Ultimate Purpose thereof , the Justice and Lib erty which , as its preamble declares , it expressly aims at , and which are also the ideal End of all sound legislation . There is no country in the world where a great man has so noble a place and opportunity to serve mankind as in America . But a wicked Judge , Gentlemen , may do great harm to mankind , as I have already most abundantly shown . For we have inherited a great mass of laws . customary or statutory ; the legislature repeals , modifies , or adds to them ; the Judge is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . The Jury is to apply or refuse to apply the Judge s " law . " In all old countries , some of these laws have come from a barbarous , perhaps even from a savage period ; some are the work of tyrants who wrought cruelly for their own advantage , not justly , or for the good of mankind ; some have been made in haste and heat , the legislature intending to do an unjust thing . Now an unjust Judge has great power to select wicked stat utes , customs , or decisions ; and in no country has he more power for evil than in the federal courts of the United States . For as in Eng land , when the King-power makes a wicked law , the Judge , who is himself made by that same power , may declare it just , and execute the heinous thing ; so in America , when the Slave power enacts a wicked statute , contrary to the purpose of the constitution and to the natu ral justice of God , the Judge , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional and binding on all the People who made the constitution as their Power of Attorney . Thus all the value of the constitution to check despotism is destroyed , and the Fortress of Freedom is betrayed into the hands of the enemies of liberty ! But barbarous laws must not be applied in a civilized age ; nor unjust laws enforced by righteous men . While left unrepealed , a fair and conscientious Jury will never do injustice , though a particular statute or custom demand it , and a wicked Judge insist upon the wrong ; for they feel the moral instinct of human nature , and look not merely to the letter of a particular enactment , but also to the spirit and general purpose of law itself , which is justice between man and man . The wicked Judge , looking only to the power which raised him to his place , and may lift him higher still , not to that other Hand which is over all , or consulting his own meanness of nature , selects the wicked laws , and makes a wicked application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , he can work most hideous wrong . /z/ Besides , the Judges are lawyers , with the technical training of lawyers , with the disposition of character which comes from their special training and profession , and which marks the manners , the language and looks of a lawyer . They have the excellence of the lawyer , and also his defects . Commonly they are learned in their profession , acute and sharp , circumspect , cautious , skilful in making nice technical distinctions , and strongly disposed to adhere to historical precedents on the side of arbitrary power , rather than to obey the instinctive promptings of the moral sense in their own conscious ness . Nay , it seems sometimes as if the moral sense became extinct , and the legal letter took the place of the spirit of Justice which gives life to the People . So they look to the special statute , its technical expositions and applications , but not to Justice , the ultimate Purpose of human law ; they preserve the means and miss the end , put up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish in their pen . Like the nurse in the fable , they pour out the baby , and carefully cherish the wooden bath-tub ! The Letter of the statute is the Idol of the Judicial Den , whereunto the worshipper offers sacrifices of human blood . The late Chief Justice Parker , one of the most humane and estimable men , told the Jury they had nothing to do with the harsh ness of the statute ! but must execute a law , however cruel and unjust , because somebody had made it a law ! How often Juries refuse to obey the statute and by its means to do a manifest injustice ; but how rarely does a Judge turn off from the wickedness of the statute to do Justice , the great Purpose of human law and human life ! Gen tlemen , I once knew a democratic judge a man with a noble mind , and a woman s nicer sense of right who told the Jury , " Such is the law , such the decisions ; such would be its application to this particu lar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manifest and outrageous wrong if thus applied . You as Jurors are to do Justice by the law , not injustice . You will bring in a verdict according to your con science . 1 1 They did so . Gentlemen , I should not dare tell you that Judge s name . It would greatly injure his reputation . God knows it for there is a Higher Law . " When the New York Convention assembled in 1846 to revise the constitution of that State , some powerful men therein felt the evil of having the Court of last Appeal consist wholly of lawyers . Mr. Ruggles thought the judges who reexamine the decisions and pronounce the final judgment in disputed cases , and determine the constitution ality of laws , should be men who are " brought into direct contact with the people and their business . " He wished that of the eight judges of this appellate Court , four should be Justices of the Su preme Court , and four more should be elected by the people on a general ballot , thus securing a popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element , representing the instinctive Justice of Humanity , he hoped to correct that evil tendency of professional men which leads them away " from the just conclusions of natural reason into the track of technical rules inapplicable to the circum stances of the case , and at variance with the nature and principles of our social and political institutions . " 1 " Such judges , " said another lawyer , " would retain more of the great general principles of moral justice , . . . the impulses of natural equity , such as ... would knock off the rough corners of the common law and loosen the fetters of artificial and technical equity . " 2 Commonly in America , as in England , for judges the Federal Government appoints lawyers who have done some party service , or are willing to execute the designs of the great ruling Power , the Slave holders , regardless alike of the interests of the People and the protes tations of the Conscience of Mankind . 3 You know how Hardwicke and Thurlow got their office in England , how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness . Need I mention the name of Americans with a similar history ? Gentlemen , I pass it by for the present . Still further , these judges thus appointed become familiar with fraud , violence , cruelty , selfishness , refined or brutal , which comes before them ; they study the technicalities of the statutes , balance the scruples of advocates ; they lose their fresh intuitions of justice , be coming more and more legal , less and less human , less natural and more technical ; their eye is microscopic in its niceness of discrimina tion , microscopic also in its narrowness of range . They forget the universality of justice , the End which laws should aim at ; they direct their lynx-eyed attention to the speciality of the statutes which is only the Means , of no value save as conducing to that end . Their understanding is sharp as a mole s eye for the minute distinctions of the technicalities of their craft ; but , as short-sighted as the mole , they can not look at justice . So they come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law except what is written in Black Letter on parchment , printed in statute-books , reported in decisions : the Law written by God on the soul of man they know not , only the statute and decision bound in pale sheepskin . In the logic of legal deduction technical inference they forget the intuition of con science : not What is right ? but What is law ? is the question , and they pay the same deference to a wicked statute as a just one . So 1 Debates in New York Convention , 371 , et al . 2 Jordan s Speech , ibid. , 447 , et al . See also Mr. Stow s Remarks , 473 , and Mr , Stephens , 474 , et al . Yet all these four speakers were lawyers . /z/ the true Mussulman values the absurdities of the Koran as much as its noblest wisdom and tenderest humanity . Such a man so appointed , so disciplined , will administer the law fairly enough in civil cases between party and party , where he has no special interest to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Richard Roe gain the parcel of ground in litigation before him . But in criminal cases he leans to severity , not mercy ; he sus pects the People ; he reverences the government . In political trials he never forgets the hand that feeds him , Charles Stuart , George Guelph , or the Slave Power of America . These things being so , in such trials you see the exceeding value of the jury , who are not Office-holders , under obligation to the hand that feeds them ; not Office-seekers , willing to prostitute their faculties to the service of some overmastering lust ; not lawyers wonted to nice technicalities ; not members of a class , with its special discipline and peculiar prejudices ; but men with their moral instincts normally active , and unsophisticated humanity in their hearts . Hence the great value of the jury in criminal trials . Gentlemen , you are the jurors in this case , to decide between me and the government . Between the government and ME ! no , Gentle men , between the Fugitive Slave Bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of the Judges appoint ment the services they are expected to render in cases like this , the services they have already rendered . Let me speak of the Function of the Jury . To do that , I must say a few words of its Historical Development . I must make it very brief and sketchy . Here I shall point out six several steps in the successive development of popular Law-making and Law-apply ing. 1 . In the barbarous periods of the Teutonic Family , 1 it seems the ; whole People " came together at certain regular seasons to transact the business of the nation . There was also a meeting of the inhabi tants of each district or neighborhood at stated times , a " regular meeting ; " and sometimes a special meeting to provide for some emergency a " called meeting . " If one man had wronged another the matter was inquired into at those popular meetings . One man presided chosen for the occasion . In the early age it appears he was a p riest , afterwards a noble , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole people investigated the matter , made the law often an ex post facto law , applied it to the special case , and /z/ on the spot administered the punishment if corporeal , or decreed the recompense if pecuniary . The majority carried the day . Thus at first the Body of People present on the occasion were the law makers , the law-appliers , and law-executors . Each law was special designed for the particular case in hand , retrospective for ven geance more than prospective for future welfare . 2 . Then in process of time , there came to be a body of laws fixed and understood by the People . Partly , these came from the customs of the People , and represented past life already lived ; but partly , also , from the decrees of the recognized authorities theocratic , monarchic , aristocratic , democratic representing the desire for a better life , a rule of conduct for the future . Then at their meetings , to punish an offender the people did not always make a new law , they simply used what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the deed done , the law , and applied the general law to the special fact , made their decree and executed it . Thus extemporaneous Making of law for the particular case , gradually passed away , and was succeeded by the extemporaneous Declaration of the law previously made , and its Application to the matter in hand . 3 . By and by it was found inconvenient for a multitude to assemble and make the laws , so a body of select men took a more special charge of that function . Sometimes a chief , or king , usurped this for himself ; or men were chosen by the people , and took an oath for the faithful discharge of their trust . Thus came popular law-making by sworn delegates , representatives of the people , who had a certain special power of attorney , authorizing them to make laws . These might be Priests as at the beginning ; or Nobles of priestly stock , as at the next stage ; or Military Chiefs as in all times of violence ; or powerful Private men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task , or chosen by the various neighborhoods , the whole process seems to have been irregular and uncertain , as indeed it must be amongst rude people . So at that time there were two sources of law-making. ( 1 . ) The unorganized People the primary source , whose uncon scious life flows in certain channels and establishes certain customs , rules of conduct , obeyed before they are decreed , without any formal enactment . These were laws de facto. ( 2 . ) The organized Delegates priestly , kingly , nobilitary , or war like the secondary source . These made statute laws . As this was a self-conscious and organized body , having an object distinctly set before its mind and devising means for its purposes , it easily appro priated to itself the chief part of the business of law-making . Statute laws became more and more numerous and important ; they were the principal the customs were only subsidiary , laws de Jure , enacted /z/ before they are obeyed by the People . Still new customs continued to flow from the primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took new forms to suit the conditions of national life . 4 . Still the people came together to apply the laws customary or enacted , to the special cases which occurred . There were fixed peri ods when they assembled without notice given , " regular law-days ; " and if an emergency occurred , they were summoned on " extraordinary law-days . " Here wrongs between party and party , and offences against the public , were set right by the " Country , " the " Body of the county , " that is , by the bulk of the population . The majority carried the day . 5 . At length it was found inconvenient for so large a body to inves tigate each particular case , or to determine what cases should be pre sented for investigation . ( 1 . ) So this preliminary examination was delegated to a smaller body of men , sworn to discharge the trust faithfully , who made inquiry as to offences committed , and reported the criminals for trial to the full meeting , the actual " Body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first organized and sworn " Jury ; " " the grand inquest ; " here is pop ular Indictment by delegates . ( 2 . ) Then it was found inconvenient for a large body the whole country to investigate the cases presented . Men were busy with their own work , and did not wish to appear and consume their time . So a smaller body of men was summoned to attend to any special case which was presented by the Grand Inquest . These also were sworn to do their duty . They were to try the men indicted . Here is Trial by sworn delegates , who represent the Body of the People . They were still called the " Country , " as any spot of the Atlantic is the " Ocean . " Here is the " Trial by Jury . " They must be taken from the neighborhood of the parties concerned for at this stage the jurors were also the witnesses , and other sworn witnesses were not then known . All the Jurors must concur in the vote of condemna tion before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still after the people had delegated their law-making to one body of sworn representatives , and the twofold function of law-applying , by Indictment and Trial , to other sworn representatives , there was yet a a great concourse of people attending the court on the " law-days ; " especially when important matters came up for adjudication ; then the crowd of people took sides with Plaintiff or Defendant ; with the authorities which accused , or with the man on trial , as the case might be . Sometimes , when the Jury acquitted , the people tore the sus pected man to pieces ; sometimes when the Jury condemned , they showed their indignation nay , rescued the prisoner . For the old tradition of actual trial by the " Body of the Country " still prevailed . 6 . At length the Jurors are no longer the witnesses in the case . /z/ Others testify before them , and on the evidence which is offered , the Grand-Jury indict or not , and the Trial Jury acquit or condemn . Then the Jurors are no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only from his district or county . But sworn witnesses from the neighborhood , depose to the facts . There is no longer a great concourse of people in the open air , but the trial is carried on in a small court house , yet with open doors , in the face of the people , coram populo public opinion still influences the Jury . As most of the Jurors were unlearned men , not accustomed to intri cate questions , it became necessary for the presiding judge , a man of nicer culture , to prepare rules of evidence which should prevent the matter from becoming too complicated for the rustic judgment . Thence came the curious and strange " rules of evidence " which prevail in all countries where trial by Jury is established , but are un known in lands where the trial is conducted solely by experts , edu cated men . But as the mass of the people , as in America , become well informed , the old rules appear ridiculous , and will perish . The number of sworn judges varies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve has long been a sacred number with the Anglo-Saxons , that was gradually fixed for the Jury . Twelve consent ing voices are indispensable for the indictment or the condemnation . Such is the form of the Jury as we find it at this day . The other officers have also undergone a change . So , Gentlemen , let me give you a brief sketch of the Historical Formation of the Function of the Judge in nations of the same ethnological origin . Here I shall men tion four steps . 1 . At the meetings of the people to make , apply , and execute the law , some one must preside to keep order , put the question , and declare the vote . He was the Moderator of the meeting . At first it would seem that some important man , a priest , or a noble , or some other wise , distinguished , or popular man , performed that function . The business over , he dropped into his private place again . A new one was chosen at each meeting . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was cho sen the next time ; again and again ; at length it was a matter of course that he should preside . He studied the matter , and became " expert in all the manners and customs of his nation . " This happens in most of the New England towns , where the same man is Moderator at the town-meetings for many years in succession . Men love to walk in the path they have once trodden , even if not the shortest way to their end . 3 . When the nation is organized more artificially and the laws chiefly proceed from the secondary source , the government , elective or usurpatory a judge is appointed by the central authority to visit /z/ the districts ( counties ) and assist at the administration of justice . As the law is now made by the distant delegates , the judge they send down declares and explains it to the people , for they have not made it as before directly , nor found it ready-made , an old inherited custom , but only receive it as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is written the officer can read while they have no copy of the law , or could not read it had they the book . Hence the necessity of a judge learned in the law . Still the people are to apply the written law or apply it not . Besides , the old customs remain , the unwritten laws of the people , which the judge does not understand so well as they . He represents the written law , the assembly the unwritten custom or tradition . The judge is appointed that he may please the central power ; the people are only to satisfy such moral convictions as they have . There is often a conflict between the statute and the custom , a conflict of laws ; and still more between the judge and the jury a conflict in respect to the application of the law . 4 . Then comes the critical period of the Trial by Jury . For the deputed judge seeks to enlarge his jurisdiction , to enforce his law , often against the customs and the consciences of the People , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks technically at the statute , the provisional Means of law , not at Justice the ultimate Purpose of law . To the " Country , " the " Body of the People , " or to the jury of inquest and of trial , he assumes not to suggest the law and its appli cation , but absolutely to dictate it to them . He claims the exclusive right to decide on the Law and its Application ; the jury is only to determine the Fact whether the accused did the deed charged or not . If the judge succeeds in this battle , then tyranny advances step by step ; the jury is weakened ; its original function is curtailed ; certain classes of cases are taken from its jurisdiction ; it becomes only the tool of the government , and finally is thrown aside . Popular lawmaking is gone ; popular law-applying is also gone ; local self-govern ment disappears and one homogeneous centralized tyranny takes the place of the manifold Freedom of the people . So the trial by jury faded out of all the South-Teutonic people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandinavian North . But the AngloSaxon , mixing his blood with Danes and Normans , his fierce kinsfolk of the same family , has kept and improved this ancient institution . When King or Parliament made wicked laws , or appointed corrupt and cruel men for judges , the People have held this old ancestral shield between the tyrant and his victim . Often cloven through or thrust aside , the Saxon Briton never abandons this . The Puritan swam the Atlantic with this on his arm and now all the Anglo- /z/ Saxon tribe reverences this defence as the Romans their twelve AONCILIA , the mythic shield which " fell from Heaven . " l After so much historic matter , Gentlemen , it is now easy to see what is THE FUNCTION OF THE JURY AT THIS TIME . Here I make three points . I. They are to decide the QUESTION OF FACT , the matter charged , and determine whether the accused did the deed alleged to be done . That is the first step to determine the Fact . II . They are to decide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to the Deed done , and determine whether there is such a statute or custom , and whether it denounces such a Deed as a Crime assigning thereto a punishment . That is the second step to determine the Law . III . They are to decide the QUESTION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACT , and to determine whether that special statute shall be applied to the particular person who did the deed charged against him . That is the third step to determine the Application of the Law . Gentlemen , I shall speak a few words on each of these points , treating the matter in the most general way . By and by I shall apply these general doctrines to this special case . I. The jury is to DECIDE THE QUESTION OF FACT ; to answer , Did the accused do the deed alleged , at the time and place alleged , with the alleged purpose and producing the alleged result ? The answer will be controlled by the Evidence of sworn witnesses , who depose under a special oath to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the truth . " Their Evidence is the Testimony as to the Fact , - the sole testimony ; the jury is the ultimate arbiter to decide on the credibility of the evidence , part by part , and its value as a whole . Sometimes it is an easy matter to answer this Question of Fact ; sometimes exceedingly difficult . If there be doubts they must weigh for the accused , who is held innocent until proven guilty . With us the theory that the jury is the exclusive judge of the Question of Fact is admitted on all sides . But in England it has often happened that the judge instructs the jury to " find the facts " so and so ; that is he undertakes to decide the Question of Fact . 1 In this brief sketch I do not refer to the authorities , but see , who will , the classic passages and proof-texts in the well-known works of Grimm , Ilogge , Biener , Michelsen , Mb ser , Phillips , Eichhorn , Maurer , and others . /z/ In libel cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to determine what constitutes a libel , and to decide on the inten tions of the accused ; that is to decide the most important part of the complex and manifold Question of Fact . For it is as much a ques tion of fact to determine what constitutes a libel , as what constitutes theft , the animus libellandi as much as the animus furandi . Some times juries have been found so lost to all sense of manhood , or so ignorant of their duties , as to submit to this judicial insolence and usurpation . If the Jury decide the Question of Fact in favor of the accused , their inquiry ceases at that step , they return their verdict , " NOT GUILTY ; " and the affair is ended . But if they find he did the deed as charged , then comes the next function of the Jury . II . The Jury are to DECIDE THE QUESTION OF LAW . Is there a stat ute or custom denouncing a penalty on that special deed ? is the statute constitutional ? To determine this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own knowledge . 1 . The Testimony of the Governments Attorney . The Government itself is his client , and he gives such a statement of the law as suits the special purposes of the rulers and his own private and particular interest , selects such statutes , customs , and decisions , as will serve this purpose , and declares , Such is the law . Nay , he makes infer ences from the law , and thereby infers new customs , and constructs new statutes , invents new crimes . He treats the law as freely as he treats the facts making the most that is possible against the party accused . You have seen already what tricks Government attorneys have played , how they pervert and twist the law making it assume shapes never designed by its original makers . He gives his opinion as to the law , as he gave an opinion as to the fact . This is not necessarily his per sonal and actual , but only his official and assumed opinion what he wishes the Jury to think is law in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Attorney . The accused is his client . He is to do all he can to represent the law as favorable as pos sible to the man on trial . He gives an opinion of the law , not his personal and actual , but his official and assumed opinion what he wishes the Jury to think is law in this particular case . 3 . The Testimony of the Judge on the Bench . But in the English courts , and the Federal courts of the United States , he is commonly no more than a government attorney in disguise ; I speak only of the general rule , not the exceptions to it . He has received his office as the reward for party services was made a judge because he was one-sided as a lawyer . In all criminal cases he is expected to twist the law to the advantage of the hand that feeds him . Especially is this so in all Political trials that is , prosecutions for opposition to /z/ the party which the judge represents . The judge may be impartial , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gives an opinion of the law , not his personal and actual , but his official and assumed opinion what he wishes the jury to think is law in this particular case . For the court also is a stage , and the judges , as well as the attorneys , may be players , " And one man in his time play many parts . " Of these three classes of witnesses , no one gives evidence under spe cial oath to tell the law , the whole law , and nothing but the law or if it be so understood , then all these men are sometimes most grossly and notoriously perjured ; but each allows himself large latitude in declaring the law . The examples I have already cited , show that the judge often takes quite as wide a range as the attorney-general , or the prisoner s counsel . As the jury hears the manifold evidence as to the facts , and then makes up its mind thereon and decides the Question of Fact , often rejecting the opinion of various witnesses , as ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forsworn ; so will the jury hear the mani fold and often discrepant evidence as to the law , and then make up their mind thereon and decide the Question of Law , often rejecting the opinion of various witnesses thereupon as ignorant , partial , preju diced , or plainly false and forsworn . In regard to the Fact , the jury is limited to the evidence adduced in court . What any special juror knows from any other source is not relevant there to procure conviction . But in regard to the Law there is no such restriction ; for if the jury know the law better than these three classes of witnesses for it in court , then the jury are to follow their better knowledge . At any rate , the jury are to make up their minds on this question of Law , and for themselves determine what the special Law is . Every man is to be held innocent until proved guilty until the special Deed charged is proved against him , and until that special deed is proved a Crime . The jury is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fact , nor the prisoner s counsel s opinion of the Fact , nor yet the judge s opinion thereon ; but to form their own opinion , from the evidence offered to make up their own judgment as to the Fact . So likewise they are not to take the government attor ney s opinion of the Law , or the prisoner s counsel s opinion of the Law , nor yet the judge s opinion thereon ; but from all the evidence offered , not otherwise known to them , to make up their own judgment as to the Law . After they have done so if they decide the Law in favor of the accused , the process stops there . The man goes free ; for /z/ it does not appear that his deed is unlawful . But if the jury find the Law against the deed , they then proceed to their third function . III . The jury is to decide the QUESTION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACT . Here is the question : " Ought the men who have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby ? " The government attorney and the judge are of the opin ion that the law should be thus applied to this case , but they can not lay their finger on him until the jury , specially sworn " well and truly to try and true deliverance make , " have unanimously come to that opinion , and say , " Take him and apply the law to him . " The Deed may be clear and the Statute clear , while the Application thereof to the man who did the deed does not follow , and ought not to follow . For 1 . It is not designed trfat the full rigor of every statute shall be applied to each deed done against the letter thereof . The statute is a great sleeping Lion , not to be roused up when everybody passes triat way . This you see from daily practice of the courts . It remains in the Discretion of the Attorney to determine what offences he will present to the Grand-Jury , he passes by many , and selects such as he thinks ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand-Jury to determine whom they will indict , for sometimes when the Fact and Law are clear enough to them , they yet find " no bill " or ignore the matter . And after the man is indicted , it still remains in the Discretion of the Attorney to determine whether he will prose cute the accused , or pass him by . Indeed I am told that the very Grand- Jury who found the bills which have brought you and me face to face , hesitated to indict a certain person on account of some cir cumstances which rendered his unlawful act less deserving of the legal punishment : the Attorney told them he thought they had better find a bill , and he would enter a nolle prosequi in court , plainly admitting that while the Law and the Pact were both clear , that the Grand-Jury were to determine in their Discretion whether they would apply the law to that man , whether they would indict or not ; and the Attorney whether he would prosecute or forbear . It remains equally in the Discretion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawful deed shall be punished whether the spirit of that statute and the Purpose of Law requires the punishment which it allows . 2 . Besides , in deciding this question the jurors are not only to consider the one particular statute brought against the prisoner , but the whole Complex of Customs , Statutes , and Decisions , making up the Body of Law , and see if that requires the application of this spe cial statute to this particular deed . Here are two things to be con sidered. /z/ ( 1 . ) The general Purpose of the whole Body of Laws , the Object aimed at : and ( 2 . ) The Means for attaining the end . Now the Purpose of Law being the main thing , and the statute only subsidiary to that purpose , the question comes " Shall we best achieve that Purpose by thus applying the statute , or by not applying it ? " This rests with the Jury in their Discretion to determine . 3 . Still more , the Jury have consciences of their own , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever morally oblige them to violate . So they are to inquire , " Is it right in the sight of God , in the light of our consciences , to apply this special statute to this particular case and thus punish this man for that unlawful deed ? " Then they are to ask , also , " Was the deed naturally wrong : done from a wrong motive , for a wrong purpose ? " If not , then be the statute and the whole complex of laws what they may , it can never be right for a jury to punish a man for doing a right deed , however unlawful that deed may be . No oath can ever make it right for a man to do what is wrong , or what he thinks wrong to punish a man for a just deed ! But if the twelve men think that the Law ought not to be applied in this case they find " not guilty , " and he goes free ; if otherwise , " guilty , " and he is delivered over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge passes such sentence as the Law and his Discretion point out . The judge commonly , and especially in political trials , undertakes to decide the two last Questions himself , determining the Law and the Application thereof , and that by his Discretion . He wishes to leave nothing to the Discretion of the jury , who thus have only the single function of deciding the Question of Fact , which is not a Matter of Discretion that is , of moral judgment , but only a logical deduc tion from evidence , as the testimony compels . He would have no moral element enter into their verdict . The judge asks the jury to give him a deed of the ground on which he will erect such a building as suits his purpose , and then calls the whole thing the work of the jury , who only granted the land ! But this assumption of the judges ultimately and exclusively to decide the question of Law and its Application , is a tyrannous usur pation. ( 1 . ) It is contrary to the fundamental Idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It leads to monstrous tyranny by putting the Property , Liberty , and Life of every man at the mercy of the government officers , who determine the Law and its Application , leaving for the jury only the /z/ bare question of Fact , which the judge can so manage in many cases as to rain most virtuous and deserving men . ( 3 . ) Not only in ancient times did the jury decide the three ques tions of Fact , of Law , and of its special Application , but in cases of great magnitude they continue to do so now , in both America and England , and sometimes in direct contradiction to the commands of the judges . Gentlemen of the Jury , if you perform this threefold function , then you see the exceeding value of this mode of trial , 1 . For the punishment of wrong deeds done against the law , done by the unorganized selfishness of thieves , housebreakers , murderers , and other workers of unrighteousness ; 2 . And also for the prevention of wrong deeds attempted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the makers and officers thereof . For in each special case brought to trial , the jury are judges of the Law and of its Application . They can not make a law statute or custom nor repeal one ; but in each particular case they must demand or forbid its execution . These Tribunes of the Saxon Peo ple have no general veto on law-making , and can efface no letter from the statute-book , but have a special and imperative veto on each case for the Application of the law . Justice , the point common to the interests of all men , yes , the point common to God and our Conscience , is the Aim and Purpose of Law in general ; if it be not that the law is so far unnatural , immoral , and of no obligation on the conscience of any man . The special Statute , Custom , or Decision , is a provisional Means to that end ; if just , a moral means and adequate , in kind ; if unjust , an immoral means , inadequate in kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the Purpose of all Law . Accordingly , if by an accident , a special statute is so made that its application in a particu lar case would do injustice and so defeat the Design and Purpose of Law itself , then the function of the jury under their oath requires them to preserve the End of law by refusing to apply the provisional statute to an unjust use . And if by design a statute is made in order to do injustice to any man as it has very often happened in England as well as America , then the jury will accomplish their function by refusing to apply that statute to any particular case . So will they fulfil their official oath , and conserve the great ultimate Purpose of Law itself . Gentlemen , you will ask me where shall the jury find the Rule of Right , and how know what is just , what not ? In your own Con science , Gentlemen ; not in the conscience of the Attorney for the /z/ Plaintiff- Government , or the accused Defendant ; not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technical " opinion " of the lawyers , or the ambition , the venality , the personal or purchased rage of the court . Of course you will get such help as you can find from judges , attorneys , and the public itself , but then decide as you must decide each man in the light of his own conscience , under the terrible and beautiful eyes of God . How does the juror judge of the Credibility of Evidence ? By the " opinion " of the lawyers on either side ? by the judge s " opinion , " or that of the community ? No one would dare determine thus . He decides personally by his own com mon sense , not vicariously by another s opinion . And as you decide the Matter of Fact by your own Discretion of Intellect , so will you decide the Matter of Right by your own Discretion of Conscience . Gentlemen , when the jury do their official duty it becomes impossi ble to execute a statute , or custom , or to enforce a decision which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be applied . But if the judge usurps these two functions of the jury , and him self decides the Question of Law and its Application , you see what follows consequences the most ghastly , injustice in the name of Law , and with the means of Law ! Yes , tyranny spins and weaves with the machinery of Freedom , and a Nessus-shirt of bondage is fixed on the tortured body of the People . The power of the judge will be especially dangerous in times of political excitement , and in political trials . Gentlemen , this matter is so important , and the danger now so im minent that you will pardon me a few words while I set forth the mode by which this wickedness goes to work , and what results it brings to pass . Follow me in some details . I. As to the judges dealing with the Grand-Jury . Here let ine take the examples from the circuit court of the United States in a supposed case where a man is to be tried for violating the fugitive slave bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . 1 . The judge challenges the whole body summoned as grand-jurors and catechizes them after this fashion . ( 1 . ) " Have you formed an opinion that the law of the United States , known as the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 , is Unconstitu tional , so that you can not indict a person under it for that reason , although the court holds the statute to be Constitutional ? " This is riddling No. 1 . Such as think the fugitive slave bill uncon stitutional are at once set aside . The judge proceeds to ask such as have no doubt that it is constitutional , ( 2 . ) " Do you hold any opinions on the subject of Slavery in /z/ general , or of the Fugitive Slave Law in special , which would induce you to refuse to indict a man presented to you for helping his brother to freedom ? " This is riddling No. 2 ; other " good men and true " are rejected , but some are found " faithful " to the purposes of the court ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " Will you accept for Law whatever the court declares such ? " This is riddling No. 3 . Still the judge finds three-and-twenty men small enough to pass through all these sieves . They are to be " the jury . " All the men who deny the constitutionality of the wicked statute ; all who have such reverence for the unalienable Rights of man and for the Natural Law of God that they would not prevent a Christian from aiding his brother to escape from bondage ; all who have such respect for their own manhood that they will not swear to take a judge s word for law before they hear it are shut out from the " grand inquest ; " they are no part of the " Country , " or the " Body of the county , " are not " good men and true . " Gentlemen of the Jury , consider the absurdity of swearing to take for law what another man will declare to be law , and before you hear it ! Suppose the judge should be drunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sermon on the Mount , those noble words " Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , do ye even so unto them , " are jurors to believe him ? What if the judge should be sober , and declare it a " misdemeanor " to call the fugitive slave bill a wicked and hateful statute , and all who thus offended should be put in jail for twelve months ! Are honest men to take such talk for American law ? The jurors then take this oath which the clerk reads them : " You , as a member of this Inquest for the District of Massachu setts , shall diligently inquire and true presentment make of all such matters and things as shall be given you in charge ; the counsel of the United States , your fellows , and your own you shall keep secret ; you shall present no man for envy , hatred , or revenge ; neither shall you leave any man unpresented for love , fear , favor , affection , or hope of reward ; but you shall present things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of your understanding . So help you God ! " 1 Then the judge appoints the most pliant member of the jury as " foreman " selecting , if possible to find him , some postmaster or other official of the government , or some man marked for his injustice or venality , who may have the desirable influence with his fellows . 2 . The next thing is to moisten this material thus trebly sifted , and /z/ mould it into such vessels of tyranny as he can fill with his private or judicial wrath and then empty on the heads of his personal foes or such as thwart his ambitious despotism or the purposes of his govern ment . So he delivers his CHARGE TO THE GRAND-JURY . By way of introduction , he tells them ( 1 . ) That they are not the Makers of Law . Legislation is the function of Congress and the President ; even the COURT , the " SU PREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES " itself can not make a law , or repeal one ! ( 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Law . To know and set forth the Law is the function of the COURT . It is true every man in his personal capacity , as private citizen , is supposed to know the law , and if he violates it , of his own presumption , or by the per suasion of some others who falsely tell him about the law , he must be punished ; for " ignorantia nemini excusat " ignorance excuseth none ; the private advice of the full bench of judges would be held no excuse . But in their official capacity of jurors they are supposed to know nothing of the Law whatsoever . It seems taken for granted that though one of the Jurors may be an old judge of the Supreme Court of the United States , and have sat on the . bench for twenty years ; nay , though he may be also an old legis lator of twenty years standing , and as legislator have made the very statute in question , and also as judge subsequently have explained and declared it , yet the moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gone from him " as completely as Nebuchad nezzar s dream . The court is the assembly of magicians , astrolo gers , sorcerers , and Chaldeans to restore it . Congress might pass a law compelling ex-judges , ex-senators , and ex-representatives who are so numerous now-a-days , and continually increasing and likely to multiply yet more , to serve as grand-jurors ; soon as they take their oath , they are in law held and accounted to be utterly ignorant of law , and bound to accept as law whatsoever the court declares such . The acting judge may be young , blind , ignorant , ambitious , drunk with brandy or rage , he may have a personal interest in promoting the law , and may notoriously twist it so as to gratify his peculiar or familistic spleen , still the jury is to accept the court s opinion for the nation s law . Any political ignoramus , if hoisted to the " bench , " has judicial authority to declare the law , it is absolute . If he errs , " he is responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but the jury must not question the infallibility of his opinion . For though the grand-jury is " the country , " the judge is not only all that , and more so ; but is " the rest of mankind " besides . Then the judge goes further talks solemnly yet familiar ; to whee dle jurors the better , he mixes himself with them , his " WE " embracing /z/ both judge and jury . I shall now quote actual language used in this very court , by the late Hon. Judge Woodbury : " One of the peculiar dangers ... to which jurors , as well as judges , are exposed , 5s the unpopularity , or obnoxiousness ... of any particular law , which has been violated , leading us ... to be timid or unfaithful in enforcing it ... the subjectmatter being a delicate or offensive one . " " While we ... are holding the scales as well as the sword of Justice , in humble imitation of the Divine Judge on high , " it is our duty to " let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just or unjust reign supreme , reign equally over all , and as to all things , no less than persons ; and till it is changed by the proper authorities , not to interpose our individual caprices or fancies or speculations that is , our convictions of justice to defeat its due course and triumph " We must not " disregard laws , when disliked , because we can , under the universal suffrage enjoyed here , otherwise help legally to change or annul them by our votes . " " As jurors you have sworn to obey them till so changed , and ought to stand by them faithfully , to the last moment of their existence . " " We are safest in our capacity of public officers . . . to execute the laws as they are right or wrong , while others who may make or retain bad laws in the statute-book , are answerable for their own wrong . If they preserve laws on the statute-book , which are darkness rather than light and life to the people , theirs is the fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell us to stab an inno cent man with it , we must obey , and the blame will rest on the blacksmith who made the dagger , not on the assassin who murdered with it ! In some cases , also , when we think the existing laws and punishments are u rong , and hence venture to encourage others in disobedience by neglecting to indict and punish offenders , it should make us pause and halt when it is remembered , it may turn out that we ourselves may not be exactly Solons or Solomons in these respects , nor quite so much wiser than the laws themselves , as sometimes we are hastily induced to suppose . " " Miserable must be the fate of that community where the ministers of the law are themselves disposed to disre gard it ; " " government will become a curse ; " " and this whether such a betrayal of public trust springs from the delusions of false philanthropy or fanatical prejudices , no less than when it comes from unbridled licentiousness " " We must not lay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility there may not be guilt , we can rightfully discharge as if there were no guilt . " " It is sometimes urged against agreeing to indict , convict , or punish , that we have conscien tious scruples on the subject ; " u if sincere tenderness of conscience presses on the heart and mind against executing some of the laws , it should lead us to decline office or resign ; not to neglect or disobey , while in office , what we have promised and sworn to per form ; " as if the juror swore to do injustice ! " or if a majority prove unaccommodating or inflexible against us , then it behooves those differing from them . . . to withdraw entirely from such a government , and emigrate " So the juror must not try to do jus tice at home , but seek it in exile . " But in all such cases we must take special care not to indulge ourselves in considering an act as a sin which is only disagreeable , or the result of only some prejudice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanc tioned , by such intelligent , numerous , and respectable members of society as compose our legislative bodies , are constitutional , and until pronounced otherwise by the proper tribunal , the judiciary , it is perilous for jurors to disobey them " that is , to refuse to execute them " and it is trifling with their solemn obligations to disregard them in any way and on any occasion , from constitutional doubts , unless of the clearest and strongest character . " * 1 The above extracts are from Judge Woodbury s charge to the Grand-Jury , in Circuit Court of United StAes , at Boston , taken from the Evening Traveller , copying the reprint of Boston Daily Advertiser , of October 25 , 1850. /z/ He then tells them that no feeling- of Humanity must be allowed to prevent them from executing any law which the court declares to them , " whether the statute is a harsh one , is not for us to deter mine . " a A cruel law is to be enforced as vigorously as a humane one ; an unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defeat the pur pose of Law itself , just as readily as one which aims to secure the dearest rights of humanity . If the statute is notoriously wicked , as in the case supposed , then the Judge says : " It is to be observed that this statute the fugitive slave bill subjects no person to arrest who was not before liable to be seized and carried out of the State ; " " Congress has enacted this law . It is imperative , and it will be enforced . Let no man mistake the mildness and forbearance with which the criminal code is habitually administered , as in cases of engaging in the slave-trade for weakness or timidity . Resistance to the fugitive slave bill must make it sternly inflexible " " As great efforts have been made to convince the public that the recent law the fugitive slave bill can not be enforced with a good conscience , but may be conscientiously resisted ... I deem it proper to advert , briefly , to the moral aspects of the subject . " " The States without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Those , there fore , who have the strongest convictions of the immorality of the insti tution of slavery , are not thereby authorized to conclude that h &; pro vision for delivering up fugitive slaves is morally wrong , that is , if it be wrong to hold man in bondage , it is also not wrong , or that our Fathers . . . did not act wisely , justly , and humanely in acceding to the compacts of the Constitution . " " Even those who go to the extreme of condemning the Constitution and the laws made under it , as unjust and immoral , can not . . . justify resistance . In their view , such laws are inconsistent with the justice and benevolence and against the will of the Supreme Lawgiver , and they emphatically ask , ; Which shall we obey , the law of man , or the Will of God ? I answer , OBEY BOTH ! The incompatibility which the question as sumes between Right and Wrong , or Good and Evil , or God and the Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be passed by human governments . But if Infinite and Inscrutable Wis dom permits political society , having the power of human legislation , to establish such laws , may not the same Infinite and Inscrutable Wisdom permit and require an individual , who has no such power , to obey them ? " So " if Infinite and Inscrutable Wisdom permits " a Blacksmith 1 Words of Chief Justice Parker , in Commonwealth vs . Griffith , 2 Pickering s Re ports , 19 , cited with approbation by Chief Justice Shaw , in the Sims case , 7 Cushing s Reports , 705 , and also cited from him and acted on by fugitive slave bill Commissioner Loring , in the Burns case . /z/ " having the power " to forge steel and temper it , to make daggers , " may not the same Infinite and Inscrutable Wisdom permit and require the individual " carpenter or tailor , who has no such power , to use the dagger for the purpose intended ! " Conscience , indeed , is to be reverenced , and obeyed ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the rights of others are concerned , that is , the right to kidnap men and may lead us to do great injustice , by refusing to punish a man who helps his brother enjoy his self-evident , natural , and unalienable right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happi ness . The annals of the world abound with enormities committed by a narrow and darkened conscience . " A statute " is the moral judgment , the embodied conscience of the political community , the fugitive slave bill the embodied conscience of New England . To this not only is each individual bound to submit , right or wrong , but it is a new and controlling element informing his own moral judg ment ; " that is , he must think the statute is just . " Obedience is a moral duty , no matter how immoral the law may be . This is as certain as that the Creator made man a social being ; " " to obey the laws of the land no matter what laws , or how wicked soever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gentlemen of the Jury , you think I have imagined and made up this language out of my own fancy . No , Gentlemen , I could not do it . I have not the genius for such sophistry . I only quote the words of the Hon. Judge Peleg Sprague delivered to the grand-jury of this Circuit Court of United States at Boston , March 18 , 1851. 1 Gentle men , I showed you what Thurlow could say at Home Tooke s trial on the 4th of July , 1777 . Nay , I quoted the words of Powis and Allybone , and Scroggs and Jeffreys . 2 But , Gentlemen , the judge of New England transcends the judges of Old England . 3 . Having made this general preparation for his work and shaped his vessel to the proper form , he proceeds to fill it with the requisite matter . ( 1 . ) He practically makes the Law just as he likes , so as to suit the general purpose of the government , or the special purpose of his private vengeance or ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law statutes , decisions , customs , charges , opinions of judicial men , since the Norman conquest or be fore it , he selects that special weapon which will serve his present turn . And tells the jury , " that is the law which you are sworn to enforce . I have not made it it is the Lex terra ? , the Law of the /z/ Land . " Or if in such an arsenal , so copious , he finds no weapon ready made , then b . Out of that pile of ancient instruments he selects something which he forges over anew , and thus constructs a new form of law when he could not find one ready for his hand . If a straight statute will not catch the intended victims he perverts it to a hook and there with lays hold . He thus settles the law . ( 2 . ) He next practically determines what Deed constitutes the " offence " forbidden by the law he has just made . So he selects some act which it is notorious was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the " offence , " the " crime . " Here too he is aided by ancient precedent ; whereof if our brief Republican annals do not furnish examples , he hies to the exhaustless treasury of Despotism in the English common law . He opens the " Reports , " the " Statutes of the Realm , " or goes back to the " Year-books . " Antiquity is rich in examples of tyranny . " He readily finds a stick who would beat a dog . " " Such are the opinions , " quoth he , " of the venerable Chief Justice Jones , " or " my Lord Chancellor Finch , " or " Baron Tvvysden , " or " my Lord Chief Justice Kelyng . " Thus the Judge constructs the Jury out of such men as he wishes for his purpose ; constructs the Law , constructs the Offence , the Crime : nay . he points out the particular Deed so plain that he constructs the Indictment . All that is left for the " Grand Inquest " is the mechanical work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Billa Vera " a true bill . That they may accomplish this work he delivers them over to the District Attorney ; he may be also an agent of the government , appointed for his party services , looking for his reward , expecting future pay for present work , extra pay for uncommon zeal and " discretion . " Gentlemen of the Jury , this may be the case humanity is fallible , and it sometimes may happen even in the Circuit Court of the United States that such a man should hold the office of District Attorney . For it is not to be expected , nay , it is what we should not even ask that this place should always be filled by such conspicuous talent , such consummate learn ing , and such unblemished integrity as that of the present attorney ( Hon. Mr. Hallett ) . No , Gentlemen of the Jury , as I look round these walls I am proud of my country ! Such a District Attorney , so bearing " his great commission in his look ; " his political course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; high-minded , the very Caesar s wife of democratic virtue , spotless and unsus pected ; never seeking office , yet alike faithful to his principles and his party ; and with indignant foot spurning the Administration s bootless bribe , the fact outtravels fancy . Nay , Gentlemen , ; is something /z/ to be an American I feel it as I look about me . For the honorable Attorney is perfectly suited to this Honorable Court ; yea , to the Administration which gives them both their dignity and their work and its pay . Happy country with such an Attorney , fortunate with such a Court , but thrice and four times fortunate when such several stars of justice unite in such a constellation of juridic fire ! But , Gentlemen , it is too much to ask of human nature that it should be always so . In my supposed case , the judge delivers the persons accused to the officers , restless , bellowing , and expecting some fodder to be pitched down to them from the national mow , already licking their mouths which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court desires . Then the Attorney talks with the most pliant jurors , coaxes them , wheedles them , stimulates them to do what he wants done . Some he threatens with the " displeasure of the gov ernment ; " he swears at some . After all , if the jury refuse to find a bill . a case , Gentlemen , which has happened , they are discharged ; and a new jury is summoned ; some creature of the government is put on it , nay , perhaps some kinsman of the anxious judge , at least a Brother-in-Law , and at last twenty-three men are found of whom twelve consent to a " True Bill/ Then great is the joy in the judge s heart , it is corrupt judges I am speaking of , Gentlemen of the Jury , not of upright and noble men , may it please your Honors ! There is great joy in the judge s heart , and great rejoicing amongst his kinsfolk and intimate friends who whinney and neigh over it in the public journals , and leer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy for his vengeance ! II . Now , Gentlemen , look next at the judge s dealing with the Trial-Jury . He proceeds as before . 1 . He sifts the material returned to him , through those three sieves of questioning , and gets a Jury with no hard individual lumps of solid personal independence . They take the oath which you have just taken , Gentlemen : " You shall well and truly try the issue between the United States and the Defendant at the Bar , according to the law , and the evidence given you , so help you God ! " The facts are then presented , and the case argued on both sides . 2 . The Judge sums up , and charges the Jury . He explains their oath ; to try the issue according- to the law does not mean ( a ) accord ing to the whole complex which is called " Law " or " The Law " but according only to that particular statute which forbids the deed charged , for otherwise the Jury must judge of the Purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rightfulness of the deed and of the statute which forbids it . Nor does it mean ( b ) by the Jurors notion of that statute , but only by the Judge s opinion thereof . He /z/ tells them if they proceed to inquire into the natural Justice of the deed , or into the law which forbids it , then they transcend their office , and are guilty of " Perjury , " and reads them the statute for the pun ishment of that offence , and refers to examples from the times of the Stuarts , though he does not mention that when Jurors were fined and otherwise severely dealt with for daring to resist a judge . Then out of the facts testified to by the government witnesses , he selects some one which is best supported , of which there is no doubt . He then declares that the question of " Guilty or not guilty " turns on that point . If the accused did that deed then he is Guilty . So the moral question , " Has the man done a wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual question , " Has he done a deed which amounts to the crime forbidden ? " is not before them ; only the mechanical question , " Did he do that particular act ? " They are not to inquire as to the Justice of the law , its Constitution ality , or its Legality ; nor the Justice or the Criminality of the deed only of its Actuality , Did he do this deed ? Nay , sometimes the Judge treats them as cattle , and orders them to find the facts for the government . If they refuse , he threatens them with punishment . Thus he constructs the Trial-Jury , the Law , the Evidence , the Crime , and the Fact . Now , Gentlemen , when this is done and done thoroughly , the Judge has kept all the Forms , Presentment by the Grand-Jury , and Trial by a Petty Jury ; but the substance is all gone ; the Jury is only a stalking horse , and behind it creeps the Judicial servant of Tyranny , armed with the blunderbuss of law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of law , but against Jus tice , that purpose of all law . Thus can tyranny be established while all the forms of law are kept . 1 Gentlemen of the Jury , let me make this more clear by a special case wholly fictitious . Thomas Nason , a " Non-Resistant " and a Quaker , is a colored citizen of Boston , the son and once the slave of Hon. James Nason of Virginia , but now legally become a free man by self-purchase ; he has the bill of sale of himself in his pocket , and so carries about him a title deed which would perhaps satisfy your Honors of his right to liberty . But his mother Lizzie ( Ran dolph ) Nason , a descendant of both Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison , for Virginia , I am told , can boast of many children descended from two Presidents , perhaps from three , who " Boast the pure blood of an illustrious race , In quiet flow from Lucrece to Lucrece " /z/ from Saxon master to African slave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father of her son Thomas . From the " Plan tation manners " of her master , the concubine , " foolishly dissatisfied with slavery , " flies to Boston , and takes refuge with her Quaker son , who conceals his mother , and shelters her for a time . But let me suppose that his Honor Judge Curtis , while at Washington , fired with that patriotism which is not only habitual but natural and indigenous to his Honor , informs Mr. Nason of the hiding-place of his female slave , thus betraying a " mistress " to her master , no longer , alas , her " keeper . " It is no injurious imputation it is an imaginary honor I attribute to the learned and honorable Judge . Mr. Nason sends the proper agent to Boston to save the Union of States by restor ing the union of master and slave . Mr. George Ticknor Curtis , fugitive slave bill commissioner , and brother to the Hon. Judge , issues his warrant for kidnapping the mother ; his coadjutor and friend , Mr. Butman , attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unarmed , resists the intruder , and with a child s pop-gun drives that valiant officer out of the house , and puts the mother in a place of safety , beneath the flag of England , or the Pope , or the Czar . Commis sioner Curtis telegraphs the news to Washington announcing a " NEW CASE OF TREASON more levying war ! The Secretaries of State and of War write dreadful letters , breathing fire and slaughter , and President Pierce , a man of most heroic courage , alike mindful of his former actual military exploits at Chapultepec , of his delegated triumph at Greytown , and of the immortal glory of Mr. Fillmore , issues his Proclamation , calling on all good citizens , and especially on the politicians of his party , to " Save the Union " from the trea son of this terrible Thomas Nason , who will blow up the Constitu tion with a pop-gun ! At the next session of the Honorable Circuit Court of the United States in and for the first District , his Honor the Hon. Benjamin Robbins Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner already set forth . He instructs them that if any man , by force and arms , namely , with a pop-gun , does resist a body of United States officers , attempting to kidnap a woman , his own mother , that he thereby levies war against the United States , and accordingly commits the crime of " Treason " which consists in levying war against the United States the " amount of force is not material . " And it is their duty to indict all persons in that form offending . The Attorney , the Hon Benjamin Franklin Hallett , offers to " bet ten dol lars that 1 will get " Nason " indicted , " and urges the matter . But no bill is found , the Jury is discharged , a new Jury is summoned , and Mr. William W. Greenough , the Brother-in-law of the Judge is pat on /z/ it , " drawn as Juror " and then a " true bill " is found , Mr. Hallett actually making an indictment that can not be quashed ! On the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial for this new Boston Massacre on the anniversary of the old one on the Fifth of March . The judge constructs a TrialJury as before . Mr. Hallett , assisted by Mr. Thomas , Mr. George T. Curtis , and Commissioner Loring , manage the case for the govern ment , bringing out the whole strength of the kidnapping party , and directing this Macedonian phalanx of Humanity and Law and Piety against a poor friendless negro . Mr. Hale , Mr. Ellis , and Mr. Dana defend him . Officer Butman and his coadjutors members of the " Marshal s guard " testify that Mr. Nason attacked them with the felonious weapon above named , putting them in mortal bodily fear greater than that which in Mexico once overthrew the ( future ) Presi dent of all this land ! Mr. Herrman , the dealer in toys , testifies that he sold the murderous weapon for twenty-five cents to Mr. Nason who declared that he " could frighten Butman with it ; " that it is of German manufacture , and is called a Knallbiichse ! Judge Curtis sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . ) That they are not to judge of the Law punishing treason , but to take it from the Court . ( 2. ) iRt to judge what Act constitutes the Crime of Trea son , but take that also from the Court , and if the Court decides that offering a pop-gun at a rowdy s breast constitutes the crime of treason , they are to accept the decision as constitutional law . ( 3 . ) They are not to ask if it be just to hang a man for thus resisting a body of men who sought to kidnap his mother , for even if it be unjust and cruel it is none of their concern , for they must execute a cruel and unjust law with even more promptitude than a just and humane one , and in the language of the " Defender of the Constitution , " " con quer their prejudices , " and " do a disagreeable duty . " ( 4 . ) If they think the Law commands one thing and the Will of God exactly the opposite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " obey both " by keeping the law of man when it contradicts the law of God , for they can never be good Christians so long as they scruple to hang a Quaker for driving off a kidnapper ; and obedience to the law is a moral duty , no matter how immoral the law may be , and " to obey the law of the land is to obey the will of God . " ( 5 . ) But they have a simple question of fact to determine ; namely , Did the Defend ant resist officer Butman in the manner set forth ? If satisfied of that , they must find him guilty . No mistaken notions of Justice must induce them to refuse their verdict for they are not to make the law , but only help execute it ; and their conscience is so " fallible , especially when the rights of others are concerned , and may lead them /z/ to do great injustice , " for " the annals of the world abound with enormities committed by a narrow and darkened conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to do so for to use the words of the most religious of all Americans , a man of most unspotted life in public and private , " Religion has nothing to do with politics . find this is a political trial . If there be any injustice in the law and its execu tion the blame lies with the makers thereof not with the jurors , and they may wash their hands as clean as Pilate s from the blood of Christ . Besides , if there be injustice the President can pardon the offender , and from his well-known religious character which rests on the unbiased testimony of his own minister and the statement of several partisan newspapers published in the very heat of the election , when men , and especially politicians looking for office , never exag gerate , he doubtless " will listen to petitions for a commutation of punishment ! " But there is no injustice in it for slavery is part of the lex terrcc , the law of the land , protected by the Constitution itself , which is the Lex Suprema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old ! Besides , " Slavery is not immoral , " not contrary to the public policy of Massachusetts ; and , moreover , the " mother " whom the criminal actually rescued , was a " foreigner " and " whatever rights she had , she had no right here . " l But it is not a cruel or an unchristian thing to require a negro lay man to allow his mother to be kidnapped in his own house especially if she were a born slave , and so by the very law " a chattel personal to all uses , intents , and purposes whatever , " and of course wholly divested of all natural rights , even if a colored person ever had any for an eminent American minister , of one of the most en lightened sects in Christendom , has publicly offered to send his own freeborn mother into bondage for ever ! Moreover , if the jurors do not find a verdict of guilty , then they themselves are guilty of PERJURY ! So the jury , without leaving their seats , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Death-warrant , and Marshal Free man hangs the man to the great joy of the Commissioner s and the Marshal s guard who vacate the brothels once more and attend on that occasion and triumph over the murdered Quaker . But the mischief does not stop there ; the Boston slave-hunters are not yet satisfied with blood ; the judge constructs another grand-jury as before , only getting more of his kinsfolk thereon , and taking his law from the impeached Judges Kelyng and Chase , charges that all 1 See Hon. Judge Curtis s Speech at the Union Meeting in Faueuil Hall , November /z/ persons who advise to an act of levying war , or evince an " express liking " for it , or " approbation " of it , are also guilty of treason ; and " in treason all are Principals . " Accordingly the jury must indict all who have evinced an " express liking " of the rescue , though they did not evince approval of the rescue by such means . It appears that Rev. Mr. Grimes in the meeting-house the Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God would " break the arm of the oppressor and let the oppressed go free ; " that he read from a book called the Old Testament , " Bewray not him that wandereth , " " Hide the outcast , " and other paragraphs and sentences of like seditious nature . Nay , that from the New Testament he had actually read the Sermon on the Mount , especially the Golden Rule and the summing of the Law and the Prophets in one word , Love , and had applied this to the case of fugitive slaves ; moreover , that he had read the xxvth chapter of Matthew from the 31st to the 46th verse , with dreadful emphasis . Nay , anti-slavery men in lectures and in speeches in the Music Hall , which was built by pious people and in Faneuil Hall , which was the old Cradle of Liberty , had actually spoken against man-steal ing , and even against some of the family of kidnappers in Boston ! Still further , he adds , with great solemnity , a woman a negro woman , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her husband that Mr. George T. Curtis , the brother of the judge , had issued his warrant and Mr. But man " with a monstrous watch " was coming to execute it she told her hus band , and incited him to his dreadful crime ! If you find these facts you must convict the prisoners . So thirty or forty more are hanged for treason . Gentlemen of the Jury , these fictitious cases doubtless seem extrav agant to you . I am glad they do . In peaceful times , in the majority of cases there is no disagreement between the law , the judge , and the jurors ; the law is just , or at least is an attempt at justice , the judge wishes to do justice by means thereof , and the jurors aim at the same thing . In such cases there is no motive for doing wrong to any per son : so the judge fairly interprets the righteous and wholesome law , the jurors willingly receive the interpretation and apply it to the special case , and substantial justice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party and party , but also in most of the crimi nal cases between the Public and the Defendant . But in times of great political excitement , in a period of crisis and transition , when one party seeks to establish a despotism and deprive some other class of men of their natural rights , cases like those I have imagined actually happen . Then there is a disagreement between the judge and the jury ; nay , often between the jury and the special statute /z/ wherewith the government seeks to work its iniquity . It is on such occasions that the great value of this institution appears , then the jury hold a shield over the head of their brother and defend him from the malignity of the government and the Goliath of injustiqe , appoint ed its champion to defy the Law of the living God , is smote in the forehead by the smooth stone taken from a country brook , and lies there slain by a simple rustic hand ; for in such cases the jurv fall back on their original rights , judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Law to the Fact , and do justice in spite of the court , at least prevent injustice . Now , Gentlemen of the Jury , I will mention some examples of this kind , partly to show the process by which attempts have been made to establish despotism , that by the English past you may be warned for the American present and future ; and partly that your function in this and all cases may become clear to you and the Nation . The facts of history will show that my fancies are not extravagant . 1 . In April , 1554 , just three hundred and one years ago this very month , in England , Sir Nicolas Throckmorton , a gentleman of dis tinguished family , was brought to trial for high treason . He had held a high military office under Henry VIII . and Edward VI. , but ( ; made himself obnoxious to the Papists , by his adherence to some of the persecuted Reformers . " With his two brothers he attended Anne Askew to her martyrdom when she was burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed to your lives for you are marked men . " He was brought to trial April 17th , 1554 , the first year of Bloody Mary . Of course he was allowed no counsel ; the court was insolent , and demanded his condemnation . But the jury acquitted him ; where upon the court shut the twelve jurors in prison ! Four of them made their peace with the judges , and were delivered : but eight were kept in jail till the next December , and then fined , three of them 60 apiece , and five 225 apiece . This is one of the earliest cases that I find , where an English jury in a political trial refused to return such a verdict as the tyrant de manded. 1 2 . In September , 1670 , William Penn , afterwards so famous , and William Mead , were brought to trial before the Lord Mayor of Lon- 1 See the case in 1 St. Tr. 8G9 , and 1 Jardine , 40 , also 115 . The great juridical attacks upon English Liberty were directed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trials for Treason , but as in such trials the defendant had no counsel , the great legal battle for English Liberty was fought over the less important cases where only property was directly concerned . Hence the chief questions seem only to relate to money . /z/ don , a creature of the king , charged with " a tumultuous assembly . " For the Quaker meeting-house in Grace Church Street , had been forcibly shut by the government , and Mr. Penn had preached to an audience of Dissenters in the street itself . The court was exceed ingly insolent and overbearing , interrupting and insulting the defend ants continually . The jury found a special verdict " guilty of speaking in Grace Church Street . " The judge sent them out to re turn a verdict more suitable to the desire of the government . Again they substantially found the same verdict . " This both Mayor and Recorder resented at so high a rate that they exceeded the bounds of all reason and civility . " The Recorder said , " You shall not be dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept ; vou shall be locked up without meat , drink , fire , and tobacco ; you shall not think thus to abuse the court ; we will have a verdict by the help of God , or you shall starve for it ! " When Penn attempted to speak , the Recorder roared out , " Stop that prating fellow s rnouth or put him out of court . " The jury were sent out a third time , and kept all night , with no food , or drink , or bed . At last they returned a verdict of " not guilty , " to the great wrath of the court . The judge fined the jurors forty marks apiece , about $140 , and put them in jail until they should pay that sum . The foreman , Edward Bushel , refused to pay his fine and was kept in jail until he was discharged on Habeas Cor pus in November . Here the attempt of a wicked government and a cruel judge was defeated by the noble conduct of the jurors , who dared be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arr attempt was made to procure an indictment against the Earl of Shaftesbury , for High Treason . The Bill was presented to the Grand-Jury at London ; Chief Justice Pemberton gave them the charge , at the king s desire it was Charles II . They were commanded to examine the evidence in public in the presence of the court , in order that they might thus be overawed and forced to find a bill , in which case the court had matters so arranged that they were sure of a conviction . The court took part in examining the wit nesses , attempting to make out a case against the Earl . But the jury returned the bill with IGNORAMUS on it , and so found no indict ment . The spectators rent the air with their shouts . The court was in great wrath , and soon after the king seized the Charter of London , as I have already shown you , seeking to destroy that strong-hold of Liberty . Shaftesbury escaped the jury was discharged . Why did not the court summon another jury , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coke says , " But as the knights of Malta could make knights of their order for eight pence a piece , yet /z/ could not make a soldier or seaman ; so these kings the Stuarts though they could make what judges they pleased to do their business , yet could not make a grand-jury " For the grand-juries were returned by the Sheriffs , and the sheriffs were chosen by the Livery , the cor poration of London . This fact made the king desire to seize the charter , then he could make a grand-jury to suit himself , out of the kinsfolk of the judge . 1 4 . Next comes the remarkable case of the Seven Bishops , which I have spoken of already . 2 You remember the facts , Gentlemen . The king , James II. , in 1688 , wishing to overturn Protestantism the bet ter to establish his tyranny issued his notorious proclamation , setting aside the laws of the land and subverting the English Church . Pie commanded all Bishops and other ministers of religion to read the illegal proclamation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petition in most decorous language , remonstrating against the Proclamation , and asking to be excused from reading it to their con gregations . The king consulted with Father Petre , a Jesuit , his confessor on the matter , and had the bishops brought to trial for a misdemeanor , for publishing " a seditious libel in writing against his majesty and his government . " It was " obstructing an officer . " Then the question before the trial-jury was , Did the seven bishops , by presenting a petition to the king asking that they might not be forced to do an act against the laws of England and their own con sciences commit the offence of publishing a seditious libel ; and , Shall they be punished for that act ? All the judges but two , Holloway and Powell , said " Yes , " and the jury were so charged . But the jury said , " Not guilty . " The consequence was this last of the Stuarts was foiled in his attempt to restore papal tyranny to Eng land and establish such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury stood between the tyrant and the Liberties of the People . Gentlemen of the Jury , let me show you how that noble verdict was received . Soon as the verdict was given , says Bishop Burnet , " There were immediately very loud acclamations throughout West minster Hall , and the words Not guilty , Not guilty , went round with shouts and huzzas ; thereat the King s Solicitor moved very earnestly that such as had shouted in the court might be committed . But the shouts were carried on through the cities of Westminster and London and flew presently to Hounslow Heath , where the soldiers in the camp echoed them so loud that it startled the king . " 3 " Every man seemed transported with joy . Bonfires were made all /z/ about the streets , and the news going over the nation , produced the like rejoicings all England over . The king s presence kept the army in some order . But he was no sooner gone out of the camp , than he was followed with an universal shouting , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the Bishops withdrew from the court , they were surrounded by countless thousands who eagerly knelt down to receive their blessing . " Of course the two judges who stood out for the liberties of the citizens , were removed from office ! 5 . Here is another remarkable case , that of William Owen , in 1752 . These are the facts . In 1750 there was a contested election of a member of Parliament for Westminster . Hon. Alexander Mur ray , an anti-ministerial member of the Commons , was denounced to the House for his conduct during the election , and it was ordered that he should be confined a close prisoner in Newgate , and that he receive his sentence on his knees . He refused to kneel , and was punished with great cruelty by the bigoted and intolerant House . Mr. Owen , who was a bookseller , published a pamphlet , entitled " The Case of Alexander Murray , Esq. , " detailing the facts and com menting thereon . For this an information was laid against him , charging him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and malicious libel . " On the trial , the Attorney- General , Ryder , thus delivered him self : " What ! shall a person appeal from that Court , who are the only judges of things belonging to them , the House of Commons I mean . An appeal ! To whom ? To a mob V Must Justice be appealed from ? To whom ? To injustice ? Appeal to the good people of England , particularly the inhabitants of Westminster ! The House of Commons are the good people of England , being the representatives of the people . The rest are what ? Nothing unless it be a mob . But the clear meaning of this libel was an appeal to violence , in fact , and to stigmatize the House . * " Then he charges the House with sinking material evidence ; which in fact is accusing the House of injustice . This is a charge the most shocking ; the most severe , and the most unjust and virulent , against the good , the tender House of Commons ; that safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " This libel . . . will be found the most powerful invective that the skill of man could invent . I will not say the skill , but the wit , art , and false contrivance of man , insti gated by Satan ; " " to say that this is not a libel , is to say that there is no justice , equity , or right in the world . " The Solicitor-General told the Jury that they were only to inquire if Mr. Owen published the pamphlet , " the rest follows of course ; " " you are upon your oaths ; you judge of the facts . . . and only tliem " Chief Justice Lee summed up the evidence " and delivered it as his Burnet s Own Times , 470 . See also 2 Campbell , Justices , 89 , et seq . /z/ opinion , that the Jury ought to find the defendant guilty ; for he thought ihcfact of publication was fully proved ; and if so they could not avoid bringing in the defendant guilty " The jury returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney-General , put this question , Do you think the evidence is not sufficient to con vince you that Owen did sell the book ? The foreman stuck to his general verdict , " Not guilty , " " Not guilty ; " and several of the jury men said , " that is our verdict , my lord , and we abide by it . " " Upon which the court broke up , and there was a prodigious shout in the hall . " Then " the Jury judged as to facts , law , and justice of the whole , and therefore did not answer the leading question which was so artfully put to them . " : Of course the insolent Attorney- General was soon made " Lord Chief Justice , " and rode the bench after the antiquated routine . This was the third great case in which the Jury had vindicated the right of speech . 6 . Here is another case very famous in its day , and of great value as helping to establish the rights of juries , and so to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller for reprinting Junius s Letter to the King , in 1770 . Here are the facts . Mr. Miller was the publisher of a newspaper called the London Evening Post , and therein , on December 19 , 1769 , he reprinted Junius s celebrated Letter to the King . For this act , an information ex qfficio was laid against him , wherein he was charged with publishing a false , wicked , seditious , and malicious libel . A suit had already been brought against Woodfall , the publisher of the Public Advertiser , in which the letter originally appeared , but the prosecution had not turned out to the satisfaction of the government , nor had the great question been definitely settled . So this action was brought against Mr. Miller , who reprinted the original letter the day of its first appearance . 2 Solicitor- General Thurlow , whom you have met before , Gentle men , opened the case for the Crown , and said : " I have not of myself been able to imagine . . . that there is a serious man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt whether this ought to be deemed a libel or not ; " " for I neither do , nor ever will , attempt to lay before a jury , a cause , in which I was under the necessity of stating a single principle that went to intrench , in the smallest degree , upon the avowed and acknowledged liberty of the subjects of this country , even with regard to the press . The complaint I have to lay before you is that that liberty has been so abused , so turned to licentiousness , . . . that under the notion of arrogating liberty to one man , that is the writer , printer , and publisher of 1 18 St. Tr. 1203 ; 14 Parl . Hist. 888 , 1063 ; 3 Hallara , 200 ; 2 Campbell , Justices , 198. 2 iO St. Tr. 803 , 895 , 869 ; Woodfall s Juuius ( Bohn , 1850 ) , Preface , p. 94 , Appendix , p. 471 ; 2 Campbell , Justices , 363 ; 5 Mahon. /z/ this paper , they do ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less . Undoubtedly the man that has indulged the liberty of rolling upon the highway , has a very considerable portion of it allotted to him . " The defendant " has published a paper , in which , concerning the King , concerning the House of Commons , and con cerning the great officers of State , concerning the public affairs of the realm , there are uttered things of such tendency and application as ought to be punished . " ; When we are come to that situation , when it shall be lawful for any men in this country to speak of the sovereign George III. in terms attempting to fix upon him such contempt , abhorrence , and hatred , there is an end of all government whatsoever , and then liberty is indeed to shift for itself . " He quotes from the paper : " He the king has taken a decisive personal part against the subjects of America , and those subjects know how to distinguish the sovereign and a venal Parliament , upon one side , from the real senti ments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake is that no libel V To talk of the , king as taking a part of an hostile sort against one branch of his subjects , and at the same time to connect him . . . icith the parliament which he calls a venal parlia ment ; is that no libel ? " Lord Mansfield , the bitterest enemy of the citizens right of speech and of the trial by jury , charged upon the jury , " The question for you to try ... is , whether the defendant did print , or publish , or both , a paper of the tenor , and of the meaning , so charged by the informa tion " " If it is of the tenor and meaning set out in the information , the next consideration is , whether he did print and publish it " " If you . . . find the defendant not guilty , the fact established by that verdict is , he did not publish a paper of that meaning ; " " the fact finally established by your verdict , if you find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , of the tenor and of the meaning set forth in the information ; " " but you do not give an opinion . . . whether it is or not lawful to print a paper ... of the tenor and mean ing in the information ; " " if in point of fact it is innocent , it would be an innocent thing . " Thus practically the judge left the jury only one thing to determine , Did Mr. Miller print Junius s letter to the king ? That was a fact as notorious as it now is in Boston that the Daily Advertiser supported the fugitive slave bill , and helped its execution , for the letter to the king was there in Mr. Miller s journal as plainly as those defences of the fugitive slave bill were in the Advertiser . If the jury said " guilty , " the court had the defendant in their claws , and all the wrath of the most malignant tories would fall on him and rend him in pieces . But the jury fell back on their legitimate function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Application of the law to the fact , and returned a verdict , Not Guilty , which a great multitude repeated with loud acclaim ! 7 . Next , Gentlemen , I will relate a few cases in which the govern ment set all justice at defiance and clove down the right of speech , REIGN OF TERROR IX ENGLAND . iC/l commonly packing submissive juries . In 1790 and following years , while the French Revolution was in progress , the thoughtful eyes of England fell on the evils of her own country . America was already a Republic , just recovering from the shock of violent separation from her mother . young , poor , but not unprosperous , and full of future promise too obvious to escape the sagacious politicians who there saw a cause " with fear of change , Perplexing Kings . " The people of France , by a few spasmodic efforts , broke the three fold chain of Priest , King , and Noble , and began to lift up their head . But Saxon England is sober , and so went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British people had already a firm , broad basis of personal freedom to stand on . Much was thought , written , and spoken about reform in England , then most desperately needing it . The American Revolution had English ad mirers whom no courts could silence . Nay , at first the French Revolu tion delighted some of the ablest and best men in Britain , who therein beheld the carrying out of the great Principles which Aristotle and Maehiavelli had laid down as the law of the historical development and social evolution of mankind . They wished some improvement in England itself . But of course there was a strong opposition made to all change . Parliament refused to relieve the evils which were made obvious . The upper House of Nobles was composed of the Elder Sons of the families which had a social and pecuniary interest in oppressing the people , and the lower House " consisted mainly of the Younger Sons of the same families , or still worse the purchased dependents " of their families . Societies were organized for Reform , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends of the People , " etc. , etc . The last mentioned contained many literary , scien tific , and political men , and about thirty members of Parliament . Great complaints were made in public at the inequality of Representa tion in Parliament , Stormy debates took place in Parliament itself such as we have not yet heard in America , but which wicked and abandoned men are fast bringing upon us . Pitt and Fox were on opposite sides . " and such a frown Each cast at the other , as when two black clouds , With Heaven s artillery fraught , come rattling on Over the Caspian , then stand front to front , Hovering a space , till winds the signal blowTo join their dark encounter in mid air . " /z/ At that time the House of Commons was mainly filled with crea tures of a few powerful men ; thus 91 commoners elected 139 mem bers of the commons , and 71 peers also elected 163 ; so 302 British members of Parliament , besides 45 more from Scotland , 347 in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Representation of the People . " From the party who feared to lose their power of tyranny , there went out the decree , " Discussion on the subject of na tional grievances must be suppressed , in Parliament and out of Par liament . " Violent attempts were made to suppress discussion . In short , the same efforts were made in England which were attempted in New York and Boston in 1850 and the two following years , till they were ended by a little sprinkling of dust . But in Britain the public mind is harsher than ever in America , and the weapons which broke in the hand of Old England were much more formidable than that which here so suddenly snapped , and with such damage to the assassinating hand . ( 1 . ) In 1792 , John Lambert and two others published an advertise ment in the London Morning Chronicle , with which they were con nected as printers or proprietors , addressed " to the friends of free inquiry and the general good , " inviting them in a peaceful , calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals in respect to law , taxation , representation , and political administration . They were prosecuted , on ex officio information , for a " false , wicked , scan dalous , and seditious libel . " The government made every effort to secure their conviction . But it failed . 1 ( 2 . ) The same year , Duffin and Lloyd , tvo debtors in the Fleet Prison , one an American citizen , wrote on the door of the prison chapel " this house to let ; peaceable possession will be given by the present tenants on or before the first day of January , 1793 , being the commencement of liberty in Great Britain . The republic of France having rooted out despotism , their glorious example and success against tyrants renders infamous Bastiles no longer necessary in Eu rope . " They also were indicted for a " wicked , infamous , and sedi tious libel , " and found guilty . Lloyd was put in the pillory ! 2 ( 3 . ) In 1793 , Rev. William Frend , of the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union recom mended to the associated bodies of Republicans and anti-Republi cans . " He was brought to trial , represented as a " heretic , deist , infidel , and atheist , " and by sentence of the court banished from the university . 3 1 22 St. Tr. 923. 2 2 St. Tr. 1793. 3 22 St. Tr. 523 . So late as 1820 , the chief justice punished an editor with a fine of 500 , for publishing an account of a trial for high treason . See 33 St. Tr. 1564 , also 22 St. Tr. 298 ; 2 Campbell , Justices , 363 , 371 et al . /z/ ( 4 . ) The same year , John Frost , Esq. , " a gentleman " and attorney , when slightly intoxicated after dinner , and provoked by others , said , " I am for equality . I see no reason why any man should not be upon a footing with another ; it is every man s birthright . " And when asked if he would have no king , he answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bad one . " This took place in a random talk at a tavern in London . He was indicted as a person of a " depraved , impious , and disquiet mind , and of a seditious disposi tion , and contriving , practising , and maliciously , turbulently , and seditiously intending the peace and common tranquillity of our lord the king and his laws to disturb , " " to the evil example of all others in like case offending . " He was sentenced to six months in Newgate , and one hour in the pillory ! He must find sureties for good behavior for five years , himself in 500 , two others in 100 each , be imprisoned until the sureties were found , and be struck from the list of attornies ! l ( 5 . ) Rev. William Winterbotham , the same year , in two sermons , ex posed some of the evils in the constitution and administration of Eng land , and for that was fined 200 , and sentenced to jail for four years , a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . ) The same year , Thomas Briellat , a London pump-maker , in a private conversation said , " A reformation can not be effected without a revolution ; we have no occasion for kings ; there never will be any good time until all kings are abolished from the face of . the earth ; it is my wish that there were no kings at all . " " I wish the French would land 500,000 men to fight the government party . " He was tried , found guilty , and sentenced to a fine of 100 , and sent to jail for a year . 3 ( 7 . ) Richard Phillips , afterwards Sheriff of London , was sent to jail for eighteen months for selling Paine s Rights of Man ; for the same offence two other booksellers were fined and sent to Newgate for four yearsj A surgeon and a physician were sent to Newgate for two years for having u seditious libels in their possession " Thirteen per sons were indicted at once . 4 ( 8 . ) In 1793 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly a Senior Fellow of Queen s College , Cambridge , and then a Unitarian minister at Dundee . Mr. Palmer wrote an Address which was adopted at a meeting of the Friends of Liberty and published by them , which , in moderate language , called on the People " to join us in our exertions for the preservation of our perish ing liberty , and the recovery of our long lost rights . " He distributed /z/ copies of this address . He was prosecuted for " Leasing-making , " for publishing a " seditious and inflammatory writing . " The ( Scotch ) jury found him guilty , and the judges sentenced him to transportation for seven years . The sentence was executed with rigorous harshness . 1 ( 9 . ) The same year Thomas Muir , Esq. , was brought to trial for Leasing-making or public Libel at Edinburgh . He was a promising young lawyer , with liberal tendencies in politics , desiring the educa tion of the great mass of the people and a reform in Parliament . He was a member of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderate tone recommending only legal efforts by discussion and petition to remedy the public grievances . His Honor ( Mr. Curtis ) who belongs to a family so notoriously " democratic " in the beginning of this century , and so eager in its denunciations of the Federalists of that period , knows that the law even of England which they so much hated allows all that . It appeared that Mr. Muir also lent a copy of Thomas Paine s " Eights of Man " to a mechanic who asked the loan as a favor . For these offences he was indicted for sedition , charged with instituting " a Soci ety for Reform , " and with an endeavor " to represent the government of this country as oppressive and tyrannical , and the legislative body as venal and corrupt . " It was alleged in the indictment that he com plained of the government of England as " costly , " the monarchy as " useless , cumbersome , and expensive , " that he advised persons to read Paine s Rights of Man , and circulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained of the grievances of the peo ple . On trial he was treated with great insolence and harshness , rep rimanded , interrupted , and insulted by the agents of the government the court . An association of men had offered a reward of five guineas for the discovery of any person who circulated the writings of Thomas Paine . Five of the fifteen jurors were members of that association , and in Scotland a bare majority of the jurors convicts . Mr. Muir defended himself , and that ably . Lord Justice Clark charged his packed jury : " There are two things which you should attend to , which require no proof . The first is that the British Constitution is the best in the world ! " " Is not every man secure in his life , liberty , and property 1 ? Is not happiness in the power of every man ? 1 Does not every man sit safely under his own vine and fig-tree and none shall make him afraid ? " " The other circumstance ... is the state of the country during last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going abroad . " " I leave it for you to judge whether it was perfectly innocent or not in Mr. Muir ... to go about . . . among the lower classes of the people . . . inducing them to believe that a reform was absolutely necessary , to preserve their safety and their liberty , which , had it not been for /z/ him , they never would have suspected to have been in danger . " " lie ran a parallel between the French and English Constitutions , and talked of their respective taxes . . . and gave a preference to the French . " " He has brought many witnesses to prove his general good behavior , and his recommending peaceable measures , and petitioning to Parliament . " " Mr. Muir might have known that no attention could be paid to such a rabble , what right had they to representation ? He could have told them the Parliament would necer listen to their petition ! How could they think of it ? A government in any country should be just like a corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landed interest , icliicli alone has a right to be represented . " Gentlemen , you might think this speech was made by the " Castle Garden Committee , " or at the Boston " Union Meeting " in 1850 , but it conies from the year 1793 . Of course the jury found him guilty : the judges sentenced him to transportation for fourteen years ! Lord Swinton quoted from the Roman law , that the punishment for sedition was crucifixion , or ex posure to be torn to pieces by wild beasts , or transportation . " We have chosen the mildest of these punishments " This sentence was executed with great cruelty . But Mr. Pitt , then in the high places of power , declared these punishments were dictated by a " sound discretion . " l For like offences several others underwent the same or similar punishment . But these enormities were perpetrated by the govern ment in Scotland where the Roman Law had early been intro duced and had accustomed the Semi-Saxons to forms of injus tice foreign to the ethnologic instinct and historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Emboldened by their success in punishing the friends of Humanity in Scotland , the ministry pro ceeded to attempt the same thing in England itself . Then began that British Reign of Terror , which lasted longer than the French , and brought the liberties of the People into such peril as they had not known since William of Orange hurled the last of the Stuarts from his throne . Dreadful laws were passed , atrocious almost as our own fugitive slave bill . First came " the Traitorous correspond ence Bill ; " next the " Habeas Corpus Suspension Act ; " and then the " Seditious Practices Act , " with the " Treasonable Attempts Bill " by legislative exposition establishing constructive treason ! All these iniquitous measures were brought forward in Parliament by Sir John Scott then Attorney-General , one of those North Britons who find the pleasantest prospect in Scotland is the road to London . He also was vehemently active in defending the tyranny of the Scotch judges just referred to , as indeed all judicial insolence and legal wrong . 2 He opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a /z/ theft of five shillings . In two years there were more prosecutions for seditious libel than in twenty before . But Scott had his reward , and was made Lord Chancellor in 1801 , and elevated to the peerage as Lord Eldon. 1 8 . Then came that series of trials for high treason which disgraced the British nation and glutted the sanguinary vengeance of the court , The government suborned spies to feign themselves " radicals , " join the various Reform Societies , worm themselves into the confidence of patriotic and philanthropic or rash men , possess themselves of their secrets , catch at their words , and then repeat in court what they were paid for fabricating in their secret haunts . A ridiculous fable was got up that there was a plot to assassinate the King ! Many were arrested , charged with treason " constructive treason . " On the evidence of spies of the government , hired informers such men , Gentlemen of Jury , as Commissioner Loring and Marshal Freeman jointly made use of last year to kidnap Mr. Burns estimable men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kingdom , with in tentional malignity confined amongst the vilest of notorious criminals . The judges wrested the law , constructing libels , seditions , " misde meanors , " treasons any crime which it served their purpose to forge out of acts innocent , or only rash or indiscreet . Juries were packed by bribed sheriffs , and purchased spies were brought in evidence to swear away the liberty or the life of noble men . One of the govern ment witnesses was subsequently convicted of ten perjuries ! No man was safe who dared utter a serious word against George III . or Mr. Pitt . Here , Gentlemen , I shall mention two cases of great importance in which the jury did their duty and turned the stream of ministerial and judicial tyranny . ( 1 . ) In 1794 in a bill suspending the Habeas Corpus , Parliament declared " that a treacherous and detestable conspiracy had been formed for subverting the existing laws and constitution , and for introducing the system of anarchy and violence which had lately pre vailed in France . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high treason ; they were members of some of the Societies mentioned just now . " The overt act charged against them was , that they had engaged in a conspiracy to call a convention , the object of which was to bring about a revolution in the country , " but it was not alleged that there was any plot against the King s life , or any preparation for force . 2 Thomas Hardy , a shoemaker , was first brought to trial . The trial began October 28 , 1794 , just sixty years /z/ before Mr. Curtis s grand-jury found a bill against me . Sir John Scott , the attorney-general , in opening the Prosecution , made a speech nine hours long , attempting to construct treason out of belonging to a society . All who belonged to it were to be considered guilty of " compassing the death of our Lord the King . " Chief Justice Eyre , in addressing the grand-jury , referred to the act of Parliament as proof of a conspiracy . 1 Mr. Erskine defended Hardy in a speech which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in such peril ; never did English lawyers more manfully defend it . The jury , a London jury , returned " NOT GUILTY . " 2 Gentlemen , the report of the trial occupies more than twelve hundred pages in this volume , 3 and it shook the nation . The British juries for a long time had slept on their post , and allowed the enemy to enter the camp and murder its inmates . But the trial of Hardy woke up those heedless sentinels , and Liberty was safe in England , I mean . ( 2 . ) Still the infatuated government went on , not conscious of the spirit of Anglo-Saxon liberty it had at last roused from long , heavy and deathlike sleep , and eleven days after brought Mr. John Home Tooke to trial . You remember , Gentlemen , that on the first anniver sary of the Declaration of Independence , he was tried for publishing a notice of a meeting which raised c100 for the widows and orphan children of our citizens who fell at Lexington on the 19th of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine and imprisonment . 4 After the acquittal of Hardy , the government brought Mr. Tooke to trial , relying on the same evidence to convict him which had so sig nally failed a fortnight before . The overt act relied on to convict him of " levying war " and " compassing the death of our Lord the King , " was membership of a Reform society ! Mr. Erskine defended him : " I will assert the freedom of an Englishman ; I w r ill maintain the dignity of man , I will vindicate and glory in the principles which raised this country to her preeminence among the nations of the earth ; and as she shone the bright star of the morning to shed the light of liberty upon nations which now enjoy it , so may she continue in her radiant sphere to revive the ancient privileges of the world which have been lost , and still to bring them forward to tongues and people who have never known them yet , in the mysterious progression of things . " 5 Gentlemen , Home Tooke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the other prosecutions , and the treason trials ended . Even George III . had wit enough left to 1 31 George III . c. 54. - 24 St. Tr. 199 ; Annual Register , 1794 , p. 274 ; 31 Tarl .

Constructive treason won t do my Lord ; construc tive treason won t do . " By and by , Gentlemen , other men , wiser than poor feeble-minded George III. , will find out that " constructive misdemeanors won t do . " Of these trials , Mr. Campbell , himself a Judge , declares , " This the conduct of the government was more exceptionable in principle than any thing done during the reign of Charles II . ; for then the fabricators of the Popish Plot did not think of corroborating the testi mony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the facts alleged had been true , they would have amounted to a plain case of actual treason ; whereas here , admitting the truth of all the facts alleged , there was no pretence for saying that any treason contem plated by the legislature had been committed . If this scheme had succeeded , not only would there have been a sacrifice of life contrary to law , but all political agitation must have been extinguished in Eng land , as there would have been a precedent for holding that the effort to carry a measure by influencing public opinion through the means openly resorted to in our days , is a compassing the death of the sovereign . The only chance of escaping such servitude would have been civil war . It is frightful to think of the perils to which the nation was exposed But Erskine and the crisis were framed for each other His contemporaries , who without him might have seen the extinction of freedom among us , saw it , by his peculiar genius , placed on an imperishable basis . " l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he have done ? He could only wail , O Jerusalem , Jerusalem when she would not ! Now , Gentlemen , let us come over to this side of the water . I shall mention some cases in which the Jury have manfully done their duty , some others in which they have allowed themselves to be brow beaten and bullied by a judge , and so have done the greatest wrong . 1 . First look at the famous case of John Peter Zenger. 2 Here are the facts . In 1733 , Mr. Zenger established a newspaper in New York there was only one there before called the " New York Weekly Journal , " " containing the freshest Advices foreign and domestic . " In some numbers of this he complained , modestly enough , of various grievances in the administration of the Province , then ruled by Governor Cosby . He said , " as matters now stand their the Peo ple s liberties and properties are precarious , and that Slavery is /z/ likely to be entailed on them and their posterity , if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks of some one who said he " should be glad to hear that the Assembly would exert them selves , as became them , by showing that they have the interest of their country more at heart than the gratification of any private view of any of their members , or being at all affected by the smiles or frowns of a Governor , both which ought equally to be despised when the interest of the country is at stake . " " We see men s deeds de stroyed , judges arbitrarily displaced , new courts erected without con sent of the legislature , by which , it seems to me , trials by juries are taken away when a Governor pleases . " " Who , then , in that pro vince can call any thing his own , or enjoy any liberty longer than those in the administration will condescend to let him do it ? " In October , 1734 , Chief Justice de Lancey gave a charge to the Grand-Jury , urging them to indict Mr. Zenger for a libel . He says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tends to scandalize the government by reflecting- on those who are intrusted with the ad ministration of public affairs , which ... has a direct tendency to breed in the public a dislike of their Governors . " " If he who hath either read a libel himself , or hath heard it read by another , do aftericards maliciously read or report any part of it in the presence of others , or lend or show it to another , he is guilty of an unlawful publica tion of it " But the Judge had not packed the Grand-Jury with sufficient care , and so no bill was found . Thereupon the Governor s Council sent a message to the General Assembly of New York , complaining of Mr. Zenger s Journal as tending " to alienate the affections of the people of this province from his majesty s government , " and asking them to inquire into the said papers and the authors thereof ; the Council required that the obnoxious numbers might " be burned by the hands of the common hangman or wldpper , near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Court of Quarter-sessions was applied to to bum the papers ; but as that body refused , the sheriff " delivered them unto the hands of his own negro , and ordered him to put them into the fire , which he did . " Mr. Zenger was imprisoned by a warrant from the Governor , a lettre de cachet , and " for several days denied the use of pen , ink , and paper , and the liberty of speech with any person . " An ex officio information was brought against him , charging him with " malicious and seditious libel . " His counsel , Messrs . Alexander and Smith , took exceptions to the proceedings . The Chief Justice would neither hear nor allow the exceptions , " for " said he , " you thought to have gained a great deal of applause and popularity by opposing this court .... but you have brought it to that point , that either we /z/ must go from the bench or you from the bar , therefore we exclude you . So " for contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attorneys . The case came on for trial . The clerk of the Court sought to pack his jury , and instead of producing the " Free holders book " to select the Jury from , presented a list of forty-eight persons which he said he had taken from that book . This Honorable Court knows how easy it is to violate the law in summoning jurors ; none knew it better a hundred and twenty years ago . Of the 48 some were not freeholders at all ; others held commissions and offices at the Governor s pleasure ; others were of the late displaced magistrates who had a grudge against Mr. Zenger for exposing their official conduct ; besides , there were the governor s baker , tailor , shoe maker , candle-maker , and joiner . But it does not appear that this Judge had any Brother-in-law on the list ; corruption had not yet reached that height . But that wicked list was set aside after much ado , and a Jury summoned in the legal manner . It may astonish the Court but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trial went on . Andrew Hamilton of Philadelphia de fended Mr. Zenger with law , wit , learning , and eloquence . He admitted the fact of printing and publishing the documents , and rested the defence on the truth of their assertions . The AttorneyGeneral , Mr. Bradley , said , " supposing they were true , the law says that they are not the less libellous for that : nay , indeed , the law says , their being true is an aggravation of the crime " He " did not know what could be said in defence of a man that had so notoriously scandalized the governor and principal magistrates .... by charg ing them with depriving the people of their rights and liberties , and taking away trials by juries , and in short putting an end to the law itself . If this was not a libel , he did not know what was one . Such persons as did take these liberties .... ought to suffer for stirring up sedition and discontent among the people . " The Chief Justice declared , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents thereof are true .... since the greater appearance there is of truth , so much the more provoking is it ! " " The jury may find that Mr. Zenger printed and published these papers , and leave it to the court to judge ivhether they are libellous ! " That would be to put the dove s neck in the mouth of the fox , and allow him to decide whether he would bite it off . Mr. Hamilton re plied : " This of leaving it to the judgment of the court whether the words are libellous or not , in effect renders Juries useless ( to say no worse ) , in many cases . " " If the faults , mistakes , nay even the vices of such a person be private and personal , and don t affect the peace of the public , or the liberty or property of our neighbor , it is unmanly and unmannerly to expose them , either by word or writing . But , when a ruler of the MR . ZENGER IN 1735 . Ill people brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his administration , and the people find themselves affected by them , either in their liberties or properties , that vrill alter the case mightily ; and all the high things that are said in favor of rulers and of deputies , and upon the side of power , will not be able to stop people s mouths when they feel themselves oppressed , I mean in a free government . It is true in times past it was a crime to speak truth ; and in that terrible court of Star-Chamber many worthy and brave men suffered for so doing ; and yet even in that court , and in those bad times , a great and good man durst say , what I hope w r ill not be taken amiss of me to say in this place , namely , The practice of informations for libels is a sword in the hands of a wicked king , and an arrant coward , to cut down and destroy the innocent ; the one can not because of his high station , and the other dares not , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . " It is a right which all persons claim and are entitled to , to complain when they are hurt ; they have a right publicly to remonstrate against the abuses of power , in the strongest terms ; to put their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or open vio lence of men in authority ; and to assert with courage the sense they have of the bless ings of liberty , the value they put upon it , and their resolution at all hazards to pre serve it as one of the greatest blessings Heaven can bestow . " " It is a duty which all good men owe to their country , to guard against the unhappy influence of ill men when intrusted with power , and especially against their creatures and dependants , who as they are generally more necessitous , are surely more covetous and cruel . " According to the Judge the Jury had only one question before them , " Did Zenger publish the words charged in the information ? " That fact was clear ; nay , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the jury fell back on their rights and duties to decide the Question of Fact , of Law , and of the Application of the Law to the Fact , and returned " NOT GUILTY , " " upon which there were three huzzas in the Hall . " Had this Honorable Court been then in exist ence I suppose it would have talked of indicting the jurors for " per jury , " and would doubtless have had its labor for its pains . For the Common Council of New York presented Mr. Hamilton with a costly gold box and the freedom of the city . Gentlemen , this took place one hundred and twenty years ago . Forty years before the Revolution , Andrew Hamilton helped lay the " brilliant foundation of liberty , " whereon another Hamilton was also to raise up noble walls of freedom . Gentlemen of the Jury , by Wisdom is a house builded , but the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands . Will you allow that to be done ? What if the jury in 1735 had been faithless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bloody and cruel , would have shorn off the heads of Otis and Quincy , and Adams and Hancock at Boston ; the family of Scroggs alone would be held in honor in New England . 1 /z/ Gentlemen , it once happened in New York that Governor Nichol son was offended with one of the clergymen of the Province . He /z/ met him on the road one day , and " as it was usual with him ( under the " protection of his commission ) used the poor minister with the worst of language , threatened to cut off his ears , slit his nose , and at last to shoot him through the head . " The minister , " being a reverend man , continued all this time uncovered in the heat of the sun , until he found an opportunity to fly for it , and coming to a neighbor s house fell ill of a fever and wrote for a doctor , " relating the facts and concluding that the governor was crazy , for no man in his right mind would behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor brought a prosecution against the minister for publishing a " scandal ous , wicked , and seditious libel . " No doubt he could have found a judge even then who would twist the law so as to make the letter " sedition " and " libel ; " nay , perhaps he could construct a jury so as to secure a conviction , but before it reached trial the prosecution was stopped by the order of Queen Anne . 2 . In 1816 , in Massachusetts , there occurred the celebrated case of Commonwealth vs . Bowen , to which I shall again refer in a subse quent part of this defence . These are the facts . In September , 1815 , Jonathan Jewett was convicted of murder in Hampshire county , Mas sachusetts , and sentenced to be hanged on the 9th of the following November . He was confined at Northampton , and hung himself in his cell on the night preceding the morning appointed for his public execution . George Bowen was confined in the same jail , in an apart ment adjacent to Jewett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely converse together . Bowen repeatedly and frequently advised and urged Jewett to destroy himself and thus disappoint the sheriff and the expectant people . He did so , and the coroner s jury returned that he committed suicide . But nevertheless , Bowen was indicted for the wilful murder of Jewett . It was charged that he " feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did counsel , hire , persuade , and procure the said Jewett the said felony and murder of himself to do and commit ; " or that he himself murdered the said Jewett by hanging him . At the trial Attorney- General Perez Morton contended that Bowen " was guilty of murder as principal ; " and he cited and relied chiefly on the following authority from the Reports of our old friend Kelyng . " Memorandum , that my brother Twisden showed me a report which he had of a charge given by Justice Jones to the grand-jury , at the King s Bench barre , Jlichaelmas Term , 9 Car . 1 , in which he said , that poisoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 Ed. 6 , was but declaratory of the common law , and an affirmation of it . If one drinks poison by the provocation of another , and dieth of it , this is murder in the person that persuaded it . And he took this difference . If A. give poison to J. S. to give to J. D. , and J. S. knowing it to be poison , give it to J. D. who taketh it in the absence of J. S. , and dieth of it ; in this case J. S. , who gave it to /z/ J. I ) . , is principal ; and A. who gave the poison to J. S. , and was absent when it was taken , is but accessory before the fact . But if A. buyeth poison for J. S. , and J. S. , in the absence of A. , taketh it and dieth of it , in this case A. , though he be absent , yet he is principal . So it is if A. giveth poison to B. to give unto C. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but believing it to be a good medicine , giveth it to C. , who dieth of it ; in this case A. , who is absent , is principal , or else a man should be murdered , and there should be no principal . For B. , who knoweth nothing of the poison , is in no fault , though he gave it to C. So if A. puts a sword into the hands of a madman , and bids him kill B. with it , and then A. goeth away , and the madman kills B. with the sword , as A. commanded him , this is murder in A. , though absent , and he is principal ; for it is no crime in the madman , who did the fact by reason of his madness . " 1 Mr. Morton also laid down this as law , " the adviser of one who commits a felony of himself is a murderer " He might have added , " the adviser of one who breaks into his own house is a burglar . " Chief Justice Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the harshness of a law charged the jury that the important question for them was , Did Bowen s advice induce Jewett to kill himself ? if so , they were to find him guilty of wilful murder ! The community has an interest in the public execution of criminals the crowd having an interest in the spectacle and to take such an one out of the reach of the law by advising him to self-destruction is no trivial offence . " " You are not to consider the atrocity of this offence in the least degree diminished by the consideration that justice urns thirsting for its sacrifice ; and that but a small portion of Jewett s earthly existence could , in any event , remain to him . " 2 There was no doubt that Bowen advised Jewett to commit suicide ; but the jury , in defiance of the judge s charge and Mr. Kelyng s law , nevertheless returned " NOT GUILTY . " Here , Gentlemen , is a remarkable instance of a judge , in private a benevolent man , perverting his official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice given to a man to anticipate a public execution by privately hanging himself ! The law relied on was the Memorandum of the charge to a grand-jury made by a judge who notoriously broke the fundamental laws of England , by declar ing that the king had a constitutional right to imprison , at will and as long as he liked , any of his subjects without trial , even members of Parliament for words uttered in public debate ; and also the right to levy ship-money contrary to the Acts of Parliament . This charge was made in the tyrannical reign cf Charles I. in 1634 , by a tyran nical judge . There was no report , only a memorandum of it , and that not printed till seventy-four years after ! It had not the force of law 1 See the case in Kelyng s Reports ( London , 1708 ) , p. 52 . The opinion of Justice Jones was only the charge of an inferior judge given to the grand-jury in 1634. /z/ even then : it was only the memorandum of the " opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion " of the full court . The memorandum is contained in Kelyng s Book , which Lord Campbell calls " a folio volume of decisions in criminal cases , which are of no value what ever , except to make us laugh at some of the silly egotisms with which they abound . " l On such authority in 1816 would even a Massachu setts court , with a judge who was a kindly man in private , dash away the life of a fellow-creature , with such mockery of law ! But , Gentlemen , the jury at that time did not slumber ; they set the matter right , and did justice spite of Judge Kelyng and his " law . " They made nothing of the judge s charge ! Gentlemen of the Jury , I will now mention some cases of gross injustice perpetrated by the Federal Courts of the United States . The tenth article of amendments to the Constitution provides that " powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Constitution itself confers no Common Law Jurisdiction on the Government . Neither the People nor their Repre sentatives had ever decreed the Common Law of England to be a part of the law of the United States . Yet , spite of the absence of positive enactment and the express words of the above amendment to the Constitution , the Supreme Court at once assumed this juris diction . In 1799 , Chief Justice Ellsworth said , " the Common Law of this country remains the same as it was before the Revo lution ; " 2 and proceeded on that supposition to exercise the powers of English Judges of Common Law , undertaking to punish men for offences which no Act of Congress forbid . You see at once what monstrous tyranny would follow from that usurpation . Had the English Common Law power of punishing for " seditious libel , " for example , been allowed to the Federal court , Gentlemen , you know too well what would follow . But this monstrous assump tion was presently brought to an ignominious end ; and strange as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court itself . Samuel Chase of Maryland , one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence , had been an Anti-Federalist and a strong State-Right s man , as such insisting on a strict construction of the Constitution . Singular as it may appear he was made a Judge in 1796 , and what is yet more sur prising , in 1798 , declared " the United States as a Federal govern- 1 2 Campbell , Judges , 406. 2 Wharton , State Trials , 653 . See too Virginia Resolutions ( Richmond , 1850 ) , Pre face , xiii . et seq . ; Virginia Resolutions by Madison , and his Report thereon ; Kentucky Resolutions by Jefferson , in 4 Eliot s Debates ( 1836 ) . /z/ ment , had no Common Law , " and thus ended this claim . 1 But tyr anny did not end ; nay , he himself , a man of uncommon powers and legal attainments , became a most atrocious example of Judicial des potism. 1 . In 1791 a direct tax was levied by Act of Congress on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their value . The " Alien and Sedition Laws " were also passed the same year . The execu tion of the law relative to the direct tax was resisted in Northampton county , Perm. , and some prisoners rescued from an officer of the United States . The President , Mr. Adams , issued his proclamation . In 1799 John Fries was arrested on the charge of treason . The overt act alleged was resistance to that one special law of Congress . Judge Iredell charged the Grand-Jury , " You have heard the govern ment as grossly abused as if it had been guilty of the vilest tyranny . " Had he read the private correspondence of the Cabinet , he might have found other specimens of " abuse . " He defended both the Alien and Sedition Laws . They were " constitutional " and " proper . " 2 Mr. Fries was indicted for treason . The Judiciary Act of Con congress of 1789 provides that " in cases punishable with death the trial shall be had in the county where the offence was committed ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve petit jurors at least shall be summoned from thence . " The offence was committed in Northampton county , and he was indicted and brought to trial in Philadelphia county , nor could the court be induced to comply with the statute ! The government laid down the law and constructed treason with the usual ingenuity of officials working by the job . Judge Kelyng s loose opinion that an attack on a brothel was high treason , was cited by Mr. Rawle , the District Attorney , as good law . 3 What " in Eng land is called constructive levying of war , in this country must be called direct levying of war . " Judge Peters charged that though force was necessary to constitute the crime of treason , yet " the quan tum of force is immaterial , " of course it may be wielding a wheat straw , or a word , I suppose . " The doctrine of constructive treason has produced much real mischief in another country " England . " The greater part of the objections to it are irrelevant here " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new trial , on the ground that before the trial one of the jurors had declared , " Fries ought to be hung ; " " I myself shall be in danger unless we hang /z/ them all ; " that the jurors were irregularly drawn , and the trial was not held in the county where the offence was committed . Judge Iredell ruled that it was " a high contempt at this time to call for a renewal of an argument whereon a solemn , decisive opinion was deliv ered " Judge Peters declared the juror had " said no more than all friends to the laws and the government were warranted in thinking and saying . " Yet a new trial was granted . The new trial was held before Judge Chase , who had , as Mr. Wharton says , a " singular instinct for tumults which scents it at a distance . . . and irresistibly impels a participation in it , " " moving perpetually with a mob at his heels . " Yet " apart from his criminal jurisdiction he was reckoned a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a thorough and indefatigable administrator of public functions . " " It was this despotic ardor of temperament . . . which made him , when a young man , employ with resolute au dacity the engine of popular revolt , and which led him when older , and when in possession of that power against which he had so stead ily warred , to wield with the same vigor the sword of constituted au thority. " 1 Gentlemen , he was like many that this Honorable Court perhaps have known , who were privateering Democrats in 1812 , and Kidnapping Whigs in 1850 . To him we are indebted for the invalu able decision that the United States courts have no Common Law jurisdiction . At this new trial he treated the defendants counsel in such a man ner that they abandoned the case , and left the Prisoner without de fence . The District Attorney , taking his law from Kelyng and simi lar servants of British despots , laid it down that treason " may consist in assembling- together in numbers , and by actual force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Force need not be used to manifest this spirit of rebellion . " " Even if the matter made a grievance of was illegal the demolition of it in this way was , nevertheless , treason " li a rising with intent by force to prevent the execution of a law .... preventing the marshal executing his warrants , and preventing the other officers .... amounted to levying war . " " In short an opposition to the acts of Congress in whole or in part that is to any one law .... either by collecting numbers , or by a display of force .... which should operate .... either throughout the United States , or in any part thereof to procure a repeal or a suspension of the law .... this offence he considered to be strictly treason . " Judge Chase laid it down as law not to be questioned in his court , " that any . . . rising of any body of the people ... to attain by force . . . any object of a great public nature ... is a levying of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising to resist . . . the execution of any statutes of United States ... or for any other object of a general nature or na tional concern , under any pretence as that the statute was unjust . . . or unconstitutional is a levying war ; " " any force . . . icill constitute the crime of levying war . " If that be law , then an old negro woman who , with a dishcloth , frightens officer Butman away from kidnapping her granddaughter in South ac street , does thereby levy war against the United States and commits the crime of treason . The jury , overborne by the assumptions of the judge , or ignorant of their duties and their rights , allowed this tyrannical court to have its way , surrendered the necks of the people , and brought in a verdict of guilty . Judge Chase made an insolent address to the prisoner and sentenced him to death . But Mr. Adams , with a remarkable degree of justice , gave him a full pardon , and drew down upon himself there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1788 Mathew Lyon , a native of Ireland , a Revolutionary soldier , a member of congress , and editor of a newspaper in Vermont , was brought to trial under the Sedition Law , for a false , malicious , and seditious libel . He had published in his newspaper a somew 7 hat severe attack on the Federalists then in power . The article , alleged to be " seditious , " was a letter written and mailed at the seat of gov ernment seven days before , and published nine days after , the passage of the Sedition Law itself . It was as much a political trial , Gentle men , as this purely political . Judge Patterson United States Circuit Judge of Vermont charged that the jury had nothing what ever to do with the constitutionality of the Sedition Law . " Congress has said that the author and publisher of seditious libels is to be pun ished . " " The only question you are to determine is ... Did Mr. Lyon publish the writing ? . . . Did he do so seditiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and govern ment , and bringing them both into disrepute ? " Mr. Lyon was found guilty , and punished by a fine of $1,000 and imprisonment for four months . The " Seditious Libel " would now be thought a quite moderate Editorial or " Letter from our Correspond ent . " His imprisonment was enforced with such rigor that his con stituents threatened to tear down the jail , which he prevented . 2 3 . In 1799 Thomas Cooper , a native of England , residing at Northumberland , Pennsylvania , published a handbill reflecting severely on the conduct of President Adams . He was prosecuted by an In- 1 Whcaton , 458 ; 9 Adams s Works , 57 ; 2 Gibbs , 3GO ; 5 Hildreth , 306 ; Chase s Trial , 18. /z/ formation exofficio , in the Circuit Court for Pennsylvania , and brought to trial before Judge Chase , already referred to , charged with a " false , scandalous , and malicious attack " on the President . Mr. Chase charged the jury , " A Republican government can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the licentiousness of the press . This latter is the more slow , but most sure and certain means of bringing about the destruction of the government . " He made a fierce and violent harangue , arguing the case against the defendant with the spirit which has since become so notorious in the United States courts in that State . The pliant jury found Mr. Cooper guilty , and he was fined $400 and sent to jail for six months . He subse quently became a judge in Pennsylvania , as conspicuous for judicial tyranny as Mr. Chase himself , and was removed by Address of the Legislature from his seat , but afterwards went to South Carolina where he became Professor at her college , and a famous nullifier in 1830. 1 4 . In 1799 , or 1800 , Mr. Callender , a native of England , then resid ing at Richmond , in Virginia a base and mean fellow , as his whole history proved , depraved in morals and malignant in temper pub lished a pamphlet called " The Prospect before us , " full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration . He was indicted for a false , malicious , and seditious libel , and brought to trial before Judge Chase who pressed the Sedition Law with inquisitorial energy and executed it with intolerant rigor. 2 As he started for Richmond to hold the trial , he declared " he would teach the lawyers in Virginia the difference between the liberty and the licentiousness of the press . " He told the marshal " not to put any of those creatures called . Demo crats on the jury , " it does not appear that he had his own Brotherin-Law on it however ; " he likened himself to a schoolmaster who was to turn the unruly boys of the Virginia courts over his knee and give them a little wholesome chastisement . " Some of the ablest lawyers in Virginia were engaged for the de fence . But they could not secure any decent regard to the common forms of law , or to the claims of justice . He would not grant the delay always usual in such cases , and indispensable to the defence . He refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , and allowed them to put none but written ques tions approved of by him ! The defendant was not allowed to prove the truth of any statements , alleged to be libellous , by establish ing the truth of one part through one witness and of another " through a different one . He would not allow him to argue to the jury that the law was unconstitutional . " We all know that juries have the right to decide the law as well as the fact , and the Constitution is the /z/ Supreme law of the land . " " Then , " said Mr. Wirt , " since the jury have a right to consider the law , and since the Constitution is law , it is certainly syllogistic that the jury have a right to consider the Con stitution ; " and the judge exclaimed , " a non sequitur , Sir ! " " Sit down , Sir ! " Mr. Wirt sat down . The judge declared " a right is given to the jury to determine what the law is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute is a law or not , or whether it is void , under an opinion that it is unconstitutional . " " It appears to me the right now claimed has a direct tendency to dissolve the Union . " " No citizen of knowledge and information . . . will be lieve , without very strong and indubitable proof , that Congress will , intentionally , make any law in violation of the Federal Constitution . " " If such a case should happen , the mode of redress is pointed out in the Constitution . " It was obvious that Congress had made laws in violation of the Constitution , and he insisted that the jury should enforce those laws against their own conscience . After all his violent injustice he of course declared " the decisions of courts of justice will not be influenced by political and local principles and prejudices . " The packed jury found the prisoner guilty . He was fined 200 and sent to jail for nine months . But Virginia was too high-spirited to bear this .

But then the Alien and Sedition Laws ruined the Administration , and sent Mr. Adams who yet never favored them from his seat ; his successor , Mr. Jefferson , says , " / discharged every person under punishment , or prosecution , under the Sedition Law , because I con sidered and now consider , that law to be a nullity as absolute and as palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall down and worship a golden image " l Judge Chase was impeached by the House of Representatives , tried by the Senate , and only escaped condemnation by the prejudice of the political partisans .

There is a To-morrow after to-day , and a Higher Law which crushes all fugitive slave bills into their kindred dust . Gentlemen , allow me to vary this narrative of British and Ameri can despotism by an example from a different nation . I will refresh you with a case more nearly resembling that before you ; it is an instance of German tyranny . In 1853 , Dr. Gervinus , Professor of History in the University of Heidelberg in Germany , published this little volume of about 200 pages , 2 " An Introduction to the History df the 19th Century . " Mr. Gervinus is one of the most enlightened men in the world , a man of great genius for the philosophical investi gation of human history , and enriched with such culture and learning as is not common even in that home of learned men . His book , designed only for scholars , and hardly intelligible to the majority of readers even in America , sets forth this great fact , The democratictendency of mankind shown in all history . Gervinus was seized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Mannheim , charged with publishing a work against consti tutional monarchy , intending thereby to depose the lawful head of the State , the Grand Duke Charles Leopold , and with changing and endangering the constitution , " disturbing the public tranquillity and order , and incurring the guilt of High Treason . " In short he was charged with " obstructing an officer " and attempting to dissolve the Union , " with " levying war . " For his trial the judge purposely selected a small room , though four times larger than what now cir cumscribes the dignity of this Honorable Court ; he did not wish the people to hear Gervinus s defence . But I will read you some ex tracts from the preface to the English translation of his book : " I offer nothing purely theoretical or speculative , and as few opinions and conclu sions as can possibly be given in a historical narrative . The work finally reaches a 1 2 Sess. 26th , Cong . Doc . 86 , Ho . Eep. ; Wharton , 844 , 679 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks in the Debates .

These opinions are themselves weighed against one another , but their value is not determined by dogmas , or phrases , or decla mations , but simply by facts . If the balance incline towards a more liberal form of government , towards democratic institutions , and therefore towards self-government , and the participation of the many rather than of the few in the affairs of the State , I am not to blame , nor is it my ordinance , but that of History and of Providence . My work is only ( what all historical narrative should be ) a vindication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them appears to me neither pious in a moral point of view , nor wise in a political . That which is proved by the most remarkable facts of History , will not be altered in the smallest degree , by the suppression of my work , or by my condemnation . The charge on this head is an absurdity , since no rational end can be attained by it . It aims at the suppression of a truth which , should /not tell it , will be ever louder and louder proclaimed by the Facts of History . " To believe such a thing possible is a proof how limited an idea exists of the eager inquiry going on after knowledge and truth , the source and origin of all knowledge . There will always be so eager a demand for a history of the Present time , that , even should 1 be prevented , ten others would arise , only to proclaim the louder , and to repeat the oftener , the truth which is here suppressed . To believe that the philosophy of History can be silenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external mechanism of philosophy . A political pamphlet , intended to serve a particu lar purpose at a particular period , may be suppressed . The author of such a pamphlet , bent on agitation , can easily console himself for its suppression . It has cost him little time and trouble ; it is only a means to an end , one means out of many means , any of which , when this is lost , will serve the author as well . But it is not thus with philo sophical works , it is not thus with the work before me . This book is deeply rooted in the vocation of my whole life , and is the end of my philosophical research ; I have prepared myself for it by the labor of years , and the labor of years will be necessary for its completion . I have reached a time of life when I can neither change my voca tion , nor even cease to labor in this vocation . I am also so imbued with my philos ophy , that even if I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecu tion of this work for four months , but in the fifth I shall return to it . For a judicial sentence can not arrest ( like a mere pamphlet ) the philosophical scheme interwoven into a whole existence . " " If it is possible that this Introduction can be condemned in Germany , that it can be prohibited , that by these means the work should be strangled in its birth , then the philosophy of history has no longer a place in Germany . The tribunal of Baden will have given the first blow , in pronouncing judgment on a matter which is purely philosophical , and Germany , whose freedom of philosophical research has been her pride and her boast , of which even the various administrations of the nation have never been jealous , will receive a shock such as she never before sustained . " " My book is on so strictly a philosophical plan , and treats of such comprehensive historical questions , that , properly , no judgment of any value could be pronounced upon it but by the professed historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ger many . Among them there has not , to this hour , been found one competent to give an opinion in a few weeks on a book which is the fruit of half a life . On the other hand , there was soon a whole set of fanatical partisans and obstreperous bunglers in a neigh boring press , who in eight days had condemned this work , in some instances , by calling it an historical commonplace , and in others , a political pamphlet with iletfructiue ten dencies At the same time , and in a manner easily accounted for , under the influence /z/ of such an expression of public opinion , and almost before any other could make itself heard , accusations were made against the book , and it was confiscated . Let no one take it amiss if , in the urgency of my defence , 1 for a moment lay aside modesty , as far as such modesty might prove injurious to my cause . My work demonstrates a law of historical development , which I do not claim as my property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated more than two thousand years ago by the greatest thinker of all ages , derived from observations on the history of the Grecian State . To repeat a law which has been already demonstrated , ought to appear but a trilling cir cumstance , and indeed might merit the term of an historical commonplace ; we could even suppose that it might be mentioned in a popular as well as in a philosophical book . Nevertheless this law has scarcely been twice repeated in the course of two thousand years , and then only by two imitators , who scarcely understood its whole purport , though they were the most thinking heads of the most thinking nations Machiavelli in Italy , and Hegel in Germany . I solemnly ask of the whole philosophical world if my words can be gainsaid , and to name for me the third , by whom the Aris totelian law , of which I speak , has been repeated and understood . I have ventured to consider the thought of Aristotle , and to apply it to the history of modern European States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occupied two thousand years . I also found that the whole series of events confirmatory of this law ( itself deduced from experience ) are not yet entirely fulfilled . Like the astronomer , who , from a known fraction of the path of a newly discovered planet , calculates its whole course , I ventured to divine that which is still wanting , and which may yet take centuries to complete . I turned silently to those whose profession was the study of history , to prove the justice of my calculations ; I handed my book over to coming generations and coming centuries , with the silent demand , when the required series of events shall be fulfilled , then to pronounce the final sentence , whether this law , and its purport as now explained , be just or not . This is the philosophical character , and these the contents of my book no more than was indispensably necessary to make this calculation . And now comes the charge , and pronounces that in the character of a pamphleteer , I have endeavored to excite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German Confederation . " On the 8th of March it should have been the fifth the thing came to a close .

" There was no Jury of the People to try him ! Here our own Court has an admirable precedent for punishing me for a word . 1 But even in Massachusetts , within twenty years , an attempt was made to punish a man for his opinions on a matter of history which had no connection with politics , or even with American Slavery . In July , 1834 , Rev. George R. Noyes , a Unitarian Minister at Peter sham , a retired scholar , a blameless man of fine abilities and very 1 See Preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Allg . Lit .

" It is difficult , " said this accomplished Theologian , " to point out any predictions which have been properly fulfilled in Jesus . " Peter and Paul found the death and resurrection of Jesus in the 16th Psalm , but they " were in an error , " which should not surprise us , for " the Evangelists and Apostles never claimed to be inspired reasoners and interpreters ; " " they par took of the errors and prejudices of their age in things in which Christ had not instructed them .

The doc trines were by no means new . But Hon. James T. Austin , was then Attorney-General of the State ; his attention being called to it by an anonymous writer in a newspaper , he attacked Mr. Noyes s article , thus giving vent to his opinion thereon : " He considers its learning very ill bestowed , its researches worse than useless , and that its tendency is to strike down one of the pillars on which the fabric of Christianity is supported . " " Its tendency is to shock the pious , confound the unlearned , overwhelm those who are but moderately versed in the recondite investigations of theology , and above all to open an arsenal whence all the small wits of the infidel army may supply themselves with arms . Its greater evil is to disarm the power of public opinion . " " It certainly disarms to a great degree the power of the law . " l Gentlemen , suppose it had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the right of freedom of conscience be worth in the hands of such a man , " dressed in a little brief authority ? " It was said at the time that the author was actually presented to the Grand-Jury , and an attempt made to procure an indictment for Blasphemy , or Misdemeanor . I know not how true the rumor was . The threat of prosecution came to nought , and Dr. Noyes , one of the most scholarly men in America , is now Professor of Theology in the Divinity School at Cambridge , and an honor to the liberal sect which maintains him there . Gentlemen , when laws are unjustly severe , denouncing a punish ment highly excessive , the juries refuse to convict . Examples of this /z/ are very common in trials for capital offences , now that the conscience of moral men has become so justly hostile to the judicial shedding of blood . There is no doubt with the Jurors as to the Fact , none as to the Law ; but they say it is unjust to apply such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jury exercising their moral discretion , spite of the judge , and spite of the special statute or custom , are yet faithful to their official obligation and manly duty , and serve Justice , the ultimate End and Purpose of Law , whereto the statutes and cus toms are only provisional means . Foolish judges accuse such juries of " Perjury ; " but it is clear enough , Gentlemen , where the false ness is . " Do you take notice of that juryman dressed in blue ? " said one of the judges at the old Bailey to Judge Nares . " Yes . " " Well , then , take my word for it , there will not be a single conviction to-day for any capital offence . " So it turned out . The " gentleman in blue " thought it unjust and wicked , contrary to the ultimate Purpose of law , to hang men , and he was faithful to his juror s oath in refusing to convict . Of course he did not doubt of the Fact , or the Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be a good many " gentlemen in blue . " To prevent this moral independence of the jury from defeating the immoral aim of the government , or of the judges , or the legislature the court questions the jurors beforehand , and drives off from the panel all who think the statute unfit for such application . Gentle men , that is a piece of wicked tyranny . It would be as unfair to exclude such men from the legislature , or from the polls , as from the jury box . In such cases the defendant is not tried by his " country , " but by a jury packed for the purpose of convicting him , spite of the moral feelings of the people . Sometimes the statute is so framed that the jurors must by their verdict tell an apparent falsehood , or commit a great injustice . When it was a capital offence in England to steal forty shillings , and evi dence made it plain that the accused had actually stolen eight or ten times that value , you all know how often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-nine shillings " 1 They preferred to tell what seemed to be a lie , rather than kill a man for stealing fifteen or twenty dollars . The verdict of NOT GUILTY would have been perfectly just in form as in substance , and conformable to their official oath . Gentlemen , tyrannical rulers , and their servants , despotic and cor rupt judges , have sought to frighten the juries from the exercise of all discretion either moral or intellectual . To that end they threaten 1 See several cases of this kind in Sullivan on Abolition of Punishment of Death , ( N. Y. 1841 ) , 73 . Rantoul s Works , 459. /z/ them before the verdict , and punish them when they decide contrary to the wish of the tyrant . To make the jurors agree in a unanimous verdict , they were kept without " fire or water or food or bed " until they came to a conclusion ; if eleven were of one mind and the twelfth not convinced , the refractory juror was fined or put in jail . 1 If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge or his master , the jurors were often punished . 2 I have already shown you how the juries were treated with fine and imprisonment who acquitted Throckmorton and Penn . 3 When John Lilburne was tried for his life in 1653 , he censured the authorities which prosecuted him and appealed to the " honorable Jury , the Keepers of the Liberties of England : " they found him Not Guilty , and were themselves brought before the council of State for punishment . " Thomas Greene of Snow-hill , tallow chandler , Foreman of the Jury , being asked what the grounds and reasons were that moved him to find . . . Lilburne not guilty , . . . saith that he did discharge his conscience in what lie then did , and that he will give no further answer to any questions which shall be asked him upon that matter . 1 " 4 This was in the time of Crom well ; but as the People were indignant at his tyrannical conduct in that matter , and his insolent attempt to punish the jurors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hundred and twenty-five years before , Thomas Smith had declared " such doings to be very violent , tyrannical , and contrary to the liberty and customs of the realm of England . " Sir Matthew Hale said at a later day , " It would be a most unhappy case for the judge himself , if the prisoner s fate depended upon his directions ; unhappy also for the prisoner ; for if the judge s opinion must rule the verdict , the trial by jury would be useless . " 5 Judge Kelyng was particularly hostile to the jury , throwing aside " all regard to moderation and decency . " He compelled the grand-jury of Somersetshire to find an indictment against their consciences , reproaching Sir Hugh Wyndham , the fore man , as the " Head of a Faction . " He told the jury , " You are all my servants , and I will make the best in England stoop ! " He said it was a " misdemeanor " for them to discriminate between murder and manslaughter ; that was for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear that he had his brother-in-law on that grand-jury . Several persons were indicted for " attending a conven- 1 Forsyth , 241 , 243. 2 Thomas Smith , Commonwealth , ( London , 1589 , ) b. iii . c. 1 . Ilargravc , in G St. Tr. 1019. /z/ tide ; " the jury acquitted them contrary to his wish , and he fined them 334 apiece , and put them in jail till it was paid . On another occasion , this servile creature of Charles II . fined and imprisoned all the jurors because they convicted of manslaughter a man whom he wanted to hang . But for this conduct he was accused in the House of Commons , and brought to answer for it at their bar . 1 In 1680 Chief Justice Scroggs was brought up before the House of Commons for discharging " a refractory grand-jury " such an one as was discharged in Boston last July : Sir Francis Wilmington said , " If the judges instead of acting by law shall be acted by their own ambition , and endeavor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , this nation will soon be reduced to a miserable condition . " " As faults committed by judges are of more dangerous consequence than others to the public , so there do not want precedents of severer chastisements for them than for others . " 2 But spite of the continual attempt to destroy the value of the trial by jury , and take from the People their ancient , sevenfold shield , the progress of liberty is perpetual . Now and then there arose lawyers and judges like Sir Matthew Hale , Holt , Vaughan , Somers , Camden , and Erskine , who reached out a helping hand . Nay , politicians came up to its defence . But the great power which has sustained and devel oped it is the sturdy and unconquerable Love of individual Liberty which is one of the most marked characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon , o whether Briton or American . The Common People of England sent Juries , as well as regiments of Ironsides , to do battle for the Right . Gentlemen , let us devoutly thank God for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffers no detriment in our day , but serves always the Higher Law of the Infinite God . Now , Gentlemen of the Jury , I come to the end . /z/ Here , Gentlemen , I shall speak of three things . ( I. ) Of the Fugitive Slave Bill . At the close of the Revolution there was a contradiction in the national consciousness : the People were divided between the Idea of Freedom and the Idea of Slavery . There consequently ensued a 1 2 Campbell , Justices , 405 ; 6 St. Tr. 910 ; Kelyng , 50 ; 3 Hallam , 6 , note ; Com mons Journals , 16 Oct. 16G7. /z/ struggle between the two elements . This has continued ever since the Treaty of Peace in 1783 . Twice the Idea of Freedom has won an important victory : in 1787 Slavery was prohibited in the North- West Territory ; in 1808 the African Slave Trade was abolished . Gentlemen , this is all that has been done for seventy-two years ; the last triumph of American Free dom over American Slavery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been manifold : in 1787 Slavery came into the Constitution , it was left in the individual States as a part of their " Republican form of government ; " the slaves were counted fractions of men , without the personal rights of integral hu manity , and so to be represented by their masters ; and the rendition of fugitive slaves was provided for . In 1792 out of old territory a new Slave State was made and Kentucky came into the Union . Tennessee followed in 1796 , Mississippi in 1817 , Alabama in 1819 , and thus four Slave States were newly made out of soil which the Declaration of Independence covered with ideal freedom . In 1793 the Federal government took Slavery under its special patronage and passed the first fugitive slave bill for the capture of such as should escape from bondage in one State , and flee to another . In 1803 Louisiana was purchased and Slavery left in that vast territory ; thus 1he first expansion of our borders was an extension of bondage , out of that soil three great States , Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all despotic , with more than half a million of Americans fettered there to-day . Florida was purchased as slave soil , and in 1845 made a State with perpetual Slavery written in its Con stitution . In 1845 Texas was annexed and Slavery extended over nearly four hundred thousand square miles of once free soil ; in 1848 Slavery was spread over California , Utah , and New Mexico . Here were seven great victories of Slavery over Freedom . At first it seemed doubtful which was master in the federal coun cils ; but in 1820 , in a great battle the Missouri Compromise Slavery triumphed , and has ever since been master . In 1845 Texas was annexed , and Slavery became the open , acknowledged , and most insolent master . The rich , intelligent , and submissive North only registers the decrees of the poor , the ignorant , but the controlling South ; accepts for Officers such as the master appoints , for laws what the Slave-driver commands . The Slave-Power became predominant in American politics , business , literature , and " Religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say ? Look at this Honorable Court , at its Judges , its Attorney , at its Marshal , and its Marshal s Guard : they all hold their offices by petty serjeantry of me nial service rendered to the Slave-Power . It would be an insult to any one of this august fraternity to hint that he had the faintest respect /z/ for the great Principles of American Liberty , or any love of justice for all men . I shall not be guilty of that " contempt of court . " Gentle men , I had expected that this Court would be solemnly opened with prayer . I knew whom the Slave-Power would select as its priest to " intercede with Heaven . " I expected to hear the Rev. Nehemiah Adams , D. D. , ask the God he worships and serves to take " a Southside view of American Slavery " in general , and in special of this prosecution of a minister of the Christian Religion for attempting to keep the Golden Rule . Should the Court hereafter indulge its public proclivity to prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Court which knows no Higher Law . Well , Gentlemen , that sevenfold triumph was not enough . Slavery will never be contented so long as there is an inch of free soil in the United States ! New victories must be attempted . Mr. Toombs has declared to this noble Advocate of Justice and Defender of Humanity , John P. Hale who renews the virtuous glories of his illustrious namesake , Sir Matthew Hale , that , " Before long the master will sit down with his slaves at the foot of Bunker Hill Monument . " But one thing disturbed our masters at the South the concubine runs away from her lusty lord , the mulatto slave child from her white father ; I have had the " best blood of Virginia , " fugitive children of her " first families " in my own house , and have given many a dol lar to help the sons and daughters of " Southern Democrats " enjoy a taste of Northern Democracy . The slaves would run away . The law of 1793 was not adequate to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern command , " Slaves , obey your masters . " The Decision of the Supreme Court in the Prigg case , 1 showed the disposition of the Federal Government , and took out of the hands of the individual States the defence of their own citizens . Still the slaves would run away . In 1849 there were more than five hundred fugitives from Southern Democracy in Boston and their masters could not catch them . What a misfortune ! Boston re tained $200,000 of human Property of the Christian and chivalric South ! Surely the Union was " in danger . " In 1850 came the fugitive slave bill . When first concocted , its author , a restless politician , a man of small mind and mean charac ter , with " Plantation manners , " thought it was " too bad to pass . " He designed it not for an actual law , but an insult to the North so aggravating that she must resist the outrage , and then there would be an opportunity for some excitement and agitation at the South and perhaps some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that general fermentation who knows what scum would be thrown /z/ up ! Even Mr. Clay " never expected the law would be enforced . " No Northern gentleman " said he , " will ever help return a fugitive slave . " It seemed impossible for the bill to pass . But at that time Massachusetts had in the Senate of the nation a disappointed politician , a man of great understanding , of most mighty powers of speech , " Created liugest that swim the ocean stream , " and what more than all else contributed to his success in life , the most magnificent and commanding personal appearance . At that time his ambition nothing abated by the many years which make men venerable , he was a bankrupt in money , a bankrupt in reputation , and a bankrupt in morals I speak only of his public morals , not his private , a bankrupt in political character , pensioned by the Money Power of the North . Thrice disappointed , he was at that time gaming for the Presidency . When the South laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Webster bet his all upon that card . He staked his mind and it was one of vast com pass ; his eloquence , which could shake the continent ; his position , the senatorial influence of Massachusetts ; his wide reputation , which rung with many a noble word for justice and the Rights of man ; he staked his conscience and his life . Gentlemen , you know the rest , the card won , the South took the trick and Webster lost all he could lose , his conscience , his position , his reputation ; not his wide-compassing mind , not his earth-shaking eloquence . Finally he lost his life . Peace to his mighty shade . God be merciful to him that showed no mercy . The warning of his fall is worth more than the guidance of his success . Let us forgive ; it were wicked to forget . For fifty years no American has had such opportunity to serve his country in an hour of need . Never has an American so signally betrayed the trust not once since Benedict Arnold turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech of the 7th of March . You know it too well . He proposed to support the fugitive slave bill " with all its provisions , to the fullest extent . " At that time this bill of abomi nations was worse than even now ; for then it left the liberty of a man to the discretion not only of any judge or commissioner of any Fed eral court , but to any clerk or marshal thereof , nay , to any collector of the customs and every one of the seventeen thousand postmasters in the United States ! It provided that an affidavit made before any officer empowered , by the United States or any State , to administer oaths , should be taken as conclusive evidence to prove a man a slave ! So John Smith of some unknown town in Texas , might make affi- /z/ davit before John Jones , a justice of peace in the same place , that Lewis Hayden , or Wendell Phillips , or his Honor Judge Curtis , was his ( Smith s ) slave , and had escaped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Texas , or find some collector of the customs or minion of the court in Massachusetts , seize his victim , and swear away his liberty ; and any man might be at once con signed to eternal bondage ! All that the bill provided for , and au thorized the kidnapper to employ as many persons as he might think proper to accomplish his purpose by force , at the expense of the United States ! All this Mr. Webster volunteered to support " to the fullest extent . " The bill was amended , here bettered , there worsened , and came to the final vote . Gentlemen , the Money Power of the North joined the Slave Power of the South to kidnap men in America after 1850 , as it had kidnapped them in Africa before 1808 . Out of fifty Senators only twelve said , No ; while in the House 109 voted Yea . The Hon. Samuel A. Eliot gave the vote of Beacon and State Streets for kid napping men on the soil of Boston . The one Massachusetts vote for manstealing must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Adams in her bosom ; yes , from under the eaves of John Hancock s house ! That one vote was not disgrace enough ; his suc cessor Hon. William Appleton must take a needless delight in reaffirming the infamy . When the bill passed , Gentlemen , you re member how Mr. Webster rejoiced : Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer , " was his public outcry on the housetop ! And Boston fired a hundred guns of joy ! Do you know who fired them ? Ask Mr. Attorney Hallett ; ask Mr. Justice Curtis . They can " instruct the jury . " Gentlemen , you know the operation of the fugitive slave bill . It subverts the Purposes of the Constitution , it destroys Justice , disturbs domestic Tranquillity , hinders the common Defence and the general Welfare , and annihilates the Blessings of Liberty . It defies the first Principles of the Declaration of Independence , think of the fugitive slave bill as an appendix to that document ! It violates the Idea of Democracy . It contradicts the very substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandments of Love to God , and Love to man , whereon " hang all the Law and the Prophets . " It makes natu ral humanity a crime ; it subjects all the Christian virtues to fine and imprisonment . It is a Icltre de cachet against Philanthropy . Gentlemen of the Jury , you know the fugitive slave bill is uncon stitutional . I need not argue the matter ; it is too plain to need proof . /z/ Sec how it opposes Justice , the ultimate purpose of human law ; nay , the declared objects of the Constitution itself ! But yet its unconstitutionality has been most abundantly shown by our own fellowcitizen. - . I need not go out of Massachusetts for defenders of Justice and Law . You remember the Speeches of Mr. Phillips , Mr. Sewall , Mr. Rantoul , Mr. Sunnier , Mr. Mann , the arguments of Mr. Hildreth . The judges before you by nature are able-minded men , both of them ; both also learned as lawyers and otherwise well educated , I love to honor their natural powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise . Now , I will not insult their manly understanding with tiie supposition that either of them ever thought the fugitive slave bill constitutional . No , Gentlemen , it is not possible that in the personal opinion of Mr. Sprague , or even Mr. Curtis , this bill can be held for a constitutional law . But the Court has its official dress : part of it is of silk or supposed to be , the gown which decorates the outward figure of the man who wears its ample folds ; it is made after a prescribed pattern . But part of it also is made of opinion which hides the ability and learning of the honorable Court . The constitutionality of the fugitive slave bill is a part of the judge s official dress : accordingly , as no federal judge sits without his " silk gown , so none appears without his " opinion " that the fugitive slave bill is constitutional . But if the court should solemnly declare that such was its personal opinion Gentlemen of the Jury , I , I should not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk was the natural judicial covering , the actual " true skin " of the judges . No , Gentlemen , these judges are not monsters , not naturally idiotic in their Conscience . This opinion is their official robe , a sup plementary cuticle , an artificial epidermis , woven from without , to be thrown off one day , when it shall serve their turn , by political desquamation . Let them wear it ; " they have their reward . " But you and I , Gentlemen , let us thank God we are not officially barked about with such a leprous elephantiasis as that . You are to judge of its constitutionality for yourselves , not to take the purchased , official opinion of the judge as veil for your Conscience ; let it hide the judges if they like . Gentlemen , I lack words to describe the fugitive slave bill ; its sins outrun my power of speech . But you know the consequences which follow if it be accepted by the People , submitted to , and en forced : the State of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her laws nothing ; her Constitution nothing the Rights of the State are whistled away by the " opinion " of a fugitive slave bill judge , the rights of the citizen all gone ; his right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness lies at the mercy of the meanest man whom this Court shall ever make a Commissioner to kidnap men . /z/ Yes , Gentlemen of the Jury , you hold your liberty at the mercy of George T.

It was only a part of Boston that fired them . The bill was odious here to all just and honorable men . Massachusetts hated the bill , and was in no haste to " conquer her prejudices " in favor of Justice , Humanity , and the Christian Religion ; she did not like the " disagreeable duty " of mak ing a public profession of practical Atheism . At first the yellow fever of the slave-hunters did not extend much beyond the pavements of Boston and Salem ; so pains must be taken to spread the malady . The greatest efforts were made to induce the People to renounce their Christianity , to accept and enforce the wicked measure . The cry was raised , " The Union is in danger : " nobody believed it ; they least of all who raised the cry . Some clergymen in the Churches of Com merce were coaxed , wheedled , or bought over , and they declared kid napping would be imputed unto men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was likened to " faithful Abraham " in the Hebrew mythic tale , " the rendition of a slave was like the sac rifice of Isaac . " One Trinitarian minister , a son of Massachusetts , laid Conscience down before the Juggernaut of the fugitive slave bill , another would send his own mother into/q/
