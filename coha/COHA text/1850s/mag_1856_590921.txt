UNITED STATES DEMOCRATIC REVIEW . DECEMBER , 1856 . THE VERDICT OF TIlE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES . IN the year 1783-84 , a council of Censors assembled in the State of Pennsylvania , " to inquire whether the Constitution had been preserved inviolate in every part ; and whether the Legislative and Executive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians of the people , or assumed to themselves , or exercised other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the Constitution . " Mr. Madison says it appeared that the Constitution had been flagrantly violated by the Legislatur* in a variety of important instances . On the fourth day of November , in the year 1856 , a grand council of Censors assembled in the United States of America . An assembly so imposing , or charged with the decision of so great issues , was never seen since the day their fathers and predecessors were asked , " Shall America be a nation ? " And , before the people of the land went up to that great council , evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , labored diligently to make mischief between them , and to fill them with angry passions . The poets sang songs of battle ; 25 // orators incited to it ; the press , hotly wicked , recorded with exultation the fever of the public mind , and stimulated its fury . And , saddest , wickedest of all , they who claimed to have received the great commission to preach in all lands the message of divine pity and universal love , first spoken on those holy fields " Over whose acres wa1ke*d those blessed feet , Which , eighteen hundred years ago , were nailed For our advantage , on the hitter cross , " shut to the doors of the sanctuary ; descended into the dust and strife of the political arena ; forgot the precepts and example of their divine Master ; and preached among brothers of one blood , one interest , and one duty-division , disunion , violence , fratricide , civil war . But the thoughts of their Master and ours , were as high above their thoughts as the heavens are above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; and spite of all they have done , or may hereafter do , in angry madness , we look forward to the future of our country with a gay and cheerful hope , relying upon the rest of his promise , that the remainder of wrath he will restrain . Let none condemn us for using these words . No Scripture is of any private interpretation . Against us the Democracy , against our great leader and elected head JAMES BUCHANAN , the wresters of Scripture to private uses and sectional purposes , have launched all the volleyed thunder of their unholy wrath . They have poured it out upon us without stint and without measure . And it has been their crime to use God 's truth to help man 's anger . On the contrary , it has not been theleast of our virtues that we have manifested for it openly that respect which we sincerely feel . Religion , exiled for a while from the pulpit , has found refuge and sanctuary in Democratic assemblies . From the beginning of the contest to the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into a rhapsody of words . We have plainly said what we deeply and conscientiously believed-that this American people is the chosen people of God in these latter days ; that to us he has committed the truth-freedom of conscience in religion-freedom of action , of thought , of speech , in politics ; and that these things have been builded up , confirmed and established b* the Democratic party for now more than half a century . Therefore we can appeal , as our fathers did , to God , for the rectitude of our intentions ; and rely upon his providence to protect and sustain us for the future as it has most manifestly done in the past . And this has appeared , too , with such clearness to the people // of these States , that in spite of all our enemies could do against us , although they were exceedingly mad , when the great council of Censors-that same People-were come together on the fourth of November , 1856 , they decided that we had been wrongfully accused ; they decided that in the execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had performed its duty as theguardian of the people  --  the Union , and the Constitution . That it had never assumed to itself nor exercised other or greater powers than it was entitled to , or the good of the nation demanded to be exercised . They decided that JAMES BUCHANAN and JOHN C. BRECKENRIDGE were the representative men , and true exponents of the calm thought and right reason of the people of this country at this time . And to them they have committed the welfare , peace and dignity of the American Commonwealth until the year 1861 . With how high and confident a hope we hail their accession to power , or how surely we rely upon their patriotism to dare , and their ability to do , all that may be necessary for the peace and happiness of the whole country , we need not here repeat . That patriotism and ability have been our theme for many months . It was a hearted belief with us , and so boldly spoken . In the pages of this Review , in , our campaign paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daily engaged in uttering our conviction that their election would restore harmony to the Republic , and disperse the clouds which have momentarily obscured the prospect of the future . In that election , and the blessings which it promises , we feel our toil and sweat of brain and body largely paid . The man whom Benton has wisely characterized as " the safest man for the public good ; " a great statesman ; a wise , inflexible , large-minded American statesman , receives , with the calmness of conscious rectitude and power , a commission from the people of the United States to sustain the peace , honor , and national greatness and territorial integrity of the country . He has the personal character and capacity to do it . He will be sustained in doing it by a Congress reflecting the same confidence in the past history and policy of the Democratic party , reposed by the people of the United States in himself . And whilst his course can not but be one of great labor and trial , every labor must be lightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers and good wishes of every patriot are constantly with him . And if our humble labors and trials in the great cause are so sweetly solaced by the thought that we have been allowed to be instrumental in contributing in some degree to // reinstate truth in its proper place , how much grander and . znore consoling must be his convictions to whose hands the 2acred standard itself is committed , and who beholds rallying around it , with affectionate confidence , a whole people . And to this consolation he can add also that noblest of all solaces , the approval of a good conscience . Standing , clearly and sternly , upon the one great principle of the Union of the States , and their constitutional rights in the Union , he has not condescended to seek the favor of any by yielding one jot or tittle of that principle . And it is the crowning glory of this contest , that the principle has triumphed with him . So confident are we of this , that we believe every scheme of disunion will soon perish from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reestablished , under his administration , between all *ections of the country . Nor will he want able instruments to carry out the noble and pacific purposes of his administration . The whole genius and greatness of the country is on his side . It is , indeed , a very remarkable and significant fact , that all the reat men of the - country have arrayed themselves on our part in the contest just passed . The open heresy against all the constitutional traditions of our national history , professed by the African-iRepublicans , their disloyalty to their country and indeed the whole tenor of their bad d signs , left them nothing , at best , but fifth-rate men . Every name honorably connected with our legislation for any term of years , or marked and distin nished in commercial and professional annals , is found in*c*.ibed among the list of Mr. Buchanan 's ardent and energetic porters . To the small fry of unknown men , who had neither name , fame , nor honesty to lose by the association with e outrages and excesses of sectionalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notoriety . It will be seen also by comparing the vote cast for the different andidates , that the body of conservative men in the North is quite as great as in the South . Amongst this Northern cons*rvative body the sentiment undoubtedly is that ample and cc mplete justice , according to the plain letter of the Constitution , should be done to all parts of the Union . That con servative body which is the real back-bone and power of the North - *o a man unite with the sentiments expressed by Mr. Benton in th latter part of his speech at St. Louis , Nov. 3d : " Mr. Buchanan will enter on his administration in times of extreme trouble , at a time when disunion is threatened , when there is danger of actual territorial dissolution of the Union , and when many of the evils of disunion , and those // 1856. like Verdict of the People of the Uhited 8tcttes. which are father to all the rest , are already upon us . Although he may be elected , the causes which have produced all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not the end . lie will , therefore , have a difficult time in the beginning . He will need the support and confidence of all the lovers of the Union . So far as I may have any power to act , he shall receive my support for every thing he does complying with his pledges to restore harmony to the Union by conciliatory means . I have no idea , of course , that force is to hold the different parts of the Union together . A different sentiment made this Union  --  the same sentiment can alone preserve it . The sentiment that united us  --  and that feeling can only come from a sense of equal justice , from a feeling and belief that justice is done to every party ; and in that I believe Mr. Buchanan will act his part . ( Cheers . ) Fellow citizens , he will have damger ; he will have trouble . Extreme parties in the North , and extreme parties in the South , a minority everywhere , by their activity , by the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand for greater numbers than they really have . I saw the formation of this Union . I was old enough at the adoption of this Constitution to recollect its adoption . I remember the joy which went through the country when the State of North-Carolina , to which I belonged , entered into the American Union-for she did not join until the second year of Washington 's administration . Congress met without her . Congress held a session without her . She came in afterwards . I remember it all well ; and it would be among the calamities of my life if I should live to see the woeful change of the separation of these States , the union of which was the subject of universal toil . ( Cheers . ) But there is danger . Good men , judging from their own feelings and bclief speak of safety . They are speaking from the heart , speaking as they feel against the thing which they hold to be impossible , because it is too bad to be looked at . They speak from these feelings ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have even heard it regretted publicly and in public speeches , that it was ever formed . I have heard earnest wishes expressed for its dissolution . I have known that this sentiment , expressed in large public bodies , has met with applause , and I know by the feeling that lies at the bottom of that movement , that there is danger in the end , and the only way to avert that danger is to face it , knox it , and see it , and to apply the proper remedy before it is too late . That remedy is not force ; it is justice , it is kindness , it is administering the Constitution of the United States // in the spirit in which it was made , and to do what is right and just to every part of the Union . It took about seven years to form this Constitution . Five-and-twenty years it has taken to get to our present state of danger . You know that the first attempt at nullification and secession was in the time of Jackson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other point rose up , and another point has been kept up ever since ; and during this long period there have been cases made ahead on the happening of which the Union must be dissolved , and so on , one after another ; for the period of twenty-five years , there has been a deep-seated feeling of hostility to this Union , and Mr - Madison , who died in 1836 , at the age of 86 , among other letters to a friend , states the grief of his heart , and misgiving at signs that were approaching ; he noticed the spread throughout the Southern States  --  the spread of nulhfication , and what he called the susceptibility of the South to the alarm for their property . He saw it going on ; he saw the danger ; and in one of these letters he said that dissatisfaction was working at the South , and that it would not be possible to retain in the Union , against its will , any large portion of the States . Force , with him , was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way to prevent a large section from sliding off . Fellow citizens , the remedy which presents itself *o my mind to it is to deprive any section of the Union of the cause . Do justice to all , administer the Constitution in its proper spirit , give to all its compromises full and free sway , and upon that I rely that the people will cling together ; the small party will be unable to make themselves felt . ( Loud applause . ) Nullification in the South , nullification and secession in the South , abolitionism in the North  --  and by abolitionism I include no man that is against the extension of slavery where it does not now exist . ( Cheers . ) I am one of that class myself . ( Cheers . ) I have avowed that on every occasion , and I say it to you , fellow citizens , that one of the occasions in which I saw Henry Clay rise higher than I thought I ever saw him before , was when , in the debate on the admission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried into this Territory , where it never was . Then Mr. Clay , rising , loomed colossally in the Senate of the United States , as he rose declaring that for no earthly purpose , no earthly object , could he carry slavery into h exist hef places were it did not ore . ( Cheers . ) At the same time he woulJ bare his hrem*st against any infraction against the right of the slaveholders wherever it existed . ( Long-continued applause . ) It was a great and proud day for Mr. Clay , towards // the latter days of his life ; and if an artist could have been there to catch his expression as he uttered that sentiment , with its reflex on his face , and his countenance beaming with firmness of purpose , it would have been a glorious moment in which to transmit him to posterity-his countenance all alive and luminous with the ideas that beat in his bosom . ( Loud applause , which interrupted the speaker . ) That was a proud day . I could have wisbed that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling you they were his , and adoDting them as my own . " Such also is the universal sentiment , we believe , of good men both North and South . In our leader of last month we think we proved the right of territories to judge the matter of slavery for themselves . That is the whole scope and intention of the Nebraska-Kansas bill . On the fair and honest interpretation and enforcement of the principles of that bill the Northern and Southern Democracy is a unit . Wild and foolish men of either section may talk as much nonsense as they please . Let themspeech is free . But the conservative Democracy of both sections stands unmoved and unmovable by the rights of the States . No more . And this party at the North have complete confidence in Mr. Buchanan . They believe that his motto will be equal justice to all , and that nothing can alarm or seduce him from the plain course of duty . But however well backed our chosen leader may be , or however great his own capacity to grapple with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future , his path will not lie through beds of flowers . The way will be rugged at the best , and he will need all his own acknowledged energy , and all the assistance oC honest well.wishers of their country , to sustain him . The public mind has been studiously agitated and inflamed by evil men , until it rather craves than fears the stimulants of a disordered State ; and prefers a supper of horrors , and the nightmare , to plain fare and a good sleep . We hear indeed every day , everywhere , and from all manner of persons , moved and acted upon by all manner of different motives , that " the times are out of joint ; " and every body considers it a " cursed spite " that they should be appointed surgeons in ordinary to set right their particular limb of the body politic . This general consent , and common outcry of evil , would be alarming if it were possessed of either the character or merit of novelty . Happily for our nerves , *aappily for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has never been a year of its history , since the invention of printing , which // has not produced its crisis . According to the philosophy of the grumblers , the world commenced going backwards shortly after the decline and fall of the IRoman Empire-in fact , went quite astray in the darkness and barbarism of the Middle Ages , and , although a certain degree of light has been breaking in upon it for a long time past , has never altogether recovered the right track , or made up for the time lost in its weary wanderings and wearier sleep . And yet all these discontented people are happy enough to eat well , drink well , and sleep well . Without being poetical enough to write odes to the " banner of stars , " or heroic enough to make dying wrapped in its folds a pleasure so great as to pluck the barb from the dart of the last enemy , they do , nevertheless , live every day , and all their lives long , comfortably clothed in that excellent but shockingly misused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bunting , making , thereby , complaint a species of ingratitude. 1f however , this kind of quarrelling with fate , and wholesale abuse of one 's own particular times and country were confined to the conversation of private citizens , whilst it would by no means add to their own usefulness or comfort , it would be , at worst , a harmless folly . But those who undertake to instruct and direct mankind , the orators and writers who have the knack of button-holding the public , and whispering or thundering their complaints into all the ears of all the hydras ' heads at once , are ever the busiest at this trade of fault-finding , and are always , like Cassandra , going about to impress the whole community with the idea that there is nothing for them in the future but ruin and retribution . Fired with the idea that the pen and the tongue have taken the place of the sceptre and the sword , these worthies start from every nook and corner , shake hands with their old companions the bats and owls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the men of fate , whose mission it is to retrieve all the misfortunes and rectify all the errors of the world . A little experience disenchants them of their delusive hope , but not of their vanity . Stung with the world 's ingratitude and contempt of such illustrious moralists and reformers as they were prepared to be , they quickly become as eager to revenge its slights , as they were at first to correct its errors and ameliorate its condition . Avarice and ignorance , bad taste , bad counsels , a tendency to barbarism , retrogression , proclivity , deciduousness-any amount of crimes , charges and epithets you please-furnish them with material for their second campaign . The disastrous event of their first having taught them little wisdom if no virtue , they ally themselves // to a party , a sect , a faction , and enlist the prejudices of less cunning fools than themselves , so that their ranks begin at last to make a respectable show , and their complaints are listened to , no matter how paltry the declaimer , or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their second campaign with new weapons , and the nucleus of . an army , and , if they happen to have either wit or wickedness enough to attempt desperate enterprises , in a little while acquire a position respectable for strengtb , if for nothing else . Others of the same kidney recognize the advantages of the combination , and propose alliances . What was at first a faction , not unfrequently becomes after a little a party , offers a bold and commanding front to its country , and , possibly , stamps its characteristics , either of good or evil , for ever upon the age which originated its " small beginnings . " There probably never was a time of such universal prosperity and happiness in the world that no man , nor no considerable body of men , had any just cause for complaint and dissatisfaction . It is equally probable-nay , it is evident , that every age has its general dangers and its particular crisis ; as , also , that every country might be better than it is ; every ruler more competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every virtuous man more actively useful ; every pious one a greater ornament of religion . In short , that we may easily conceive human perfections ; but  --  and here is the answer to the grumblers-what it is possible for us to conceive og is very often , and , in this case , always , impossible to bring to pass in action and in life . We can go on perfecting : we never reach perfection . The crisis of one age is little more than the " prologue to the swelling act " of the next ; and the danger which to-day agitates every bosom of the community with fear , hope , dread , with all the passions of humanity at their height , is tomorrow the province and property of the historians ; and , perhaps , it is a vexed question with them whether there was any reason for any body to have been the least excited about the matter . Whatever may be our trials , our dangers , or even our disasters , therefore , we have no right to assume that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ; and about as little to predict that any future one will be exempted from them . Pride , which no success would satisfy ; affectation , anxious for sympathy , and rather insisting upon being utterly miserable than want it ; timidity , starting from the shadows of a diseased fancy ; discontent , rather devoting a life-time to the creation of evils , where there were none before , than consent to be without its argument ; ambition , to which the calm equality // and unruffled happiness of peaceful times are mere destructionthese are , unfortunately for the world , the fruitful seeds of discord and turmoil planted in every age , and amongst every people . But perhaps the most powerful element of unrest is the vanity of writers . Ambitious of producing something out of nothing ; eager to create , and keenly alive to the mortification of even partial failure , they ally themselves , as a general thing , with the part of grumblers , and , as vituperation has many stronger epithets than praise , and the bitterness of fault-finding is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good nature , they fall into an immediate success and local notoriety which , whilst it flatters them into the belief that they are on the high road to all the greatness their most ambitious dreams ever painted , confirms them , in spite of the most lamentable failures , in the bad habit of always seeing the bitter and the evil , and always distrusting the simple but sublime pleasures of content and goodness . We of this Republic are very much pestered and overrun with this kind of cattle . Small poets , small journalists , small politicians , and even smaller and more contemptible would-be moralists and reformers , each armed with a system , and , unluckily , too often intrenched in the columns of widely circulating papers , swarm everywhere , both in city and in country . These gentlemen , forsooth , are " nothing if not critical ; " nothing if not iconoclasts of every innocent idol of habit or of fancy . They have no ambition but to give us a world , a state , a society , from which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful ; willfully forgetting that under proper restraints , and properly directed , the fancy is as useful as the reason , and the d*elicate perfume of the flower not less necessary in the economy of nature than the oak of the forest , or the corn , the wine , and the oil , which strengthen man for his labor . How we have been pestered with these gad-flies during the campai0n , and how the Sophomorical flourishes of a Sumner , and the garrulous twaddle of a Beecher ; how the strange mixture of blasphemy , treason , and nonsense poured from hustings , press , and pulpit , has bedevilled men 's minds and fancies until they almost confounded night with day , and good with evilis it not like a fantastic dream of horrors ? and ought we not to be deeply thankful that our waking brings with it a new capacity for healthful enjoyment of the real blessings which these wild and foolish men have , happily , labored in vain to take from us ? And yet this battle has been fought by only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 800,000 citizens of full age , // and entitled to vote , in the State of New-York . And of these more than a third have remained idly at home during this canvass . A quarter of a million of them have refused to exercise the franchise of a freeman . They have permitted their State escutcheon to be stained by the triumph of a fanatical and sectional party . It is clear by their not voting that they are not fanatics or abolitionists , for such men always vote . It is then fair to conclude that they would have voted on the side of order , Union , and the Constitution , if their strange sloth had not held them back . How can they answer to their country for their neglect of the most obvious duty of a good citizen ? Are they insensible to shame ? Do they not feel it now , when the majority of the nation has spoken with no double or doubtful voice its indignation against and condemnation of every scheme of sectionalism and disunion ? How will they preach to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand findeth to do , do it with thy might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave , whither thou goest " ? It is then labor to which every man who fulfills the intention of his being , and obeys the ordination of his Creator , is called and destined in the world . It is , in the words of Longfellow , so to live " that each to-morrow find us farther than to-day . " Forward always ; forward ever . No looking back , no shrinking , no withdrawing the hand from the plough . And it is because , as a nation , and , for the most part , as individuals , we obey that divine law of our creation , that the God of nations , as well as of individuals , has enriched and made us great . Every American appears born into the world , not as a mere item in the great account of hiP inanity , but as an officer of Providence sent and appointed to take account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite and useful balance-sheet of life . Very early in life we catch from each other , from the tone of the society in which we live , the idea that neither mere enjoyment , nor mere strife to get the wherewithal to clothe and feed us , is " our destined end and way . " We feel as if something in the shape of action , something passing out of ourselves , and exerting an influence upon the course of our law , the action of our government , the character of the society in which we are called to move , was required of us . As if a kind of necessity , not the nemesis , not the blind fatalism of the Greek and iloman , but a moral necessity of doing according to our delegated strength and power , followed always behind us , as our commanding officer , and cried out , clear and sonorous above the din of life and turmoil // of business , On ! Push on with the advance ! Some disobey the voice ; some lag and loiter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat and drink and be merry , and let the moving world go by unheeded , consoling themselves with the other words of the wise preacher , but not seeing the wisdom of their irony , or the irony of their wisdom-which you will : " A feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh merry ; but money answereth all things . " And yet it seems to us that when we have seen that same moving world of action , and of enterprise for good , go by them , they have , as it might be , winced , and looked aside , or chattered a little peevishly with each other , and raised the mantling wine-cup with hands not altogether assured -- drinkin* rather to dissipate unpleasant thoughts , than from an impulse of pure enjoyment . Well , let them sit by the way-side of our American life , without a motive , and without an object . We feel no envy of their occupation , and to our simple thinking are not alone in our manner of considering them . Every untamed valley and wide rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet faintly , and is only heard at long intervals and wide apart , echoes the order , Push on with the advance . Idlers and drones fall back to the rear . Men of heart and men of action-forward ! Every cry from the crowded millions of the old world , yearning for those rights for which we have not to strive , taking them as our inheritance of which only fools or fanatics desire or hope to despoil us ; and all the thousands of that same old world pouring in upon our shores , bid us be up and doing . A new element of physical greatness adds itself daily to our strength , imposing upon us the duty , which is also a necessity , of combining with this physical element our own moral elements of education and republican principle . No man can safely be idle at this day in the republic . No man . can clear himself of responsibility before God and his people , or delegate to others his share of the task . As surely as the sun shines , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so surely every American has a mission to perform  --  a work to do-beyond the acquisition of wealth or social position . It is not enough that he is a " good citizen , " as the phrase runs ; obeying the laws , and living honestly and uprightly in the sight of men . He is not a good citizen in any thing but the cant name , if he does no more . He has no right to the name , no claim to be respected as a citizen , if he permit other men to go forward , whilst he remains at his work , or at his pleasure . New ideas are in the world ; new principles are insinuating // themselves into the frame-work of society . It behooves every d small , to examine whether these thino*s be evil man OTeat an b or good ; whether they are in accordance with the principles of his fathers , and tend to the benefit of his country .

Other men will do for you , what you are too idle or too predecupied to do for yourselves , and you will not be asked whether you have time for them or not . You will be simply compelled to fall into the line , as one of the rank and file , and ordered to push on with the army on its march . It will be idle then to look around you-idle to regret the mental slothfulness which surrendered to others the right of action , and retained for itself only the right , for a little while , to enjoy . You will no longer have the power even to remonstrate . You will only have the choice , a very poor one it is , to go on , or to be trampled under foot . Now , we are not manufacturing armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body restlessly moving amidst us . Whither ? That is the question for every one to ask . There is also a strange and sad apathy among that class of the people who ought to think and act . They are pleased with the fallacious idea that what our fatbers did is carved in adamant . It is false and selfish . No human work is immutable ; and there is no state of things in this age of the world , except a state of unrest . Its fever is unrest ; its panacea , change . Who shall govern those changes - all or a part ? And can any man afford to lose his voice in their government , for the sake of a little rest or pleasure ? " Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with all thy might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave , whither thou goest . " The carelessness of wealth , and security of sloth , is the grave of nations . We may die , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our childrew*who are to come after us , and for them we build the ark . It is time that every man felt how much he owes to our unequalled system of government , and how deep his obligation to lend arm and heart to the Republic . We have deeply felt the apathy of our formerly active men in the State of New-York during the past campaign . Those , in fact , to whom we had been always in the habit of looking as the men to take the lead in political enterprises , held back , and // did little or nothing . They left the whole thing to the young men of the party ; and outside the city of New-York , and th' adjacent counties , did not even allow them the chance to act . In New-York and its vicinity the mercantile interest nobly supported the efforts of the Buchanan Clubs , and the young men devoted themselves with great ardor to the work . The result there shows how well they did it . We care little , however , about the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with leaders or without them , have come up to the work from the length and breadth of the land , and a glorious prospect opens before us . The government is in the hands of the Democratic party . We have never failed to administer it for the best interests of the whole country ; and what we have done we can and will do again . JAMES BUCHANAN takes the helm on the 4th day of March , 1857 , and the calmness of Democratic wisdom succeeds the stormy folly of faction and fanaticism . Till then we possess our souls in the patience of a confirmed hope . For six months we have worked for the result now happily accomplished , as we never worked before , and as , we will confess , in all honesty , we never desire to have to work again , for brain and body both hint to us that we have tasked them overmuch ; but the victory , in the language of ilufus Choate , is worth " dying for-ay , even worth having lived for .
