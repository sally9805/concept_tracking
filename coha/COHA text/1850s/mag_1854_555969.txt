txt ART . VI . - 1 . Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes , and for Juvenile Offenders . By MARY CARPENTER . London : Gilpin. 18.51. 2 . Juvenile Delinquents , their Condition and Treatment . By MARY CARPENTER . London : Cash . 1853 . WE have already , in a brief notice , * called attention to one of the volumes now before us ; but we are unwilling to dismiss them without recording more fully our sense of their great interest and value . The accomplished and excellent lady to whom we are indebted for this most satisfactory treatment of a subject so painful to the natural feeling , and so beset with difficulties to the practical understanding , has given one more example of the position that may be taken and the work that may be done by a Christian woman , while respecting the most scrupulous limits that society has assigned to the office of her sex . While so much in the true position of women is matter of declamation and debate , we rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of another in our own country , to show how , without any cavil , or sacrifice of selfrespect , the noblest tasks of philanthropy may be undertaken , and carried through on the largest scale , by a woman 's devoted energy and faith in God . There is something very touching and beautiful in this protest of the religious conscience against the dark fatalism which , to so many minds , seems to swallow up all hope // for the future of the wronged and the criminal . Gigantic strides in social or industrial " progress " have fixed great gulfs between the favored and the poor . Vast piles of wealth cast deep shadows of want . Crime advances with a swifter pace than population . Ignorance in one class breeds and spreads faster than enlightenment in another class . Civilization is always beset by its " perishing and dangerous classes , " - those to whom life is a misery and a failure , and those to whom society is a foe . And it has been too much the way with many , abandoning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hopeless ruin , contenting themselves with the dreary creed , that the Destiny which appoints to every nation its set time of growth and decay crushes men by millions , and little children , too , by the same irresistible and irreversible decree . Now while this is the secret or professed philosophy of some , and the minds of others yield unwillingly to a cowardly scepticism , it seems to us a noble and most cheering thing that Christian faith , embodied in a woman 's labor , and uttered in a woman 's words , not only speaks a brave protest , but shows the way of rescue , and proves by deeds that it is practicable . The immediate aim of Miss Carpenter 's volumes is to gather a mass of testimony that may have its practical effect , first , in convincing the public mind , and next in hastening and guiding legislation , - testimony that may be irrefragable in its character , and irresistible by the sheer weight and bulk of it . To a remarkable degree , she keeps any personal agency or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts begun many years ago , and most faithfully carried out , in Bristol , for the rescue of children from ignorance and vice , - which we know to have been not incoiisiderable , - is studiously veiled behind a mass of evidence gathered from both continents , and arranged with great skill and care , so as to serve for a solid and impersonal argument of fact . The mind of the author is chiefly apparent in the fervent religious tone , the confidence of conviction , the powerful sense of duty , and the direct appeal to conscience , which convert materials so various all to a single end . It is in the grouping of materials , therefore , that the most // obvious value of these volumes consists . In the earlier one , after an introductory chapter detailing the actual coudition of the classes mentioned , we have the following topics : First Principles , Evening Ragged Schools , Free Pay Schools , Industrial Feeding Schools , The Jail , and Penal Reformatory Schools . In the second volume , - in which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sense of a more immediate practical purpose , - a fuller exposure is made of the evils of existing modes of treatment ; the experience of America , of the Continent , arid of private philanthropy in England , is given in greater detail ; and the work concludes with a summary of principles and their modes of application . We give this rapid view of the broad field occupied by these treatises , because we wish to direct attention to Miss Carpenter 's own statements , and not to substitute an imperfect sketch . Those who seek full information will not be satisfied without personal study of the subject ; and they will feel especially grateful , that so much of the task of collection and condensation is superseded for them . The importance of the topic treated certainly can not be exaggerated , neither can we over-estimate the need of some full and popular treatment of it , like the present . " The mass of society , " says Miss Carpenter , " are better acquainted with the actual condition of remote savage nations , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , whose true nature is less visible to the public eye when collected in a Ragged School , or swarming in by-streets , than is the state of little heathen children as exhibited in the reports of missionaries . " Many of the details presented in these volumes are of course more directly applicable to English society than to ours ; but the same general facts are repeating themselves in our commercial cities with startling rapidity , and the condensed narrative before us has hardly less practical interest here than there . The several reform schools , the " FivePoints House of Industry , " the reports of our city missions , deal respectively with the same order of things shown on so appalling a scale in the great cities of the Old World . Christian civilization is interested as a whole to defend itself against the invasions of ignorance , squalor , and crime . The // perishing classes appeal as loudly to our conscience , and the dangerous classes to our fear , as if we too had a thousand years ' history behi*d us . What then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signified by these new but already familiar phrases ? To state the case in its most striking form , and leaving out of view mere accident or misfortune , we find a distinct order or class in every populous community , whom society regards as outcasts , or enemies . They are Ishmaclites , or , as they have been called , Arabs of the street , - their hand against every man , and every man 's hand against them . They live by preying upon the rest . What others produce , they consume ; what others accumulate , they destroy . In great cities they make a hostile camp , which society sustains an army of police to watch , assail , out-mano3uvre , and defeat , in every possible way , - a paid and registered army of about six thousand in London alone , to watch a hostile force at least ten times as numerous , that dwell constantly in abject , deadly terror of them . Though reckoned by tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands , - in England computed last year ( 1853 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest possible estimate , " - they have no place in the census except by prison statistics ; no recognition from the law , except through the criminal calendar . By a singular anomaly in legal practice , they have hitherto been reckoned as having no infancy , or age of nonaccountability . Two Scottish children of the ages of two and szx were two years ago sentenced for poaching to a fine of some eight dollars each , " or , failing payment , thirty days ' imprisonment " ! * As a class , they consist of the vagrant , the desperately needy , the unprincipled and reckless , - often organized in companies and communities for self-defence , having their secret system of law among themselves , their own invisible police , their own dialect of " slang , " their social customs and places of abode , - right by our side , it may be , yet strange and unknown to us as the customs of Japan , or the internal economy of a tribe of wild animals . Ethnologically , many of them may be relics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquerers ,  --  " cursed races , " as they call them on the continent of Europe . Some are victims to misfortune of birth , some are driven by fault or crime of their own out of their inherited position . Grouped thus in a great order by themselves , they become barbarians in the midst of civilization , carrying the wants , instincts , passions , and habits of barbarians into the shadow of comfortable homes . They throng the darkest and densest quarters of large towns . They make a separate and hostile camp under cover of streets and lanes , and are recruited daily from those unhappily born or bred , or from those thrust out in the great chase for livelihood or gain . They live by a perpetual law of plunder , by the pirate 's right of strength and cunning . They are kept in check by violence and fear , - in some few cases only , rescued from their vagrancy , and brought into the ranks of the social organization . They comprise those who make a living of dishonesty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulge , and those who thrive by , the worst passions of our nature ; those whom our religion has not yet succeeded in reclaiming , and our laws in exterminating . To state the matter in still another form : there are ( we are told ) two distinct classes or races of mankind , - dividing them not ethnographically , but socially , - the wanderers and the settlers , vagabonds and citizens , the nomadic and the civilized . Moreover , not only are all races of mankind divisible into wanderers and settlers , in large outline but each civilized or settled tribe has generally some wandering horde intermingled with , and in some measure preying upon it . As distinguished from the rest , these wandering tribes are remarkable for their animal characteristics , for the strongly developed bones of the cheek and jaw , and for a language of their own , - slang or " thieves ' Latin , " as it is called , - adapted to conceal their designs and way of life from the more honest part of the community . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world ; and are in fact an inseparable feature of our modern civilization as we find it at present . The nomadic or wandering man is distinguished from his more civilized neighbor " by his repugnance to regular and continuous labor ; by his want of // providence in laying up a store for the future ; by his inability to perceive consequences ever so slightly removed from immediate apprehension ; by his passion for stupefying herbs and roots , and , when possible , for intoxicating drinks ; by his extraordinary powers of endnring privation , and insensibility to pain ; by an immoderate love of gaming , frequently risking his own personal liberty upon a single cast ; by his love of libidinous dances ; by the pleasure he takes in witnessing the sufferings of sentient creatures ; by his delight in warfare and all perilous sports ; by his thirst for vengeance ; by his profligacy and disregard of female honor ; by his slang language , his lax idea of property , pugnacity , and utter want of religion . " Such is the degraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering tribes of savages , and as furnishing the groundwork of what are called the " dangerous classes of society . " Such are the qualities descriptive of an order of human beings , - which , as they appeal to the Christian conscience , and are known as moral facts , constitute the appalling significance and practical moment of the volumes under review . Such as they have been now described , they are found especially in great cities , as London , Paris , and New York . There they *form the population of well-known quarters , whence they emerge to give ferocity and terror to such scenes as the Gordon riots of London , the September massacres and the June insurrection of Paris . The more failure , the more distress there is uncared for , the more violent the vicissitudes of trade , the greater the disaster and terror of revolution or the ravage and rage of war , the more human creatures are plunged into that condition where society denies them sustenance and shelter , and the way to a living is easiest through crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus gathered in the heart of every populous city , chiefly in those capitals of the Old World where the causes are most busily at work , the gates of escape most closely shut , and the contrasts of condition most hard and glaring . // But nowhere has civilization yet redeemed itself from this curse and stain . There is hardly a country village , it has been said , without its outcast family , - one at least , - branded with social reprobation and virtual exclusion from the rest . There is no commercial town without its distinct criminal class of population , to be watched by the police with a wary and unfriendly eye ; its recognized haunts of vice ; its boys and girls growing up under the worst influences of the street , with passions prematurely strong , trained in idleness and incipient crime , swiftly learning the skill of smaller villany , and preparing for the higher degrees of guilt , for which society finds no home or cure but the jail . The evil is one of very long standing . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the accident of want leading to desperation and crime . It is the existence of an outcast or criminal class , in which crime is the daily training and practice , and for which all the moral relations of society are reversed . As a class of enemies in the land , to be suppressed and put down at any cost , the English law recognized them nearly five centuries ago , - the result , most probably , of driving whole populations from their estates by conquest , of the desolations wrought during reign after reign by the policy of the conquerors , and of the dreadful civil feuds , turning loose upon society bodies of landless , lawless , and desperate men . An ordinance of 1557 , cited by Miss Carpenter , * clearly recognizes the distinction between the " perishing** and the " dangerous** classes , in the following terms : " The poor man is he whom sickness and age oppresseth , or by losses , or otherwise , is driven to the ground with necessity : which doth labor willingly to gain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength will serve . The beggar is the contrary ; one who never yieldeth himself to any good exercise , but continually travaileth in idleness , training such youth as cometh to his or their custody to the same wickedness of life . " " Whereas , " says a law of Queen Elizabeth ( 1572 ) , " all the parts of this realm of England and Wales be presently with rogues , vagabonds , and sturdy beggars exceedingly pestered , // by means whereof daily happeneth in the same realm horrible murders , thefts , and other great outrage , to the high displeasure of Almighty God , and to the great annoyance of the common weale , " it is enacted , " that all persons set forth to be rogues and vagabonds , or sturdy beggars , that is to say , all persons whole and mighty in body , able to labor , not having land or master , nor using any lawful merchandise crafts or mystery , and all common laborers , able in body , loitering and refusing to work for such reasonable wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence " be grievously whipped , and burnt through the gristle of the right ear with a hot iron of the compass of an inch about ; for the second , be deemed felons ; and for the third , suffer death as felons , without benefit of clergy . " * This is but a sample of the merciless legislation which all along for two or three centuries vainly endeavored to suppress the class of " sturdy vagabonds and valiant beggars , ** - that is , the class of outcasts and vagrants that now make their haunt mostly in populous cities , and are kept within strict and narrowing boundaries by terror of the polices Theyare treated summarily as enemies , - as wild beasts rather than men . The ferocity of the English law has been such ferocity as could be justly practised only on beasts of prey . Within this century , companies of fifteen or twenty criminals hung together have been no uncommon thing . Judges on a circuit have declared beforehand their intention of hanging the accused in every case where a verdict could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of the better classes , and the cruelty born of fear , practised upon that wretched race , whom law and circumstance had done their full share to drive upon a life of crime . " We are compelled , " said lately an English justice , " to carry into operation an ignorant and vengeful system , which augments to a fearful extent the very evil it was framed to cure . " * it is as a class thus branded by society , - whom Religion scarce entertains the hope or ambition of redeeming , whom * Report of Poor-Law Commission for 1834 , p. 12. t Speech of M. D. Hill , Esq. , at a Conference held in Birmingham , December 9 , 1851. // Law knows only as its enemy and its victim , - that it becomes the afflicting duty of the social moralist to *tudy their condition , and of the practical reformer to seek and save them . Mercy , and the hope of reformation for the criminal , is a thought that scarce entered into the heart of a generation before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded in another light . A more radical and humane mode of treatment proposes to meet the evil at its source . The criminality of great classes is felt to be a misfortune and a disease , as much so as deformity or pestilence . Let us cease to think of the full-grown criminal as he confronts us , perhaps at dead of night in the consummation of his crime , or with sullen brow and the traces of low passion written on his face , at the courthouse bar or the reluctant prison task ; - let us think what he has been , how he has lived , and how he has become what he is , and anger or hatred is changed into terror that a class of such as he should be growing up at our side , ready at any unguarded hour to make us their prey , - into pity that he , by the guilt of others or the negligence of the state , was plunged into the dreadful fatality of such a life . To measure the amount and quality of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first to understand the causes that create and continually increase the numbers of such a class . Here is one born to it , - the most pitiable and hopeless of all . Vagrancy and vice were his inheritance . The brand is stamped on his organization . His very features , the coarse apd heavy jaw , the retreating forehead , the restless eye , set him apart from civilized races towards the savage , - mark him , in the dominant qualities of his nature , as a brute rather than a man . His first breath was drawn in the atmosphere of sin . The first language he learned was that of profanity , lewdness , or violence ; the first acts he was bred to were childish imitations of the vices of a man . His training has been in the stealthy trade of pilfering ; the champions and superi " I know a shrewd gentleman who said he would walk a hundred miles to see a reformed thief . I think I could cure him of scepticism , and furnish him at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , before quoted . // ors he has been taught to admire were those most adroit in villany , ormost brutal in the ring. * In some of the Ragged Schools " the announcement of a robbery or murder rather calls forth their curiosity or sympathy than excites horror. ** In a school for girls , " no one of the class had ever seen the sun rise , and one did not know what the rising of the sun meant . " A street life of hazards and shifts has developed the precocious cunning of the thief ; a home life among the debauched and profligate has developed the precocious passions that devour the little manhood that might have been spared . Or , if caught and sent to jail , the boy spent the time of his sentence in learning from older and more hardened offenders ; and then was turned adrift , with the prison-brand upon him in addition to his birth-mark , to keep him from the confidence or company of the good ,  --  to thrust him back upon his criminal associates , who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tempt him more hopelessly than ever into a life of guilt . Saturated from his birth in vice and crime , what destiny could possibly be in store for him but a rank among the dangerous and desperate enemies of our laws and outcasts from our civilization ? Do we state the case too strongly ? In a five years ' calendar of London we have thirty-two " reputed thieves " of seven , and eighty-seven of eight years of age4 In a reform-school list , * we have a child of eight registered as having been fifteen times in the hands of the police , for skilful pilfering ; and one of nine , who had attempted to hang himself in jail . Those of twelve or fourteen are often regarded as inveterate and incurable offenders . Miss Carpenter mentions a little girl of ten or eleven , who kept a light ladder secreted , to enter cottage windows foc plunder ; a child of six or seven tried for housebreaking ; and one of eight who had " lived by crime from the time he was capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy the conclusion of a narrative , " which , I fear , " says the chaplain of Manchester jail , " may be taken as a sample of many * See Reformatory Schools , pp. 60 , 131 , 215 , 268 ; Juvenile Delinquents , pp. 24 , 145 , 187. t Reformatory Schools , p. 10. * London Inquirer. // others . " * The boy , aged twelve years , had been discharged with every disposition and prospect of amendment . " Two days after , I opened the door of a cell , and , to my surprise , found him again an inmate . My first exclamation of sorrow and surprise was , What , B. , you here again ! ' He hung down his head , as though unwilling to meet my eye , and , after a few moments of silence , he suddenly raised it , and , looking at me with an appealing and hopeless expression of anguish I can never forget , he said , with an almost passionate emphasis , Sir , what could I do ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the jail , he went directly to look for his mother , in the cellar where he had left her . She was not there , gone , the neighbors said , into the workhouse . Penniless and houseless , he wandered about all day and all night in the streets , and the next day , driven by hunger , he stole some bread , and was committed for the offence . He said he knew not what to do , and everything was better than his condition outside . Shortly after , an officer looked into his cell one Sunday afternoon , and found him lying on his bed , which he had unrolled contrary to orders , reading his Bible . The officer reproved him , and desired him to roll it up till the proper hour . To his surprise , the boy rose immediately , and , without a word or a look of anger and defiance , his usual answer on such occasions , quietly obeyed the order . The same officer , passing the cell not long after , looked in again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas-pipe , and dead ! " To illustrate another frequent source of criminal desperation , we refer , instead of a solitary example , to one of the most striking spectacles of the past year , the " labor battle " at Preston , whose issue was decided on the first of May last . For thirty-six weeks , Capital and Labor held their several positions as open foes , each pledged under heavy penalties not to yield . The masters were sustained by past profits and accumulated wealth , the men by the generous gifts of more fortunate laborers in other districts . Still and steady , without a word of violence , without an act that could put them within the grasp of law , they stood at bay , resolute , but suffering ; their daily wages gone , their subsistence the least that would keep them at their post , their families in increasing distress , their future growing more dark and hopeless day by day , - an // army of fifty thousand men , discharged from all useful or remunerative work , with not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands upon , with nothing to rest on in the future but the chance of better wages in a trade already overstocked , and depressed by the gathering storm-cloud of the Russian war . What hardiness of courage and obstinate honesty should keep them so long from depredating on the wealth of their masters , of which they sought a larger share , - from leaguing themselves as open opponents of the law , of which their masters endeavored to take advantage , to force them into a false position ? We do not undertake to decide whether , at the time of the strike , their wages either could or should have been increased . But we see the terrible spectacle of an army of the producers of wealth in open hostility to the holders of wealth ; and how slight an accident it might require to turn them into a formidable body of lawless , reckless , and desperate men , to prey as enemies upon the state that seemed thus to withhold their just claim ! This example shows on a large scale what takes place daily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their fault , into the hostile and dangerous ranks . To understand yet another source of accession to these ranks , we must know that vice in large towns is reduced to a system ; that it has its market and its scale of prices ; that its agents are always busy to furnish its living prey , always ready to seize on those who , by poverty , distress , desertion , or ignorance , are left exposed to the tricks of their dreadful trade . A young person well brought up , ( it may be , ) in the country , comes to the city for employment , or runs away and seeks a shelter there . The secret police of the " dangerous classes " are on the look-out for him ; and before he has found his first night 's lodging , they have marked him for their spoil . He is cheated in an auction-room , enticed to a gambling-house , tempted to drink or to stake his little purse , defrauded in a sham bet , won by easy steps downward , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shame , till he becomes as one of those infinitely worse and more degraded than anything in human shape his fancy had conceived . And this is a system , deliberately planned beforehand , and deliberately brought to bear on him step by step ; its result , in the average 36 // of cases calculated and foreknown ; its head-quarters in the low dram-shop , or the cheap lodging-house , rented , it may be , and often is , by some one respectable for wealth , social repute , and even religious standing , who can not but know that his quarter 's rent is the price of the " blood of souls . " Or , if the young person is a female , who knows not how a more devilish enginery lies in wait , sfretching its horrid arms along the seacoast and into country villages , - from New York even among the fair peasantry of Germany , whence the police not long ago rescued one-and-twenty from its deadly clutch , - from many a manufacturing town dragging its victims to their living death ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the public prints ; - what thoughts does it suggest of the suffocating and vague terror of that worst of the dangerous classes that make their trade of misery and shame , which must crush the heart of many a parent , who , through thronged streets and unfamiliar haunts , seeks tidings of a daughter lost ! And then that great tide of immigration , a thousand a day , and more , - as high , even , as twelve thousand in a single port. * How many must come destitute and friendless ; - destitute of all but the vague hope that brought them over ; friendless but for such as may meet them at the dock , to volunteer the charge of them ! How many come worn and broken with the voyage , sick with the close atmosphere of the steerage , and the long confinement amid the squalor of poor adventurers ! How many pass from the ship to the hospital and the grave ! How many are robbed at landing , and cheated of their all by the systematic villany that lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in exchange for their hard-earned and hoarded gold ! In hopeless poverty and despair , in ignorance of the spoken tongue and customs and peril of the place , more hopeless still , how many have gone down in broad day to the pitfall of death that was dug for them ! How many are floated thither , native and foreign , on the black and swelling flood of drunkenness ! Or , again , how * On one day of last May there arrived in the port of New York twelve thousand immigrants , and on each of the two following days four thousand more , making twenty thousand within three days . // many have been Criminals abroad , driven hither to find a safer harborage of crime , or have been made fierce and desperate , either by want or governmental persecution , till society seems all their enemy , and , with some wild theory of an outlaw 's justice , they avenge themselves by organizing fresh bands of freebooters and depredators , - a new and formidable addition to the dangerous classes already gathered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such causes as unjust laws , and the legal or political outlawry of whole races and tribes of men . Those we have mentioned are not legal or accidental , but social and permanent causes , which will follow out their dreadful tendency , till some radical cure is applied . Law , it is not doubted , does already much to keep them in check . Beneficent organizations are doing much to redress their mischief . Schemes of Christian instruction , followed here and there , already save hundreds , it may be thousands , from the dreadful fate to which they seemed born and bred . But , however checked and partially healed , the evil still exists , with its tendency to gather strength with the natural increase of population . It is great enough , if not to alarm us personally , at least to make us anxious in behalf of others . Society suffers from the existence of this outlaw race , in purse , in health , in morals , in hope of the future . In all these ways the classes spoken of are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of wealth . In England , it has been reckoned that every thief costs the community a thousand dollars and upwards for the average profits of his theft , about three hundred more for his conviction , besides the police force to keep him down , the jail system , the transportship , and the destruction of property by accidents of violence and revenge . " The more profligate the person , the greater burden is he to the community . " Miss Carpenter cites an instance in which a family circle of eight thieves " have muleted the public to the amount of ? 13,000 " within seven years , - their annual support thus costing , children and all , more than eleven hundred dollars each . " Every freeman in this country is at present taxed to support in idleness every pauper and every criminal . " A thief 's average earnings , by the above // estimate , are equal to those of at least eight of the best-paid honest laborers . In Liverpool , their depredations are reckoned at eight and a half million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious classes are the most costly of all , without return , - the most costly part of the political system , except the equipment and organization of war . They are dangerous to the public health . Mr. Carlyle quotes the story of a poor woman in Edinburgh , who , being refused shelter and left to perish in the streets , took the typhus-fever , and by the infection killed seventeen others in the neighborhood . So it is that a vicious and neglected class spreads secret poison through all our veins , - in some a scalding leprosy and rottenness of the bones , in all the terror of some cholera-scourge or some epidemic fever that breeds in the lurking-place of wretchedness and crime . Feeble and barbarous tribes , that to our sceptical judgments seem smitten with a mysterious decree of extermination , perish by no mystery at all , but by the poison of civilized vices , which their inferior temperament makes quickly fatal . But the same poison , of squalor , of licentiousness , of strong drink , preys upon our own population also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian civilization are more fully understood , and the efforts of our humanity more wisely and vigorously applied . We have portrayed , with constant reference to the aim and purport of the volumes before us , some of the features of that great social peril , of which they would aid both in the illustration and the cure . Unless in very rare and exceptional cases , the evil can not be met full-grown with any prospect of eradicating it . " Train up a child in the way he should not go , and when he is old he will not depart from it . " The practical question - one which every moment 's consideration presses more closely on the conscience - is , Can not something be done to rescue the " children of the perishing and dangerous classes " ? There is no need that the unfitness , the utter and horrible mischief , of the jail , as a place of cure for juvenile offences , should be again exposed . Setting this aside , with an unanswerable exhibition of its results , these volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young offenders is possible , in a large proportion of cases ; // next , that it Can be had not by penal , but by moral and religious agencies alone ; next , that the true and most hopeful methods are precisely the cheapest , while the present method of habitual neglect , with occasional violent interference , is as costly as it is shown to be ineffectual ; and finally , that the state must interfere by law , to take the exposed child out of evil hands , to give authority of detention to those who seek his recovery , and to establish permanently , and on a large enough scale , the agencies required for that end . The practical importance of these positions , and the revolution they would work in existing practices if fully carried out , will be seen at a glance . They are regarded here as propositions to be sustained with great xv eight of evidence , - to be forced upon the thoughtful understanding , rather than barely commended to the popular mind and conscience . Voluntary endeavors have done what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and needful funds to carry through an experiment which is proved beforehand to be successful . The examples of the police arrangements in Aberdeen , wholly suppressing the juvenile vagrancy of that district ; of the juvenile prison at Parkhurst ( Isle of Wight ) , with its discipline of terror and its costly failure to meet the end in view ; the religious labors of the Brotherhood of St. Vincent de Paul , first organized at Mettrai , in France , and extended afterwards into more than forty similar establishments , showing the wonderful practical skill of the Romish Church in organizing religious effort for a definite end and creating the religious societies needful thereto ; the reform-colonies of Evangelical Protestantism at Dusselthal and the Rauhe Haus near Hamburg , rivalling the above named in their practical wisdom and marvellous success ; the State Reform Schools of New York and Massachusetts , - all are described with sufficient detail , making chapters of most interesting incident , and of singular value , in the history of moral enterprise . None of this testimony do we consider to be without worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this direction , efforts which no one will regard as aught but the beginning of a vastly more extensive work required to be done . We think that the readers of these volumes will be struck , // not merely with the religious motive and feeling that prompted and guided their composition , but also with the fact , that the only successful steps taken in this enterprise have hitherto been the inspiration of a very positive religious faith . " First and above all , " says our author , * " there must be in the minds of those who plan , and those who carry out the work , a strong faith in the immortality of the human soul ; the universal and parental government of God , and the equal value in his sight of each one of these poor perishing young creatures with the most exalted of our race . " No motive or conviction less powerful could prompt to the labors here recorded , or could undertake them with hope of the same result . The School at Mettrai , and the Rauhe Haus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful examples respectively of Catholic and Protestant reform.  --  In each case , the founder engaged in his task with a fervor of religious devotion to it , which would have been pronounced fanaticism or mysticism if it had taken a less practical direction . We mention this fact , so striking if not in nature at least in degree , because it is one of which the practical consequences become more important day by day , as experiments are more widely made . The state , as Miss Carpenter has shown , has the power of availing itself of an almost unlimited amount of earnestness , strong conviction , and working ability already existing ; and if its efforts are wisely directed , it may be competent ( as no other agency can possibly be ) to grapple with the subject in its length and breadth , and cure the malady at the root .
