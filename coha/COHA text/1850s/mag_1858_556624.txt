Boston : Published for the Society , by Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1858. 8vo. pp. 514. 2 . The American Revolution . By GEORGE BANCROFT . Vol . I. Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1858. 8vo. pp. 435 . THE subject-matter of both these volumes , taking into view the great theme to which the whole of one of them and by far the larger part of the other are devoted , makes it convenient to treat of them together . They are both filled , substantially , with a varied rehearsal of the incidents and measures which transpired in the councils of patriotism and of despotism during the year preceding the opening of the great American war of independence . They are , therefore , confributions to that steadily increasing library of American history , on which , as a foundation , the training of our future statesmen and the culture of our general scholars are to be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of a faithful biography of one of our patriots , or of a more accurate rehearsal of the events of the times already receding into a dim distance . Few persons are aware how voluminous that department in our libraries is . We doubt , indeed , whether all the works which belong to it are actually von . Lxxxvii. - NO. 181. 39 // to be found even in any two or three of the largest libraries in our country . It will be observed that one of the volumes whose title we have copied is issued under the auspices of the Massachusetts Historical Society . This Society , which has now nearly reached the seventieth year of its existence , was the pioneer of all the similar institutions formed in this country , quite numerously in recent years , for the collection , preservation , and publication of materials for the illustration of our local and general annals . Dr. Belkuap , the prime mover in this grateful cause , would rejoice greatly if he could return to see with what zeal , and by how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts Society has steadily followed up the work to which its honored founder devoted it . If it has not issued as many volumes as outside observers might have expected from the number of its years , it has as faithfully , and , perhaps in the ultimate issue it will appear , more effectively , served its design in gathering materials , rescuing valuable records from decay , consolidating its means , and training a select body of men for zeal , accuracy , and painstaking fidelity in the tasks of annotation and illustration . Its late President , Hon. James Savage , still giving the ripeness and vigor of what in his case we can hardly call old age to a work which he must have begun in his cradle , is preparing to leave behind him a monument of his marvellous industry and research in the Genealogy of the First Settlers of New England . His recollection of facts and dates , of incidents and details illustrative of times and characters , furnishes an almost unprecedented instance of the capacity of memory in receiving , keeping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His brain seems to be as faithful in the custody of things antiquated and obsolete , in all their minute relations , as is the antediluvian rock in preserving the most delicate tracery of the fern-leaf . The term of Mr. Savage 's presidency covered those years of the Society in which it had parted with the fresh zeal of its first impulse , and had not as yet partaken of the fostering generosity vhich it has recently begun to enjoy . To him belongs the great credit of a quiet and patient constancy , // private and official , in administering the interests of the Society while it was assimilating the food for its maturity . Hon. Josiah Quincy , the senior member of the Society , and the associate of its founders , has just given to it the oxvnership , and to the community the perusal , of his " Memoir of John Quincy Adams . " Hon. Robert C. Winthrop , who now presides over the Society , brings to it , together with the treasured respect for a venerated and beloved ancestral name , tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . His own peculiar claims and interests in connection with the Society have in part created and in part called out a new and lively zeal for its objects , manifested by the generous bequests of the Appleton Fund for publication , and of the splendid library of Thomas Dowse , Esq. , by the bestowal of many lesser but still valuable gifts , and by the increased interest in its business and social meetings . The thirty-four volumes of the Society 's publications are , of course , occupied for the most part with matters relating to Massachusetts or New England history and biography ; though the exceptions are numerous and important , in documents of great value interesting to the whole country , and even to the world . The editing of many of the papers contained in them has been a service requiring much dry labor , as , without accuracy , such documents are almost worthless . The task of editorial supervision for each volume is intrusted to a committee of four , of which , as is usual in such cases , the exacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is , after this fashion , to be credited to the zeal and pains of Hon. Richard Frothingham . Of the call for labor , of the fidelity with which it was given by him , and of its good fruits , our readers will be able to judge when we speak more particularly of its contents . We may barely mention such of these contents as do not relate to the theme with which we must soon engage ourselves . They are , a reprint of Scottow 's Narrative ( 1694 ) of the Planting of the Massachusetts Colony ; a paper on the Extinction of Slavery in Massachusetts ; a Notice of the Sicur d'Aulnay , of Acadie ; the Petition of Roger Williams to the General Court of Massachusetts ; // the Declaration , Petition , and Relation of Phinehas Pratt ( 1668 , curious documents ) ; and brief Memoirs of Nathaniel Morton Davis , Abbott Lawrence , and William Parsons Lunt . More than half of the volume exhibits in print for the first time the Correspondence in 1774 and 1775 between a Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relief of Sufferers by the Boston Port Bill . With a more or less direct bearing upon matters incidentally connected with the same paramount theme , there are Letters of Thomas Cushing , Speaker of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts ; Queries of George Chalmers , the historian , and Answers of General Gage , in relation to Braddock 's Expedition , the Stamp Act , and Gage 's Administration of Massachusetts ; Letters of Samuel Adams ; a remarkable Letter from Joseph Hawley ; and Letters , containing a variety of interesting particulars , from Rev. Dr. Andrew Eliot of Boston to Thomas Hollis , Esq . of England . It will be seen , therefore , that the especial theme of this new volume of Collections is the engagement of the sympathies of the whole continent , first in relieving the sufferings , and then in sharing the rebellious spirit , of the inhabitants of the town of Boston , under the oppressive action of the Port Bill . As the matter of the volume becomes at this point identical with one of the central themes expanded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose title we have given , we must now turn to his work , and devote to it a few brief and general remarks , before uniting the two threads of the great narrative before us . In the sixth volume of his continuous History of the United States , Mr. Bancroft finished his exposition of the causes which conduced towards the American Revolution . He now undertakes , in what may be regarded as a separate work , to make that crisis in our annals the subject of his most mature and his crowning labors . He designates two epochs in the subject ; the first extending from the enforcement of the Port Bill to the Declaration of Independence ; the second proceeding on to the acknowledgment of that act by Great Britain . The volume before us is occupied with the former epoch . We must pay to the volume as a whole the tribute of unstinted // and exalted praise . Gratitude requires this ; for labor of the most exacting kind , research conducted with exemplary keenness and patience , and a noble ardor , awakened alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have left their unmistakable stamp upon every page . Mr. Bancroft has enjoyed rare opportunities in the use of original documents from every quarter , ministerial and diplomatic , official and private . That some little fancies , theories , and partialities of his own should betray themselves in his relative estimate of the value of one or another class of his materials , and in his mode of using them , is not strange . In this he is human , - human , too , after his own individuality . The elaboration of some of his periods is occasionally too intense and artificial . In a few instances it would seem as if the inspiration of the thought with which he started had been reduced into mere ingenuity while he was seeking the most striking way of expressing it . He tessellates his narrative , in lines , half-lines , sentences , phrases , and words , with quotations from the copious and multiform papers which he has digested . His pages are thus a mosaic of his authorities . Of course his narrative wins in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its authenticity . But this mode of composing history is also apt to run into a bizarre style , to become unnatural , stilted , and exaggerated , and likewise to impair the perfect truthfulness of the narrative as a rehearsal of what once was fact . A writer may be tempted to seize upon the unqualified , the emphatic , or the passionate and unrestrained expression , sentence , or phrase in a speech or letter , and to work it into his own sober narrative , when perhaps the original speaker or writer may afterwards spend a whole paragraph in qualifying his recent excess in utterance . As to this feature of style , we have a grave objection to urge against some portions of this volume , especially its more characteristic and patriotic narrations of the debates and battles of the opening storm . It pleases our English critics to charge upon American writers in the mass - particularly upon our historians , orators , essayists and lecturers , and the after-dinner speakers at our frequent celebrations and commemorations - what has come 39* // to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound of exaggeration , effrontery , bombast , and extravagance , mixed metaphors , platitudes , defiant threats thrown at the world , and irreverent appeals flung at the Supreme Being . Now it is a simple slander upon us to generalize this charge , and to visit it upon American writers and speakers as such . There has been , as we all know , too much of this inflated and braggadocio utterance among us . The earliest appearance of the mannerism and the license which have developed - we might better say , degenerated into - this bombast , as we shall have occasion to note by and by , is to be traced to the ardent expressions of a young patriotism . " The Ereles vein " broke out first in some of our town-meetings , early caucuses , commemorations of the Boston llliassacre , and on other similar occasions . It has run to riot in Fourth of July orations , stump speeches , and a few Congressional harangues of the " manifest destiny " pitch . Yet in these modern excesses and affronts to good taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the speaker yields himself to this strain in sheer ignorance , or when with a covert and ridiculous sense of his own skill in thus pandering to the folly of others . This habit of speaking , however , is now visiting the force of its own ridicule upon itself , and that will banish it sooner than will any protest of those aggrieved by it on either side of the water . But we must withstand the reproach of English critics , that the style of which we speak is not only American , but also characteristic of American writers . In general , our writers , especially such of them as may be taken as representatives of the literary class , now use as classical a style , and one every whit as closely conformed to the standard of a pure taste , as do our contemporaries beyond the sea . " The spread-eagle style " is chargeable only upon a certain class of writers , on a certain class of occasions , treating a certain class of subjects . Unhappily , the class in each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to fix a national characteristic in this respect . We would by no means imply that a gentleman of the splendid scholarly culture of Mr. Bancroft should be ranked among the prime offenders in this matter . But there are sentences and para . // graphs in his volume , in which he has evidently caught from some of his old documentary authorities the spirit of exaggeration , occasionally turgid and sometimes almost ludicrously intense in its expression . We regret this the more , because his work will be justly regarded in England as a national work , the exponent of the American mind and genius in the rehearsal of American history . We know that some of his readers abroad , and those not the most phlegmatic or contemptuous , will smile at some of his rhapsodies and intensities in describing the councils of our patriots and the battles of our yeomen . His calmer and more prosaic relations , and his summaries , are , in our view , faultless , while his scenic descriptions and his pictures from the wild woods and wilder water-courses sparkle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen in this volume to exclude all notes and all references to his authorities . He assigns as his ground for this omission , " the variety and multitude of the papers which have been used , and which could not be intelligibly cited without burdening the pages with a disproportionate commentary . " His readers will recognize the force of this plea when they note , as we have already observed , that his pages are so largely interspersed with excerpts from original documents . Of course his context will , to a great extent , indicate his authorities , but it will not always satisfy his readers as to the pertinency of the citations , or the judgments or inferences drawn from them . On many points of coniparatively frivial importance , Mr. Bancroft rectifies errors in several of our popular compends , and he differs in statement from the generally accepted opinions concerning matters of more or less interest . We are willing in such cases to yield entire confidence to the fairness of his conclusions drawn from the best authorities well used . But there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , or from the interest which feeling of a domestic , party , or sectional nature has thrown into them , on which he pronounces a judicial decision in reversal of generally established judgments . He must expect to be challenged on this score , and he would have facilitated the treatment of such issues as may arise between him and others , if he had given // with precision and fulness the grounds on which his verdicts are based . Perhaps he would in some cases have averted controversy , and have shown to his questioners sufficient guaranties for his judgments when in opposition to theirs . But having concluded to omit all references and authentications , he follows his own rule in the most serious as in the most trifling matters . His decisions are pronounced most oracularly and most positively where they are most divergent from settled opinions . True , he excites our curiosity , and wins the suspense of our minds , by promising at no distant day to cull out from his rich heaps of manuscripts such original letters as , besides possessing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is all that we can ask of him ; and we can but strengthen the expression of our hope that he may very soon redeem his promise , by hinting to him that he is now virtually in debt to his readers in a way which demands quick payment . He will be especially held to substantiate the judgment which lifts Samuel Adams to such a conspicuous pre-eminence among his compatriots . Nor will it be enough to adduce the fact that there are so many papers in his handwriting . The preparation of one class of patriotic papers was assigned to John Adams . These were of an exact , legal , advisory , argumentative , and positive character , and were the product of his own mind . The preparation of another class of papers was assigned to Samuel Adams . These were of the exciting , demonstrative , ardent , and objurgatory sort , and in the construction of them he was the compiler , and , so to speak , the editorial secretary , of the utterances and opinions of many various minds . Two judgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found expressed in the writings of John Adams about the genius , influence , and wisdom of his kinsman . One who undertakes to adjudicate here will have a delicate matter for his treatment . But in the mean while Mr. Bancroft must open his stores . Whether his English readers will admit that he has rigidly adhered to his own resolve so to write as not " to revive national animosities , " is not yet decided to our knowledge . The only sharp response that has reached us is in protest against his sharp judgment of Dr. Samuel Johnson . // The plan by which Mr. Bancroft has arranged and divided his narrative in this volume is admirably adapted to the interest and instruction of his readers . He preserves faithfully the proportions of his theme . Of tediousness he is incapable . His glance is wide and free over all the elements which enter into the substance and tenor of his story . His chapters are brief , and are only discursive enough to comprehend the details which bear directly upon the division of his subject on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the period from May , 1774 , to June 17 , 1775 , which is covered by his narrative ; and by that calendar he presents to us almost the daily transactions and combinations of events , and the appearances , opinions , and deeds , in either hemisphere , which are wronght into the work of the loom that elaborated the finished pattern he is studying . He has to perform the office confidently hoped for from the oceanic telegraph-cable , of conveying daily bulletins from continent to continent , transmitting the pulsations and throbbings of a raging fever from member to member of the body politic . The English journals are trintalizing us with the warning that the British side of the story of our Revolution can not yet be written , because there are masses of state papers , official documents , and private letters , whose secrets , still jealously guarded , have in their keeping a great many surprises , with facts of a marvellous and wholly unimagined character , which will completely reverse in some cases , and rectify in others , the accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are quite sceptical as to the existence of the means of such startling revelations . The only point of any emphatic consequence on which the disclosures from archives or private cabinets have changed the judgment or the narrative of our sober annalists , beginning as far back as the very first year of the strife , is in reference to the personal views and agency of Lord North . It suited the exigencies of our patriot declaimers - nor , making liberal allowance for rhetoric , did they much affront the literal truth in so doing - to represent the tyrannical course pursued towards us as dictated by the ministry , in distinction from the // agency of Parliament and the personality of the monarch . So Lord North bore the brunt of the angry declamation as the supposed leader and the prime mover in all the tyranny of Great Britain . The letters of the king to his prime minister came into the hands of Sir James Mackintosh , who transcribed the matter of chief importance in them into a volume which afterwards was in possession of Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brougham received them some twenty-five years ago from her , and , having availed himself of them in his Historical Sketches of Statesmen , was the first to make public the fact that Lord North was not utterly unflinching , obstinate , and persistent in recommending oppressive measures , nor in any sense the instigator of his sovereign in that course . But , after all , the disclosure is by no means so important , nor does it really soften and abate an established judgment of that minister to so great an extent , as is commonly supposed . We can not find that Lord North relented , till he had done mischief which he could not repair ; or that he sought by resignation to relieve himself of the responsibility of advising , or rather of co-operating with , the king , until the quarrel had reached such a stage that it was impossible to arrest it , or to change its issue . He was bound in honor not to desert the king , and his distrust of the wisdom of their measures was but a late repentance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord North the full benefit of all the new disclosures in the case , but is inclined to judge him as severely , for yielding to the wishes of his sovereign in retaining his place and pursuing a course which he did not approve , as the Boston patriots judged him when they regarded him as the prime offender . Lord Mahon , who after Lord Brougham seems next to have been favored with the use of these letters , is somewhat milder in his general view of Lord North 's course . Mr. Bancroft has enjoyed the same privilege , and we must regard his verdict as on the whole the most just . Indeed , Professor Smyth of Cambridge , who in his Lectures , published in 1811 , that is , before the disclosures concerning Lord North had come to light , while pronouncing upon him with unqualified severity , anticipated the plea that has since // been advanced for him , yet wrote : " For Lord North there can be no excuse . He must have been guilty of acquiescing in measures , the general folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his view . When Lord Brougham wrote his " Sketches , " and some others of his numerous published pieces , he had access in his various official capacities to repositories which are now guarded with considerable jealousy . He had personal assurance from a high quarter , when asking certain privileges of research in England , that some disagreeable disclosures made by him in print had led the guardians of a class of interesting papers to a very rigid prohibition of the transcription , and , in some cases , of the consultation of them . Doubtless there are such papers , great numbers of them too , which would yield much curious and important matter . It may be that some of them relate to the zeal which England then indulged in favor of the slave-trade , or to her efforts to engage the slaves and the Indians on her side against us . It may be that they contain humiliating or damaging information about ministerial intrigues , or about the governors and military officers sent here , most of whom showed such a manifest incompetency for their triist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accusers . It may be that the careful use of such papers would very much enlighten us on some points not now clear or intelligible . But that they will introduce any new element into , or essentially modify , the relation of the history of the American Revolution , or reverse a single judgment now valid as regards men or measures , is a vain fancy . Mr. Bancroft has certainly had as much material as any writer could use to advantage . He does not need in any case to have recourse to his imagination , or to rely upon mere probabilities for any of his statements , where he meets a hiatus in some authority , or a discrepancy between partisans . He has his own biases , no doubt . The large vein of his idiosyncrasy runs through his whole series of historical volumes , and there is a special manifestation of it under a specific form in the various themes which he has treated , // now in a philosophical disquisition , now in a beautiful piece of word-painting , and now in a brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had anything more to digest , we fear that the process of assimilation would have been less perfectly performed . Some persons , however , are impatient of that painstaking zeal , scrutiny , and exhaustiveness of research , which are now considered so desirable in the method of the historian and in the composition of his work . They ask , What is the use of rewriting over and over again the same old story ? Has it not been already told with sufficient fulness and accuracy ? Why this everlasting ransacking of public and private repositories ,  --  this high value set upon each successive pile of papers that comes to light , - this haste to make a new history for the sake of bringing in one new agent , or one new version of an event , which will at best be like the designation of some single ripple on a flowing tide ? We do not sympathize with this impatience , which often expresses itself as disgust . Even if the rewriting of any interesting series of events as history , were nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a remunerative labor , and would deserve gratitude . But the aim of the historian is higher , and , if he is qualified for his work , all new materials will help to enrich and to authenticate his narrative . Especially in the treatment of that great theme with which we are dealing , the American Revolution , we value the introduction from time to time into its narratives of all the side-lights gathered from the diaries , letters , and memoirs of prominent persons , from the municipal registers and the legislative journals which are now happily treated with such respectful regard , and from the traditions which have been for the most part confined to a narrow circle . More and more , as years pass on , does the American Revolution present itself to its students as a theme unsurpassed in interest , whether of a solemn or of a merely curious character , by any other event that has transpired in the secular concerns of this earth . We are learning to see in it , as many of its noblest and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , an august disclosure of a newly-revealed stage in the great methods of // Providence . The work was mightier than the men that performed it . A microscopic study of it , as of the objects of natural science , gives us a grander conception of the whole in a finer apprehension of its parts . And there is one circumstance to be taken into the account , which , we believe , will warrant some very important inferences . There is a propitious time , an interval peculiarly favorable , for the composition of a satisfactory and trustworthy history of any great event in the world 's annals ; and we should date that time at about from eighty to a hundred years after the event transpired . We have not space here to give our reasons for accepting this theory , nor to draw our inferences from it . If our position be true , both the grounds of it and the inferences from it will be obvious to any one who thinks about it . In that period of time passions have cooled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for composing a history are abundant , many of the incidental circumstances necessary for its illusfration are still in remembrance , traditions can be tested , and private and public documents may be used to the best advantage for explaining and supplementing one another . It is to be added , too , that the interest of a large class of readers is most intensely engaged upon great subjects which loom in the retrospect of nearly a century . The measurement of time is as important to a fair and engaging historical study , as the adjustment of the length of the telescopic tubes is to a favorable focus for observing distant objects . In view of all our present accurate knowledge of the method and the immediate consequences of our Revolutionary war , - especially of the processes needful for engaging the thirteen Colonies as in a common cause , and the perilous forebodings of dissension attendant upon the subsequent formation of a confederate government , - a fair and inviting subject of speculation presses itself upon the notice of our philosophical historians . It offers itself in this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , on the instant of the opening of strife between them and the mother country , England , with a wise forecast of what the issue of the strife must necessarily be , had at once abandoned the // Colonies and bid them take care of themselves ? Suppose that , when tidings of the indignation with which the Stamp Act , and the claim to the right of imposing internal taxes upon which that act was based , had been received in the Colonies , were carried back to England , a shrewd adviser of the sovereign had proposed to " leave off contention before it be meddled with , " and after instituting measures to secure all proprietary rights , and the adjustment of the outstanding obligations of prerogative and contract , Great Britain had withdrawn all royal , ministerial , and parliamentary oversight , protection , and interference , and left the Colonies and Provinces to their own headiness or wisdom in the trial of self-government . This would have been but the adoption of what was more than intimated even in the House of Commons by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise policy of England , and in conformity to the law of reason and the constitution of things . More than one advocate for a mild and forbearing course with the Colonies indulged himself in the alluring rhetoric of comparing the Colonies in their relation to the mother country to a sinewy and somewhat selfwilled youth , who had grown to man 's estate , who was fretting under parental restraint , and who had a legal claim to a discharge from pupilage and subjection . A question about property , as between parent and child , did indeed obtrude itself into the debate . But it was not exactly as if the restive youth demanded a partition of the parental estate . He claimed to be already in possession of all that he wished to have secured to him ; and , what is more , he claimed to have earned it all without any help during his minority , or any borrowed capital at the outset . So the rhetoric of the argument was rich , and the argument itself was a strong one . The Colonists , self-exiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard labor , which was still the condition of all thrift in the enjoyment of it . Even when under age , and really weak in their isolation and immaturity , they had felt the sense of virtual independence , and only by the spur of that proud consciousness would they have been sustained under the severe exactions and hardships of their dreary enterprise . They had never held their claim on English protection // or patronage as of any real worth to them , beyond the simple assurance that their rights as patentees were identified with the rights of England to dominion here , as founded on discovery and occupation . As against Papal , Spanish , French , or Dutch pretensions , they were willing to refer back to the crown of England as their guaranty in the possession of the soil and in their rights of trade . But they had settled the matter of local ownership , of land tenure and dominion , with the Indians and among themselves . Here they had grown strong , bold , and rich . They had invented town-meetings , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Englishmen , caused more of gaping amazement than has been excited among the gazers at the Museum upon the winged bull of Nineveh . They had planted the foundations of an empire in regions of such colossal magnitude , that it was even absurd to think that they could much longer be content to look across the ocean for the headship of their sovereignty . They were surveying lakes of fresh water fringing their domain , into which all Great Britain might be plunged and still appear as an island . They had , in fact , proved their power of self-government , and were in the virtual exercise of it ; and their first acrimonious bickerings with England were carried on fully as much in the language and after the method of embittered diplomatic correspondence , as in the spirit of remonstrance or supplication . When we say , however , that the Colonists had proved their skill in self-government , we of course limit the assertion within the bounds of their separate jurisdictions , to the exclusion of all reference to a confederation among themselves . Probably there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were most of the Colonies in America at the era of the Revolution ; and those functions and details of government in which the mass of the people had the most direct agency , were managed the most efficiently and faithfully . England , too , might have considered that even her visionary pretensions about an oversight and fostering guardianship exercised towards us in our pupilage were in the way of being amply satisfied , if , as the elder Pitt affirmed in Parliament , the profits of our trade were worth to her two millions sterling annually . // These representations , substantially , were made to men in power , and to the people of England , in season to have allowed the mother country , before any embittering feuds had gone too far for reconciliation , to adopt towards us the policy that has been suggested , namely , to cut us loose from all dependence and allegiance , and to compel us to shift for ourselves . Some of the wisest of her statesmen , as well as some of her more florid rhetoricians , recommended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary burden to England , attended with great delays and inconveniences , perplexing her counsels at home , and subjecting her to complicated rivalries and embarrassments in disposing matters of trade and commerce with other powers . All these perplexities would increase with the progressive development of the Colonies . The time must come when the child would outgrow the parent , in strength and riches at least , if not in wisdom . The relation between the Colonies and England was unnatural , and the only way in which it could be made natural would be , to set them adrift with a parting blessing , and the warning counsel , expressed in plain terms : " Now take care of yourselves . Keep . out of mischief . Do n't disgrace your parentage , and stand ready to fight for us when we have to fight for ourselves . " Suppose it had been so . Suppose that the vexation felt at home by the ill-reception of the Stamp Act here had thrown a spice of temper , and perhaps a hint of our ingratitude , into a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What would have been the consequences to us ? Deplorable and disastrous , beyond all description , we might almost say , beyond all imagination . Without drawing to any great extent upon our fancy , using only the sober facts which lie revealed and now well understood upon our records , we would undertake to show , that the abandonment of the Colonies by Great Britain before they were ripe for union in a confederation among themselves , would have involved a train of evils , more grievous in character , more complicated , extensive , and enduring , than those which attended upon the War of Independence . One has but to read with care the anxious story of the process by which the Colonies came out of the // strife in a condition which disposed and enabled them to enter into a union , to be satisfied that this process could not have been anticipated or effected by any other instrumentality than that through which it triumphed . Two very distinct and independent conditions were needed to insure safety in the dissolution of our old ties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , it was requisite that England should pursue such a course towards the Colonies as would be sure wholly to alienate their affections from her . This could be brought about only by a protracted series of irritating measures . There was a slight feeling of pride attending the thought that the Colonies were connected with the only free and the most advanced empire in the world . England was still called home by many whose descent removed them five generations from the original exiles . This pride would have been touched , and perhaps have changed itself into a sort of wounded affection , which proverbially clings with regret to an alienated object , if England , prematurely and without any actual wrong , had cast off her hold upon us . It was for her to pursue a course , beginning perhaps in a pardonable mistake , but leading on through obstinacy and arrogance to actual tyranny , persisted in after it was known and felt to be iniquitous , and defiantly vindicated at last as vengeance , when all show of right had disappeared . Only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonies be made to know how annoying and oppressive the continuance of English rule over them must necessarily be . That such a course on her part , while alienating our affection from her , would also win for us sympathy from other nations , was a direct consequence from the natural working of things . A less direct consequence to be looked for as incidental to such a course would be , that some old rival of England . as a nation would be prompt to seek , or easy to be won into , an alliance with us . We have hinted at an alternative between seeking and accepting an alliance , because we regard it as one of the still unveiled secrets of the era before us , whether France or the American Congress was really the prime mover in the league of amity and co-operation between them . But this was an essential element of the 40 // condition which we are defining , that , contemporaneously with the rupture of our old allegiance , there should be an embryo development of the tendrils which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ten years which witnessed the working out of all the elements of this condition in the series of aggravating measures adopted by the English ministry , were just about a sufficient space of time to allow their most effective working towards the great result . The other condition needed to avert the dreadful risks attendant upon a rupture with the old government , and to assure the almost chimerical project of a stable union among the Colonies in the perils of resistance and in the establishment of a confederation , was , that time and occasion should be granted to us for overcoming all the obstacles , and for availing ourselves of all the facilities , in the way of the desired end . Our union was the birth of time and occasion measured out and furnished by England . It could have sprung from no other combination of circumstances than that in which it originated . It was necessary that the Colonies should be brought into an acquaintance *xith one another in a way which would knit them in strong sympathy and love , before it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a single feature in the whole history of our Revolutionary war which has for us such a subduing influence of an almost melting tenderness , and which so reveals the Providence that guided it , as the fact , that holy charity was the prompter to the long train of agencies which wrought out our union . The correspondence opened in Boston with the whole continent , and the gifts which were sent hither to relieve the poor in their distress from the Port Bill , were the real initiatory means of our confederation . The dove of a fraternal pity which bore over the continent in its laden beak the staff of bread for the famishing , dropped everywhere from , beneath her wings epistles which summoned both givers and receivers to become known to one another first as brethren , that they might next become joint sovereigns of a glorious domain . The method of policy pursued by Great Britain suggested to the Colonies the policy for them to pursue , and , more than all , helped them to carry it out in every respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the two conditions which we have defined as essential were brought together ; and the two books now before us , each in its own way , but both of them in a most delightful and impressive way , tell us how those conditions worked . The English policy opened and shaped itself very gradually , step by step , giving us the lead just fast enough to be available to us . That policy was so besotted and moon-struck as to help our local agitators to nationalize their cause . The mixing of the tea in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean was a symbolic act , and affected the character of the water in every bay and river on the seacoast of our continent . That English policy wrought out our union . It protracted a necessary delay till we could feel or grope our course on to a safe issue . It added just enough of fuel to the flame to keep it steadily burning . It was continually devising some additional grievance , or threatening some act of vengeance , which extended the fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in one after another of the Colonies , less as actual parties in the first quarrel , than as spectators whose blood rose so as to tempt them to enter the ring . England worked so slowly , feebly , and hesitatingly in her first measures of intimidation , as to take from the more resolute measures which came later all the wholesome character of dread , and to tempt the Colonies to withstand the latter simply because they had withstood the former . The little homcnopathic dose of the military first sent to Boston was barely sufficient to cause a nausea . The sight of that ineffective force facilitated the necessary process of change , from speaking with dignified consideration of " his Majesty 's troops , " to the more daring familiarity of " red-coats , " which , when it run down among the boys , cast itself into the appellative of " lobsters . " England worked after this fashion in alienating her Colonies , and in making it safe for them to be alienated . The process was a most wonderful one . The Colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there was very little sympathy between them about anything , and England created for them their first sympathy out of an antipathy . Some of the Colonies had no real grievance . No one of the measures // adopted by England previously to our Declaration of Independence would have been really oppressive to the majority of them . The tea tax , which England insisted upon retaining for the sake of adhering to a principle , would not have cost any one among the Americans , in his lifetime , so much as some of them contributed for the relief of the suffering and the unemployed in Bo*ton alone . Many of the Colonies , instead of inheriting , as did Massachusetts , a traditional fretfulness towards England , the result of old provocations , were warmly loyal to the realm , and were actually interested for the time being in retaining their allegiance to it . In one point of view there is something ludicrous in the scenes described with such a graphic power by Mr. Bancroft , in which wild backwoodsmen in their hunting-shirts , sleeping under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having the range of a continent before them , passed resolutions to secure their liberty ! There was as little real cause for fear that they would lose it , as that they would suffer from thirst while encamping upon the bank of a Western river , or crossing a Northern lake . Certainly it would seem as if only the most felicitous management and the most adroit skill could have contrived to draw these Colonies into a league for fighting , and then into a national union . English policy wrought out that marvel . We are free to say that an intelligent apprehension of all the facts which might here be exposed , and a candid allowance for them , ought to affect the tone towards England in which our histories are written . That tone should be softened ; if not justice , gratitude requires it . As a nation , we are under obligations towards Great Britain for enabling us to become a nation , and for pursuing such a course towards us as turned our alienation from her into sympathy with one another . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of study on this subject , or a biassed result from it , Las affected our judgment ; but we must affirm that the intensely bitter tone in which some of our modern patriots and orators still rehearse the aggravating course of Great Britain in the war , is disagreeable to us . Not only is it needlessly irritating and inflammatory , but it is virtually unjust . Even if England , like Joseph 's // brethren , really intended for evil all that she did against us , - which is not true , - the thought how wonderfully God turned it all to good in our case , as in Joseph 's , should chasten the passion with which the old grievance is related . Indeed , we owe to England something like a debt , and a tinge of gratitude ought to cast itself over the narrative . Fearful would have been the consequences , had England abandoned us before oppressing us , or hurried on the open fight before we had formed a rank and file , or made us loathe foreign dominion before we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . The rhetoric sounded beautifully when England was told that we ought to be free because we were grown men ; but stern facts presented an alarming commentary . It was evident that there was hostility to be engendered and fighting to be done , either with one another or with a common foe . The natural relations between a grown-up son and a parent are often not so difficult to settle as are those of brothers who are joint heirs to unequal portions of an inheritance . There is no question but that the most irritated and bitter among the English advocates of continued severity against the Colonies , up to the acknowledgment of our Independence , expected us even then to fall into open and implacable quarrels among ourselves , and to present to the world a wretched spectacle of jarring , irreconcilable fragments of a people , laden with hopeless debts , rent with jealousies , and trained in fighting only that they might devour one another . Some quite amiable Englishmen predicted these results as the punishment of our ingratitude to the dear mother country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a king . Why , a king was even picked out for us from the royal stock of Europe . He was to come over by invitation , and set up his throne . We have done without him so far . The course which England pursued towards us was just adapted to enable us to dispense with a king , and to educate us all for sovereigns . How England , of course with our co-operation , though subordinate , managed to bring about this grand result , is , as we have said , beautifully related in the volumes before us , and expounded with an admirable and lucid development of the // two processes , - alienation from Great Britain and cohesion among ourselves , - which made us an independent nation . We xviii run hastily over some of the salient points of the story , following the lead of these two most instructive reporters of it . The Parliamentary Bill which shut up the port of Boston was a revengeful measure , designed to coerce payment for the East India Company 's tea which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been entertained that this summary act would not only secure such payment , but would also be effectual towards the complete subjection of the refractory spirit of the citizens . Up to this point Boston had been regarded in the councils of Great Britain , and not unfairly so , as the prime offender , and as concentrating in the bosoms of a few ardent or self-seeking popular leaders all that then existed of discontent and the spirit of rebellion . The easy problem which , as Parliament supposed , was given to it to solve , was , how by one summary act to repress this spirit before it should grow more violent or extend itself . The nobler problem which Providence was to work out was , how to make a ministerial act , which , though oppressive , could hardly be called tyrannical , the means of awakening the spirit of liberty and of union among a most heterogeneous multitude of persons , in the main content to be under foreign rule , and strangers to one another . We do not hesitate to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was designed to redress a deed of violence and sedition attended with a loss of private property which was under government protection . On June 1 , 1774 , Governor Jiutchinson left the land of his birth , the church of his baptism , the college of his education , the town and country mansions furnished by the wealth he had acquired in the long course of prosperity that had enriched him and his family , and all the honors which his fellow-citizens had lavishly bestowed upon him till he began to crave those which he could enjoy only as the tool of a foreign will . At noon on the day of his departure for England , the port from which he sailed was closed . The coincidence of these events was characteristic of the whole strange method for working out a destined result . The only one of the Provincial // Governors of Massachusetts who was a native of the soil was the chief agent in exciting the spirit of rebellion . It was right that he should pass out of its waters as the interdict was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instantaneous stop to more than half of all the various occupations of its laboring and mercantile classes . All water transit for every species of property was forbidden . Nothing could be transported in boats from one wharf to another , not even food , wood , hay , sand , lime , or bricks . If vessels on the stocks were launched , they were liable to seizure . For a town standing upon the edge of the ocean , surrounded by deep water , and which , but for one narrow neck of land attaching it to the continent , would have been an island , - encircled by islands covered with flocks and crops , without a bridge in either direction ,  --  for a town thus situated and environed , the interdict operated like the plague coming hand in hand with famine . What is regarded in all civilized communities as a most dangerous class , the , dependent and the unemployed , were thus left to brood over their wrongs , to foment discords , and to be the means for rallying the sympathies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a number of idle and angry persons , leaving their common employments and lacking bread , would have been a most alarming element of anxiety and mischief in a small but flourishing town . Benignant for us was the fostering method of Providence which turned that forlorn company into pleaders first for bread and then for something more . On the 17th of the same month , a day to which the next year was destined to affix in red a deep mark , the Massachusetts House of Representatives , on the eve of its dissolution by Governor Gage , resolved that resistance should be made to the operation of the Port Bill , and that the suffering people of Boston and Charlestown ought to be encouraged in withstanding oppression , and in holding out under their wrongs by aid from all quarters , especially from other parts of the Province . These resolutions were ratified and enforced by the Massachusetts Provincial Congress , and on the 17th of September the Continental Congress made the solicitation of contributions for Boston the ground of a public appeal . The trust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , imposed upon the Overseers of the Poor , as a lawful body politic for such functions . But these gentlemen having asked relief for reasons given , a larger committee of twenty-six members was chosen , to whom soon after ten more were added , charged with the anxious and responsible trust . They were men of the highest standing , religious and patriotic , representing different interests and feelings in the community . The office was one of exacting labor , and it was exposed to much invidiousness . It had two distinct objects , - to obtain the common articles of subsistence for the necessitous , and to provide employment with pay for the idle . Only the most judicious and conscientious management would have secured such an agency against being in itself a prolific source of mischief . Samuel Adams was the chairman of the committee , and the town treasurer , David Jeifries , had charge of the funds . At a town-meeting in December a general vote of thanks for the donations was passed , besides the acknowledgment made by the committee in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historical Society two Letter-Books devoted to this very interesting correspondence . One of them contains copies of letters from over the whole continent accompanying the gifts transmitted , the other contains the replies of recognition and thanks from the committee . It is this correspondence , edited and illustrated by Mr. Frothingham , very pertinently and intelligently , and with great pains , which mainly occupies one of the volumes before us . The reader of it will be struck by the remarkable variety in sentiment , phrase , and turn of expression displayed on both sides of the correspondence , considering that it has but one theme . This is the more remarkable on the side of the committee in the composition of their replies . One might naturally suppose that they would have chosen a few formulas of patriotism and gratitude , and repeated them in substance in their several compositions . But no . In two or three instances they sent a copy of the same reply in two directions ; but for the rest they gave themselves even to the routinework of their task with the zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is amazing how wealthy // they found or made the vocabulary of patriotism and of brotherly-kindness . Now it is in these papers that we meet with the first specimens of that spasmodic , energetic , and occasionally exaggerated style of patriotic expression , which , wofully degenerated and deprived of the heart-beating and the originality of Revolutionary eloquence , is grossly parodied by some of the muddier Fourth-of-July orators , et id genus omne . We can more than tolerate the originals , not only because they are originals , but because they are real , and were written by those who backed them up by deeds . Nor do they ever run into the rant , bombast , and blasphemy of some modern declamations . Here is a good specimen , from the letter from Brooklyn , Connecticut , accompanying a gift of one hundred and twentyfive sheep - " We mean , in the first place , to attempt to appease the fire ( raised by your committing the India Tea to the watery element as a merited oblation to Neptune ) of an ambitious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs ; if that do not answer the end , we are ready to march in the van , and to sprinkle the American altars with our hearts ' blood , if occasion should be . " - p. 51 . There was another mode of emphatic expression which occasionally crept into the excited remarks of some of our Revolutionary men , for which we will offer no apology . We have a specimen in an epistle of Gadsden , of South Carolina , in which he says , " Do n't pay for an ounce of the damned tea . " Considering what was the fate of the tea , perhaps the word may be regarded rather as judicial than profane . It would not be easy at this day to get a perfectly exact account of all the gifts sent to Boston in these critical times , nor of their value . It is enough to know that they answered their noble purpose in both directions , as expressing the sympathy of the donors , and as securing all deserving objects from extreme destitution . Of course the shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost attending the reception of the contributions , especially as , for the most part , they were in heavy goods and articles of sustenance , such as live stock , flour , grain , and wood . The town of Marblehead generously offered the use of its wharves and warehouses // for the unlading and storing of the goods , and they were thence transported by land to Boston . Some large donations show the zeal of wealthy places , proud of their munificence in a noble cause ; some small gifts from frugal settlements , into which the luxuries of life had hardly yet penetrated , are tokens nevertheless of the substantial food of our yeomen . If any one would have a marvellously touching proof and illustration of the sweet Christian assurance , that the mutual doing of deeds of kindness and mercy makes us have confidence in one another , adds to our own wisdom , sincerity , and loftiness of purpose , and strengthens us for sharp conflict and sure victory , let him read this correspondence . He will find on every page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English policy devised for us our policy , and knit the inhabitants of this continent in bands of love , while alienating them from old foreign ties . Here is a slyly cautious paragraph from a most spicy letter , overflowing with rank rebellion , from Lebanon , Connecticut - " As you have printed some letters , &amp;c. , if any of this should be thought worthy of notice , ( which we do n't desire , ) and as the issue of things is not absolutely certain , and this town the residence of the Governor , &amp;c. , please to let it stand as anonymous , and be entire , ending with bleed and die together . ' The remainder you may do with as you please . " - p. 45 . And here is some good , sensible matter from a reply by Joseph Warren to a letter from Norwich - " We consider a suspension of trade through the continent with Great Britain , Ireland , and the West Indies , as the grand machine that will deliver us . If this should fail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As yet we have been preserved from action with the soldiery , and we shall endeavor to avoid it until we see that it is necessary , and a settled plan is fixed on for that purpose . The late Acts of Parliament are such gross infringements on us , that our consciences forbid us to submit to them . We think it is better to put up with some inconvenience , and pursue with patience the plan of commercial opposition , as it will be more for the honor and interest of the continent , as well as more consistent with the principles of humanity and religion . " Mr. Gage finds himself very unequal to the task that is set him , and is at a loss for measures . He sees and is astonished at the spirit of the // people . He forbids their town-meetings , and they meet in counties . If he prevents county meetings , we must call provincial meetings , and if he forbid these , we trust that our worthy brethren on the continent , and especially of the town of Norwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time of danger , and will be no less conspicuous for their fortitude than they now are for their generosity . " - p. 47 . In a reply to a letter from Kingston , asking about the condition of Boston , we find the following : - . " The circumstances of this Town are truly deplorable ; our harbor filled with armed ships ; all foreign trade suspended ; a vast number of poor thrown out of employ , who swarm daily to the Committee for labor or support ; our Town filled with troops ; the Neck , the only avenue into the Town , fortified by cannon planted on the walls ; a regiment , and two redoubts , about forty rods without the fortification ; the soldiery insolent , all the cannon that is private property which they can come at seized ; the cannon at the North Battery spiked up , our powder taken possession of , and every hostile appearance . What the event of these things will be , is known only to the Supreme Ruler of the universe , in whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In full confidence that our cause is just , and that we have an unalienable right to all the privileges specified in our charter , we are determined to make no concessions . " We have just to observe that we employ our poor , in mending the streets , making bricks , spinning wool , flax , cotton , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , and are erecting looms to weave the same into baizes and shirt cloth , which we hope to sell , and so protract our stock . The Committee have an arduous task , and they can assure the public that no one person , but such as are in indigent circumstances , ever received a penny benefit from the donations ; and it is requested that no ill-natured report may be credited , until facts can be ascertained . " Please to present to our friends in Kingston , that have so liberally contributed to our relief the most sincere and hearty thanks of this Committee , in behalf of the Town . We wish the best of Heaven 's blessings may attend you , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold . " - pp. 77 , 78 . The small farming town of Littleton , Massachusetts , sent a donation of ? 4 3s . Old. , with " twenty-six and a quarter bushels of rye , one handkerchief , half-pound of pinks flowers , " and the expense of carting the rye to Boston , accompanied by a letter containing the following : - // " I wish the donation had been larger ; but our principal men give nothing . You have many friends in this Town , but are not able to do much for you . I would have you put in the papers , received so much from Littleton , as a few of us would be glad to support the credit of the Town . " - p. 241 . The explanation of the hint dropped in these lines is that the minister , the lawyer , and some of the principal inhabitants , were Tories . The reader of the volume will not fail to note , that among the gifts which passed through the hands of the Committee were two money-drafts upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forces , Thomas Gage . He seems to have paid at sight the smaller draft for ? 186 , and to have at least accepted the other for ? 737 . It may be that in these negotiations he was the purchaser of some of the surplus provisions for which he paid in that which " answereth all things . " This curious fact ought to have another mentioned in connection with it , namely , that Washington , after devoutly observing in his parish church the Fast Day which Virginia had appointed on account of the enforcement of the Port Bill in Boston , headed the subscriplion paper for the relief of our poor by friends in his neighborhood with a gift of ? 50 . The small district of Monson , evidently the residence of some rude but honest yeomen , sent a present , the nature of which is not specified , and a letter , with the following postscript - " We have eighty stout fellows in this district , a great part of which are not only disciplined , but excellent marksmen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , they would pick up tories as so many hawks would kick ( pick ? ) frogs from a frog-pond. " - p. 271 . And so the zealous work of generous sympathy was engaging the committee and their new-made friends all over the continent , till the very eve of the battle at Lexington . The planters at the South , the wild hunters then penetrating westward , the French and English ' in Quebec , joined with neighbor Provinces , and with towns inland beyond the mountains and spread along the coast , in the same noble cause . It is observable that some scandalous reports , impugning the disinterestedness of the Committee , and ascribing to them the meanest motives , obtained currency , and required a repeated // notice in public prints and circulars . These slanders , which were alleged to come from the malignity of the Tories , as they witnessed the spirit engaged on the side of sympathy with the Bostonians , when followed up by the Committee , took the form of two specific charges , as follows : " That each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as some say , half a guinea , for every day 's attendance ; besides a commission upon all the donations received , and other emoluments for their trouble ' * and " that the Committee have employed poor persons in working for themselves , and gentlemen of fortune with whom they are particularly connected in their private concerns , and paid them out of the donations received . " These base insinuations , when freely circulated at a distance by enemies or pretended neutrals , would have the effect of cooling the ardor , and holding back the gifts , of many well-disposed persons . It was therefore well that the Committee took pains to meet them by a dignified but flat denial , signed by Samuel Adams , while they freely opened their books to all who would consult them to know how they administered their charities . Mr. Frothingham has taken pains to seek out from the prints notices of the meetings held over the country for the collection of these gifts , and to give us interesting notes illustrating the text . These meetings cxtended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide . So they are to be regarded as parts of that wonderful and beautiful method of a Divine purpose working through human affections , and preparing the fragmentary materials of an empire on this continent for assimilation and coherency . These ministrations of charity to the poor in Boston from the other towns in the Province and from the continent at large , furnish , of course , only an episode in the whole year 's drama as written by Mr. Bancroft . He deals very skilfully with this one efficient agency in extending among all the nominal subjects of Great Britain here the dread of all tyranny , and the sense of a common cause uniting them first in resistance and then in harmony of purpose , and in bringing them into those intimate relations which enabled them so to overcome their antipathies that a new empire might spring 41 // from their counsels and arms . The reader of Mr. Bancroft 's volume xviii require no aid in tracing through every page of it the working out of those two conditions to which we have referred as necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American independence . He opens to us the vacillating , but always irritating , policy of England . He takes us into the debates of Parliament , and the secret sittings of ministers . He explains to us how it was that England delayed to strike a decisive blow until the train of circumstances had so matured our strength and ability for resistance that the decision passed from the side of Great Britain to our own side . The plea set up for England , that her plans and measures were devised in entire ignorance of the actual state of things in the Colonies , is shown by Mr. Bancroft to be wholly vain . Indeed , one needs but to read the speeches of Pitt , Pownal , Burke , and Barr6 , to understand that only a dogged obstinacy and arrogance could blind ministers to the folly of their course . Facts enough , eloquently , deliberately , and importunately uttered , were laid before the councils of the nation , to have guided them more wisely . Colonel Barr6 , in 1774 , told the Commons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much like yourselves to be driven ; have some indulgence for your own likeness . " Dean Tucker , that strange medley of wisdom and folly , in his Fourth Tract , recommended the recognition of our independence , and a treaty with us , ten years before we had ventured to declare ourselves free . Lord Chatham , addressing the ministers in 1775 , said , " The whole of your political conduct has been one continued series of weakness , temerity , despotism , ignorance , futility , negligence , blundering , and the most notorious servility , incapacity , and corruption . " If the objurgatory spirit in these charges helped , as doubtless it did , to strengthen the bad passions and the fatal errors which they rebuked , there were not wanting calmer appeals . Dr. Franklin 's examination at the bar of the House of Commons , ten years before our Declaration of Independence , should have wrought a great impression through his mild wisdom . Indeed , if English statesmen had but read aright their own history of just a century previous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tional principles among them was but an earnest of the result that must take place in America . Burke reminded them of the parallel in these burning sentences : - " In effect we suffer as much at home as abroad ; for in order to prove that the Americans have no right to their liberties , we are every day endeavoring to subvert the maxims of our own . We never gain a paltry advantage over them in debate , without attacking some of those principles , or deriding some of those feelings , for which our ancestors have shed their blood . " Horace Walpole 's letters through the whole period are strewn with banter and sarcasm , from which , however , it is very plain what was his serious view of the policy and conduct of the whole war on the part of Britain . Thus : - " Mrs. Britannia orders her Senate to proclaim America a continent of cowards , and vote it should be starved unless it will drink tea with her . She sends her only army to be besieged in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terra firma ; but orders her army to do nothing , in hopes that the American Senate at Philadelphia will be so frightened at the British army being besieged in Boston , that it will sue for peace . " - ( To Rev. William Mason , August 7 , 1775 . ) But wisdom , remonstrance , and banter were all vain . In vain did the city of London , after holding a friendly correspondence with the aggrieved Colonists , petition Parliament against its measures , and find its effort to offer a humble address to the throne repelled . In vain did officers of the British army and navy resign their commissions rather than engage against us , while even the king 's brother disapproved his course ; and the lack of Englishmen willing to fight in the bad cause necessitated the enlistment of Continental mercenaries . The almost annual change of ministry , between that of Pitt and that of Lord North , during the five critical years which really disposed of the issue at stake , indicates the shifting policy of the times and the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London in August , 1775 , was not taken into the British ark because there was no dove to offer its beak . And now the whole burden and blame of the course pursued by England are visited upon the king , - but not rightfully so . His full share of responsibility was actually understood here at the time , and it was well known that his quality of ob // stinacy became more intense as the Colonies thwarted his contemptuous and revengeful measures . The New England Calvinistic preachers of the time , many of whom were just then softening into Arminians , had a good illustration in him of the textual exposition , that by the Lord 's hardening the heart of Pharaoh , is meant , that the Lord allowed it to harden . For so it was with the king . But he found advisers and backers in his measures , even many among the Colonists themselves . The only explanation we can discern for the whole train of events and its marvellous working , is that the God who allowed the king 's heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals to be incompetent , and his soldiers to be conquered , had a design to accomplish which included all these contingencies as its means . Four months after the Port Bill reached Boston , the Congress of twelve Colonies was in session at Philadelphia . Mr. Bancroft follows with consummate skill every thread which was worked in the loom that was fashioning the pattern of a new and rich design . He traces through parallel lines the oppressive and alienating measures of Great Britain , the harmonizing and co-operating measures of the Colonies . He tells us with what delicate care , and with what a cautious feeling of the way , the representatives of most unlike constituencies were brought into council together , and then balanced , qualified , and moderated one another 's judgments and feelings . He takes us into town-meetings , provincial assemblies , camps in the backwoods , and secret sessions in Congress . He points out to us the temporizers and the neutrals , the honest waverers , ready to be assured into ardent champions of the right , and the truculent debaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts . He gets into the secrets of the French minister , Gamier , at London , and tells us what that keen and sly observer of English policy and fatuity wrote home to Vergennes , prophetic of every measure which transpired here ; and thus he finds the root of that alliance which was soon to unite us in a championship of freedom with the French Empire . But something must precede that alliance as its condition . France would make no treaty with us till we had committed ourselves to // an implacable rupture with Great Britain . That required a Declaration of Independence , and this Declaration required two Congresses to mature it . In the mean while some extreme measures , such as real battles , must come in the series of providential methods . And these , too , came . They were fought on the soil of Massachusetts . Mr. Bancroft leaves nothing to be desired as to the fulness of detail in relating them , and nothing to be objected to as regards the accuracy and impartiality of his narrative . With the rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , and with the choice of Washington , the nation 's providential man , Mr. Bancroft leaves us to wait further fruit from his labors.
