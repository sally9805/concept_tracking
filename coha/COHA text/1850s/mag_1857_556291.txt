txt ART . IJ. - Lectures read to the Seniors in Harvard College . By FDWARD T. CHANNING . With a Biographical Notice by R. H. DANA , JR . Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 18*36 . THE office of the Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory in Harvard University is undoubtedly one of the most important in that institution . It was remarked with truth by an ancient writer , that the proper use of language is a leading test of infellectual culture . Clearness of thought and purity of taste are chiefly manifested through the medium of words , and can hardly exist without the aid of words . Among the ancient Greeks the rhetorical teachers to a considerable extent identified themselves with the Sophists , who corrupted the youth of the Hellenic republic , while they amassed great private fortunes by teaching the art of making the worse appear the better cause , for the purpose of gaining selfish political ends with the popular bodies . To the best thinkers and wisest men of Athens , - to Socrates and Plato , - this art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pernicious system of mental trickery , which struck at the fundamental distinctions between truth and falsehood , right and wrong , virtue and vice . The dialogues of Plato , and especially the noblest of them all , the Gorgias , contain the most masterly exposures of the mischiefs done by this immoral art , and some of the most pungent passages in the Aristophanic comedy have the same general bearing . In modern times , no doubt , there reigns among controversialists much of the same unconscientious dealing with truth , the same system of disgnises , by which the real features of a question in dispute are attempted to be hidden under the veil of deceptive words and phrases ; but the art of rhetoric , treated by systematic writers , and taught in the schools and colleges , // is founded on principles of truth ; that is , it aims to render the expression the true representative of the thought . In the ancient treatises , - in Dionysius of Halicarnassus , in Aristotle , and most especially in the precious and admirThie work of Quintilian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Institutes " of the last-named author should be carefully studied , not only by every teacher , but by every man who wishes to understand the power of speech , as a means of public communication . No teacher within our knowledge , whether of ancient or modern times , understood this matter better , we think , than the late Professor Edward T. Channing . In various departrnents of Aiuerican literature , the family bearing this name have greatly distinguished themselves . In pulpit eloquence , the voice of Dr. William E. Channing - that voice so penetrating , so persuasive , so mild , and yet so powerful - has but lately died away ; while his written speech , still breathing in its immortal periods the vivid genius of the living man , charms , instructs , purifies , convinces , the readers of the English language in both hemispheres , and is translated into most of the cultivated languages of the European continent . Others of that honored name continue the spell , and show that the source whence the inspiration was drawn has not ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominently before the public as his brother ; but the channels by which his influence floxved through the literary community were perhaps deeper , and the effects of that influence more personal to those who felt it , and more permanent . Edward Tyrrel Channing was born at Newport , IRhode Island , on the 12th of December , 1790 . He entered harvard University in 1804 ; but having been involved in some way in a college rebellion , he did riot receive his degree until several years after the regular period . We have no means of knowing the particulars of the affair , nor to what extent he was implicated in the proceeding . College rebellions seem to have died out , with other curious and unintellic4ble practices of the past ; and it is hardly worth while to recall those foolish proceedings of petulant boys , even for the purpose of showing that some particular victim was personally innocent of the follies in which his fellows were engaged . // Mr. Channing studied law with his elder brother , Francis Dana Channing , whose early death was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he distinguished himself ; but his tastes were strongly literary , and he took an active part in the discussions held by some of the leading scholars , which issued in the establishment of the North American Review , in 181* . It was edited first by Mr. William Tudor , in whose hands it remaiued two years ; next by Mr. Sparks , with the assistance of a club ; then by Mr. Channing and Mr. Richard I-I . Dana . In 1819 Mr. Channing received the appointment of Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory in the University at Cambridge . His well-known literary habits , his pure taste and exquisite critical judgment , the power and beauty of his style , his extensive reading in the best parts of English literature , and his familiarity with the great masters of the classical languages , made the appointment eminently suitable ; and the long period of thirty-two years , during which he discharged its duties with an assiduity never surpassed , and a success seldom equalled , justified in a most brilliant manner the wisdom with which the selection was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctual and exact in the performance of every duty . Some of our readers perhaps know by experience that academic life , in its best forms , and under the most favorable circumstances , is not a pathway always strewn with flowers . The support of college discipline , ever irksome , yet ever needful , because study and teaching are impossible without it , in an American college at least , is sometimes a severe trial to men of culture and sensibility . The gratifications are many ; but they are sometimes offset by annoyances and provocations , which make the college officer sigh for a larger and freer career , in the competition with ripened intellects on the stage of the world . Professor Channing - and we speak of what we know - bore his full share in the minute details of college administration , and did it cheerfully , as well as efficiently . On committees , he was laborious and wise , careful and cool . As a teacher , his method was exact and thorough . He never aimed to make a show of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His questions went straight to the centre of the subject , and // there was no evading them by wordy and unmeaning generalities . The student must answer to the point , or not at all . The remarks by which he was accustomed to unfold the subject of the lesson were drawn from wide reading and careful reflection ; and the illustrations which he often added sometimes did more than the text of the author to fix a rule or a principle in the scholar 's mind . Mr. Channing was not , in the usual sense of the word , an orator . He was not much in the habit of appearing before the public . His tastes were quiet , and averse to display . But he did sometimes read lectures before lyceums and other popular institutions , on literary subjects , and never failed to command the interested attention of his audience . His services in this way were always highly valued by those who had the good fortune to secure them . We remember well an admirable lecture he gave on Walter Scott , many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illustrious master of fiction never had a more genial and appreciating critic . But though Mr. Channing was not much addicted to public speaking , he often delighted the circle of his friends by his exquisite readings , especially from Shakespeare . His voice was clear and pleasant , his enunciation distinct , his emphasis admirable , so that no part of the rhythmical beauty , no shade of forcible or sublime thought , was lost to his hearers . His reading was at once interpretation and commentary , and conveyed the full meaning of the author to the mind . We have spoken of some of Mr. Channing 's characteristics as a teacher . These were most strongly displayed in his mode of dealing with the exercises in writing - the compositions or themes - of the college students . This is a difficult part of the duty of a rhetorical professor , and requires , perhaps , more tact and judgment than any other branch of public instruction . The sensitiveness of young persons to the comments of their elders upon their first essays in putting their thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any experience in teaching . Bashfulness , self-love , vanity , and modest distrust of self are alike alarmed , and the nerves are put to their utmost tension , while the Rhadamanthus of rhetoric sits in awful judgment on the piece , - the result of so // many trials , the product , it may be , of so many sleepless hours . Some are afraid to venture beyond the driest forms of expression , and find the wings of imagination utterly unable to lift them from the ground of commonplace , the thick-coming fancies that played about them in their meditation or talk flitting away before the point of the pen and the mer de glace of the barren sheet ; others , seduced by sounding words and pompons phrases , that mean little or nothing , rush fearlessly on , dazzled by their own brilliancy , and dreaming that nothing half so fine was ever written before , yet afraid that the cool judgment of the teacher will not be equally impressed with the transcendent merits of the theme . How to encourage and call out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair by making them feel too deeply the poverty of the first attempt ; how to take down the vanity of these , by making them see how frothy is all that fine writing , without giving a deadly stab to their natural and rightful self-appreciation , - is aL*ays a difficult problem , which it requires great delicacy and sympathy to solve in a satisfactory manner . We think Mr. Channing , in the earlier part of his career , lost something by making his judgment dreaded . His own taste was so pure and cultivated , his dislike of tawdry expression was so deep , his abhorrence of slang was so emphatic , his contempt for the fantastic novelties with which many popular writers have weakened and debased the language was so keen , that he sometimes excited a ludicrous terror in the trembling neophyte ; but , for the most part , his criticism was so just and discriminating , his suggestions were so obviously sound , and the manner in which they were conveyed was so good-humored and witty , that the scholar was always benefited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal which his writing passed . it is true , as we well remember , that his sparing but most effectual sarcasm cast a sudden blight upon many gairish flowers of rhetoric , which had been cherished through the agonies of cultivating a hard and barren soil , and they drooped and died , having no successors after their kind the following season ; and they were resigned not without a sigh , by those whom they had cost so dear . A big word used where a small one would have been // better , a swelling phrase painfully wrought out to supply the place which were better filled by a simple and plain one , never escaped his skilful touch . By these minute labors , and by the influence which so keen and accomplished an intellect gradually gained in the society of the College , Mr. C hanning succeeded in creating a purity and simplicity of taste in English style , which - we think we may say it without claiming undue honor for our literary mother - characterize in a remarkable degree the speaking and writing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man of remarkable social qualities and talents . He was a lover of home and its quiet enjoyments ; but the delights of intelligent conversation , of the conversation of cultivated persons , were relished by none with a keener zest than by him . He was not monopolizing , sermonizing , dogmatic , nor dictatorial . He had the wit of Johnson , with the urbanity in which the great lexicographer was lamentably wanting . His literary knowledge was extensive , and furnished the most instructive matter to his talk , with no pedantic showing off . No man ever conversed with him without receiving so much of instruction and pleasure , that he would willingly have surrendered the reins to his hands entirely ; but Mr. Channing always gave others every opportunity to take their fair share . He loved to receive as well as to give ; so that conversation wandered on , through the pleasant paths of literature , or social life , or the news of the day , - each party contributing according to his means , - enlivened by the never-failing flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdote , polished criticism , and instructive teaching , on iVIr . Channing 's part . Some of his social tastes were old-fashioned , and in general the conservative tendency had its effect upon the forms of his social entertainment . He was fond of a quiet hand of whist , which he always cheered by his genial humor , and never grew impatient , as some old whist-players do , with the blunders of an inattentive partner . An excellent player himself , he did not , like Mrs. Battle , insist on " the rigor of the game , " but made the changing fortunes of the war wholly subservient to the interests of conversation . Had any one , of Boswell 's ready skill in recording conversations , noted down Mr. Channing ' s , // the good things he said , - the delicate irony , the just criticism , the happy comments , that dropped from his lips , at parties , during the social call , at the dinner-table , in walking , or in dealing the cards , - many a volume might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to those records of the great lexicographer , which still charm , and will for ever charm , the successive generations of readers . Mr. Channing 's lectures were always listened to with respect and interest . They were full of his peculiar spirit ; in style clear , elegant , and racy ; in thought , rich and delicate ; marked by keenness of judgment , and always seeming to express just the right thing in just the right form and connection . When advancing years and decreasing strength induced him to resign the office he had so long held , it was hoped by the numerous sons of Harvard that he would be able to prepare for the press the written discourses which had been so instructive from the Professor 's chair ; and all wished he might pass a serene and happy old age , surrounded by his numerous friends , who still shared in the pleasures of his conversation , enjoying as of old the treasures of his wit and wisdom . But disease laid upon him a stronger and stronger hand , and his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unexpectedly , except to those of his household who were constantly with him . It was found , however , that he had prepared a portion of his writings for the press ; and the admirable volume before us is the result of these labors of his invalid hours . It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the literary merit of these exquisite compositions . Intrusted to the taste and affection of Richard H. Dana , Jr. , his pupil and kinsman , and himself one of the best writers and most eloquent speakers of our times , the volume has been well edited and carefully printed . The Biographical Notice , which precedes the Lectures , is drawn with admirable truth and discrimination . We quote a few paragraphs , both for their elegance of style and justness of delineation . " Mr. Channing held the office of Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory for thirty-two years . The students who enjoyed the privilege of his instruction , now to he numbered by thousands rather than by hundreds , in all parts of our land , and in all occupations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His reputation for pure // style , and for exquisite taste and judgment in English literature , has been long established ; and all who have been his pupils know how faithfully and successfully he brought these gifts and aequirements to bear upon the duties of his office . They acknowledge , too , his dignity , justice , and impartiality , and his insight into character . They recognize , almost daily , the benefits of his criticisms in composition and elocution . But these constitute by no means the sum of their obligations . He was their adviser and guide in their reading : that which develops the minds and so much forms the tastes and influences the opinions of the young . Not merely by his course of lectures , and by private interviews , but also in the voluntary reading classes that met at his study , he drew them from the fascinations of the superficial , brilliant favorites of the day , to the writers of deep thought , elevated sentiments , and pure style . During the term of his professorship , he outlived many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For thirty years and more , he stood a breakwater against the tides and currents of false and misleading fashions ; and under that lee , in calmer airs , and in smoother but not less deep waters , the student was protected in his feebler and less skilful early efforts . Many will recall the quiet , keen , epigrammatic satire that he used so sparingly and so well , with which he gave a death-wound to the popularity of some ill-deserving favorite in oratory or poetry . Yet , though severe in his tastes , he was , on the whole , a wide liker . He was not fond of fault-finding . He was no martinet . Wherever he saw sincerity , earnestness , and power , no man made larger allowances for faults . So it was , that , although decided in his convictions and exact in his tastes , yet , as is well known to his friends , those young men who early espoused and have since distinguished themselves in courses of doctrine and style most distasteful to him , still preserved intimate relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Thus he escaped the condition in which too many nice critics find themselves , - a condition marked rather by distastes than by tastes , and powerless for good influence over the tempers and feelings of the young* He was also much aided by his humor and wit , - qualities which so liberalize and make genial the mind . In the exercise of these gifts he was choice and reserved , but as his humor was of that kind which springs from and attaches itself to what is general in human nature , it was widely received and well remembered . " - pp. xi - xiii . Of his literary acquirements Mr. Dana says - " Mr. Channing was a good classical scholar , and at one time made a particularly careful study of the Greek and Latin orators , and continned to the last to read a few of the poets , and the De Officiis and 4* // other essays of Cicero . But his reading lay chiefly in the works of his own tongue . It is needless to say that he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a familiar reader of the prosewriters of Queen Anne 's time , and of Burke , Johnson , Goldsmith , Fielding , Richardson , and Scott . All this is of course . He was also a student of Chaucer and the earliest English writers , and of the old dramatists , and a lover of the unique and quaint , the novelists and humorist*s of all periods . The theologians , too , Barrow , Taylor , and South , were the friends of his more serious leisure , which they shared with Young , Cowper , and Bunyan . Of the writers of the Regency , and since , while he yielded most perhaps to the charm of Scott , yet he was among the earliest to recognize the genius and influences , in their various characters , of Wordsworth , Coleridge , Byron , Southey , Campbell , and Lamb . With our own literature , he had grown up . Irving , Cooper , Bryant , and Miss Sedgwick were his contemporaries ; while Longfellow and our historians have gained their reputations since he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time , he saw so much of vicious style , and of questionable usefulness of thought , that he suffered them mostly to glide by him ; but to the humor and pathos of Dickens , with all his defects , he was fully alive . " - pp. xiv , xv . And of his conversational and social qualities , the following beautiful passage is as true as it is well expressed - " Of his conversational talent his friends need not be told , but it will be a pleasure to them to recall its charm . Natural , free , animating , humorous , and , when need be , using against any predominant folly or evil that classic , restrained , but effective satire , of which he was a master , his style in conversation was as pure and choice as in writing . But it was not a finish or choiceness which labored or embarrassed . It was as natural to him as awkwardness and solecisms are to many . Not a professed story-teller , in characteristic anecdote or graphic description of persons , classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character or manners , he was not easily to be surpassed . Still , his best conversation was his most thoughtful . While no man more readily fell into or more successfully sustained the humorous , it was strictly his recreation , and not his habit . His numerous friends and relatives , who enjoyed , at his house , the weekly Saturday dinner , at which , without special invitation , it was known they were always welcome , will take a sad pleasure in calling to mind , among the beauties and privileges of their lives , the attractions that presided at either end of the table , dividing their attention and doubling their delight . // " As he was not a professed wit , so he was not a controversialist . His powers were best seen in the contemplative , in the pursuit of serious thought , or of beauty in nature , art , or character . As a letter-writer , he was valued by his friends beyond price . Perhaps there was no field in which his talents played more naturally and fitly than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humorous of friendly letterwriting . " Throughout life he retained the warmth of his affection for the young ; and any one who had the claim upon him of blood , or of childhood or youth , must have been ill-deserving indeed not to have held an inner place in his heart . " It has been remarked of him by one who knew him intimately from boyhood , that , although society or intercourse with a single friend always pleased and animated him , and his powers particularly displayed themselves in conversation , yet he was as fond of being alone as if he had been unsocial and morose . His preference for solitude arose from the cheerfulness and equanimity of his temper , and his great resources in himself for pleasure and improvement . A change to society was not unwelcome to him , but the return to solitude was even more congenial . " All that we have here attempted to portray has gone from us . But it will live in the recollections of his friends ; and when they too have passed away , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . " - pp. xviii , xix . The discourses begin with the address on " The Orator and his Times , " delivered December 8 , 1819 , when Mr. Channing was inducted into office . The main part of this discourse is devoted to a consideration of the circumstances in the state of society which distinguish the modern from the ancient orator . It is a very ingenious and elegant oration . We take a brief passage towards the conclnsion. - " If I were told that the heart and imagination had necessarily grown torpid , while society was becoming more regular and cultivated , that our best powers were sacrificed in order to our well-being , I should ask for the evidence of this much sooner than for the reason . I would even venture to ask how the fact was with regard to eloquence itself . I would take the best and most characteristic specimens of English eloquence in different ages , and learn from them if the imagination had perished under the chilling restraints of an improved society . Can you point to productions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such perfect riot and joy , and to have been so peculiarly the warming and animating principle of the speaker 's thoughts ? It seems as if the effect of our increased knowledge had been to make men more contemplative , live less upon the public for excitement , feel the most deeply when alone , and suffer their imaginations to enter into and warm and illuminate their most serious thoughts . It is indeed true that the imagination and passions do not predominate in modern eloquence ; they are not our turbulent masters . Still we think it a false philosophy which tells us that it can ever be the effect of general improvement to separate them from the judgment . We let them work with the judgment ; and they work safely , forming and perfecting the character , enlivening the truth , and impressing it deeply , rendering our serious labors agreeable and efficient , making us love what we approve , and act earnestly after we have chosen wisely . We believe that the more perfect we are , the more intense will be our pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , the more thoroughly it will pervade and influence our opinions and characters . " Our religion is certainly one of the great causes which have given to society that temperate , subdued character which is thought by some to be unfavorable to impassionate eloquence . And yet this religion constantly addresses the affections , not only as consisting perfectly with a sound mind , but as the very principles of our nature on which its moral provisions for human perfection and happiness are founded . It demands not the sacrifice of a single power , but that all should be cultivated to the utmost , and properly directed and balanced in order to our happiness . It sends neither fever nor lethargy to the heart , but sees men equally distant from their good , in the frenzy of savage passion and the hardened indifference of stoicism . It encourages the warmest sympathy , and the noblest and most persevering ambition . In offering its simplest precepts and sublimest promises , it has spared no language or beauty or imagery that could delight and refine our taste , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the Bible for its eloquence , appealing to all nations and classes in every age , - its power is as universal as the sun . The form and tone of society may change , but you can not so change the heart , that this eloquence will not reach it , and be a model and help for the orator who would reach it . " As another argument that the art has lost none of its dignity or honorable motives , and no worthy means of gaining a strong and wholesome influence over men , - I would mention the importance of character to all successful eloquence . It is his virtues , his consistency , his unquestioned sincerity , that must get the orator attention and confidence now . He must not rely too much upon the zeal or even the // 1857 . PROFESSOR CHANNING AND 1115 LECTURES . soundness with which he treats a question under immediate discussion . His hearers must believe that his life is steadily influenced by the sentiments he is trying to impress on them , - that he is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinions and professions the full authority of his actions . There are , indeed , accidents arid artifices that may secure present success to the worst men ; but it is the general effect of our improved society to give an influence to purity , firmness , and stability , on which every public speaker may rely for lasting consideration and weight . " It would not be going too far to say , that it is not in all the graces of address , or sweetness and variety of tones , or beauty of illustration , - in all the outward and artificial accomplishments of the orator , - to equal or even approach the power conferred by a good character . Its still eloquence is felt in the commonest transactions of life . But it is in the administration of justice , in public deliherations upon the endangered interests of our country , and in the services that are to form us for this world and for heaven , that we feel its majesty and purity in all their power , and receive strength from its presence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , no treacherous allureinents from a close and sober inspection of the truths upon which we are to act . We want then the orator who feels and acts with us ; in whom we can confide even better than in ourselves ; who is filled with our cause , and looks at it with solemnity and wisdom . We want then the orator who is unmoved by the reproaches or threats that alarm us ; who walks over the injurious as over the dust , unconscious even that he tramples on them ; who fears nothing on earth but a bad action , and regards no considerations but those of good principle . " - pp. 20- 24 . A " General View of Rhetoric " is presented in the following discourse , and we commend it earnestly to all teachers and scholars . The discourse on " Elocution , a Study , " contains the following excellent remarks , with a great deal snore that is very instructive and important - " Many have a vague notion of ' art as opposed to or above nature ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in our present use of the term , - in the sense of a means or instrument , - art is drawn directly from all that we have learned of the perfect in man 's nature , and is intended to develop and train what he already possesses . It is an experiment upon human power to know how far it may be extended , and what direction it needs . And whether he knows it or not , every man , in his particular calling , is subjected to this experiment , He // either tries it upon himself ; or others try it for him . He is a pupil , more or less docile , of somebody . This is a necessity of his constitution and condition . There can be no qualification or dispensation to suit the faculties , tastes , or pursuits of any man . The very prodigies of genius , who seem to us short-sighted worshippers to find their way upward like the plant , - if they had the power to reveal the mystery of their growth , would probably show us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict though perhaps unconscious obedience to principles , than the most dependent of their brethren have ever been subjected to . The poet is called emphatically the child of nature . He is born to his vocation . Still he is and must be in the strictest sense a pupil of art , as in his triumph he is a master . To speak only of versiilcation , - I admit that there is such a thing as a natural ear for melody ; but I must go far beyond this simple perception and pleasure to account for all the received varieties of verse ; its complication , its refinement , and power of endless adaptation . Sound is studied by the poet , till its hidden capacity of expression is understood , - till verse in its most finished state becomes a full exhibition of an inborn faculty , and serves to illuminate both thought and passion , however various or subtile . " What should exempt the voice from the necessity imposed upon our powers generally ? It is certainly capable of being affected in some way by experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled and harmed by ourselves and by others . The proper view of it seems to be , that Nature gives her early lesson where no other can teach , and indicates that there is much in reserve which we ourselves must bring to light for the noblest services of speech . The natural voice , in order that its full compass of expression may be known , and that it may be capable of giving the best utterance , needs cultivation , vigilant study , and many experiments . No matter how great may be a man 's natural gift , or whether his practice is the analysis and trial of vocal sounds , or an exercise at school , or solitary declamation in forests or on the seabeach , or whether he studies the manner of other speakers as a means of discovering and improving his own faculty ; be the discipline what it may , so far forth as he is a good speaker , he has followed the true principles of rhetoric . Call him a natural or taught orator , it is all substantially the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do nearly everything for themselves are greater men than the thousand who need help from others . Profiting by a wise education is trusting to Nature , in the only common-sense interpretation of the words . We then acknowledge her secret forces , and try to give her full play . " - pp. 48-31. // The ancient rhetorical writers divided oratory into several departments , one of which was entitled Epideictic , or Demonstrative . This branch of eloquence is the subject of the next discourse in Professor Channing 's volume , and it is a composition of great literary interest and merit . It is of considerable importance among us , because similarity of circumstances to those of the ancient Greek republics has produced a great variety of occasions for this species of address in our country . On the system of popular lectures , which has such an astonishing development among the American people , Mr. Channing makes the following judicious remarks : - " It is on ground as broad as Milton has here taken in recommending a refining popular culture , a wisdom and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well worthy of consideration and support at this time among ourselves . Our courses of public lectures in town and country accord very well with his idea ; and though once a doubtful experiment , they are now regarded as a means of supplying a general want . Their uses are obvious . In a social view , the mere bringing people together to have their minds refreshed by truth , and their tastes gratified by simple , intellectual pleasures , is of itself civilizing . It is a very favorable sign of the times , that audiences can be collected evening after evening with no livelier temptation . " The purpose of such lectures can not be to furnish a great amount of exact knowledge , which will be retained and used like that which we amass in our private studies . Their object , I suppose , is partly to hold a sort of conversation with men upon what they are already to some extent acquainted with , in order that they may compare their ideas with those of a fellow-inquirer , and be assisted to take comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in detail . Generally , no doubt , the effect is to stimulate those who are in the habit of thinking and inquiring , to wake up the less intellectual , and to make whole communities feel that they have other matters of common interest than the affairs of their towns and families . " - pp. 67 , 68 . In the discourses which succeed , the Professor handles the following subjects : " Deliberative Oratory " ; " Judicial Oratory " ; " The Advocate and the Debater " ; " Eloquence of the Pnlpit " ; " Literary Tribunals " ; " Forms of Criticism // A Writer 's Preparation " ; " Habits of Reading " ; " A Writer 's Habits " ; " The Study of our own Language " ; " Clearness of Expression and Thought " ; " Using Words for Ornament " ; and " Permanent Literary Fame . " Upon every one of this attractive list of subjects Mr. Chauning has written with equal care , thoughtfulness* and taste . These essays are , therefore , interesting and instructive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every literary person . We have thus called the attention of the readers of this journal to the matured and well-weighed thoughts of a mind which possessed a singular combination of abilities and resources . We trust other volumes will follow , embracing other portions of his public lectures , his contributions to periodical literature , and a selection of the letters to which Mr. Dana alludes in his introductory Notice . No doubt they would be welcomed by the community as a precious addition to our literature .
