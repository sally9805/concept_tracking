WILLIAM PENN. * WHEN a new witness is brought into court , it is a customary measure of precaution to examine hIm on what the lawyers call his voir dire-that is to say , in order to discover whether or no he is competent to testify , and worthy to be believed ; so , in literature , when an author comes newly into the field , it is the custom to examine his work the more carefully , because we are not aware , from experience , how much faith may be placed upon him . Especially is this the case , when the author under consideration professes an intention to succeed where others have failed , to answer what has hitherto remained unanswered , and to have received new materials or new lights , not to be reached or seen by other persons . This is exactly Mr. Dixon 's condition . His preface informs us , that because the prior efforts to depict Penn 's life have been failures ; because the " sneers of Burnet , the falsehoods of Echard , and the bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because Macaulay has again brought forward these " errors , assumptions and mistakes , " he was determined to write , and he has written . He also gives us a list of thirtysix heretofore unconsulted and unpublished documents . His paragraph of thanks informs us that neither England nor America has been omitted in his collection of materials ; and we know , of our own knowledge , of one descendant of Penn , in Philadelphia , who was obliged to spend sundry weary mornings , and sadly to soil her delicate fingers , in endeavoring to satisfy Mr. Dixon 's requirements from among the musty family records . Yet we must confess that we have an unfortunate partiality for Burnet , Echard , Macintosh , and Macaulay , and that we commenced Mr. Dixon 's book , requiring that he should make out a very strong case , before we could abandon the faith which we , wrongly or not , have been accustomed to place upon them . Not only has the new biographer failed to do this , but he has , in addition , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established facts , that were the field of controversy on Penn 's character totally unoccupied , we should be very careful before we trusted to Mr. Dixon 's accuracy . It may be useful , in order to justify our doubts on the main question at issue , that we should instance some of these errors , and let our readers judge for themselves . We shall pass very *ummarily over the mistakes , which a proper knowledge of the geography of the country he wrote about would have saved Mr. Dixon from committing . had he possessed such knowledge , he could never have mistaken the Schuylkill for the Delaware , or placed East Jersey on the opposite bank of the river from the treaty-ground at Shackamaxon , or made Chester higher up the river than Wiccacoa , the modern Southwark in Philadelphia ; or have given Lord Baltimore the eastern and Penn the western half of the peninsula between the Chesapeake and Delaware . Neither shall we do more than call attention to some of his legal disquisitions , in which he shows very conclusively that he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the opinion of a court , and makes judicial discoveries equally astounding and ill-founded . Where , however , he errs on the questions of fact or historical events , we will take the liberty to consider his assertions more at length , as more nearly affecting his fitness for the work he has undertaken ; and if we can show , as we think we can , that he has committed unpandonable blunders in regard to notorious facts of English history , we submit that it is only fair to doubt his accuracy exceedingly , where we are asked to depend upon it in disputed questions , or where we have only his own researches and authority for a voucher . We will select a few cases for examination . " A well-merited impeachment was hanging over the head of Lord Danby , first minister of the crown . " - P. 163 . Danby was impeached for being in the interest of Louis XIV . During the negotiations , prior to the treaty of Nimeguen , Charles had offered to Louis , if the allies did not accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow him six millions of livres a year for three years , that all the English troops should be recalled from Flanders within two months ; that most of the army should be disbanded , and that no Parliament should be called for six months . This offer was contained in a letter transmitted through Danby to Montague , the then English ambassador at Paris ; but the letter was signed by Charles himself ; Danby and the other ministers consulted having positively refused to affix their names to it . Judged by the standard of official conduct now-a-days , IDanby 's part in this transaction is unjustifiable ; when compared with the actions of the minister 's contemporaries he appears much less blameable ; but , waiving this ground of defence , we unhesitatingly say , that Danby 's impeachment was unjust , simply because he was not the guilty party . He was a sacrifice to the ridiculous maxim that " the king can do no wrong . " An example was required ; the nation , in the fervor of the restoration , had lost the resolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had enabled them to disregard cobweb technicalities , and visit the responsibility for the actions of government on the really guilty party . Danby was , therefore , selected to fill the vicarious office , which a higher head should have occupied ; and his case was a violation of that principle cf common justice and common law , which forbids the trial and punishment of an accomplice till after the principal has been convicted . There is another view of this affair which puts the Lord Treasurer in an even better position , and shows the impeachment in its proper light . The truth is , as is now readily admitted by every properly informed person , that Danby was really impeached , not because he was a friend to France , but because he was an enemy to Louis ; not because he supported the French interest , but because he opposed it ; because he had been instrumental in bringing about the marriage of the Princess Mary with William of Orange , and because his unvarying advice to the king was to reject French interference . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted by Louis 's order , when he betrayed the correspondence from which the impeachment arose , and which the French monarch well knew would tuin the ministry ; and it is equally certain that most of the chiefs of opposition in Parliament were in the habit of acting under Louis s instructions . We can not agree that such an impeachment , so brought // about , was welI*merited or justifiable ; and even its most prominent actors and supporters admitted , in after years , that it was not so . " The House met in a most threatening mood . Its revenge was prompt . Danby was committed to the tower . The Duke of York was banished the realm . " - P. 167 . If this means  --  and it can mean nothing else-that James was banished by the action of Parliament , we can only say that Parliament did nothing of the kind , as any respectable history of England will show . James tried his right to suspend the whole body of the penal laws which oppressed his subjects . The question was regularly brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exception of Street , the judges were unanimously of opinion that , according to the laws and usages of England , the king had power to suspend the obnoxious enactments. " - P. 248 . Regularly brought to issue , says Mr. Dixon . There were certain pro . ceedings had preparatory to the trial which did much to produce this marvellous regularity . The counsel for the prosecution was a notorious creature of the court , paid by the defence to betray his case . When the king sounded the judges , he found them almost unanimous against him ; " I am determined , " said he , " to have twelve judges who are all of my mind as to this matter . " " Your majesty may find twelve judges of your mind , " replied one of them , " but hardly twelve lawyers . " The king acted on his threat , and packed the bench with his adherents . Finally , the solicitor-general , Finch , refused to appear for the dispensing power , and was instantly dismissed to make room for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trial must have been almost too regular ; but Mr. Dixon does not think such minutice of arrangement worthy a passing hint , let alone an extended notice ; and the decision in question is cited by him with as much respect as if it were one of Lord Coke's. **rPhe uncompromising champions of church prerogative were all ejected from the college ( Magdalen ) . Yet they lost little by their temporary removal . His self-love gratified , the king soon afterwards restored the fellows to their honors and emoluments . " - P. 256-7 . The fellows were expelled on the 16th November , 1687 , and rendered incapable of holding ecclesiastical preferments . They were only restored in September , 1688 , when the king , in an agony of terror because of William 's invasion-which Mr. Dixon probably thinks gratified his selflove-hoped , by retracing his steps , to escape the danger which threatened him . " In his misplaced confidence , an order in council had been issued at the same time with the Roy*il Declaration , commanding it to be read in all churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was published on the 4th April , 1687 , republished 27th April , 1688 , and the order in council not issued till the 4th May following . The dates are not mentioned by Hume , the authority most likely to be relied on by men of Mr. Dixon 's stamp , and , indeed , Hume 's statement is so contrived as to insinuate the idea expressed by Mr. Dixon . When we remember that this matter was one of the most powerful in producing the revolution , and that much stress was laid on the particular dates of every step in the whole affair , it is difficult to // say whom we should be most astonished at ; the historian who could lose sight of such important landmarks , or the biograj*her who could implicitly trust such an historian . " He ( James ) fled before the menaces of his son-in-Iaw. " - P. 259 . Truly Mr. Dixon must have drawn his history as well as his biography from " new sources . " Even Hume was obliged to confess that William 's conduct was anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that James , like all tyrants , was a coward , and fled from imaginary dangers where no real ones existed . We are weary of this continual citation and correction , though we could easily fill more pages with the statement of similar errors . In many eases the misrepresentation is of that common yet peculiar kind , in which , while it is impossible to place the finger on a positively false statement , the whole is so contrived as to produce an impression widely different from the true one . These things every one reading the book must correct for himself ; we have only striven , and can only strive , to give warning of them beforehand . We will not for a moment deny that we take an interest-almost a partisan interest-in the controversy about Penn . We always have a leaning towards the ranks of the iconoclasts ; and there is no image which men are so likely to set up improperly , and to endow with fanciful or nonexistent virtues , as that of any one in Penn 's situation : a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonwealth ; almost the martyr , and always the advocate and protector not only of his own religious sect , but also of the oldest , most powerful , and most united section of the Christian Church ; never had any one a better opportunity to be canonized , and few less deserving have ever been so . While these are our deliberate opinions , we do not care now to go extensively into Penn 's life to find a justification for them . With his European career we desire at present to have little to do . Of that portion of his history , however , which affected this continent , we wish to speak , and to endeavor , as far as in us lies , to correct many misconceptions to which we think it liable . It is remarkable how , throughout almost the whole of this dispute , American affairs have been left out of the question . It would have been reasonable to suppose , that those desirous to investigate Penn 's character should have sought the manifestations of it where it was least controlled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his principles of action became the moving spring of the state ; yet , by a seemingly common consent , this whole field has been abandoned , or all the notice given to it has been an occasional epithet or a passing slur upon the " ungrateful colonists . " Now we are not so unreasonable as to expectthat Pennsylvania history could be very entertaining to any one . All who have ever made it their study will agree , that of the dull , dry , and unattractive things of this world , " Proud " and " Gordon " take the lead . Talk of law books being uninteresting ! we had rather undertake to learn Littleton by heart twice over , than be condemned to a three months ' course of Pennsylvania annals . We can scarcely say whether her local position or her Quaker origin has had the greater influence over the destiny of the " old keystone , " as her sons delight to call her , but some how , and for some reason , romance or beauty never came near her . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circu pectus erat , dareth to imagine Gertrude of Wyoming , while another has tried how that extraordinary specimen of prose run mad-English hexameters-would suit the unpromising ground ; but the experiment was never repeated . For historical events of any interest , we look in vain over the dreary waste . No Puritans , pilgrims from oppression , the wrecks or the springs of revolution , claimed her protection or sheltering care : they sought a climate more fitted to their stern , determined natures , and a soil whose barren rocks might give the greater triumph to their perseverance . No reckless cavaliers , or gay-hearted Frenchmen , came within the Delaware : they looked further to the south , and settled the gentle plains and savannahs of a warmer and more congenial latitude . In short , the land of Penn was left to its sober fate . No Clyborne could be found , as in her neighboring colony , to disturb her peaceful sleep ; and , in the dearth of greater events , her sons fell to squabbling over petty ones . Looking at all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers , the history of Pennsylvania may well be a sealed book ; but it is none the less true , that within it lie hid many things which the disputants on Penn have not done well to neglect . It shall be our effort here to bring to light such portions of it as may be of importance to a just appreciation of the Proprietary 's character . An amusing or interesting history it can not be ; and we only make a virtue of necessity when we announce it as a mere catalogue of dry , and , to many , perhaps , trivial facts . In order to a proper understanding of the early history of Pennsylvania , it is desirable that a clear idea should , if possible , be obtained of its constitution and government . This is , however , no easy matter ; for the blessings of new government were so plentifully showered upon the early colonists , that it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly under what system they were living . In the twenty years , between 1681 and 1701 , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or whatever else they were called , were in force ; these , together with the common law rights , inherent in the colonists as Englishmen , and with the royal charter to the Proprietary , constituted the political system of the colony . The first " frame of government of the province of Pennsylvania , in America , " was perhaps as moderate in its provisions , and as well calculated to attract colonists , as it was possible t make it . Penn well knew what he was doing ; and , in order that his advertiseinent , for it was nothing more , might be as attractive as possible , Sidney was persuaded , innocently we believe , to take part in the solemn farce . Constitutional rights did not flourish very luxuriantly under the restored Stuarts ; and , when a liberal government was offered for their acceptance , crowds of emigrants flocked to the Proprietary 's ships . When , however , the requisite number had been obtained , the constitution had done all that Penn ever intended it to do , and all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to effect this end were well devised to conceal their ultimate object , and bore upon them marks of the same family likeness that distinguished the insidious encroachments of the sovereigns at home . Subsequently to the royal charter to Penn for the ter . ritory north of the fortieth degree of latitude , he obtained a grant from the then Duke of York , for the land commonly known as the " lower counties " or " territories , " lying along the west side of the Delaware River and Bay , from the southern limits of Pennsylvania to the ocean . Never was a grant // more fruitful of dispute , governmental aggression , and legal controversy , than this . After arraying Penn against his colonists , and Lord Baltimore against Penn ; after being debated in the Privy Council , and decreed upon by the Lord-Chancellor , it has descended as a sort of heir-loom to our own times ; it has been.the subject of dispute between neighboriug states of the Union ; it has opposed individual citizens to the general government ; national courts of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under it the harmonious spectacle has been exhibited , of the United States Marshal of one district ejecting tenants introduced by the same officer of another district . Scarcely was the ink of this portentous grant dry , when it was laid hold of by Penn , as a means of abolishing the constitution of 1682 . The grant in question was merely of the property in the soil . It passed no rights of governmt*nt , but gave a mere fee simple estate , the seigniority being in the duke , by his governor at New-York . Yet , in spite of this undoubted and undisputed fact , Penn , for his own purposes , endeavored to exercise over the " territories " the same powers he possessed over the province . He then argued , plausibly enough , that the constitution of 1682 did not bind his new acquisitions , and that , as the government was now one , a new constitution was necessary . It would be difficult to find a greater non sequitur , or an assertion less capable of support than this . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duke 's deeds which Penn asserted , there was the best reason to deny that the government was one . At that very moment , England and Scotland , though having a common sovereign , were perfectly distinct in government ; and , in later days , from the accession of George the First to that of Victoria , the same has been the fact as to England and Hanover . Had Penn really obtained the same rights over the " territories " which he possessed over Pennsylvania , the same reasons which governed the cases of Scotland and Hanover would have ruled his . How perfectly futile then does his claim appear , when we remember that *ie in fact possessed no right of government at all over these " lower counties . " In spite of all this , however , he effected his objects ; and in a year from the date of the first constitution , that one which , from its liberality , had been one of the greatest inducements to emigration , was abolished , and a new one adopted . The consequences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very soon appeared . The lower counties obeyed the consolidated government only when it plc sed them ; and when they refused obedience , or dissolved the connection , which they did several times , they justified themselves by the unanswerable assertion of Penn 's total want of authority over them in governmental matters . They were only regarded as a means of revenue , while all their officers were appointed from the province , and their custom-house and similar offices removed to Philadelphia . But the gravest danger , and the one most feared by the colonists , was , that the acts of the Proprietary in this matter might afford an ample cause for the forfeiture of the royal charter , an operation attended with little difficulty in those days , even where there was much less ground than this to support it . Whether Penn thought of this or not , it is difficult to say ; as if however , to throw beforehand the odium of such a result upon the colonists themselves , he met the first Assembly , under the settlement of // colonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of any act of theirs . It is also worthy of observation , that when the troubles between the province and the territories reached their climax , and a separation took place , Penn , although it was the legitimate consequence of his own act , threw all the blame upon Governor Lloyd , and accused him of purposely producing such a result . From 1683 to 1696 the province dragged along as well as it could . Penn sailed for England in 1684 , and did not return till 1699 , to what Mr. Dixon is pleased to call , somewhat cantingly it may be , his " holy experiment . " A succession of governors ruled with equally ill success . The crown seized the government for a time , it having become absolutely necessary that the province should be placed in a state of defence . Finally , . the people agreed upon the adoption of a constitution for themselves . This settlement of 1696 was the first thoroughly democratic one which the province had ever enjoyed . It abolished the almost close borough system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originate bills ; and , in short , for the first time , carried out the doctrine which Penn had announced in his promises to the colonists , but had never acted upon " that any government is free to the people where the laws rule , and the people are a party to those laws . " This constitution the Proprietary would never assent to , sanction , or recognize ; and yet it was the only one which met the wants of the colony . From the time of its adoption to that of its destruction by Penn , it worked efficiently and harmoniously ; and , in the words of the historian of Pennsylvania , " under it the people were content , and calmly and industriously applied themselves to the improvement of the country ; and their best eulogium is the paucity of material for history , which their annals , for several years , afford . " This state of things was too good to last . Penn arrived out in 1699 , and the troubles at once re-commenced . When the government of the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed to the post of governor , one of Penn 's first acts was to write to that officer , warning him that the charter of the province had neither been attacked nor recalled , and cautioning him that he tread carefully . At that time it was evidently the Proprietary 's interest to deny the abrogation of the charter ; but immediately he was reinstated in the government , his whole convictions were changed . Markham , during his governorship , prior to Penn 's arrival , had deliberately assumed , as his theory of government , that the royal intervention had destroyed the charter , and that on the Proprietary 's restoration he took the province , subject only to his own will , precisely as the king had held it . On this doctrine Markham acted ; and on Penn 's arrival , he quietly carried on the government on the same principle , though in direct contravention of his own doctrine , avowed in his letter to Fletcher . Acting only by his own will , and reflising to recognize the constitution of 1696 , Penn summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fancy . The Assembly , then in session , with remarkable calmness and skill , at once met and rebuked his pretensions . As the representatives of the people , they would not allow such an act of arbitrary power to take place , and , at the same time , with rare temper and consideration , they did not wish to stand in the way of necessary governmont , or to produce confusion ; they therefore adopted a course which , while it skillfully preserved their constitutional liberties , did not interfere // with the action of the Proprietary , and , at the same time , obtained his own confession of his . improper attempt at arbitrary government . At their urgent representation and remonstrance , and to prevent his recent acts being drawn into a precedent , he ordered that it should be entered on the minutes of the then Council and Assembly : that the change in the method of summoning them , and in their qualifications , was made by the consent of those bodies , saving to himself only the right to prescribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should serve . On this minute , the result of no small parliamentary ability , it may be observed , that by assenting to it , to prevent his acts being drawn into a precedent , the Proprietary impliedly abandoned his claim , to make such changes of his own will ; and also , that by only expressly saving the right to prescribe the term of the Council , he , *according to all rules of construction , gave up all other rights over the matter ; yet within the very same year , and also in 1701 , he assumed and exercised the right to change the numbers and constitution of the legislature , and its place of meeting. , Such acts are by no means without a parallel . Charles I. did the same thing in regard to the Petition of Rights , and James 11. in regard to the dispensing power ; and we shall presently see that Penn and his master were fully agreed on that subject . The last constitution , or frame of government , with which Penn had to do , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised the colonists , that if the then existing frame of government was surrendered to him , they " should have a better one . " Willing to trust and oblige him , even in this , the desired surrender was made . When once the charter was in his hands , Penn was in no hurry to grant a new one . For fifteen months his solemn promise was disregarded ; and it was only when , as Franklin says , he had one foot on ship-board for his final departure , that , being unwilling to give his deputies the same unbounded powers of misgovernment which he exercised himself the charter of 1701 was granted . The provisions of this it is needless to state , except where they were the subject of controversy ; and where that was the case , we will presently enumerate them . Having thus traced the *onstitutional history of Pennsylvania , from its foundation to the last grant of the Proprietary , we will now advert , for a little space , and in a very disconnected manner , to some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's continual absence we make but little complaint . It is very true , that during these absences , from the delays incident to his being on the other side of the ocean , and from the bad character for their place which most of his deputies possessed , misrule reached its highest point . Governmental aggression and popular turbulence raged almost unchecked , with the solitary exception of the golden age under the constitution of 1696 . Neither does the Proprietary 's conduct compare at all advantageously with that of his neighbors , the Calverts , who were unfailing in constant attention and devotion to Maryland affairs and interests . But as the little experience which the colonists possessed of Penn 's direct rule , gave them little reason to expect much happiness or improvement from it , and as his presence was always the signal for new troubles , his absence was probably no great loss . In 1685 , while they were yet ignorant of the full extent of the Proprietary 's Machiavellian doctrines and theory of government , the colonists urgently pressed his return to the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar and stable , may be provided for , with a barge and yacht , or sloop for the service of the governor or government , I may try to get hence . " For a colony not yet four years old , and whose people had , till quite recently , been living in caves of the earth , these demands were somewhat magnificent ; and it is not to be wondered , that a man with such ideas of personal comfort should have unhesitatingly given as an excuse for not waiting upon the Secretary of State , the fact of his having , for six weeks , been ill of a surfeit . The constitution of 1696 had recognized a power in the executive to prorogue the Assembly ; but in the charter of 1701 this clause was omitted altogether , and a provision inserted , empowering that body to sit on its own adjournments . Penn and his deputies , however , positively refused to admit the exercise of this power so expressly granted to the Assembly , and relied on the provision of the constitution of 1696 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , as we have seen , the Proprietary had always refused to recognize that constitution as valid . Penn 's full adherence to this monstrous infringement of the charter is proved both by the commission to Governor Evans and by his correspondence with that officer . Indeed , the whole spirit of the Proprietary 's government was of the same character , as may be well shown by his instructions to the commissioners in 1086-just about the time of Sir Edward Hale 's case , where the king , by means which we related some pages back , obtained a decision in favor of the dispensing power , which these instructions carry to the fullest extent . The commissioners were instructed that , if dissatisfied with the Council , they should appoint others ; that they should abrogate all laws passed since 1684 ; and that they should search curiously for infractions of the charter by the Council or Assembly . The first of these instructions was in direct violation of the act of settlement of 1683 then in force , and which made the Council elective by the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than that of dispensing with penal statutes , as claimed by the king ; and the third was evidently of the same family with the quo warrantos of Charles IL. , coming with very ill-grace from one whose whole course was an infraction of the charter , and in a document which was one itself . The immense strength possessed by the home government by means of its influence over the courts-well exemplified by the decision on the dispensing power-was not lost on Penn . No bill for the ' permanent establishment of the colonial judiciary could ever obtain his assent or that of his deputies ; and whenever pressed on the subject , the uniform . answer was , a reference to the sixth section of the royal charter , by which charter we have seen the Proprietary denied himself to be bound whenever it suited his interest to do so . The section , in question , after reciting that sudden accidents might happen which would render the enactment of laws necessary , before the freeholders of so large a country , or their delegates , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves or their magistrates , to make fit and wholesome ordinances for the occasion . Under this section the Proprietary government claimed the right to regulate and establish the judiciary without the intervention of the Council or Assembly , notwithstanding these bodies over and over again met and proposed laws on the subject , which , as is perfectly evident , destroyed all claim such as that set up by the government under this section of the charter . // Penn 's effort throughout his connection with Pennsylvania was to blend the different characters of Proprietary and governor in such a manner that the one might help the other , and that whatever he could not constitutionally do as the civil ruler , he might claim as a right belonging to the owner of the soil . But it is very certain , that when a deputy was appointed he receive*d all the powers of a civil governor , was the civil governor alone , and had nothing to do with the proprietary rights , whatever they Were . The two characters were then separated , and , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely in the hands of the deputy , and with it Penn could properly have nothing to do . This state of things , however , did not suit the Proprietary , He was determined to hold over the laws a negative in addition to that of the governor ; and , though attending to none of his duties toward the province , intended that the colonists should still feel that , whenever it pleased him , he would exercise every privilege which struck his fancy . To effect his end , he first tried dissimulation and round-about means ; afterwards , when these were made manifest , usurped the power with a strong hand . The Council , as a secret and seldom changing body , was the first instrument adopted . In the Council , James Logan ruled without a rival . Of Logan 's talents and ability there can be no dotibt ; of his unscrupulousness there is a little question . In character somewhat like that arch-apostate , the great and bad Earl of Strafford , he cared little what means he adopted , so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear a man like this , and Logan , as was natural , became the mouth-piece and agent of Penn . We shall say nothing now of the impropriety of retaining Logan in the Council , or the greater indecency of appointing him governor-as was afterwards done-when there were , as there still are , thirteen articles of impeachment for malversation unanswered on record against him . Instructions were forwarded to Governor Gookin forbidding him to pass any law without the consent of the Council . These instructions Gookin , perhaps unintentionally , managed to make the Assembly aware of , and an immediate and powerful protest was the result . Gordon speaks of these instructions as they deserve . His language is as follows :  --  " This interdiction giving birth to a power foreign to the constitution , was highly offensive to the assembly . The office of the council was to aid , not to rule , to serve , not to command the governor . He was the representative of the Proprietary , vested with all his political power , and constitutionally subject to no other control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his compact with the people . In this character they knew how to approach him ; but if he were subject to the will of a secret and irresponsible cabal , they were uncertain to whom their grievances might be effectually addressed , or what interests they were to propitiate . Deprived of his freedom of will , he was no longer answerable for his actions ; his dignity must vanish , and himself sink into pity or contempt . Besides these constitutional objections , the assembly felt there were others of a personal nature . Logan , devoted to the Proprietary , to whose interests he was at all times ready to postpone those of the province , was predominant in the council ; and , in terms as plain as their indignation was strong , the House ascribed to him all the past dissensions of the government . " The method of employing the Council having failed , Penn boldly inserted in Governor Evans ' commission , a clause expressly reserving to himself a final assent to all bills , after they were passed into laws by the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked of the Council whether such a saving clause was valid , and the latter body , with Penn 's own son at its head , could not but answer that the clause was good for nothing . Still the Proprietary was not to be foiled , and subsequently the governors were obliged to give him their private bonds for several thousand pounds , conditioned on their obedience in this unconstitutional reservation . There are yet two other matters which greatly influenced the relations between Penn and the colonists , and which we desire to consider now . Unfortunately , they are the most complex and difficult of any that arose , and the length to which this article has grown , forbids our considering them in detail . We refer to the " Land Question " and the Revenue . Intimately connected together , it is impossible to understand the one without the other , and yet the combination only tends to deepen the obscurity which surrounds them . We shall , therefore , simply content ourselves with condensing the remonstrances of the Assembly on these subjects , only premising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Penn under . took the colony as a pecuniary spe*mlation ; he received it as payment for a " bad debt , " and was fully determined to make as much profit out of it as possible . This one consideration explains much of his conduct , other . wise without apparent motive , and no other one will do so . The offices of property , and of the surveyor-general , were closed , and lands solds by Penn directly in England ; all the proceeds of which , he appropriated to himself . Instead of only reserving his tenth of the lands , according to the original conditions , he held or seized much more . Under pretence of passing an act for confirming and securing lands , new surveys were ordered , the expenses of which , and the consequent new deeds , not to speak of the vexatious delays and procrastinations of the officers , were equal to , and sometimes greater than the original cost of the lands . Even then , not content with receiving a double payment for the land , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? * , 0O0 , and an impost or excise , on account , he said , of his great expenses for the province ; whereupon the Assembly , in order effectually to put an end to this pretence , desired him to consider better-we quote their very words ,  --  what to place to the account of the province , and not to forget that no part of his pretended charges was expended in paying some of those who acted under him , in the administration of the colony . Before his last departure for England , and after the re-surveys just spoken of he signed a new charter of property , and promised , under his hand , that he would confirm it ; yet , within six months therefrom , and after reaping all the benefits given in exchange for this confirmation , he forbade his deputy to allow it to pass the seals . At the same time also , he told the colonists that , " for a consideration , " in addition to the taxes and imposts voted to him , he would act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reasonable people might suppose that this was part of his duty as Proprietary ; but whether it was or not , neither a sense of duty , nor a valuable consideration paid , could hold him to his bargain , and the business was shamefully neglected . When the surveyor 's office was open , Penn refused his assent to any bill to regulate that officer 's fees , or to prevent the systematic extortion practiced therein ; and the commissioners of property made the greatest possible difficulty and delay in making up the deficiencies of surveys , // though Penn had been paid for the full quantity called for by his deeds . Indeed , so great was this trouble and expense , that it was " better for one to forego his right , than td ' wait on or attend the com ; missioners about it " When the quit-rents were reserved , it was much against the wish of the colonists , and Penn only obtained them by saying , that such a payment would prevent the imposition of any other taxes ; yet he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free grants of land in Philadelphia , but he insisted on , and obtained , other taxes and revenues . After selling certain lots in Philadelphia , on the Delaware , as water front lots , he sold others between them and the river , thus defrauding the first purchasers of an advantage they had paid an increased price for . Although he promised the settlers of Philadelphia a convenient common for pasturage , nothing of the kind was ever set out ; and , finally , the very lots sold by Penn , though he had received full price therefor , were never cleared by him from the claims of the Swedish settlers , and often had to be re-purchased from them . When all these things are considered , taken as they are from official records and papers ; and when it is remembered that every penny arising from the sales of lands , from the quit-rents , and from the various imposts , excises , and taxes , either went into Penn 's own pocket , or to the support of the government , the " immense debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonists owed him , dwindles down to a very small amount indeed . The position of Pennsylvania , under Penn , was well represented ninety-eight years ago , when it was described as a colony " in point of establishment , one of the last upon the British list , and in point of rank , one of the most subordinate , being not only subject , in common with the rest , to the crown , but also to the claims of a Proprietary , who thought he did them honor enough in governing them by deputy ; consequently so much further removed from the royal eye , and so much the more exposed to the pressure of self-interested instructiOns . " From the same source we would cite , in conclusion , the following summary of Pennsylvania colonial history , and the portrait of her Proprietary " A. father of his family , the latter united by interest and affection , the former to be revered for the wisdom of his institutions and the indulgent use of his authority , was the form it was first presented in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed to convert free tenants into abject vassals , and to reap what he did not sow , countenanced and abetted by a few desperate and designing dependants , on the one side ; and on the other , all who have sense enough to know their rights and spirit to defend them , combined as one man against the said landlord and his encroachments , is the form it has since assumed .
