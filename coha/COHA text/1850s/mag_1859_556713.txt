txt ART . VIII . - L ' */e of fames Sullivan : with Selections from his Writings . By THOMAS C. AMORY . Boston : Phillips , Sampson , &amp; Co. 1859. 2 vols. 8vo. pp. 414 , 424 . THERE 15 one original feature in the working out of the plan of the great Washington Monument , at our federal capital , which is so appropriate and symbolic in itself , as to go far towards reconciling us to a faultiness of taste in the whole design . We refer to that feature , so generally approved , of building into the walls , on the inner surface , blocks of every variety of stone , gathered from all quarters , and bearing appropriate inscriptions designating their grateful donors . There is a meaning in this ; or rather it admits of a significance which we shall venture to assign to it . Beneath the deep foundations of the structure is the stone inscribed with the name of Washington . The external walls are uniform and homogeneous in their material . But as the visitor ascends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be invited and detained by a series of mural tablets , bass-reliefs , and inscriptions , on stones of various shape and size , of granite , slate , or marble . These are all free contributions to the structure , and are nominally dedicated as tributes to the great and good man whom the pillared shaft commemorates . Those inscribed stones bear various devices and legendf* They are contributed by sovereign States , by municipal , mercantile , charitable , professional , artistic , and mechanical corporations and associations , and by patriotic individuals . If wrought in with skill and good taste , they will form one of the most appropriate , perhaps the most striking , of all the features of that stupendous monument . Anything like symmetry in the arrangement of those inner blocks is out of the question . A forced attempt at symmetry would vitiate the very purpose aimed at in them , and turn the matter to a merely finical result . Now just what those inscribed stones are to the Washington Monument , the biographies of our Revolutionary patriots are to our organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have said , is uniform and homogeneous . So must be the plan and method and the working outofour national history , if we ever have a writer equal to the whole theme . But the greater variety there is in the contributions to its internal composition , in the lives and reported services of the able and faithful men who helped to plan and secure the whole fabric , the better will posterity understand , and the more thankfully xviii it appreciate , the noble work . Such a contribution Mr. Amory has made to one of the most valuable departments of our national history , in his biography of his grandfather , Governor Sullivan of Massachusetts . The subject of it eminently deserved this grateful memorial , and the author of the volumes in our hands has discharged his office with unexceptionable good taste , with the utmost fidelity in research , with appreciation , candor , intelligence , and rare impartiality . He has had a most interesting story to tell , and he has wisely allowed the whole interest of his pages to be sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own imagination , or exaggerating any incident which he relates . No partisan feeling seems to have had the slightest // influence with him , though his narrative leads him through the times of the most exciting and embittered party strife of Vhich the record enters into our annals . The pride of kindred might be justified in a far more obtrusive display of itself than his modest pen and his chastened style allow . It is evident that the industry and toil which Mr. Amory has spent upon this excellent work would have sufficed for the preliminary labor requisite for the composition of a history of the chief events and deeds which mark the period embraced in his biography . He has turned his temptation to diffuseness into a concentration of the substance of much biographical , political , and historical material in well-wrought paragraphs and comprehensive chapters . Here , then , we have another inscribed block to be wrought into our national monument . A block of firm-set texture , and of the substantial quality of our native granite , would be typical of the character and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages . The best office which we can perform at once for the book and for our own readers , is to follow the lead of the author , and to report in a condensed and summary way the main points of the story which he has furnished for our gratified perusal . One element of his plan is to allow others to speak to us in his place , where he thinks an extract from a document , carrying with it the life and passion of its own time , will convey to us better than reports or comments of his own an intelligible view of what he seeks to communicate . He gives us especially liberal selections from the writings of Governor Sullivan , and intimates a purpose to follow the present volumes with a more extended compilation . It is remarkable , that , with the exception of a Life of Governor Gerry , this should be the first contribution , in anything more than the most unpretending and inadequate form , to the biography of the post-Revolutionary Governors of Massachusetts . We will now pass rapidly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family at a date when the characteristic 0 ' formed a part of the name , and that capital vowel , with the aspirate following , unmistakably localizes the portion of the human race concerning whose fortunes he writes . The O'Sullivans have a distinguished fame // in Irish history as far back as the era in which fabulous legends give place to veritable records . They constituted a large and powerful sept , ruled by a succession of independent chieftains , mighty and rich in castles and lands . The sept retained its wild independence down to the time of Elizabeth , and had joined the famous Catholic League of Munster , at the close of the sixteenth century . English conquest sweeping over the land of course reduced the O'Sullivans to subjection , except so far as an intenser hostility of spirit was engendered in Irish hearts by the loss of independence , and by disabilities attending a constancy of adherence to the Roman Catholic faith . Mr. Amory relates with a vigorous pen the embittering details of the hatred and strife incident to the subjugation of Ireland by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons which might justify a survival in the feelings of his kindred , even to this day , of an inherited animosity . But he nobly discharges his own breast of all such feelings , and is careful to follow his exciting narrative with some calm words of wise and forbearing Christian moderation . A speck of romance connects itself with the transition of the family history from the Green Isle to the forests of Northern New England . The father of Governor James Sullivan was John O'Sullivan , born in Limerick , Ireland , in 1692 . He might have lived to win his share of renown , and to exhibit some of the prowess of his ancestors in his native land , had it not been for a trial of the affections which drew out alike the strength of his more tender passions and the obstinate resolution of his will . But it was of precisely such stock as his , and such children as he would train up , that the colonies of England on this side of the water were soon to have need , and whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were destined to have a field and an opportunity for settlement here . John O'Sullivan had set his affections upon a young lady whom his high-spirited mother did not regard as his equal in blood and social rank , and whom she therefore positively forbade him to marry . He vowed that , if thus opposed in the dearest wish of his heart , he would go where his mother should never hear of him or from him again . He made good his threat , and it was literally // fulfilled in the very terms in which he defined it . He sailed from Limerick in 1723 , as it would appear , penniless . Whatever the destination of the vessel , or his own plans , it was driven , by stress of weather , into York , Maine , where he entered into an agreement to earn with his hands or wits the means of paying the master for his passage . He had as a fellow-passenger a forlorn little orphan girl , Margery Brown by name , aged nine years , whose fortunes were thenceforward to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having received at home a good classical education , without any training to manual labor , the task of meeting his obligations and supporting himself by the work of his hands was so irksome , that he naturally cast about for some relief which would throw the burden upon his mind . He therefore applied to the famous Father Moody of York , for employment in teaching , and for a loan wherewith to discharge his debt . He obtained the loan , from which , besides paying his due to the captain of the vessel , he bought off the indentures of the aforesaid Margery , of whose origin and desolate lot there is no explanation . Besides this , even , he took the child under his charge , and brought her up as his own , while he at once opened two schools , one for boys and one for girls , kept , after the intermittent fashion and necessity of the time and region , only for a part of the year . As little Margery grew up , she developed both attractions and a temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter of which she as naturally retained , in her advancing years . A passing stranger , struck with her girlish beauty as she was drawing water at the well , instantly pressed his suit upon her . Being dressed in better apparel , and appearing to greater advantage than the young men whom the maiden was accustomed to see , she referred him to her father , whom the suitor at once importuned with his first warmth of passion . The Irish exile was not pleased with the aspect of the matter , and dismissed the youth with a refusal . The affair , however , seems to have opened his awn eyes , and perhaps those of the maiden , to the possibility of a new disposition of their household relations , and she soon became his wife . Though of an uncultivated mind and taste , she proved to be a most energetic woman , // faithfully supervising the economical interests of her husband , and discharging her maternal duties in a way to secure the love and respect of her children . Her husband soon bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till his death , in 1796 , at which time he had entered upon the hundred and fifth year of his life , sixty years of which he had spent on this soil of his purchase . He did not love farm-toil , and his wife relieved him of much of the labor of its supervision , while he devoted himself to more congenial tasks . He was a sort of " squire " for his town and the neighborhood , arbitrating in strifes , drawing legal papers , and teaching the young of several generations the needful humanities , while to the most capable pupils , including his own children , he was fully able to impart the rudiments of even a likeral education . Dr. Eliot , in his Biographical Dictionary , says that iUiaster Sullivan , as he was familiarly called , spoke fluently both French and Latin , and wrote them correctly , after he had completed his century of years . He was temperate to abstinence . He retained his strength and faculties to the very last , cutting wood , doing farm-work , and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit his son . This old patriarch , the subduer of wild woods and the humanizer of rugged lives , appears to have isolated himself as to the religious sympathy of his neighbors , and so it has been conjectured that he retained in private affection the favorite creed and faith of his Irish ancestry . But a pleasant and impressive picture of him is preserved in the memory of an aged woman , who describes the old man as she saw him on a visit to his cottage , with his long dark robe , a small cap crowning his white locks as they flowed over his shoulders , the appearance of fine health on an attractive face , and his spare frame bowed over his Bible . A copy of Hervey 's Meditations among the Tombs - not one of the most cheerful even of serious companions - was lying upon the table near him . His widow died in 1801 , at the age of eighty-seven . The remains of the venerable couple repose within the limits of their Berwick farm . From them sprang , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and in service durino* our Revolutionary strife , and two of whom were efficient builders of our national // fabric . James , the fourth son , the subject of the present memoir , was born at Berwick , April 22 , 1744 . His home was on freshly cleared soil , flanked by wild forests , the last scenes of Indian border strife . The whole region , with its frontier experiences , was admirably suited to call out the energies of self-dependence , arid the inborn faculties to which alone manhood must owe subsistence , or advance in means and honors . His father intended that James , like his older brother John , the General in the war of the Revolution , should be trained to military life . But accident withstood the purpose . We find him first engaged in his youth in the hardy toil of a lumberman , shooting down timber through a tributary of the Piscataqua . While he was stretched on the grass one summer day for sleep , he was horror-strickeu on awaking to see a rattlesnake watching him and ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sank from fright was believed to have saved him from the fangs of the reptile , - death or seeming death being supposed to secure immunity from its assaults . But the fearful shock caused to his nervous system by the dread apprehension is regarded as the primary cause of those attacks of epilepsy to which he was subject through the rest of his life , which seized upon him at home and abroad , in court and at church , and made him the pitiable spectacle of many painful scenes . Another calamity in his youth visited upon him life-long consequences . While he was felling a tree , one of his legs was caught by a bent branch , and received a compound fracture , which , aggravated by unskilful surgery , confined him at home for two years , and made him lame ever after . During this confinement he applied himself to faithful study , learning the Latin grammar , and whatever he could procure in that language , with all other available knowledge ; and so he laid the foundation for a solid literary culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to him for the lack of a college course , and indeed , through his subsequent professional career , advanced him far beyond many of his contemporaries , who had enjoyed the best education of the times . His brother John , having made trial of the sea , devoted himself to the study of the law ; and , meeting with success , established himself at Durham , New Hampshire , where James became his 38* // pupil in 1764 . In that relation the two brothers were fitted for the various services which they afterwards performed for their country , while the honors of each culminated in their reaching respectively the chief magistracy of New Hampshire and of Massachusetts . A curious , but by no means a singular , professional experience attended the settlement of John Sullivan at Durham . Lawyers in that time and neighborhood were regarded as a pestilent and mischief-making set of men , whose livelihood depended upon the promotion of strifes and differences among their neighbors . The neighbors of the new-coiner to Durham manifested in no dubious way their displeasure at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He disregarding the hint , a violent collision , with insults and blows , was the natural consequence . After the issue had been protracted , it was concluded to settle it by the result of a championship with the fists of one on either side . James Sullivan was the champion on the side of Law , in both senses of the word , and he was victorious . Amicable relations were very soon established , and there was work preparing for lawyers , of a sort to make them quite helpful to their neighbors . The agitations and discussions roused by the Stamp Act were just then engaging the zeal of the people of New England . James Sullivan , who soon found a wife in Hetty Odiorne , hard by his brother 's home , entered upon his professional studies just at the opportune time for hastening all his faculties to their faithful and profitable development . After having resided for a short period at Georgetown , a place which comprehended in its title an island and a section of the mainland at the mouth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here he prospered in his profession , and advanced his worldly interests , and here he would in all probability have passed his days , had it not been for the exciting scenes that invited him nearer to the centre of the turmoil . It was while riding the circuit for professional practice , and following up the business of the courts over long country roads , and in the close intercourse of the hospitalities of the public inns and private homes of those days , that he made the intimate acquaintance of many men of ability , destined to act conspicuous parts in the coming contest . Lowell , Sewall , Otis , and Adams // shared with him the rough adventures of travel , and the often rougher contests of forensic practice , all happily soothed by the familiar pleasantries of rural festivity . These home-bred lawyers were a class of men with whom more than with any other class rested the prospects and fortunes of the Colonies , when threatening issues were raised with the mother country . They had stronger temptations than any other class to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolutionary spirit . They had the most at risk in the strife , and would be the severest sufferers in case of an unsuccessful revolt . In the year 1774 , the last year of grace allowed to the vacillating for taking a decided stand , and the first year of the real contest as it presented the issue in its broadest bearings , James Sullivan was sent as representative from Biddeford to the General Court then meeting at Salem , just as the Boston Port Bill was to take effect . He and his brother John were concerned in the first overt act of the Revolution , which was the seizure , in December , 1774 , of Fort William and Mary , in Portsmouth harbor . The powder which was obtained in this capture , after having been concealed for a time under the pulpit of the meeting-house in Durham , was carried to Cambridge by John Sullivan in the following May , and used by the American soldiers in the battle of Bunker Hill . It will at some future time engage the zeal of some curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , to inquire for what proportion of all the military equipments , weapons , ammunition , clothing , small stores , and commissary 's goods used by our troops , we drew upon our opponents . The rich prizes brought in by our privateers , together with several successful raids upon the goods of the enemy , will be found to have furnished no small part of the camp furniture of the patriot army . James Sullivan , having thus entered upon political life at a crisis which committed every able man to serve in some capacity through the whole of the campaign about to open , was thenceforward put to service in a long succession of exacting and responsible trusts . On occasional visits to his home , he employed himself in stirring up , instructing , and nerving the spirit of the largest patriotism , on which alone the cause of his // countrymen could rest in the arduous and doubtful struggle yet before them . They might be called to bear disaster and ruin , in any form which it might please their enemies to inflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severest burdens of taxation , self-denial , and military rule imposed by their own leaders . The most remarkable and characteristic feature of our Revolutionary struggle was , that it was conducted through means afforded by a most methodical and systematic adherence to all the forms of civil legislation and administration , practised amid the actual wreck of all established government . There was really no legal sanction for giving effect to the last will of a dying testator , or to the military commission of the leader of all our armies . The voluntary system reigned supreme . James Sullivan was one of the most laborious and hardest-worked members of both Provincial Congresses , and afterwards of the same body when reorganized , according to the terms of the Charter of 1692 , as the Provincial Assembly . He served on more than one hundred committees ; he drafted important documents , initiated and matured measures of offence , of defence , and of wise provision for all manner of contingencies ; he was commissioner of the expedition to Ticonderoga , in the affair with Arnold ; he acted prominently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed the act of the Assembly authorizing the fitting out of armed vessels , the beginning of our navy , and was appointed one of the three Admiralty Judges . While the American army , under Washington , was investing the foe in Boston , his brother John Sullivan was doing good service as a brigadier-general , and was enjoying the success of his late law pupil in the multiplied employments of military legislation . On the evacuation of Boston , James Sullivan , not yet thirty-two years old , and still serving in the Assembly , was made a Judge of the newly reorganized Superior ( afterward Supreme ) Court . His brother Eben , as a patriot soldier , was adding to the laurels of the family in one direction , while his other brother , Captain Daniel Sullivan , was equally busy in another , till he was numbered among the victims of the Jersey prison-ship , in 1782 . To be nearer to the scene of his professional duties , James Sullivan removed to Groton , in this State , in 1778 , though // he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a matter of course , he was a member of the Convention for framing our first State Constitution . The claims of a growing family , and the insufficiency of his salary as a Judge of the Supreme Court , compelled him to resign that office , and , removing to Boston , he entered upon the fullest and most lucrative practice of the legal profession . He served for a short time in the Continental Congress . One of the most laborious and vexations of his many public trusts was that which he discharged as com ssioner on the public and private claims to lands west of the Hudson River . These claims were perplexed and embarrassed by the old Charter grants , by unextinguished Indian rights , by inconsistent Indian deeds and stipulations , by rival pretensions to jurisdiction , and by the sturdy resolution of actual occupants . When they became complicated also by relations brought about between the Colonies through the Confederation , and involved in litigation before the different courts , and a fierce collision of individual interests , it may well be inferred that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and that even such decisions as they might reach would provoke many personal hostilities , the effects of which would outlast their occasions . It was in the discharge of this trust that Judge Sullivan found a use for all the practical knowledge which he had already acquired about Land Titles , and was led to that thorough and systematic examination of the whole complicated subject , the results of which appear in his treatise under that name . His History of the Province of Maine is a creditable monument to his research , his general intelligence , and his skill as a writer of good , plain English . The circumstances of the times brought before our courts many cases arising out of the previously existing corn plications of the affairs of church and state . Ecclesiastical litigation is one of the most annoying professional employments of a jurist . In those days no one could take part in it to any good purpose , unless he had a considerable amount of theological knowledge , and a strong personal sympathy on one side or the other , committing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new-born spirit of religious freedom , with all its risks . Judge Sullivan was a consistent church-member , heartily interested in the public and private offices of religion , a strict observer of its ordinances in the public assembly and in the forms of domestic devotion , He had entered in his early years into covenant relations with a Calvinistic Congregational church in Maine , but had gradually yielded to the liberalizing influences which had modified the faith of so many of his private and professional associates . In Boston he became a member of the Brattle Street Church , and worshipped there in a communion which drew together the prominent leaders of the two political parties , and the successive rival candidates for the Governorship of Massachusetts . Under these circumstances he was often employed in cases of ecclesiastical litigation , and always espoused the side of freedom , pleading effectively for the entire dissociation of things spiritual and civil in the province of legislation . It was well for an advocate on that side , that he was known to be a friend and a pledged disciple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , with no faith of their own , assumed the right of supervising the faith of others . The newly established government of Massachusetts was subjected to a sore trial of its strength and popularity in the Rebellion of 1786 . There were sharp animosities and fierce struggles , lingering feuds , and grievous burdens of taxation , with exhausted public and private exchequers , all concentrating the darkest clouds in the near , as well as in the distant horizon . The threatening state of affairs seemed to call for that mature wisdom which could follow only from the full trial of an experiment then but in its opening stage . In those who were relied upon to exercise the controlling influence of mental or official authority under such a hazardous state of things , the most needful qualities were a resolute and fearless support of the principles then on trial , and a spirit of forbearance ever ready to practise the utmost tolerance towards disaffected , ignorant , and impulsive men , whose purpose was in the main honest . Judge Sullivan appears to have used his clear-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those threatening times . Like // most of the men in office at that period , he was a constant writer in the gazettes , where , under various signatures , generally not . amounting to a disguise , he forcibly expressed his own views , and combated those of others , standing ready to meet , and sometimes to exchange , the asperities of language incident to such a mode of discussing embittered lssues . If ever any skilful writer among us shall think it worth his while to revive and rehearse a full presentment of the matters then discussed in the newspapers under sundry classical and patriotic noms de plume , he will doubtless find in them , or elaborate from them , illustrations of some of the profoundest truths of the largest human science , while he traces through them the inchoate principles of the best assured economical and political maxims of our day . Patriotism certainly did not lisp , as other infant things do . It spoke strongly in well-formed periods , and often showed much familiarity with the Classical Dictionary . Mr. Sullivan was next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council , and Attorney-General of the State ; neither of which offices was inconsistent with his continuance in private practice . In the last of these offices his duties as public prosecutor were very onerous , and were discharged with a fidelity that drew encomiums from men most passionately enlisted against him in the strife of party . The famous Selfridge case , occurring at a time of the intensest acrimony in State and national politics , called him to one of the severest trials of forensic ability against the most eminent talent enlisted on the other side . The death of his wife was followed by a second marriage , which made him the brother-in-law of Governor Langdon of New Hampshire . Home was rendered pleasant to him by its natural cares , by the refuge which it afforded from the heats of public life , and by the exercise of a large hospitality . Not the least among his various services were those which he performed in the discharge of numerous municipal trusts in the town of Boston before it received its city charter . These services were exacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention and of a rivalry of interests as belonged to the antagonism of partisans on the broader fields // of politics . Judge Sullivan declined to be a candidate for the Convention to form our national Constitution ; but he accepted the agency for our government in the matter of the boundary line , to be decided with reference to the stream which was properly signified by the St. Croix River , a provided for in the treaty with Great Britain . This busy man found time to serve all the various associations then formed in Boston in the interests of science , literature , history , charity , and internal improvements . He was one of the original Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ; first President of the Massachusetts Historical Society ; first Vice-President of the Congregational Charitable Society ; and a member of the Humane Society , and of the Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Indians and others in North America . He was also one of the projectors and a most efficient agent for insuring the success of the Middlesex Canal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - enterprises at that time of a most formidable character , however moderate and practicable they may appear now , when dwarfed by modern undertakings . After having stood , for several years , as the Republican candidate for the office of Governor of Massachusetts , he was finally chosen in 1807 , and again in 1808 , and died while filling the chair , December 10 , 1808 , aged sixty-four years . Interspersed over the pages of the second volume of this work are very valuable and instructive materials for tracing the history of the first party issues and strifes which divided , not only the citizens of Massachusetts , but almost equally the people of the republic , from the hour of the formation and adoption of the Federal Constitution . It would hardly seem possible that darker times , or fiercer struggles , or more threatening risks , should ever present themselves on this continent , than those through which Mr. Amory leads us in his narrative . His summary relations , though concise , are luminous , and perfectly adequate to their purpose . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed in a wise and suggestive way to indicate to his readers , that the same candor which is so excellent a help to the right reading // 457 of the history of the past , is the best security for good temper and honesty amid the exciting experiences of the present time . Many of his readers will doubtless ask on which side are his own convictions and sympathies in the remnants of the old strifes , or in the fresh agitations of our day , to which he necessarily makes reference . But if they find an answer which commits him to a fealty to any party except that which includes men of moderation , they will have found something which has escaped our notice . Besides the interesting biographical narrative contained in these volumes , we value them highly for the information and the judicious hints which they contain in reference to the origin , the grounds , the manifestations , and the merits of the first divisions and alienations of opinion among those honest men , who , from having been united heart and soul in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot contention about the true interests of their country . The partisanship of those times was unmistakably acrimonious , often blind and bitterly unjust . We thank every writer of our own day who reviews those ancient feuds so as to present to us their merits in a passionless and faithful narrative , and so as to leave us at liberty to believe - ay , more , so as to compel us to believe - that the fiercest champions in those party strifes were honest men , true patriots , and not intentionally Babel workmen . Certainly , order , a noble , finished fabric , and not confusion , is the result of their work , and that result is a composite structure showing how the most various materials contribute to harmony , in use at least , if not in design . IDr . Randall , in his Life of Jefferson , so elaborately and conscientiously vrought out , has removed the scales of a miserable prejudice from the eyes and minds of thousands of readers in New England , who had inherited the notion that this wise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especial hater and foe of his own country . Mr. Amory leads us over a portion of the same most rich and fruitful field which is so admirably worked by Dr. Randall . He makes the biography of his grandfather the thread on which he strings a great many lessons of sound wisdom for all times . There is just that calm and healthful moderation in his remarks upon these party strifes , which // wonid indicate , that , after having thoroughly reviewed them with an intelligent mind , the writer had no ambition , no interest , no feeling even of his own , beyond that of a private and well-disposed citizen of the republic . He does not even attempt to sum up in a general concentration of balanced and adjusted estimates the claims which the subject of his volumes has upon the gratitude or the respect of posterity . Still less does he assume the judicial office of pronouncing upon the complexion of his life and the composition of his character . He leaves his readers to decide how Governor Sullivan shall stand before them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows of his own times . Those shadows were deep , and they are deep to us as we look back into them , except as they are illumined by the candor which knowledge and charity*will impart to all who try to under-* stand their conflicts . The best use of such works as this before us is , that they revive in the most intelligible and instructive way the story of times which have entailed upon us some of their own strifes , and have confused our judgment of men and things which it is very desirable for us to understand and estimate rightly . We might naturally have supposed that the formation of a Constitution for our federal government would have been so deliberately entered upon and pursued to its great results , as to leave no material for any extended opposition to the details which it involved ; and that its adoption would have been followed by the inauguration of a feeling of universal good-fellowship over the country . But that fancy is strangely mocked by any page of the records of those times , whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the doings of a town-meeting in the obscurest village of the land . There were questions of infinite moment opened for agitation . The experiments that were to be put on trial were wholly beyond the scope of all the precedents which the history of the world could furnish . Some of the ominous forebodings and dismal apprehensions connected with the earliest party discords in our political annals appear to us as the merest bugbears ; we are tempted to laughter as we read of them ; we wonder that people with honest consciences could have been wrought up // to such alarm , to such passion , about them . The fear that Washington would set up a monarchy ; that a privileged class would bring in orders of nobility ; that returning loyalists were secret agents of a prince of the blood commissioned to subject us again to royal rule ; - these and some other apprehensions , which made our grandfat*hers more afraid of the daylight around them than their grandfathers had been of the Indians prowling about their cabins at midnight , seem to us too unreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality answering to each one of those apprehensions . There was a risk of centralization , and of an entail of offices and privileges in our national government . The returning loyalists , seeking to reclaim their alienated estates , revived many dangerous contentions . The treaty with England left some of the most fruitful matters of subsequent strife still open , and concentrated party interests and common fears upon them . The funding system , and the equalizing of olzrligations among those whose debts were unequal ; the question about the levying of imposts , - whether by State or federal authority ; the question of neutrality and of commercial restrictions ; and , above all , the question of sympathy and alliance with France , before and after her revolution turned to fearful anarchy ; - these were some of the materials for the fires of political and partisan strife , than which no later age of the republic has provided any more combustible . Judge Sullivan stood as the Jeffersonian , or Republican , or Democratic candidate for the chair of state , when the intensity of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of government to which he gave his allegiance were especially obnoxious to his professional associates . His opponents at the bar were generally those who belonged to the antagonistic political party . He allowed his name to stand as the target for the shafts cast at the set of measures then identified with the Republican platform . He was the subject of some slanderous imputations , which seem as we read the account of them to be rather available as a tribute to his integrity , - because , few as they are , they were all that the most venomous hostility could summon against him , while their triviality makes them for the most part matters of indif // ference . Still , as we read the extracts from his writings which his grandson with excellent judgment has spread before us , we sec that he was really no partisan , but an independent man . We find expressions of regret and distrust uttered by him about some of the men whom his party was compelled to carry with it . His allegiance was that of a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and *n a few grounds of decided conviction . We therefore close the volumes with a grateful impression of the man and of his career . His Life , and the inscription which it bears , are a most valuable contribution to our national monument .
