txt ART . YL-PRESIDENT EDWARDS ON CHARITY AND ITS FRUITS . Charity and its Fruits ; or christian love , as manifested in the heart and life . By JONATHAN EDWARDS , sometime pastor of the church at Northampton , Mass. , and President of the College of New Jersey . Edited from the original manuscripts , with an Introduction , by TRYON EDWARDS . New York : Robert Carter &amp; Brothers , 285 Broadway , 1852 . PRESIDENT Edwards , by his last will and testament , said to be recorded in Northampton , * gave all his manuscripts to his wife , Mrs. Sarah Pierrepont Edwards ; and Mrs. Edwards , in her will , as recorded in Philadelphia , says : " My will respecting my late husband 's papers and writings , is , that they shall all be put into the hands of some one of my family , which one shall be agreed upon by my children . " A paper found among the papers of the late Jonathan Edwards , D. D. , President of Union College , dated March 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Edwards then surviving , appoints " our brother , Jonathan Edwards , to take into his possession all of the said manuscripts and papers* and safely keep them , and use them ibr his own good and the advantage of mankind , until by * So it has repeatedly and without contradiction been stated ; and yet we have before us a letter from a careful and accurate friend , dated Northampton , March 18 , 1862 , which states explicitly , that " the will of President Edwards is not recorded there ; " that " there is a record of the inventory of his property , taken at Stock . bridge , ( for at that time Stockbridge belonged to Hampshire county ) but nothing else relating to his estate . " // us ( the major part of us , or the major part of those for the time being then surviving of us , ) required to give them up . " On the decease of the younger President Edwards , the manuscripts and papers thus alluded to , passed into the possession of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were loaned to the Rev. Sereno E. Dwight , D. D. , to enable him to prepare a new edition of the works of President Edwards , and to write the Life of their author . In the year 1847 , Dr. Dwight , having long since completed the work for which the manuscripts were loaned to him , signified his readiness " to deliver them to any person duly authorized to receive them in the name of a majority of the heirs ; " and all the grandchildren of their author , then surviving , ( twenty-one in number , ) united in conveying them , in trust , to the editor of the present work , by whom they were received in the following year . In the inventory of the estate of President Edwards , taken at Stockbridge , Nov. 21 , 1758 , it is stated that he left , of " books , in folio , 38 vols ; in quarto , 34 vols ; in octavo , 99 vols ; in diiodecimo , 130 vols ; of his own works , 25 vols ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vols ; in quarto , 15 vols ; and 1074 sermons in manuscript . " It is doubtful , however , if this inventory included all his hooks ; for a catalogue in his own hand writing seems to indicate his ownership of others , which might perhaps have been in Princeton , and not comprised in the Stockbridge list . Certain it is , that it did not include all his manuscripts ; for we have seen , in the possession of the editor of the work before us , 49 volumes in manuscript , and between eleven and twelve hundred manuscript sermons , some nine hundred of which are written out , more or less fully , and the remainder for the most part skeletons for extempore use . Most of these sermons are dated . Some are without date . About 170 of the skeletons are marked as prepared for , and preached to , the Stockbridge Indians ; and tradition , as well as a letter written at the time , says , they were " delivered with a freedom and pathos of eloquence surpassing that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sermons are in courses : as , for example , on the parable of the Sower ; on the twelfth chapter 9f Hebrews ; on the twenty-first chapter of Revelation ; on the first chapter of the first epistle of Peter , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c . The dates of many seem to indicate that their author took up a book of the Bible , ( Proverbs , for example , ) and preached in order on every verse in it that struck him at the // time as particularly interesting or appropriate for discussion . And all the manuscripts are so closely written , and in so fine a hand-writing , as to render it almost impossible to decipher them , until from repeated and careful examination , ( often with a magnifying glass ) the characters have become familiar . Such is the rich intellectual and moral " placer " in which the editor of the work before us has commenced excavations ; and the work itself is the best testimony to the value of the deposit . The volume consists of a course of sixteen Lectures on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were " first preached , " ( as we are informed in the Introduction ) " by Mr. Edwards in 1738 , in a series of sermons to the people of his charge in Northampton ; " and " after his death were selected for publication by Dr. Hopkins and Dr. Bellamy , and by the latter , were , in part , copied out and prepared for the press , when for some reason he was interrupted in their preparation , so that now , for the first time , they are given to the public . " This was written in November , 1851 ; the work was issued by the Carters , in January , 1852 ; was re-published in London , in the same month , from the proof-sheets sent over from this country ; and the first American edition being exhausted , a second we are informed , is soon to be issued by the original publishers . Turning from these merely introductory matters to the work itself , the first Lecture is occupied in showing that charity , in the broad sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that without it , the most excellent privileges and performances are alike in vain the second , that the grace of charity , or love in the soul , is a more excellent blessing than any of the extraordinary gifts of the spirit : the third , that all that can be done or suffered , can never make up for the want of sincere christian love in the heart : the fourth , that charity " suffereth long , " or disposes us meekly to bear evil , or injuries from others : the fifth , that charity " is kind , " or disposes us freely to do good : the sixth , that charity " envieth not , " or is the opposite of an envious spirit : the seventh , that charity " vaunteth not itself , " or that its spirit is an humble spirit : the eighth , that charWv " seeketh not her own , " or that its spirit is the opposite of selfishness : the ninth , that charity is " not easily provoked , " or that its spirit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenth , that charity " thinketh no evil , " or is the opposite of a censorious spirit : the eleventh , that charity " rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth . " or that all true grace in the heart tends to holy practice in the life : the twelfth , that charity " beareth all things , " or is willing to undergo all sufferings for Christ : the thirteenth , that charity " believeth all things , // hopeth all things , " &amp;c. , or that all the graces of christianity are mutually connected and dependent : the fourteenth , that charity " end ureth all things , " or is a permanent , abiding principle , that can never be overthrown , but will endure forever : thefifteenth , that charity " never faileth , " &amp;c. , or that it is peculiarly that grace or fruit of the spirit , in which the Holy Ghost shall , not only for a season , but everlastingly be communicated to believers : and the sixteenth , that Heaven is a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the source , the objects , the subjects , and the principle of love in heaven , and to the excellent circumstances in which it is there expressed and enjoyed , and the happy effects and fruits of all this to all eternity . Such is a brief outline of the work before us  --  a work on the favorite topic* of its author , and just such a work as might be expected from the childlike simplicity of his tastes , his strength of intellect , his acute and searching discrimination , and the warmth and earnestness of his piety . It is full-full to overflowing , of striking thoughts , and sound and most important instruction . it deals most faithfully with the conscience ; and presses both truth and duty , with the freshness , and point , and power , of " preaching " to the living congregation . The editor , in his introduction , speaks of it as " marked throughout by that strong and clear thought , those broad and comprehensive views of truth , that thorough knowledge of human nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which characterize the writings " of President Edwards , and expresses his belief , that it " will at once take rank with his well known works on the " Will , " the " Affections , " and " Redemption , " and be esteemed as valuable in its practical bearings , as the firstis in its metaphysical , the second in its experimental , and the third in its historical . " And thus far the opinion of our ablest divines has sustained his estimate , and the critics of both the secular and christian press , have , with singular unanimity , confirmed it , and pronounced the work every way worthy the reputation of him who has been called by Chalmers " the ablest of theologians , " and by Robert Hall " the greatest man of the world , " and whom the verdict of christendom has declared to be " unequalled in intellect , unsurpassed in virtue .

Diary oJ President Edwards . // is characterized by a singular transparency and precision , and marked by a calmness , dignity , sweetness and force , which are adapted to the subject and expressive of the man . It is copious , from his fulness of thought ; clear , from the vividness of his conception ; earnest , from his deep sense of the importance of his theme ; and strong , from the native vigor of its source . It is not elastic or sprightly ; for the weight of sentiment clothes it with gravity and seriousness . It is not polished ; for with the high and heavenly topics that occupied his pen , he gave little heed to the graces of rhetoric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not without other mechanical faults ; but let any one attempt to reconstruct and improve his sentences , and it will soon be found that his language , like that of every thinker , is the body to the soul of his thought , and that it is as difficult to change it for the better , as to transpose the muscles and sinews of the human frame without marring its proportion and impairing its strength . If its movement has not the grace of the walking Apollo , it is the quiet , steady , resistless step of the strong man armed . If it has not the music of the gurgling rivulet , as expressive of his thought it is the silent , onward flow of the mighty current . As we read on from page to page , we no more think of the style , than we do of the atmosphere when looking through it at the landscape that fixes our gaze . We do not so much ask whether the sentences of the writer are polished , as feel that hIs thought is profound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a comprehensiveness of view , an inherent force of sentiment , an honesty and seriousness of conviction and purpose , a heartiness and selfforgetfulness , that are of more value than a thousand graces , and that so interest and absorb , as to render us heedless whether the latter are present or absent . He speaks , not as one who is singing a pleasant song , but as one who has just come from the mount with a message from Jehovah himself , and as we listen to its burden we are so awed , and occupied , and taken captive , that we do not even think of the tones in which it is delivered . Passing from the mere style of the work , to its topics and their discussion , and viewing it in connection with the other productions of its author , we are struck with the wonderful versatility and power of his genius . We examine his masterly treatise on the " Will , " completed as it was in four and a half months , amid the cares and labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to rank him the prince of metaphysicians , and so unanswerable* that the rejecters of its doctrine have // been compelled to meet it with protests for lack of arguments . We take up the " History of Redemption , " and find it so vast in conception , so comprehensive and proportioned in plan , and so just in its estimates , as to be the nearest approach to the idea of a purely philosophic universal history that the world has ever known. * We think of the work on the " Affections , " so searching in its knowledge of the human heart , and so clear in its statements of the evidences of piety , as to have become the text-book of christendom on experimental religion . And now we have " Charity and its Fruits , " abounding in original and striking views of its great subject , scriptural , light-giving , solemn , practical , and so adapted to " the times " and to the wayward phases of the heart , that but for its date we might easily suppose it had just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reprove the sins of the present day . And all these works by the man whose preaching in its calm , quiet tones , and without a gesture , could startle his audience from their seats , or bow them down in distress and weeping " with awful convictions of their sin and danger ! " t Here is the realization of our highest conception of all that is valuable in genius-the power of grasping , in turn , every class of subjects with equal ease , and treating each with equal discernment and appropriateness and strength . Most minds are limited in their range ; if they traverse one circuit successfully , they are at fault or lost in others . But it is the greatness of Edwards that he is equally at home in all spheres of investigation ; every subject which never was answered , and never will be answered . " Now and then , indeed , some conceited sciolist is heard to boast that it is easy to overthrow its reasonings ; but few are rash enough to expose their own shallowness by attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to essays againstfctalism , have called them replies to Edwards ; ' but scholars have no need to be informed that Edwards never entertained any such doctrine as that word describes . " * " Universal history , " says Bancroft , " does but seek to relate the sum of all God 's works of Providence . ' In America , the first conception of its office , in the mind of Jonathan Edwards , * * * was nobler than the theory of Vico . More grand and general than the method of Bossuet , it embraced in its outline the whole work of Redemption ;  --  the history of the influence of all moral truth in the gradual regeneration of humanity . " - History of the United States , Vol. iii , pp. 399. * Gilfillan , after speaking of Edwards ' well-known sermon on the text , " Their foot shall slide in due time , " and describing its effect as preached at Entield , says , " In reading the sermon we do not wonder at the impression it produced . It is a succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that preceded it . We read it once to a distinguished savant , who , while disapproving its spirit , was compelled , literally , to shiver under the fury of its power . " Gilfillan 's description is exaggerated , his taste wretched , and his epithets , in this case , indiscriminating and indefinite , though evidently intended to be strong ; but he is probably a reliable witness as to the fact last mentioned . Is there a sermon in the language , which , when quietly read , would compare in effect with the one above alluded to ? // to which he turns his penetrating intellect he masters as though it were his peculiar province . As we study his various and varied works , we almost feel that if he had attempted it , with Shakespeare he might have producd a Hamlet ; and certain we are , that Finley was but just in saying , that he was " equally and thoroughly versed in all branches of theology , didactic , polemic , casuistic , experimental , and practical . " In perusing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scriptural character . Little or nothing is advanced on the mere dictum of the author . Every position , and statement , and doctrine is sustained by a " Thus saith the Lord . " At every step the argument is elevated from the province of mere human didactics , to the holy sphere of divine teachingsfrom the accents of the mere earthly teacher to the voice of the living God . And that the work is as practical as it is scriptural , is obvious from but the mention of its themes . Charity , " meekness in bearing injuries , " " cheerful in doing good , " " op - posed to an envious , selfish , censorious , wrathful spirit . " " tending to holy practice in the life , " and " willing to undergo all suffering for Christ " - all these are topics bearing directly on the daily temper , and habits , and conduct , and life of men ; and they are urged with a solemn and earnest impressiveness that can not but be felt . The lectures , too , display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Either from the author 's close observation of men , or from his self-knowledge , or from his profound acquaintance with mental philosophy , or from all together , the recesses of the soul seem to be open before him , and he speaks to the consciousness of every reader . And , once more , the work is peculiarly adapted to the times , and destined , we doubt not , if God attend it with his blessing , to have a decided and strong influence on the piety of the age , making it more thorough , equable , and proportioned , imbuing it with more of the spirit of tenderness and love , and thus making it more faithful , useful and invincible . Did our limits permit , we might easily notice , at some length , other interesting and obvious traits of these lectures ; their common-sense aspects of truth and duty ; their contemplative seriousness ; * the spirit of deep and humble reverence that per- * It was probably this trait in his writings , which led Mackintosh , by a strange perversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Edwards , as " a calvinist and a mystic . " A calvinist he certainly was ; but a mystic , in no other sense , than that he had all the heavenly-mindedness of the most serious and devoted of that class . The clearness of his mind on every subject must have excluded forever one essential element of mysticism . And Mackintosh could have called him " a mystic , " only as the opposers of Whitefield and the Wesleys were in the habit of cafling every truly spiritual christian " a Met/sadist. " // vades them ; * their singleness of thought and purpose ; and that sense of repressed emotion and power in their author , which we always feel in reading Edwards , and which leaves the impression that whatever strength he may put forth , he has more in reserve , and however his greatness may be manifest in the treatment of the subject before him , it would be easy for him to appear greater still . But we have too long detained our readers from some specimens of the work itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from the first lecture , in which the author shows that " Love is the sum of all virtue . " In arguing this from what reason teaches of the nature of love , he remarks , " first , that love will dispose to all acts of respect to both God and man . " " This is evident because a true respect to either God or man consists in love . If a man sincerely loves God , it will dispose him to render all proper respect to him ; and men need no other incitement to show each other all the respect that is due , than love . Love to God will dispose a man to honor him , to worship and adore him , and heartily to acknowledge his greatness , and glory , and dominion . And so it will dispose to all acts of obedience to God ; for the servant that loves his master , and the subject that loves his sovereign , will be disposed to proper subjection and obedience . Love will dispose the Christian to behave toward God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to him for help , and put all his trust in him ; just as it is natural for us , in case of need or affliction , to go to one that we love for pity and help . It will lead us , too , to give credit to his word , and to put confidence in him ; for we are not apt to suspect the veracity of those we have entire friendship for . It will dispose us to praise God for the mercies we receive from him , just as we are disposed to gratitude for any kindness we receive from our fellow-men that we love . Love , again , will dispose our hearts to submission to the will of God , for we are more willing that the will of those we love should be done , than of others . We natural . ly desire that those we love should be suited , and that we should he agreeable to them ; and true affection and love to God will dispose the heart to acknowledge God 's right to govern , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will dispose to submission . Love to God will dispose us to walk humbly with him , for he that loves God will be disposed to acknowledge the vast distance between God and himself . It will be agreeable to such an one , to exalt God , and set him on high above all , and to lie low before him . A true Christian delights to have God exalted on his own abasement , because he loves him . He is willing to own that God is worthy of this , and it is with delight that he casts himself in the dust before the Most High , from his sincere love to him . And so a due consideration of the nature of love will show that it disposes men * In this , Edwards is an example to all , and especially to all religious teachers . In his public prayers , we are told by his biographer , he was deeply solemn and reverent ; and his most familiar sermons are in utter contrast to that " free and easy** way of contemplating and addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evangelists and self-styled revival preachers , who seem to think that nearness of access to God consists in the use of terms of the most intimate and colloquial endearment . So prevalent has this vitiated phraseology often been in seasons of deep religious interest , that so sensible a writer as Isaac Taylor , has expressed the doubt , whether it be possible to originate and carry forward any religious revival , without bringing into use a phraseology that must differ " in this respect " from that of the sacred scriptures . " The best solvent of the doubt might be fonud in the history of the great Revival at Northampton . // to all duties toward their neighbors . If men have a sincere love to their neighbors , it will dispose them to all acts of justice toward those neighbors-for real love and friendship always dispose us to give those we love their due , and never to wrong them . Rom. xiii . 10 . " Love worketh no ill to his neighbor . " And the same love will dispose to truth toward neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deceit . Men are not disposed to exercise fraud and treachery toward those they love ; for thus to treat men is to treat them like enemies , but love destroys enmity . Thus the apostle makes use of the oneness that there ought to be among Christians , as an argument to induce them to truth between man and man . Ephesians iv . 25 . Love will dispose to walk humbly amongst men , for a real and true love will incline us to high thoughts of others , and to think them better than ourselves . It will dispose men to honor one another , for all are naturally inclined to think highly of those they love , and to give them honor ; so that by love are fulfilled those precepts , 1 Peter xi . 1 ' 7 , " Honor all men , " and Phil . ii . 3 , " Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory , but in lowliness of mind , let each esteem other better than themselves . " Love will dispose to contentment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coveting any things that our neighbor possesses , or envying him on account of any good thing that he has . It will dispose men to meekness and gentleness in their carriage toward their neighbors , and not to treat them with passion , or violence , or heat of spirit , but with moderation , and calmness , and kindness . It will check and restrain everything like a bitter spirit ; for love has no bitterness in it , but is a gentle and sweet disposition and affection of the soul . It will prevent broils and quarrels , and will dispose men to peaceableness , and to forgive injurious treatment received from others ; as it is said in Proverbs x. 12 , " Hatred stirreth up strifes , but love covereth all sins . " Love will dispose men to all acts of mercy toward their neighbors when they are under any affliction or calamity , for we are naturally disposed to pity those that we love when they are afflicted . It will dispose men to give to the poor , to bear one another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as to rejoice with those that do rejoice . It will dispose men to the duties they owe to one another in their several places and relations . It will dispose a people to all the duties they owe to their rulers , and to give them all that honor and subjection which are their due . And it will dispose rulers to rule the people over whom they are set , justly , seriously and faithfully , seeking their good , and not any by*ends of their own . It will dispose a people to all proper duty to their ministers , to hearken to their counsels and instructions , and to submit to them in the house of God , and to support and sympa. thize with and pray for them as those that watch for their souls ; and it will dispose ministers faithfully and ceaselessly to seek the good of the souls of their people , watching for them as those that must give account . Love will dispose to suitable carriage between superiors and inferiors ; it will dispose children to honor their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with eye service , but in singleness of heart ; and it will dispose masters to exercise gentleness and goodness toward their servants . Thus love would dispose to all duties both toward God , and toward man . And if it will thus dispose to all duties , then it follows , that it is the root , and spring , and , as it were , a comprehension of all virtues . It is a principle , which if it be implanted in the heart , is alone sufficient to produce all good practice ; and every right disposition toward God and man is summed up in it , and comes from it , as the fruit from the tree , or the stream from the fountain . " pp. 9-14 . The next extract is from the fourth Lecture , and notices some of the ways in which men may and often do injure others . " Some injure others in their estates , by unfairness and dishonesty in their dealings , by being fraudulent and deceitful with them , or at least by leading them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance ; or by oppressing them , t ' *king advantage of their necessities ; or by unfaithfulness towards them , not fulfilling their promises and engagements , and being slack and slighting in any business // they are employed in by their neighbors , aiming at nothing but just to meet the letter of their engagements , and not being careful to improve their time to the utmost in accomplishing that which they are engaged to do ; or by asking unreasonable prices for what they do ; or by withholding what is due , from their neighbors , unjustly , neglecting to pay their debts , or unnecessarily putting their neighbors to trouble and difficulty to get what is due from them . And besides these , there are many other methods in which men injure one another in their dealings , by an abundance of crooked and perverse ways in which they are far from doing to others as they would have them do to themselves , and by which they provoke , and irritate , and injure one another . Some injure others in their good name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs . No injury is more common , and no iniquity more frequent or base than this . Other ways of injury are abundant ; but the amount of injury by evil-speaking of this kind , is beyond account . Some injure others by making or spreading false reports about them , and so cruelly slandering them . Others , without saying that which is directly false , greatly misrepresent things , picturing out everything respecting their neighbors in the worst colors , exaggerating their faults , and setting them forth as far greater than they really are , always speaking of them in an unfair and unjust manner . A great deal of injury is done among neighbors by thus uncharitably judging one another , and putting injurious and evil constructions on one another 's words and actions . Persons may greatly injure others in their thoughts , by unjustly entertaining mean thoughts , or a low esteem of them . Some are deeply and continually injurious to others , by the contempt they habitually have of them in their hearts , and by their willingness to think the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , a great deal is done to the injury of others by the words ; - for the tongue is but too ready to be the wicked instrument of expressing the evil thoughts and feelings of the soul , and hence in the Scriptures ( Job v. 21 , ) it is called a scourge , and is compared ( Ps. cxl. 8 , ) to the fangs of some very poisonous kinds of serpents , whose bite is supposed to cause death . Sometimes men injure others in their treatment and actions towards them , and in the injurious deeds they do them . If clothed with authority , they sometimes carry themselves very injuriously toward those over whom their authority extends , by behaving very assumingly , and magisterially , and tyrannically toward them ; and sometimes those who are under authority , carry themselves very injuriously toward those who are over them , by denying them that respect and honor which are due to ' their places , and thus to themselves while they occupy them . Some carry themselves very injuriously toward others by the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and apparently having no regard to the good or benefit of their neighbor , but all their contrivance is only to better their own interests , Some carry themselves injuriously in the manifestation of a very haughty and proud spirit , as though they thought they were more excellent than all others , and that nobody was at all to be regarded except themselves alone ; and this appears in their air , and talk , and actions , and their greatly assuming behavior in general , all of which are such , that those about them feel and justly feel , that they are injured by them . Some carry themselves very injuriously by the exercise of a very wilful spirit , being so desperately set on having their own way , that they will , if possible , bend everything to their own will , and never will alter their career , or yield to the wishes of others ; they shut their eyes *igainst the light or motives others may offer , and have no regard to any one 's inclination but their own , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some carry themselves injuriously in the course they take in public affairs , acting not so much from a regard for the public good , as from the spirit of opposition to some party , or to some particular person ; so that the party or person opposed is injured , and oftentimes is greatly provoked and exasperated . Some injure others by the malicious and wicked spirit they cherish against them , whether with or without cause . It is not an uncommon thing for neighbors to dislike and even hate one another ; not cherishing anything like love to each other in their hearts , but whether they acknowledge it or not , in reality hating one another , having no delight in each other 's honor and prosperity , but , on // the contrary , being pleased when they are cast down and in adversity , foolishly and wickedly thinking , perhaps , that another 's fall is their own elevation , which it never is . Some injure others by the spirit of envy they show toward them , cherishing illwill toward them for no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many injure others from a spirit of revenge , deliberately returning evil for evil , for real or imaginary injuries received from them ; and some , as long as they live , will keep up a grudge in their hearts against their neighbor , and whenever an opportunity offers , will act it out in injury to him in the spirit of malice . And in innumerable other particular ways which might be mentioned , do men injure one another ; though these may suffice for our present purpose . " - pp. 99-108 . In the eighth Lecture , after making perfectly plain the difference between two things that are often confounded , viz : a proper self-love and selfishness , he remarks : " And if you are Christians , as . many of yon profess to be , then , in a peculiar sense , ye are not your own , for ye are bought with a price , ' even with the precious blood of Christ , ' 1 Cor. vi 19 , 20 ; and 1 Peter i. 19 . " " By a most just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , therefore , you must not , henceforth , treat yourself as your own , by seeking your own.interests or pleasure , only , or even chiefly ; for if you do so , you will be guilty of robbing Christ . And as you are not your own , so nothing that you have is your own . Your abilities of body and mind , your outward possessions , your time , talents , influence , comforts , none of them are your own ; nor have you any right to use them as if you had an absolute property in them , as you will be likely to do if you imagine them only for your own private benefit , and not for the honor of Christ , and for the good of your fellow-men. " - pp. 261-2 . And again : " In seeking the glory of God and the good of your fellow-creatures , you take the surest way to have God seek your interests , and promote your welfare . If you will devote yourself to God , as making a sacrifice of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself away . Though you seem to neglect yourself , and to deny yourself , and to overlook self in imitating the divine benevolence , God will take care of you ; and he will see to it that your interest is provided for , and your welfare made sure You shall be no loser by all the sacrifices you have made for him . To his glory be it said , he will not be your debtor , but will requite an hundred-fold even in this life , beside the eternal rewards that he will bestow upon you hereafter . His own declaration is , Every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands for my name 's sake , shall receive an hundred-fold ' ( the other evangelist adds , in this present time ' ) , and shall inherit everlasting life , ' Matt. xix. 29 ; and the spirit of this declaration applies to all sacrifices made for Christ , or for our fellow-men for his sake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a definite number ; but he does not make use of numbers , however great , to set forth the reward promised them hereafter . He only says , they shall receive everlasting life , because the reward is so great , and so much exceeds all the expense and self-denial persons can be at for Christ 's sake , that no numbers are sufficient to describe it . If you are selfish , and make yourself and your own private interests your idol , God will leave you to yourself , and let you promote your own interests as well as you can . But if you do not selfishly seek your own , but do seek the things that are Jesus Christ 's , and the things of your fellow-beings , then God will make your interest and happiness his own charge , and he is infinitely more able to provide for , and promote it , than you are . The resources of the universe move at his bidding , and he can easily command them all to subserve your welfare . So that not to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way of seeking your own in a better // sense . It is the directest course you can take to secure your highest happiness When you are required not to be selfish , you are not required , as has been observed , not to love and seek your own happiness , hut only not to seek mainly your own private and confined interests . But if you place your happiness in God , in glorifying him , and in serving him by doing good , in this way , above all others , will you promote your wealth , and honor , and pleasure here below , and obtain hereafter a crown of unfading glory , and pleasures for evermore at God 's right hand . If you seek , in the spirit of selfishness , to grasp all as your own , you shall lose all and be driven out of the world , at last , naked and forlorn , to everlasting poverty and contempt . But if you seek not your own , but the things of Christ , and the good of your-fellow men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Holy Spirit yours , and all things yours . Yes , " all things " shall be yours . whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or t ? iings present , or things to come ; all are yours ; and ye are Christ 's ; and Christ is 0 ods. " - pp. 264-6 . The Lectures on Charity as opposed to envy , to selfishness , to anger , and to censoriousness , would each , by itself , make a capital " Tract for the Times . " We have space for only a few brief quotations . What a keen knowledge of human nature is manifest in the inquiry : " Have we not been glad to hear of anything to our neighbor 's disadvantage ; and in the forebodings we have expressed about them , have we not in reality spoken out our wi8he8 ? " - pp. 177 . And again : " Humility will further tend to prevent a levelling behavior . Some persons are always ready to level those above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to level those below them up to their own position . But he that is under the influence of humility will avoid both these extremes . On the one hand , he will be willing that all should rise just so far as their diligence and worth of character entitle them to ; and on the other hand , he will be willing that his supeliors should be known and acknowledged in their place , and have rendered to them all the honors that are their due . " - pp. 206 . And how true is the following : " And as the spirit of charity , or Christian love , is opposed to a selfish spirit , in that it is merciful and liberal , so it is in this , also , that it disposes a person to be public-spirited . A man of a right spirit , is not a man of narrow and private views , but is greatly interested and concerned for the good of the community to which he belongs , and particularly of the city or village in which he resides , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member . God commanded the Jews that were carried away captive to Babylon , to seek the good of that city , though it was not their native place , but only the city of their captivity . His injunction was ( Jeremiah xxix. 7 ) , Seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the Lord for it . ' And a man of truly christian spirit , will be earnest for the good of his country , and of the place of his residence , and will be disposed to lay himself out for its improvement . " - pp. 243-4 . And how descriptive the remark , that , " Sometimes men 's passions rise so high that they are , as it were , drunk wit/s them , so that their reason is gone , and they act as if beside themselves . " - pp. 281 . And how searching the inquiry : // " How has it been with respect to your holding anger ? Has not the sun more than once gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Nay more , has it not gone down again and again , through month after month , and year after year , while winter 's cold hath not chilled the heat of your wrath , and the summer 's sun bath not melted you to kindness ? And are there not some here present , that are sitting before God with anger laid up in their hearts , and burning there ? Or if their anger is for a time concealed from human eyes , is it not like an old sore not thoroughly healed , but so that the least touch renews the smart ; or like a smothered fire in the heaps of autumn leaves , which the least breeze will kindle into a flame ? And how is it in your families ? - pp. 288 . In the eleventh Lecture , speaking of heavenly-mindedness , he says : " And this grace , like all the others mentioned , tends to holy practice . If the heart be taken off from the world , it will tend to take off the pursuits from the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are things not of the world , it will tend to lead us to pursue the things that are heavenly . He that has his heart loose from the world , will not practically keep the world close in his grasp , as being exceeding loth to part with any of it . If a man speaking of his experience , tells how at some given time he felt his heart weaned from the world , so that the world seemed as nothing arid vanity to him , and yet if in practice he seems as violent after the world as ever , and a great deal more earnest after it than he is after heavenly things , such as growth in grace , and in the knowledge of God , and in duty , then his profession will have but little weight in corn parison with his practice . And so if his conduct shows that he thinks more of treasure on earth than of treasure in heaven , and if when he has got the world , or some part of it , he hugs it close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go for pious and charitable uses , though God promises him a thousand-fold more in heaven for it , he gives not the least evidence of his being weaned from the world , or that he prefers heavenly things to the things of the world . Judging by his practice , there is sad reason to believe that his profession is in vain. - pp. 347 -- 8 . In the thirteenth Lecture , speaking of the connection of the christian graces , he says : " So saving repentance and faith are implied in each other . They are both one and the same conversion of the soul from sin to God , through Christ . The act of the soul in turning from sin to God through Christ , as it respects the thing from which the turning is , viz : sin , is called repentance ; and as it respects the thing to which , and the mediation by which it turns , is called faith . But it is the same motion of the soul ; just as when a man turns , or flees from darkness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it may be called by different names , according as it respects the darkness fled from , or the light fled to ; in the one case , being called avoiding , or turning from , and in the other , receiving or ernbracing. " - pp. 395 . And again : " There is not one conversion of the soul to faith , and another conversion to love to God , and another to humility , and another to repentance , and still another to love to man ; but all are produced by one and the same work of the Spirit , and are the result of one and the same conversion , or change of the heart . " - pp. 39*1 . And again : " A true convert , the moment he is converted , is possessed not of one or two , but of all holy principles , and all gracious dispositions . They may be feeble indeed , // like the faculties and powers of an infant child , but they are all truly there , and will be seen flowing out progressively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man . In every real convert , there are as many graces as there were in Jesus Christ himself , which is what the evangelist John means , when he says : the word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , full of grace and truth ; and of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace , ' John L 14 , 16 . And , indeed , it can not be otherwise , for all true converts are renewed in Christ 's image , as says the Apostle , And have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge , after the image of him that created him , ' Cobs. iii . lO . " - pp. 401-2 . And again : " False grace is like a defective or monstrouB picture or image , wherein some essential part is wanting . There is , it may be , an appearance of some good disposition toward God , while at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or if there appears to be a kind , just , generous , good-h*arted disposition toward man , there is a want of right feeling toward God . On this account , we find God complains of Ephraim , that he is a cake not turned , ' Hosca vii . 8 ; that is , that his goodness is partial and not consistent ; that he is good in one thing , and bad in another , like a cake not turned , which is generally burnt on one side , and raw on the other , and good for nothing on either . " - pp. 408-9 . But without multiplying quotations of the important thoughts that strike us , ( for to do it , would be to copy a large part of the work , ) we close with a single extract from the concluding Lecture , on the noble topic , " Heaven , a world of Charity or Love . " In sweetness of thought it reminds us of some of the choicest passages of Washington Irving , and in loftiness and grandeur , of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a striking similarity in it , to a passage often quoted from the latter writer as perhaps the gem of all his writings . It alludes to what the saints shall find in heaven . " There they will find those thingf that appeared most lovely to them while they dwelt on earth ; the things that met the approbation of their judgments , and captivated their affections , and drew away their souls from the most dear and pleasant of earthly objects . There they will find those things that were their delight . rc below , and on which they rejoiced to meditate , and with the sweet contemplation of which their minds were often entertained ; and there , too , the things which they chose for their portion , and which were so dear to them that they were ready for the sake of them to undergo the severest sufferings , and to forsake even father , and mother , and kindred , and friends , and wife , and children , an ( l life itself . All the truly great and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and it may be from every part of the universe , are constantly tending toward heaven . As the streams tend to the ocean , so all these are tending to the great ocean of infinite purity and bliss . The progress of time does but bear them on to its blessedness ; and us , if we are holy , to be united to them there . Every gem which death rudely tears away from us here , is a glorious jewel forever shining there ; every Christian friend that goes before us from this world , is a ransomed spirit waiting to welcome us in heaven . There will be the infant of days that we have lost below , through grace to he found above ; there the Christian father , and mother , and wife , and child , and friend , with whom we shall renew the holy fellowship of the saints , which was interrupted by death here , but shall be commenced again in the upper sanctuary , and then shall never end . There we shall have company with the patriarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those of whom // the world was not worthy , with whom on earth we were only conversant by faith . And there , above all , we shall enjoy and dwell with God the Father , whom we have loved with all our hearts on earth , and with Jesus Christ our beloved Saviour , who has always been to us the chief among ten thousands and altogether lovely , and with the Holy Ghost our Sanctifier , and guide , and comforter ; and shall , be filled with all the fulness of the Godhead forever I " - pp. 4 ' 74-5.
