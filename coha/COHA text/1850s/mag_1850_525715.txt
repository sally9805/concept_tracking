GENERAL WINFJELD SCOTT . THE State of Virginia has caused to be prepared for presentation to Major General Winfield Scott a gold medal , upon which his fame is typified by a solid Grecian Done column , with " 1812 " inscribed onits base , and upon its capital " 1848 " - the date of the treaty of peace with Mexico . It would be pleasing to us to adopt the idea conveyed by this medal in tracing the career of General Scott . We should wish to follow him throughout his whole course , and elucidate the characteristics of his genius by the simple narration of his story . But as his biography down to the commencement of the Mexican war has already been given by Mr. Mansfield , we shall confine ourselves in this sketch to a summary of antecedent eventsr and reserve the greater part of our limited space for an examination of acts and characteristics during that war , which appear to us as yet little understood . Our purpose is not therefore to dwell upon the great acts of the historical drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years . We do not propose to present vivid representations of battles , in which he has been distinguished as the soldier , the General , and as the Commander-in-Chief , in order to heighten the effect of that picture . Still less should we desire by the scenic effect of any such representations to divert attention from the genius and characteristics of the man . But from the ample material which his labors in the closet and the field furnish , we shall present , as it appears to us , the picture of a generous and magnanimous man , with genius strengthened by industry ; sternness softened by kindness ; an indomitable will governed by reflection ; ability and vigor in war , combined with a love of peace and order ; and respect and obedience to the constituted authorities of his country , unimpaired by an unshrink .. ing maintenance of his own rights . The early career of Major General Scott was very brilliant . At the commencement of the war with Great Britain , he was promoted to a Lieutenant Colonelcy of Artillery , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accepted in 1808 , after the passage of the non-intercourse act , and when the danger of war with Great Britain appearing imminent , Congress had increased the army . At the time that General Scott became a soldier , he was engaged in the practice of law in his native state of Virginia , having previously received a collegiate education at William and Mary college . With the events of the war of 1812-14 , the promotion of the subject of our sketch kept pace . He was soon Adjutant General of the army , next Colonel of Artillery , then Brigadier General , and on the 25th July , 1814 , * For his distinguished services in the successive conflicts of CHIPPEWA and NIAGARA , and for his uniform gallantry and good conduct as an officer in said army , " he was brevetted a Major General . He attained this high rank at the early age of twenty-eight years . In the battle of Niagara be had been severely wounded , and when the proclamation of peace followed in February , 1815 , he was still suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sometime previously been the Commanding General at Baltimore . The plaudits of his countrymen still rang in his ears . Governor Tompkins , in presenting to him a year later , a sword voted by the State of New York , thus addressed him : " Your military career is replete with splendid events . Without descending into too much minuteness , I may briefly refer to your exploits in the most // interesting portion of the American Continent . The shores of Niagara , from Erie to Ontario , are inscribed with your name , and with the names of your brave companions . The defeat of the enemy at Fort George will not be forgotten . The memorable conflict on the plains of Chippewa , and the appalling night battle on the heights of Niagara , are events which have added new celebrity to the spots where they happened , heightening the majesty of the stupendous cataract , by combining with its natural all the force of the moral sublime . " The admirers of the great in nature , from all quarters of the globe , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear to their distant homes the idea of this mighty display of nature , and will associate with it your deeds and those of your brothers in arms . And so long as the beautiful and sublime shall be objects of admiration among men ; so long as the whelming waters of Erie shall be tumbled into the awful depths of Niagara , so long shall the splendid actions in which you had so conspicuous a share , endure in the memory of * Such was the tone of public sentiment which every where greeted our young countryman , upon the conclusion of peace , but he modestly thought that whatever industry , and vigor , and genius had heretofore accomplished , much yet remained for him to do before he could hope to be master of the science of war . Far from resting upon the laurels he had gained , in what has been aptly styled the second war of independence , he obtained permission to visit Europe for professional improvement. - There , by personal intercourse with Carnot , and the great generals of the French empire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline of the allied armies , and in the collection of books , his time was profitably occupied , and he returned to the United States prepared to enter upon a course of study which would give him self-confidence in any future war in which his country might be engaged . Upon his return he was not idle . In the year 1821 he published a volume entitled , " General Regulations for the Army " containing every thing necessary for the government of troops in garrison , in camp , 277 and in the field . In 1826 , as president of a board of regular officers and distinguished militia generals , he reported : 1 . A plan for the organization and instruction of the whole body of the militia of the union . 2 . A system of tactics for the artillery . 3 . A system of cavalry tactics ; and 4 . A system of infantry and rifle tactics . In 1835 , under a resolution of Congress , he published a new edition in three small volumes of the infantry tactics , with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such were the labors of General Scott , in the closet , during the intervals of time when he was not actively engaged in his military duties ; but during the same period , which we have thus hastily run over , his military avocations were by no means few or unimportant . The war with the Northwestern Indians , commonly called the Black Hawk war ; the direction of which General Scott was ordered to assume in 1832 , was brought to a conclusion by the battle of the Bad Axe , August 2d , the day before General Scott had joined General Atkinson , under whom the operations against the Indians had until that time been conducted The fugitive Indians were soon afterwards collected and brought in prisoners . Treaties between the United States and the Indians soon followed , and General Scott received the approbation of the government for his conduct , " during a series of difficulties , requiring higher moral courage than the operations of an active campaign , under ordinary * Allusion is here made by the Secretary of War ( General Cass ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolating scourge , the cholera . His conduct is thus described by an eye-witness : " The General 's course of conduct on that occasion should establish for him a reputation not inferior to that which he has earned on the battle field , and should exhibit him not only as a warrior , but as a man-not only as the hero of battles , but as the hero of humani ty . He visited the sick , cheered the well , encouraged the attendants , and set anexample to all , which did much towards preventing the spread of a panic , scarcely less to be dreaded than the original calamity . The mortality was appalling , but at // length , on the 8th of September , the infection disappeared . * We pass from the difficulties surmounted in the Northwest to South Carolina , where General Scott soon after was called upon , in his position as the commander of the troops , to exercise all his judgment and discretion . The feelings which actuated his whole course of conduct on that occasion , are thus described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nullifier , dated Dec. 14th , 1832 , from Savannah : " I have always entertained a high admiration for the history and character of South Carolina , and accident or good fortune has thrown me into intiinacy , and even friendship , with almost every leader of the two parties which now divide and agitate the State . Would to God they were again united , as during the late war , when her federalists vied with the republicans in the career of patriotism and glory , and when her Legislature came powerfully to the aid of the Union . Well , the majority among you have taken a stand , and those days of general harmony may never return . What an awful position for South Carolina , as well as for the other States ! " I can not follow out the long , dark shades of the picture that presents itself to my fears . I will hope , nevertheless , for the best . But I turn my eyes back , and good God ! what do I behold ? Impatient South Carolina could not wait-she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ; and the great names of Washington , Franklin , Jefferson and Greene , no longer compatriot with yours , or those of Laurens , Moultrie , Piuckney , and Marion with mine ! " But the evil , supposing the separation to have been peaceable , would not stop there . When one member shall withdraw , the whole arch of the Union will tumble in . Out of the broken fragments new combinations will arise . We should probably have , instead of one , three confederacies-a Northern , Southern and Western Union ; and transmontane Virginia , your native country , not belonging to the South , but torn off by the general West . I turn with horror from the picture I have only sketched . I have said it is dark ; let but one drop of blood be spilt upon the canvass , and it becomes one red ' " Mansfield 's Life of Scott . Deeply impressed with the conviction expressed in the foregoing letter , the conduct of Scott throughout these difficulties between the United States and South Carolina was conciliatory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Hon. B. W. Leigh , ) if it was possible , to prevent a resort to arms ; and nothing could have been more judicious than his conduct . Far from being prone to take umbrage , he kept his temper under the strictest guard , and was most careful to avoid giving occasicn for offence ; yet he held himself ready to act , if it should become necessary , and he let that be distinctly understood . " " He was perfectly successful , when the least imprudence might have resulted in a serious collision. ** At length the passage of the celebrated compromise act by Congress caused South Carolina to rescind her ordnance of nullification , and the officers and soldiers and seamen of the United States departed with the satisfaction of knowing that every act of theirs , during the apprehended collision , had been dictated by kindness to their brethren of South Carolina . In 1835 , the Seminoles of Florida broke out into open hostilities against the United States . On the 20th of January , 1836 , General Scott was ordered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations against those Indians for a few months , in which they , by scattering , contrived in a great measure to avoid collision with our troops , General Scott was ordered to proceed to the Creek country , in Alabama and Georgia , for the purpose of subduing that tribe of Indians , which had meanwhile also engaged in hostilities . There he proceeded forthwith to organize the volunteer corps ; and , in the beginning of July , five hundred Indians had already surrendered prisoners . While thus zealously and efficiently engaged in the Creek country , General Scott was suddenly re-called by the President of the United States , upon private representations made by the second in command of the army in the field , through an unauthorized channel of communication , and his conduct during the Seminole and Creek campaigns was submitted to a Court of Inquiry . The Court , after a patient and laborious investigation of the charge , pronounced General Scott 's plan of the Seminole cam- // 279 paign " well devised and prosecuted with energy , steadiness and ability . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of campaign , as adopted by General Scott , was well calculated to lead to successful results ; and that it was prosecuted by him , as far as practicable , with zeal and ability , until he was re-called from the command . " Towards the close of the year 1837 , insurgent movements commenced with the French population of Canada against their government . These movements were closely followed by the enrollment of large numbers of sympathisers among the border population of the United States . " Thousands and thousands met in lodges all along the frontier , oaths of secrecy were adinin - istered , principal leaders appointed , Generals and Staff Officers chosen , and at least for Upper Canada , a Provisional Government formed . The President of the United States issued his proclamation , enjoining all good citizens to observe the strictes.t neutrality towards the British provinces . It had but little effeet. *** The arms in the hands of the citizens , and even those in the State arsenals , within reach of the borders , were soon seized or purloined , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these people passed over from Schlosser to Navy Island , within the Biitish line , but the insurgent movement in Canada had meantime been apparently crushed . A small steamboat , called the Caroline , was employed by the Canada sympathisers between Navy Island and Schlosser , on the American shore , as a ferry boat . The first night the boat commenced her trips the British fitted out an expedition at Chippewa , passed over to the American town of Schlosser , killed one citizen and wounded several others , and after firing the boat cut her loose from her fastenings and sent her over the cataract of Niagara , as was believed by many at the time , with several wounded Americans on board.t This national outrage greatly inflamed the minds of the people of the United States , and General Scott , then in Washington , was ordered to the frontier , and clothed with full power to call for militia to enforce the act of neutrality , to defend our * Mansfield , p. 288. t Mansfield . territory against invasion , or to maintain peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was busy in exercising his influence for peace . He allowed himself no repose . He passed frequently along the frontier-sometimes along the Detroit , and sometimes on the north line of Vermont , and , in the performance of this duty of peace-maker , he addressed on a line of eight hundred miles , immense gatherings of sympathisers as well as other citizens . He in those addresses acknowled*ed that the burning of the Caroline was a national outrage which called for explanation and satisfaction ; but , at the same time , he reminded our incensed citizens that we lived under a government of laws . That a republic can have no sure foundation except in the general intelligence , virtue , respect , and obedience to law , of its people ; that if , in the attempt to force on our unwilling neighbors independence and free institutions , we had first to spurn and trample under foot treaty stipulations and laws made by our own representatives , we should greatly hazard free institutions at home ; that no government can or ought to exist , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations to foreign countries , and of enforcing its own at home ; that such power depended in a republic chiefly on the people themselves ; that we had a treaty with England , binding us to the strictest observance of amity , or all the duties of good neighborhood with adjoining provinces , and also an act of Congress for enforcing those solemn obligations ; that the treaty and the laws were as binding on the honor and conscience of every American freeman , as if he had specially voted for each ; that this doctrine was of the very essence of a civilized republic , and that the neglect of it could not fail to sink us into anarchy and universal contempt . That the whole subject was in the hands of the President , the regularly elected official organ of the country ; that there was no doubt the President would make the proper demand , and failing to obtain satisfaction , would lay the whole matter before Congress . Such harangues from the mouth of a soldier , not unknown to fame , produced the happiest effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , and the friends // of order were encouraged to come out in support of order . On the 10th of April , 1838 , Gen. Scott was ordered to take measures for the removal of the Cherokees beyond the Mississippi . The duty was happily accomplished without bloodshed , although large bodies of troops had been assembled in their country with a view to force the emigration of the reluctant Cherokees . The instructions of the General to the troops , and his counsels to the Cherokees themselves , dictated by the spirit of the philanthropist , effected this happy result . Scott was again soon on the Northeastern frontiers , where hostile movements were on foot in relation to what was known as the Disputed Territory . Our space does not permit us to say more than that he again appeared as a pacificator , and that in consequence of an early friendship between himself and Sir John Harvey , the Governor of New Brunswick , as well as by his active exertions in Maine , he was enabled to prevent collisions which might have resulted in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the National Whig Convention at Harrisburgh , the name of Scott was brought forward as a candidate for the Presidency . He received 62 votes , and the nomination fell on General Harrison . In 1841 , upon the death of General Macomb , Scott was appointed the Commander of the Army , with his head-quarters at Washington , where he continued in the performance of his duties until he assumed command of the Army in Mexleo . The war with Mexico broke out in May , 1846 . It is not our purpose to discuss the causes of that war , but the Administration of Mr. Polk held , that , Texas , before her annexation to the United States , having declared the Rio Grande to be her boun dary with Mexico , and the United States having , by the act of annexation , taken upon themselves the onus of settling the question of boundary , and Mexico having refused to enter into diplomatic negotiations for the settlement of that and other disputed questions , and having refused even to receive a Minister from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sustaining the claims of Texas and the United States . In this position of affairs , General Taylor , then in command on the west bank of the Nueces , was ordered to take post on the east bank of the Rio Grande , and in obeying this order , a detachment from his command was surprised and assaulted by an overwhelming Mexican force , and a number of American soldiers killed , wounded , and taken prisoners . As soon as news of this event reached Washington , Congress declared , by a large majority , that war existed by the act of Mexico , and measures were takcn to vindicate the rights and honor of the United States . In the state of anxious feeling then prevailing , General Scott was freely consulted by the Administration , and it was intimated to him , that he was to command the Army about to be raised , for the prosecution of the war . He at once set himself assidu. ously at work in arranging the necessary details , for organizing and dispatching the volunteers , authorized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him on the 17th of that month . This bill was defective , in not providing a sufficient staff , or sufficient company officers , for the regiments about to be raised , and General Scott at once prepared a supplemental bill , to provide for these deficiencies . This bill , the Secretary of War promised to press upon the attention of Congress , and on the 19th of May , he went to the Senate committee for that purpose , but at the same time caused to be inserted a first section , providing for two additional Major-Generals , and four Brigadier-Generals , for the regular Army . The section had been introduced without the knowledge of General Scott , and it was then known to him that party leaders had protested against his being charged with the war . Indeed , Mr. Senator Ben .. ton , in advocating the measure , avowed it to be the policy of the Administration to appoint party Generals to conduct the war . " Generals , , * said he , " are wanted , who would look to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere military skill , is needed to conduct an invasion successfully . " On the 18th of May , General Scott had written to General Taylor , informing him that heavy re-inforcements were to be sent to the Rio Grande , and that he had been // designated for the command of the augmented army . He added , he feared that , with the utmost efforts , the reinforcements could not be put on the Rio Grande before the 1st of September , and that he did not expect to assume the command much before the arrival of the reinforcements alluded to . This letter was read by Mr. Marcy , before it was dispatched , and one paragraph in the letter stricken out , upon his suggestion . Under these circumstances , Mr. Marcy undertook , on the 20th , two days later , to lecture General Scott on his delay , in not repairing at once to the seat of war . The Secretary well knew , at the time , the avocations of the General-in-Chief ; that much yet remained for him to do in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that , in the opinion of General Scott , military operations could not be pushed from the Rio Grande before the 1st of September . From this unusual and unjustifiable proceeding , on the part of the Secretary of War-this condenination in advance-it was apparent to General Scott , that the Administration had lent itself to what seemed the popular belief at that time , that an army of thirty thousand men could be collected , equipped , thrown upon the Rio Grande , and be in condition to commence military operations immediately ; or else , that the design of the lecture of the Secretary was to make use of this popular belief , for the purpose of hurrying him off to the Rio Grande , before the necessary preparations had been made , or the troops collected , and afterwards charge the necessary delays which must occur , before military operations could be commenced , to his inefficiency , and recall him . It was under these circumstances , that General Scott wrote his letter of the 21st of May , 1846 , to Mr. Secretary Marcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recited , in detail , the work that must be done , to collect together , to transport , to equip , and supply an army . He proved conclusively , that the army , materials of war , transportation , and supplies , could not be in readiness before the 1st of September . He then remarks , " All that I have but sketched , I deem to be not only useful to success , but indispensable . As a soldier , I make this assertion , without the fear of contradiction from any honest and candid * " Against the ad captandum condemnation of all other persons , whoever may be designated for the high command in question , there can be no reliance , in his absence , other than the active , candid , and steady support of his government . If I can not have that sure basis to rest upon , it will be infinitely better for the country , ( not to speak of my personal security , ) that some other commander of the new army against Mexico should be selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least be judged and supported by me , in this office and every where else , as I would desire , if personally in that command , to be judged and supported . " These representations of Scott had no effect at the time . The fiat of party was made to over-ride all patriotic considerations . The assertion that the army could not commence operations from the Rio Grande until the 1st of September was ridiculed . General Scott was himself caricatured , and Mr. Marcy replied on the 25th , that the country would feel impatient if the volunteers were to remain inactive on the Rio Grande till the 1st of September , and concluded by informing Scott , that his services would be confined to the City of Washington and to the preparations for the vigorous prosecution of hostilities against Mexico . But this action of the government was not destined to endure . Subsequent events of the war verified the sagacity of the General-in-Chief ; and , notwithstanding all the efforts of the Administration to falsify his predictions , the army could not commence its operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , conscious that public opinion would do hini justice with the verification of his calculations , and doing all that he could do in that position towards the successful prosecution of the war . His reliance upon public sentiment was not misplaced . When hostilities between the United States and Mexico began , the idea was cherished , that by beating such forces as Mexico might assemble in defence of her more remote provinces we might " conquer a peace . " Besides , the army then under General Taylor on the Rio Grande , // for the invasion of Tamaulipas and New Leon , another army was placed under General Wool to over-run Chihuahua , a third under General Kearny for the conquest of New Mexico , and a fourth detachment , afterwards to fall under the command of Kearny , in California . New Mexico and California were soon under American Government . Wool had made a long march without encountering opposition , and Taylor had in September fought the battle of Monterey , after having previously in May gained the brilliant victories of Palo Alto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , notwithstanding these uninterrupted successes , the probability of a peace with Mexico was as remote as at the commencenient of the war , and the Administration in October appears to have become satisfied that something else should be done to accomplish an end at that time sincerely desired . Accordingly , on the 22d of October , the Secretary of War writes to General Taylor , " it is believed that Vera Cruz may be taken ; and having possession of that city , the castle of San Juan d ' Ulloa might probably be reduced or compelled to surrender . If the expedition could go forth without the object being known to the enemy , it is supposed that four thousand troops would be a sufficient force for the enterprize , receiving as they would the co-operation of our naval force on the Gulf ; but at least fifteen hundred or two thousand of them should be of the regular army , and under the command of officers best calculated for such an undertaking . " This letter of Mr. Marcy shows that the proposed exhibition was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that the detachment was to be commanded by Major-General Patterson ; that General Taylor must not make such detachment if it interfered materially with his plan of operations , and that it was hoped to carry Vera Cruz by a coup-dc-main , without looking to ulterior operations from that point ; and , that if unforseen difficulties in regard to Vera Cruz should arise , the movement should be turned against Tampico . The Brazos Santiago was designated as the place of embarcation of the detachment . No siege preparations were made ; and the whole tenor of the despatch to General Taylor as well as the instructions to General Patterson , * shew that Mr. Marcy still proposed nothing more than partial operations . He tells General Patterson , " Our object is to strike an effective blow at the enemy ; and if Vera Cruz can be taken and by that means the castle of San Juan d ' Ulloa reduced , it would be an important point in the war ; but the force which is proposed to be sent aga.inst that place , or the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other operations , may not be sufficient to insure reasonable hopes of success , provided the enemy should anticipate our design upon that place in season to strengthen its defences and greatly increase bis forces at that point . " " If Vera Cruz should , all circumstances considered , be found to be too dangerous an enterprize to be attempted , your attention will then be directed to the capture of Tampico . " As soon as these views of the government came to the knowledge of General Scott , he expressed himself strongly against them . He tells Mr. Marcy , October 27 : " Unless with a view to a second or new line of operations , I regard the possession , by us , of the city of Vera Cruz and its castle San Juan d ' Ullon , as a step towards compelling Mexico to sue for peace , as not likely to be worth one-tenth of the lives , time , and money , which their capture would cost us . In other words , I am persuaded that our possession of those places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present strict blockade of the port ; unless , as intimated above , the capture should be promptly followed by a march thence , with a competent force , upon the capital . To conquer a peace 1 am now persuaded that we must take the city of Mexico , or place it in imminent danger of capture , and mainly through the city of Vera Cruz . " Full details are given by General Scott in his memorandum on the subject for the organization , embarkation , and landing of the force necessary for the undertaking , and on November 12 , in a supplemental memorandum , he writes : " To divide our forces on the lower Rio Grande and in the direction of Monterey and Saltihlo , // equitably and wisely between the two lines of operations upon the enemies ' capital , the positive instructions of the government will be needed , besides the presence on the theatre of war of the highest in army rank . The latter , I beg to say , is the proper officer to carry out on the spot , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to direct the principal attacking column on and from Vera Cruz . " On the 18th of November , General Scott was told by the President to hold himself in readiness for this service , and on the 20th , he submitted to the Secretary , at the recuest of the latter , a draft of the instructions required . These instructions were of a definite and precise character . The duties that he was to perform were distinctly stated ; the manner in which the necessary force was to be obtained was given , and the 1st of February made the point of time in which it was desirable to reach the point of descent . The Secretary did not adopt these specific instructions , but wrote to General Scott on the 23d , " to repair to Mexico , to take command of all the forces there assembled ; and particularly to organize and set on foot an expedition to operate on the Gulf coast , if , on arriving at the theatre of action , you , ( General Scott , ) shall deem it to be practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite instructions , but you are left to prosecute them as your judgment , under a full view of all the circumstances , shall dictate . The work is before you , and the means provided , or to be provided , for accomplishing it are committed to you , in the full confidence that you will use them to the best advantage . " No confidence could apparently be greater , and General Scott , before leaving Washington , wrote to several eminent friends : " The President has behaved nobly . " His expectations of support and sympathy from his Government were soon , however , disappointed . While on the route to the Rio Grande at New Orleans , he first heard that the project was entertained of creating the office of Lieutenant-General for the purpose of superseding him in his high duties . He scouted the idea that the President could be guilty of such an act of treachery , but ere long a public message to Congress , recommending the creation of the office , and the announcement that Mr. Senator Benton would fill it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that instead of expecting active aid and support from home , he must look to having his operations delayed , if not thwarted , by opposition from the Administration , in order to promote their political scheme . Far from being awed or deterred by the developments before him , bis faculties were invigorated , and he exhibited to those around him a moral and intellectual greatness , rising superior to the pressure of adverse circumstances . It has been stated that the plan which General Scott proposed for the conquest of a peace was , to capture Vera Cruz , and thence by incessant and vigorous movements , either to " take the city of Mexico , or place it in imminent danger of capture. ** The plan of the Administration , until this suggestion was adopted , had been , not to interfere with any plan of operations which General Taylor might have , but in addition to such operations , to strike at the enemy on the Gulf coast of Mexico , provided their suggestion met with General Taylor 's approval . On the 20th of November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dated October 15 , was received in Washington . In that letter , General Taylor thus expresses himself : " It may be expected that I should give my views as to the policy of occupying a defensive line , to which I have above alluded . I am free to confess , that in view of the difficulties and expense attending a movement into the heart of the country , and particularly in view of the unsettled and revolutionary character of the Mexican Government , the occupation of such a line seems to me the best course that can be adopted . The line taken might be either that on which we propose to insist as the boundary between the republics-say that of the Rio Grande  --  or the line to which we have advanced , viz : the Sierra Madre , including Chihuahua and Sante F6 . The former line could be held with a much smaller force than the latter ; but even the line of the Sierra Madre could be held with a force greatly less than would be required for an active campaign . Monterey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government determine to // strike a decisive blow at Mexico , it is my opinion that the force should land near Vera Cruz or Alvarado ; and after establishing a secure depot , march thence on the capital . The amount of troops required for this service would not fall short , in my judgment , of 25,000 men , of which at least 10,000 should be regular troops . " It has been seen that the Government had , previously to the receipt of this letter , determined upon striking this decisive blow , and designated General Scott for the command . He at once , upon reading General Taylor 's letter , submitted the following propositions : " I have hastily read General Taylor 's dispatches , which arrived last night . I suppose that the war must go forward , and not be allowed to degenerate into a war like a peace , which would be as bad , or worse , than a peace like a war , involving an indefinite period of time and waste of money . " I have the honor to propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5,000 Regulars and four small bri gades of Volunteers , making , say , 6,000 men , with two Volunteer Major Generals , and four Volunteer Brigadier Generals , to be takenfrom the forces now under Major General Taylor , or under orders to join him , although he may be , for a time , reduced to a strictly defensive position at Monterey . 2 . That to the 11,000 men , ( Regulars and Volunteers as above , ) there be added , say , 4,000 Volunteers , to be divided among the four old brigades , taken as above , or to be placed under two new Volunteer Brigadiers , to be appointed by the President , according to his pleasure . 3 . That the new Volunteers , ( nine regiments , ) be organized and despatched as rapidly as possible , and also the construction of the boats for embarbation and debarkation , in order that the whole expedition may be afloat and beyond the Rio Grande by the 15th of January , or , at the very latest , the 1st of February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf coast before the return of the yellow fever , to be apprehended in April , but always certain in May . 4 . That , to enable Major General Taylor to resume offensive , or , at least , threatening movements from Monterey upon Saltillo , San Luis de Potosi , &amp;c. , pending the expedition against Vera Cruz , if possible , to send him recruits to fill up the regular corps left with him , and also the remainder , say , 3,500 new Volunteers , of the nine regiments . 5 . That , to give the certainty of greater activity and success to the two attacking columns , it is respectfully auggested that the President call for additional regiments of Volunteers . 6 and 7 proposes other details for increasing the efficiency and strength of the force . ( Signed . ) WINFIELD SCOTT . Washington , Nov. 21,1846 . " The instructions of the Secretary , dated the 23d of November , giving the whole direction of the war to General Scott , followed ; and he at once proceeded to the Rio Grande . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to General Taylor , intimating his proposed theatre of operations , and expressing his regret that , in order to act upon the new line of operations in time to avoid the dangers of pestilence at Vera Cruz , it would be necessary to reduce General Taylor for a time to stand on the defensive . In this letter , and a subsequent one from New Orleans , he also informed General Taylor that he should be at Camargo in order freely to consult with him . When , however , General Scott arrived at the Brazos Santiago on the 27th of December , he learned that General Wool , with his column , was at Paras ; General Worth at Saltillo ; General Butler at Monterey ; General Patterson on the march from Matamoras to Victoria ; and General Taylor himself with Twiggs ' Division of Regulars and Quitman 's Brigade of Volunteers , in m arch from Monterey to Victoria . These movements and dispositions were undertaken by General Taylor , as he explained in a communication to the War Department , dated December 8 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IViadre . This communication was not , however , known to General Scott at that time , and it has been seen that his design was not to occupy the extensive line which General Taylor had thus marked out for defence , but only leave with the latter a sufficient force for the defence of Monterey and the line of communications thence to the Rio Grande , and embark with the remaining force for Vera Cruz , with a view to ulterior operations against the capital . // qwq had been elected President and gone to GENERAL ORDERS the city of Mexico ; that detachments of IVo. 20. the Mexican army have been sent from 1 . It may well be apprehended that many San Luis in the direction of Vera Cruz , grave offences not provided for in the act of and that the army at San Luis were Congress " establishing rules and articles for // 286 General TVin.fleld Scott . the government of the armies of the United States , " approved April 10 , 1806 , may be again committed-by , or upon , individuals of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Republics . Allusion is here made to atrocities , any one of which , if committed within the United States or their organized territories , would , of course , he tried and severely punished by the ordinary or civil courts of the land . 2 . Assassination ; murder ; malicious stabbing or maiming ; rape ; malicious assault and battery ; robbery ; theft ; the wanton desecration of churches , cemeteries or other religious edifices and fixtures , and the destruction , except by order of a superior officer , of public or private propcrty , are such offences . 3 . The good of the service , the honor of the United States and the interests of humanity , imperiously demand that every crime , enumerated above , should be severely punished . 4 . But the written code , as above , commonly called the rules and articles of war , provides for the punishment of not one of those crimes , even when committed by individuals of the army upon the persons or property of other individuals of the same , except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor for like outrages , committed by the same individuals , upon the persons or property of a hostile country , except very partially , in the 51st , 52d , and 55th articles ; and the same code is absolutely silent as to all injuries which may be inflicted upon individuals of the army , or their property , against the laws of war , by individuals of a hostile country . 5. it is evident that the 99th article , independent of any reference to the restriction in the 87th , is wholly nugatory in reaching any one of those high crimes . 6 . For all the offences , therefore , enumerated in the second paragraph above , which may be committed abroad-in , by , or upon the army , a supplemental code is absolutely needed . 7 . That unwritten code is Martial Law , as an addition to the written military code , prescribed by Congress in the rules and articles of war , and which unwritten code , all armies , in hostile countries , are forced to adopt-not only for their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their property , about the theatres of military operations , against injuries contrary to the laws of war . 8 . From the same supreme necessity , mar tial law is hereby declared , as a supplemental code in , and about , all camps , posts and hospitals which may be occupied by any part of the forces of the United States , in Mexico , and in , and about , all columns , escorts , convoys , guards and detachments , of the said forces , while engaged in prosecuting the existing war in , and against the said republic . 9 . Accordingly , every crime , enumerated in paragraph , No. 2 , above , whether committed -1 . By any inhabitant of Mexico , sojourner or traveller therein , upon the person or property of any individual of the United States ' forces , retainer or follower of the same ; 2 . By any individual of the said forces , retainer or follower of the same , upon the person or property of any inhabitant of Mexico , sojourner or traveller therein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retainer or follower of the same , upon the person or property of any other individual of the said forces , retainer or follower of the same-shall be duly tried and punished under the said supplemental code . 10 . For this purpose it is ordered , that all offenders , in the matters aforesaid , shall be promptly seized and confined , and reported , for trial , before iIilitar'y Commissions to be duly appointed as follows : 11 . Every military commission , under this order , will be appointed , governed and limited , as prescribed by the 65th , 66th , 67th , and 97th of the said rules and articles of war , and the proceedings of such commissions will be duly recorded , in writing , reviewed , revised , disapproved or approved , and the sentences executed-all , as in the cases of the proceedings and sentences of courts-martial ; provided , that no military commission shall try any case clearly cognizable by any court-martial , and provided also that no sentence of a military commission shall be put in execution against any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nature and degree of the offence , as established by evidence , in conformity with known punishments* in like cases , in some one of the States of the United States of America . 12 . This order will be read at the head of every company of the United States ' forces , serving in Mexico , or about to enter on that theatre of war . By command of Major General ScoTT : As early as May , 1846 , General Scott had presented for the consideration of the Secretary of War the project of a law giving expressly to military couits in an enemies ' country the authority above indicated . Congress did not , however , act upon the recommendation , and it appears by letters from General Taylor , dated October 6th and October 11th , 1846 , that the " most shameful atrocities " were committed by individuals among the troops , without punishment . In the letter of General Taylor of October 1 1 th , he reports a cold-blooded murder as having been committed in the streets of Monterey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proper disposition of the culprit . " The Secretary replied , November 25th , ; 1846 : " The competency of a military tribunal to take cognisance of such a case as you have presented in your communicatioa of the 11th ult. , viz , the murder of a Mexican soldier , and other offences not embraced in the express provision of the articles of war , was deemed so questionable that an application was made to Congress , at the last session , to bring them expressly within the jurisdiction of such a tribunal ; but it was not acted on . I am not prepared to say that , under the peculiar circumstances of the case , and particularly by the non-existence of any civil authority to which the offender could be turned over , a military court could not rightfully act thereon ; yet very serious doubts are entertained upon that point , and the government do not advise that course . It seriously regrets that such a flagrant offender can not be dealt with in the manner he deserves . I see no other course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement , and send him away from the army ; and this is recommended . It is intended to invite the attention of Congress again to this subject , in order to have provision made for such cases ; but it can not be so done as to operate ex rost facto , and of course will not embrace the case in question . " This letter of the Secretary of War was written after General Scott had left Washington , and when the Secretary had before him , a project from General Scott , dated October 8th , in which the views embodied in his martial law order , afterwards issued , were recommended for the action of the Executive . Such were the circumstances under which the order was issued ; but , in the opinion of General Scott , " the good of the service , the honor of the United States , and the interests of humanity , " demanded that the numerous grave offences which he recapitulated , should not go unpunished ; and , upon assuming command of the Army of Mexico , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His order was rigidly executed , and victories were won , but not abused , and the horrors which usually attend the steps of undisciplined troops in an enemies ' country , so far meliorated as to challenge the admi ration of the civilized world , and of the conquered people themselves . We will not dilate upon the skill and science displayed during the military operations attending the embarkation and landing of the troops for the investment and siege of Vera Cruz , but simply remark , notwithstanding the denunciations of a political sentimentalist , ( Mr. William Jay , ) that if Vera Cruz had been carried by assault and not by siege , the sufferings of the Mexicans must have been far greater than actually happened , while the Americans instead of losing all told but 65 men in killed and wounded , must have lost hundreds . General Scott 's first care in all his operations was for his own army , but that his HUMANITY has never been deadened by the horrors of war , is evinced by his whole life , as well as by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vera Cruz-his notification in advance to the foreign Consuls in that city , and his dispatches to the Secretary of War , especially that of March 25 , in which he reports " All the batteries , iNos. 1,2,3,4 , and 5 , are in awful activity . " If members of peace societies , instead of attacking those who risk their lives in the service of their country , would preach a more enlarged civilization ; if they would go farther and teach by example and precept the blessed truths of the Christian religion , and thus possibly hasten the happy millenium , where universal equality and fraternity will no longer be simply an aspiration , but a reality , there would then be no more wars or rumors of wars . But until this consummation has been reached , would it not be well for such persons to reflect , living as they do under a Goverment instituted with the consent of the governed , that their first duty is to obey the laws of their country , and if needs be , hazard their lives for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience to law and the lawful commands of their government . Ought they not to furnish for the regulation of nations , some more authoritative exponent of the will of God , than the crude interpretations of their own consciences ? and also in charity recollect , that in the present condition of the world , the destruction of all society must necessarily follow the establishment of the doctrine that the conscience of every man is to be // 288 General Winfield Scott . qwq again , the recent killed , wounded and sick , together with the garrison of Miscoague ( the then general dep6t ) and that of Tacubaya , was but 7,180 ; and , finally , after deducting the new garrison of Chapultipec , with the killed and wounded of the two days , we took possession ( September 14 , ) of this great capital with less than 6,000 men ! And I re-assert , upon accumulated and unquestionable evidence , that , in not one of those conflicts was this army opposed by fewer than three and a half times its numbers-in several of them-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we arrived in the basin of Mexico August 19 , 20 . Killed 137 , including 14 officers ; wounded 877 , includiug 62 officers ; missing , probably killed , 38 rank and file-total , 1,052 . September 8 . Killed 116 , including 9 officers ; wounded 665 , including 49 officers ; missing 18 , rank and file-total 799 . September 12 , 13 , 14 . Killed 130 , inelading 10 officers ; wounded 703 , including 68 officers ; missing , 29 rank and file-total , 862 . Grand total losses 2,713 , inc luding 212 officers . On the other hand this small force has beaten , on the same occasions-in view of their capital  --  the whole Mexican army , of ( at the beginning ) thirty odd thousand men-posted , always , in chosen positionsbehind entrenchments , or more formidable defences of nature and art ; - killed or wounded of that number , more than 7,000 officers and men ; - taken 3,730 prisoners , one-seventh officers , including thirteen generals , of whom three had been Presidents of this Republic ; captured more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides fifty-seven wall pieces , 20,000 small arms , an immense quantity of shots , shells , powder , &amp;c . Of that army , once so formidable in numbers , appointments , artillery , &amp;c. , twenty odd thousand have disbanded themselves in despair-leaving , as is known , not more than three fragments  --  the largest about 2,500-now wandering in different directions , without magazines or a military chest , and living at free q*tarters upon their own people . " This blow was followed up by General Scott in devising and commencing the cxcVOL . VI . NO . II . NEW SERIES . cution of a wise system for the collection of revenue and the government of the conquered country , which would itself make an interesting chapter in the history of the Mexican war . But we hasten to the end . The Mexicans were now without resources . A treaty was soon negotiated by our Commissioner Mr. Trist . It was ratified by the Senate with but slight alterations , and is now the existing treaty of amity and limits with Mexico . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What was his reward ? In the very Capital to which he had been borne by his victorious troops , he was " stricken from his high command " by the flat of the Administration , and ordered to appear in the presence of Mexicans as an accused person , before a court designated by that authority which had shown " a set purpose " to crush him , since the commencement of the war . And what was the shallow pretext which the Administration offered to extenuate this course of conduct ? Strip it of its verbiage-it was this and nothing more . The Administration had issued an order denouncing the publication of private reports of military operations , as tending , necessarily , from their ex-parte nature , to do injustice to the great body of officers , who did not endeavor to gain reputation at the expense of their brother officers by such means . This order of the Administration General Scott undertook to enforce , but instead of being sustained by the authority which issued it , he was deprived of his command , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charges for the enf rcement of discipline was stigniiatized as quarrels , and General Scott , a victor in many battles , the successful executor of a plan of operations resulting in the conquest of a peace , came to his home suffering from disease , contracted in the line of his duty , and accused by the Executive Administration . The nomination of General Taylor for the Presidency , which soon after followed , relieved General Scott from further active persecution by Mr. Polk 's Administration , and he has , until called to Washington by President Fillmore , been residing quietly in New York , with but little connection with public functionaries , but as ever deeply interested in the perpetuity of the Union , and the honor and glory of the American name .
