txt A HISTORY OF THE DJYINING ROD ; WiTH THE ADVENTURES OF AN OLD EODSMAN . ( CONCLUDED . ) THE first trial of the powers of the new mineral rod , was made on the coffers of a man who lived a few rods from " the Commodore , " and was thought to have a considerable sum of specie in his house . It was strongly attracted that way , and the operator said there must be a large amount to draw it so powerfully . The man being credulous , and easily alarmed , and happening to have three or four hundred silver dollars in his house , complained loudly of " the Commodore , " as exposing him to be robbed , and immediately deposited his money , for safe-keeping , in the bank . This highly gratified the old rodsman , and established both his character and his faith in the use of the rod . In the course of his various voyagas upand down the Ohio , he became acquainted with a boatman , named John Steel , whose father was intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians from near Red Stone , Old Fort ; " who , in their return , passed down the waters of Grave Creek . At their encampment , one of the Indians , after a short absence , returned with a deer skin full of lead ore , yet dripping with water , which they melted into bullets . He said it was only a l*ew miles from the mouth of the creek , and that the Indians had covered the opening in the bed of the stream , from which the ore was taken , with a flat stone . This story he had often related to his son . " The Commodore " tried to persuade him to go with him in search of it , believing that if he could arrive anywhere in the vicinity of the mine , he could find it with // his rod . After several applications to Steel , he finally consented to come to Manilla and make the trial . Accordingly , in September , ' 1828 , they left home in a canoe , accompanied by B. Devoe , a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious science of alchimy , at which he had experimented for several years , with a stock of meal and bread for a two weeks ' tour . After reachi*ig the mouth of Grave Creek , seventy miles above the outlet of Muskingum , they pushed up it to the fords . Here Steel was unable to decide whether his father had said the mine was on the right *r the left hand branch . " The Commodore " answered that it was of no cons*quence , as he could decide it with his rod ; he having for some time past referred all doubtful questions to the superior intelligence of this talisman with satisfactory results . Stepping ashore , on to the point of land between the forks , he set , and flourished the instrument , in the true scientific manner , when it pointed towards the left hand branch . Up this they therefore marched , with their tools and baggage , leaving the canoe at the shore ; the water being too lo*v for further navigation . After spending two days in examining the borders and bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten or fifteen miles up , without finding the mine , they began to think they had either taken the wrong branch , or that some slip in the banks had covered it up . While debating the matter , and while Devoe was engaged in pulling out great lumps of iron ore , with his mattock , which filled the hill sides , it so happened that the land surveyor of the county was running a line near them , and found the party at their researches . After the usual salutatiomis , and seeing they were strangers , he inquired the cause of their visit and business in this remote place . " The Commodore " frankly told him they were searching for a lead mine he had heard of in that neighborhood , and that he expected to find it with his mineral rod. * The surveyor had heard of their wonderful powers in finding lost mines and other articles , but expressed his doubts of its truth , and told " the Commodore , " that if he could find some curious stcne monnments that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm their virtue , and feast him and his company at his house , not far distant , as long as they would stay . " Enough said , " replied the old rodsman ; " I will give it a try . " So putting the rod in order , and raising it to a perpendicular , on a level with his head , he turned round on his feet to each point of the compass , *vatchiumg carefully in whst direction it leaned . After repeating this movement two or three times to his satisfaction , and finding it moved towards a certain direction each time , he lowered the instrument and started off in the course pointed out ; the surveyor and Devoe a few rods behind , with Steel and the chain carriers close at his heels . The man looked at Devoe with a smile , as much as to say , he is on the right course . After going about two hundred yards , he stopped and again set the rod , to be sure that he had not deviated from the right line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Devoe , " lla* he ever been here before V ' lie answered , " No , he thought he never had . " " Well , " said he , " the course he is now on is as direct as I could lay it with my compass . " When they had travelled about three miles , or It is a well known law in godogy , ihat lead amid iron are not found in the same formations ; so that no fault cotdd be attributed to the rod br aoL fiudiug what did not eKist. // within a quarter of a mile of the monuments , " the Commodore " stopped , and said " We are within a short distance of them , as I know by the trembling of the rod . " The whole course was in the woods , which , here , was full of underbrush , and the progress slow , occupying about an hour and a half in accomplishing it . The surveyor was greatly astonish .. ed , and said to Devoe , " Is your old friend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigh to one , " was the reply . It so happened , that the monuments were on the man 's farm , and as they approached a field which lay across the line of attraction , " the Commodore " pointed out the course , and said , " They are over yonder , near the foot of that rise . " As they deviated round the corner of the fence , instead of crossing the lot , they soon came up to them . They proved to be a cluster of flat stones , four in number , set in the earth ; about two feet wide , three or four inches thick , and from six to eight feet high . Some of them were partly fallen , and stood leaning considerably from a perpendicular . The largest , and one the next in size , had a number of curious characters , or " Harlo .. griffigs , " as " the Commodore " called them in relating the story , cut on their faces . The most of them were much weather-*vorn and indistinct . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their origin was equally obscure , as they had been found there when this part of the country was first settled , about the year 1773 . The surveyor then said he should like to know by what people they had been erected , but did not suppose that would ever be discovered . Much elated with his success so far , the old man replied , " If anybody can do it , I c*tn , and will consult the rod in this matter . " When inquiries were to be made as to the discovery of anything but minerals , such as stray animals , stolen goods , &amp;c , his course of procedure was to swear the rod . It may seem to some people to be irreverent , if not blasphemous ; but by those who knew the man , it was thought he did it hi sincerity , and a confident belief in the virtue of the rod ; which he Lupposed must be indued wtth some supernatural power , or it could not make such strange discoveries . Having uncovered his bald head , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , administered in a solenin tone the usual form of an oath ; directing it to tell him the truth to such questions as he should ask , in relation to these monuments . He then inquired whether the French , the Spaniards , the English , the Dutch , the R*-mans , and several other nations , had erected them ; to all which the rod remained immovable . Finally he asked if it was the Welsh , or the same people who had built the mounds . To this it gave a gentle nod , which the rodsman knew , from former trials , meant yes . A few years after this curious adventuie , the great mound near the mouth of Grove Creek , was opened and carefully explored . Amongst many other singular relics of that ancient people who erected it , was found in one of the vaults , a small flat stone , covered on one side with characters and letters of the old Saxon and Welsh langua*es ; a full description of which , with a fac simile of the relic , was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ethnological Society , in New-York ; thus confirming the sagacity of " the Commodore " and his talismanic rod . The surveyor intimated a desire to know how long it was since the erection of these monuments ? The same ceremonies were again performed , and various periods of time named , until tho answer was , " fifteen hundred years before the discovery of America // by Columbus ; " which is probably about the actual time of the building of the earth-works in the valley of the Ohio ; as is partly confirmed by the age of the immense trees found growing on these ruins , when first noticed by the whites . The ceremonies here terminated , much to the wonder and astonishment of all present , even to the old rodsman himself who never before had witnessed so plain a demonstration of the marvellous powers of the divining rod . The exploring party was liberally and freely feasted for that day and following night at the man 's house , which stood not far from the monuments . While here , " the Commodore " regaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures . He was very anxious to learn the art of making them ; and said he would come down to his house for that purpose , and pay any price he would in reason demand . He accompanied the party the next day , by a shorter route than the one by which they ascended the creek , to their canoe , and from thence to the mouth . They left here on their way home , about sunset . Two or three miles below , in " the narrows , " is a huge rock , which had tumbled out of the cliffs above , and lies at the edge of the water , called " Kate 's * ock . " It is a spot well known to all the old keel-boat-men as a difficult pass in ascending the Ohio , from the strong current around the base of the rock . Somewhere on the opposite , or Ohio shore of the river , on the second bottom , are several small mounds , in one of which was buried an iron pot full of silver and gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were on their way to Kentucky in the early settlement of that country to purchase lands . As they descended the Ohio in a canoe , with a frontier's-man as a pilot , a little belo*v " Kate 's Rock " they discovered a large party of Indians crossing the river on rafts and bark canoes ; they hastened to the opposite shore , and taking out their money , blankets , and iron pot for cooking , fled into the woods . The money being heavy , a thousand or two dollars , they concluded to bury it in a small mound they found near the base of the hills , as a spot more readily recognized . They dug a hole , and placing in it the pot , covered it with a flat stone , over which they threw earth and leaves . Fearing to proceed on their voyage , or return to the canoe , they travelled back to Wheeling , and ascended the river to Fort Pitt . On their route up they again met a party of Indians , and two of their riumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This so disheartened and alarmed the remaining one , that he re-crossed the mountains and went home to England . The fact of the buried money was known to only one or two persons ; one of these , an early settler of Kentucky , it seems , had met the Englishman when on his way back , and learnt these particulars . " The Corrimodore " in one of his voyages down the river had met with this man , and got from him a certificate of the locality , who was to receive one-half of the treasure if found , and the old rodsman the other . He had tried several times before this to find it in his trips , but being generally in haste , the land cleared of the forest trees , and the peol ) le about , he could not make a fair trial without being seen . It was now nirht , and a favorable time for such an adventure ; so taking Steel with him to carry the tools , and leaving Devoe in charge of the canoe , he elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mounds . In about two hours he returned , in a very ill humor , and reported that he found the mound very readily , and after digging a few feet he came to the flat stone over the pot , when Steel involuntarily cried out , // 321 " By the Lord we have got it ! " when instantly , with a low rumbling sound , it settled down out of sight . It is said such searches must always be conducted in silence , as the sound of the human voice irritates the evil spirit who has charge of hidden treasures , and they vanish away . It is , however , by no means certain that the flat stone was the one which covered the pot , for nearly all mounds have more or less flat stones in their bases , placed there by their builders , to inclose the dead hod y , before heaping up the mound . Raccoons and ground hogs often burrow in the mounds , and the stone most probably sunk into an excavation of this kind . The night being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated homeward , where they arrived the next day , much improved in their stock of experience , but none in their worldly wealth . " The Commodore " now for several years applied diligently to his calling of- transporting merchandise up and down the river ; occasionally during the winter months making short excursions into the adjacent regions in search of lead mines , which were said to have been worked by the friendly Indians when they visited this part of Ohio , and spent a winter in hunting at the commencement of the war in 1811 , to avoid the tribes hostile to the Americans . Pieces of lead ore , of one or two pounds weight , are sometimes picked up on the surface of the earth , probably scattered there by the aborigines , and brought from Kentucky or Illinois , the nearest known lead mines . These always awakened curiosity , and were counted as certain evidences of lead mines in the vicinity . Lead , however , is never found in a region abounding in argillaceous iron ores , stone coal and sandstone ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead-bearing rock . lie used at other times to display the powers of this wonderful rod in discovering lost articles . A man consulted him , who had lost a trunk in landing from a steam-boat , by the upsetting of the skiff in the dark . " The Commodore " told him that it was taken up by a person who lived on " Goose Island , " near the head of Letart Falls , about forty miles below ; that there was some money in the trunk as well as clothing , but the finder was an honest man , and he would get it again . He went down and found it as predicted . His friend Devoe once lost a large flat-boat in the night , bya sudden rise in the river ; he applied to the old rodsman , who , after due consultation with his talisman , told him it was taken up at a wood-yard , eight miles below the mouth of the Muskingum , about daylight that morning . By inquiry of the mail-carrier , he ascertained that such a boat was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he took it up about daylight , confirming the truth of the diviner . Being constantly on , or about the river , arid knowing when the rise of water took place , he could easily calculate the time required for the current to float a boat eight miles , and thus make a near estimate of the place it would reach at daylight . The keeper of the wood-yard being on the look out for drift prizes , at all sudden rises of the water , would be early up , and probably take Devoe ' s floating craft at daybreak ; so that in his responses , like the priests of the oracle at Delphos , of old , he was aided by a combination of circumstances , which a shrewd mind could turn to account . his talismanic oracle , however , was never ambiguous like theirs ; but always gave a plain answer . He undertook no other great mineral achievement , after the adventure at Grave Creek , until the autumn of the year 1834 . The man Steel , who had put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XXvi. - No . CXLiI. 3 // since been occasionally employed by " the Commodore " in his boating business , although his home was somewhere below Gallipolis . During the long nights of autumn , after the day 's work was done , and the evening meal over , it was customary for him to converse on the subject uppermost in his mind  --  the existence of rich mines of the precious metals . Amongst other localities which Steel named , as affording silver ore , was the region of country on the headwaters of the Big Sandy and the Clinch rivers , in the Cumberland mountains , on the borders of Tennessee and North Carolina-where his father had formerly lived-fifteen miles above the " Boat-yard , " in the hounds of the former state . He bad assisted in digging the ore , and melted out pure silver ; a small bar of which he once had in his possession , and sold to a silver-smith in Cincinnati . For thirty or forty years the region on the head of the Big Sandy had been the head-quarters of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was pretended , from rich silver mines , known only to themselves . Like the noted bands of rogues in London , who are designnted by some cant phrase , these mountain bandits were known all over that region by the name of " Cogniacs : " and the half .. dollars , which they chiefly coined , were called " Cogniac dollars . " A regular trade was carried on between them , the horse thieves , and other western rogues , in this money , one hundred dollars of these pieces being exchanged for fifty of real silver . They are so well executed that thousands of them are in general circulation , and oftentimes taken in and paid out at the banks as genuine coin . The body of the piece is copper , whitened by arsenic , and coated over with a thin layer of silver ; so that a simple examination with a file or a knife does not detect the cheat , and is only discovered by a chemical process . These bands , though often ferreted out by the strong arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dens and caves of the mountains . This account of the silver mines in that remote region , awakened in " the Commodore " a vehement desire to visit them ; as , by the aid of his mineral rod , he felt assured he could select the richest of the veins arid appropriate the treasure to his own use . Steel having consented to go with him , they , in September , 1834 , started on the journey with two horses , both of which were blind-aiid for this reason cheap  --  and could not stray far away from their night encampments . The distance was about four hundred miles  --  the larger portion of which was through a mountainous and wilderness region , very sparsely inhabited . He took with him fifteen dollars in money , some provisions , and two pair of stout leather portmanteaux , for their baggage , and to briiig back the silver ore . Passing down the Ohio river , to the mouth of the Little Kenawha , he struck out southerly across the country , following an old Indian trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early journies with pack horses , to the salt works above Charleston , on the Big Kenawha , and came out on to that river at the mouth of Elk , distant about ninety miles from his home . After crossing the Kenawba , he passed up Little Coaly , a large branch of the latter river , to near its head , and thence travelled over a very mountainous country to Logan County Court House , on the Guyandotte river . The head waters of this river and the Big Sandy interlock with the Clinch , a branch of the Tennessee , in the " White Top Mountains , " belonging to the Cumberland range . In their passage to the Ohio river , these streams traverse the most wild and picturesque re // 32*i religion to be found in Western Virginia ; abounding in immense hills of sand rocks , cut into deep ravines by the water-courses , containing caverns of various sizes and extent . It was formerly the most famous hunting ground for bears in all the country , and still contains many of these animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most favorite food in exhaustless abundance , as well as safe retreats for their winter dormitories , in its numerous caves . He is not strictly a carnivorous animal ; but like the hog , feeds chiefly on vegetable food . The ridges are covered with whole forests of chestnuts , and the hill sides clothed with oaks , on whose fruits they luxuriate and fatten , until their glossy hides afford the finest of peltry , and their flesh the richest and most palatable food . About forty-five years ago , when the wars of Europe had increased the demand for their skins , from six to eight thousand of these animals were killed in one year . For the last thirty years , the attention of the sojourners of these wild regions has been turned to the gathering of the roots of the ginseng , ( panax quinqu*folia . ) This beautiful plant grows with great luxuriance , and in the most wonderful abundance , in the rich virgin soil of the hill arid mountain sides . For a long period of time , the forests have afforded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed at remote points along the watercourses . No part of America , east of the Mississippi , furnishes a more stately growth of forest trees ; embracing all the species of the climate . The lofty liriodendron , or yellow poplar , attains the height of eighty or a hundred feet without a limb ; having a shaft of from four to six feet in diameter . The white and black oak are its rivals in size . Immense magnolias , of the variety acuminata , tower aloft to an altitude uncommon in any other region , while their more humble relatives , the tripelala and mycrophylla , flourish in great beauty by their sides . It may be considered the storehouse for building future cities on the Ohio , when the prolific pines of the Alleghany river are exhausted . In addition to all these vegetable riches , the hills are full of fine beds of bituminous coal and argillaceous iron ores . Lower down , on the Big Sandy , is a bed of nice cannel coal , and deeper in the earth copious fountains of saline water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carburetted hydrogen gas bursts from the around in several places along the margin of the river , and when discharged through a pool , or spring of water , it is called " a burning spring . " Some of these are so copious that , when ignited , they will boil the meat in the camp kettles of the hunters . More recently , at the salines on the Big Kenawha , where wells have been sunk to the depth of fifteen hundred feet in search of stronger brine , so abundant is the flow of gas , that it is used at several furnaces in the mariufacture of salt ; thus saving much labor and expense in fuel . The inhabi .. tants of this secluded mountain country , cut off from all intercourse with the rest of the world , are as primitive in their dress and manners as the hills around them . Their clothes are chiefly fabricated from the dressed skins of the deer ; as well the women as the men . This article is well adapted to their occupation of digging " sang roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which affords much of their animal food . Mounted astride , on the back of a little pony , on top of a huge bag of roots , the women were har- ! ly to be distinguished from the men . Huts , covered with bark , were erected in the most productive localities for ginseng ; and the months of August and September , when the plant is in // perfection , were spent in its collection . A little corn meal , made on large tin graters , and baked into cakes in the embers , with some sour milk and jerked meat , constituted their food . Their code of morals was as rude and aboriginal as their diet . The men often exchanged their wives with each other , giving or taking some article as the difference in value ; and sometimes sold them outright for a desirable horse or a fine rifle gun . Amongst these wild denizens of the mountains , " the Commodore " journeyed for nearly a week at free cost , as none of them could change a five dollar bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes the narrow horse-path led through gorges , cut by the mountain torrents , so deep that the sunshine only reached them for a few hours in the middle of the day ; and at others ascended amongst loose rocks to the tops of the ridges , one or two thousand feet high , affording a wild* and almost boundless sweep to the eye , over the forests of the mountain ranges . Along the water-courses the inhabitants cultivated small patches of Indian corn and potatoes , and having generally a cow or two , he could get milk and corn-bread with a little meat . They were kind and hospitable to strangers , travellers being seldom seen amongst them , and charged little or nothing for the food of either man or beast . Wherever he went , his main conversation was about silver mines and mineral rods ; . and so interesting and wonderful was it to the minds of these simple people , that any lodging or food they could furnish him was hardly an equivalent for the entertainment afforded them by his stories , which were heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mineral region , the rocks changed from sand-stones to a transition and primitive character . Fragments of slate , quartz and chert , were scattered on the surface of the earth ; and on the heads of the Holstein , the prevailing rock in the mountains was granite . In the Roane and Smoky Mountain ranges , by the measurement of Professor Troost , in his geology of Tennessee , the highest peaks in this quarter attain an altitude of seven thousand feet ; towering above any other mountains in the United States east of the Mississippi river . His route led him by the falls of the Clinch , in Russel county , Virginia , where he visited a large bed of the red oxide of iron ore , which " the Commodore " mistook for cobalt-not being much skilled in the true character of minerals-and brought back a few small pieces for experiment . The legends of rich minerals , in the mountain ranges which supply the head branches of the Tennessee river , on the borders of the States of North Carolina and Tennessee , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration of this quarter , at a subsequent period , found several specimens of gold , silver , and lead ores , with an abundance of manganese , and magnetic iron in rich veins ; so that this is truly an interesting and actual mineral region . H igher up , near the head of the Holstein , are extensive beds of Plaster of Paris , and deep in the earth vast deposits of mineral salt ; specimens of which have been brought up by the auger in boring wells for salt water . At the falls of the Clinch river " the Commodore " met with an old man , a brother professor of the divining rod , the legs of whose instrument were made of brass wire , twisted spirally , rendering it very sensible to the slightest impressions . He passed a day with him , greatly to his edification ; and ascertained from his experience and observations , many things in relation to the mines of that region , with the best route in approaching // 325 them . About four days ' travel from the falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the farm where his companion Steel was born and formerly lived . The rod was now put in operation , and directed him to a place where the ground was filled with heavy lumps of brown ore , whose fracture was shining . The surface of the mineral was studded with protuberances , designated in the books as " mammillary ; aptly likened by " the Commocore " to a toad 's back . This he had no doubt was the silver ore he had travelled so far to find , and felt highly elated at the success of his journey , fancying hirrself in a fair way to wealth and independence . To strengthen his faith , he here met with a man who had his saddle-bags loaded with lumps of a white looking metal , as large as goose eggs , which he said he had melted out himself from ore near there . He also saw the owner of an iron furnace near " Copper Ridge , " who had melted a white metal from some ore he found in that vicinity . A large " loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forge , and laid on the anvil to draw out into a bar . The first blow of the hammer shattered it into a thousand pieces , burning the faces and hands of the forgemen . " The Commodore " pronounced the metal to have been zinc , and not silver . To render the ore tight and as transportable as possible , they spent a day or two in roasting it in large log fires , and then selected the finest looking portions , l ) reaking them up with hammers . Having filled their leather bags with about a hundred pounds each , as much as the horses could conveniently carry over the rough mountain roads , they turned their faces homewards , leading the animals by the bridle . In their journey back they came down the " Tug Fork " of the Sandy ; which stream for about one hundred miles from the mouth , makes the boundary line between Kentucky and Virginia . This branch received the odd name of " Tug " from the following incident in the early history of the country : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies of soldiers , was fitted out by order of Governor Dinwiddie , of Virginia , to invade the Indian towns on the Sciota river . To avoid discovery they took an unfrequented route from New River , over on to the heads of the south branch of Sandy , instead of the usual course down the Big Kenawha . They proceeded along this fork until they came to the " burning spring , " three or four days march from the Ohio . By this time their salt provisions , brought out on pack horses , was exhausted . They here killed two buffaloes , and left their skins hanging on a tree near the spring . The party proceeded to the mouth of Sandy , but being out of food , and having received orders by a messenger from the governor to proceed no further , they returned . It was late in November when they arrived at the spring ; hunger pressed them so hard , that the two buffalo skins were cut into strips or thongs , the hair singed off over the flames of the burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance , the south-east branch of Sandy was ever after called the " Tug Fork , " from the resemblance these thongs bore to those used in that day for traces or tugs in harness , by the backwoodsmen . " The Commodore " proceeded down the Sandy to the Ohio river , and then up that stream , on the Virginia shore , to the ferry opposite Gallipolis ; the toll for crossing was twenty-five cents , being the last remnant of his money , obliging him to proceed the rest of his journey , sixty or seventy miles , on credit , the best way he could ; and glad was he when the welcome sight of his own house met his eyes , after an absence of six weeks . // Having rested his weary frame a few days , the next thing to be done was to devise a plan for smelting the silver ore . At this time there was living with him , in a part of his house , a man who had considerable skill in metallurgy , having worked for several years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " philosopher 's stone . " With his assistance and direction , a small furnace of bricks was erected in his chamber , and the flue conducted into the chimney . Here their cpera. * tions could be carried on in secret , and not excite the curiosity of the neighbours . Large crucibles were procured , a quantity of the silver ore , with proper fluxes put in , and the strong blast of a small blacksmith 's bellows applied to the furnace . Hour after hour the process of melting was watched with intense interest by the operators ; but the metal refused to flow . A more vehement heat was now applied , and kept up for twentyfour hours , so obstinate and refractory was the ore , until the fire descending through the hearth of the furnace , began to ignite the wood of the chamber floor and sleepers on which it was built , and " the Commodore 's " house narrowly escaped destruction . The furnace was then suffered to cool , as the obstinacy of the supposed silver ore had bid defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arise as to its true character ; and some of it was shown to a mineralogist , who had a cabinet of ores , for his opinion ; he at once pronounced it to be " manganese , " an ore much more refractory than iron , and in no way related to silver . It was a great mortification to the old rodsman , that after so much labor and expense , his silver ore should prove a worthless mineral . He sat down however , very quietly under the disappointment , attributing the mistake more to his own ignorance than to any defect in the virtue of the rod and to the day of his death , was firm in the belief , that the region in the heads of the Holstein abounded in silver ore . cONcLUsION . In p ersun " the Commodore " was rather short , thick-set , and stoutbuilt . He had a full , broad forehead , the ' mark of intellect , which early becoming bald , gave him quite a venerable aspect * small twinkling gray eyes , rather deep-set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a frank , open expression of face , denoting a condition of mind ready to believe any tale that was related with apparent sincerity , however marvellous it might be ; complexion sanguine , but tanned and weather beaten , from his exposure to great hardships both on the salt water and the fresh . The collar of his shirt was open both summer and winter ; and his neck hardened by exposure to heat and cold , so as to bid defiance to coughs and catarrhs . In all cases of emergency he was forward , bold , and resolute ; mounting , when sixty years old , the tallest ladders on to the roofs of burning buildings , and amidst the fire and smoke performing deeds of daring , that few youn*er men would think of attempting . In times of flood he was equally actiVe ; pushing his boat through the rushing waters under the windows of the deluged houses , and removing the inhabitants and their effects to places of safety , without fee or reward ; deeming it a duty to aid and succor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural turn for physic , and was always ready with some certain remedy for any disease he happened to n-meet with in his intercourse with the // sick ; these were chiefly drawn from roots and plants in the woods . His most infallible medicine , however , was a large jug of " Hot stuff " as he called it , made from brandy , cayenne pepper and spices . This he al ' ays carried with him in his boating voyages , and applied inside and out1 was a sure cure for nearly all the ailments of humanity . His political views were purely democratic ; hating cordially all monopolies , banks and chartered privileges . In religious belief , although once a " Free-will Baptist , " he was in his latter years a thorough Universalist ; believing that all mankind would be finally saved , and however vile , made pure and holy . For bringing this about , . he had a process peculiarly his own . He compared the soul of a vile man at death , to a puddle of fetid , putrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particles of vapor which rose from it , were pure and sweet , forming the clouds and nice clear rainwater . Thus , he said , the souls of the wicked at death would be cleansed , and ascend to Heaven in a purified state .
