txt //am authorized to say that there is not a fictitious name nor place in the whole volume ; but that names and places are literally given , and that every transaction therein described actually transpired . Perhaps the best Preface to this volume is furnished in the following letter of Mr. Douglass , written in answer to my urgent solicitation for such a work : ROCHESTER , N. Y. July 2 , 1855 . DEAR FRIEND : I have long entertained , as you very well know , a somewhat positive repugnance to writing or speaking anything for the public , which could , with any degree of plausibilty , make me liable to the imputation of seeking personal notoriety , for its own sake . Entertaining that feeling very sincerely , and permitting its control , perhaps , quite unreasonably , I have often2 refused to narrate my personal experience in public anti-slavery meetings , and in sympathizing circles , when urged to do so by friends , with whose views and wishes , ordinarily , it were a pleasure to comply . In my letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of Slavery in the light of fundamental principles , and upon facts , notorious and open to all ; making , I trust , no more of the fact of my own former enslavement , than circumstances seemed absolutely to require . I have never placed my opposition to slavery on a basis so narrow as my own enslavement , but rather upon the indestructible and unchangeable laws of human nature , every one of which is perpetually and flagrantly violated by the slave system . I have also felt that it was best for those having histories worth the writing  --  or supposed to be so  --  to commit such work to hands other than their own . To write of one 's self , in such a manner as not to incur the imputation of weakness , vanity , and egotism , is a work within the ability of but few ; and I have little reason to believe that I belong to that fortunate few . These considerations caused me to hesitate , when first you kindly urged me to prepare for publication a full account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freeman . Nevertheless , I see , with you , many reasons for regarding my autobiography as exceptional in its character , and as being , in some sense , naturally beyond the reach of those reproaches which honorable and sensitive minds dislike to incur . It is not to illustrate any heroic achievements of a man , but to vindicate a just and beneficent principle , in its application to the whole human family , by letting in the light of truth upon a system , esteemed by some as a blessing , and by others as a curse and a crime . I agree with you , that this system is now at the bar of public opinion  --  not only of this country , but of the whole civilized world  --  for judgment . Its friends have made for it the usual plea  --  " not guilty ; " the case must , therefore , proceed . Any facts , either from slaves , slaveholders , or by-standers , calculated to enlighten the public mind , by revealing the true nature , character , and tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely be innocently withheld . I see , too , that there are special reasons why I should write my own biography , in preference to employing another to do it . Not only is slavery on trial , but unfortunately , the enslaved people are also on trial . It is alleged , that they are , naturally , inferior ; that they are so low in the scale of humanity , and so utterly stupid , that they are unconscious of their wrongs , and do not apprehend their rights . Looking , then , at your request , from this stand-point , and wishing everything of which you think me capable to go to the benefit of my afflicted people , I part with my doubts and hesitation , and proceed to furnish you the desired manuscript ; hoping that you may be able to make such arrangements for its publication as shall be best adapted to accomplish that good which you so enthusiastically anticipate . FREDERICK DOUGLASS 3 There was little necessity for doubt and hesitation on the part of Mr. Douglass , as to the propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . A man who was born and brought up in slavery , a living witness of its horrors ; who often himself experienced its cruelties ; and who , despite the depressing influences surrounding his birth , youth and manhood , has risen , from a dark and almost absolute obscurity , to the distinguished position which he now occupies , might very well assume the existence of a commendable curiosity , on the part of the public , to know the facts of his remarkable history . EDITOR INTRODUCTION When a man raises himself from the lowest condition in society to the highest , mankind pay him the tribute of their admiration ; when he accomplishes this elevation by native energy , guided by prudence and wisdom , their admiration is increased ; but when his course , onward and upward , excellent in itself , furthermore proves a possible , what had hitherto been regarded as an impossible , reform , then he becomes a burning and a shining light , on which the aged may look with gladness , the young with hope , and the down-trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To such a man , dear reader , it is my privilege to introduce you . The life of Frederick Douglass , recorded in the pages which follow , is not merely an example of self-elevation under the most adverse circumstances ; it is , moreover , a noble vindication of the highest aims of the American anti-slavery movement . The real object of that movement is not only to disenthrall , it is , also , to bestow upon the Negro the exercise of all those rights , from the possession of which he has been so long debarred . But this full recognition of the colored man to the right , and the entire admission of the same to the full privileges , political , religious and social , of manhood , requires powerful effort on the part of the enthralled , as well as on the part of those who would disenthrall them . The people at large must feel the conviction , as well as admit the abstract logic , of human equality ; 5 the Negro , for the first time in the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must prove his title first to all that is demanded for him ; in the teeth of unequal chances , he must prove himself equal to the mass of those who oppress him  --  therefore , absolutely superior to his apparent fate , and to their relative ability . And it is most cheering to the friends of freedom , today , that evidence of this equality is rapidly accumulating , not from the ranks of the half-freed colored people of the free states , but from the very depths of slavery itself ; the indestructible equality of man to man is demonstrated by the ease with which black men , scarce one remove from barbarism  --  if slavery can be honored with such a distinction  --  vault into the high places of the most advanced and painfully acquired civilization . Ward and Garnett , Wells Brown and Pennington , Loguen and Douglass , are banners on the outer wall , under which abolition is fighting its most successful battles , because they are living exemplars of the practicability of the most radical abolitionism ; for , they were all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them remained slaves until adult age , yet they all have not only won equality to their white fellow citizens , in civil , religious , political and social rank , but they have also illustrated and adorned our common country by their genius , learning and eloquence . The characteristics whereby Mr. Douglass has won first rank among these remarkable men , and is still rising toward highest rank among living Americans , are abundantly laid bare in the book before us . Like the autobiography of Hugh Miller , it carries us so far back into early childhood , as to throw light upon the question , " when positive and persistent memory begins in the human being . " And , like Hugh Miller , he must have been a shy old-fashioned child , occasionally oppressed by what he could not well account for , peering and poking about among the layers of right and wrong , of tyrant and thrall , and the wonderfulness of that hopeless tide of things which brought power to one race , and unrequited toil to another , until , finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away down in the depths of his own nature , and which revealed to him the fact that liberty and right , for all men , were anterior to slavery and wrong . When his knowledge of the world was bounded by the visible horizon on Col. Lloyd 's plantation , and while every thing around him bore a fixed , iron stamp , as if it had always been so , this was , for one so young , a notable discovery . To his uncommon memory , then , we must add a keen and accurate insight into men and things ; an original breadth of common sense which enabled him to see , and weigh , and compare whatever passed before him , and which kindled a desire to search out and define their relations to other things not so patent , but which never succumbed to the marvelous nor the supernatural ; a sacred thirst for liberty and for learning , first as a means of attaining liberty , then as an end in itself most desirable ; a will ; an unfaltering energy and determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; determined courage ; a deep and agonizing sympathy with his embruted , crushed and bleeding fellow slaves , and an extraordinary depth of passion , together with that rare alliance between passion and intellect , which enables the former , when deeply roused , to excite , develop and sustain the latter . With these original gifts in view , let us look at his schooling ; the fearful discipline through which it pleased God to prepare him for the high calling on which he has since entered  --  the advocacy of emancipation by the people who are not slaves . And for this special mission , his plantation education was better than any he could have acquired in any lettered school . What he needed , was facts and experiences , welded to acutely wrought up sympathies , and these he could not elsewhere have obtained , in a manner so peculiarly adapted to his nature . His physical being was well trained , also , running wild until advanced into boyhood ; hard work and light diet , thereafter , and a skill in handicraft in youth. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered in connection with his natural gifts , a good schooling ; and , for his special mission , he doubtless " left school " just at the proper moment . Had he remained longer in slavery  --  had he fretted under bonds until the ripening of manhood and its passions , until the drear agony of slave-wife and slave-children had been piled upon his already bitter experiences  --  then , not only would his own history have had another termination , but the drama of American slavery would have been essentially varied ; for I can not resist the belief , that the boy who learned to read and write as he did , who taught his fellow slaves these precious acquirements as he did , who plotted for their mutual escape as he did , would , when a man at bay , strike a blow which would make slavery reel and stagger . Furthermore , blows and insults he bore , at the moment , without resentment ; deep but suppressed emotion rendered him insensible to their sting ; but it was afterward , when the memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation at his injured self-hood , that the resolve came to resist , and the time fixed when to resist , and the plot laid , how to resist ; and he always kept his self-pledged word . In what he undertook , in this line , he looked fate in the face , and had a cool , keen look at the relation of means to ends . Henry Bibb , to avoid chastisement , strewed his master 's bed with charmed leaves and was whipped . Frederick Douglass quietly pocketed a like fetiche , compared his muscles with those of Covey  --  and whipped him . In the history of his life in bondage , we find , well developed , that inherent and continuous energy of character which will ever render him distinguished . What his hand found to do , he did with his might ; even while conscious that he was wronged out of his daily earnings , he worked , and worked hard . At his daily labor he went with a will ; with keen , well set eye , brawny chest , lithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been king among calkers , had that been his mission . It must not be overlooked , in this glance at his education , that8 Mr. Douglass lacked one aid to which so many men of mark have been deeply indebted  --  he had neither a mother 's care , nor a mother 's culture , save that which slavery grudgingly meted out to him . Bitter nurse ! may not even her features relax with human feeling , when she gazes at such offspring ! How susceptible he was to the kindly influences of mother-culture , may be gathered from his own words , on page 57 : " It has been a life-long standing grief to me , that I know so little of my mother , and that I was so early separated from her . The counsels of her love must have been beneficial to me . The side view of her face is imaged on my memory , and I take few steps in life , without feeling her presence ; but the image is mute , and I have no striking words of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maryland , our author escaped into the caste-slavery of the north , in New Bedford , Massachusetts . Here he found oppression assuming another , and hardly less bitter , form ; of that very handicraft which the greed of slavery had taught him , his half-freedom denied him the exercise for an honest living ; he found himself one of a class  --  free colored men  --  whose position he has described in the following words : " Aliens are we in our native land . The fundamental principles of the republic , to which the humblest white man , whether born here or elsewhere , may appeal with confidence , in the hope of awakening a favorable response , are held to be inapplicable to us . The glorious doctrines of your revolutionary fathers , and the more glorious teachings of the Son of God , are construed and applied against us . We are literally scourged beyond the beneficent range of both authorities , human and divine . * * * * American humanity hates us , scorns us , disowns and denies , in a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American christianity , apparently broad enough to give shelter to a perishing world , refuses to cover us . To us , its bones are brass , and its features iron . In running thither for shelter and9 succor , we have only fled from the hungry blood-hound to the devouring wolf  --  from a corrupt and selfish world , to a hollow and hypocritical church . "  --  Speech before American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society , May , 1854 . Four years or more , from 1837 to 1841 , he struggled on , in New Bedford , sawing wood , rolling casks , or doing what labor he might , to support himself and young family ; four years he brooded over the scars which slavery and semi-slavery had inflicted upon his body and soul ; and then , with his wounds yet unhealed , he fell among the Garrisonians  --  a glorious waif to those most ardent reformers . It happened one day , at Nantucket , that he , diffidently and reluctantly , was led to address an anti-slavery meeting . He was about the age when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitt , too , he stood up a born orator . William Lloyd Garrison , who was happily present , writes thus of Mr. Douglass ' maiden effort ; " I shall never forget his first speech at the convention  --  the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind  --  the powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory , completely taken by surprise . * * * I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment ; certainly , my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it on the godlike nature of its victims , was rendered far more clear than ever . There stood one in physical proportions and stature commanding and exact  --  in intellect richly endowed  --  in natural eloquence a prodigy . " 1 It is of interest to compare Mr. Douglass 's account of this meeting with Mr. Garrison 's . Of the two , I think the latter the most correct . It must have been a grand burst of eloquence ! The pent up agony , indignation and pathos of an abused and harrowed boyhood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestness ! This unique introduction to its great leader , led immediately10 to the employment of Mr. Douglass as an agent by the American Anti-Slavery Society . So far as his self-relying and independent character would permit , he became , after the strictest sect , a Garrisonian . It is not too much to say , that he formed a complement which they needed , and they were a complement equally necessary to his " make-up . " With his deep and keen sensitiveness to wrong , and his wonderful memory , he came from the land of bondage full of its woes and its evils , and painting them in characters of living light ; and , on his part , he found , told out in sound Saxon phrase , all those principles of justice and right and liberty , which had dimly brooded over the dreams of his youth , seeking definite forms and verbal expression . It must have been an electric flashing of thought , and a knitting of soul , granted to but few in this life , and will be a life-long memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , of Wendell Phillips , Edmund Quincy , William Lloyd Garrison , and other men of earnest faith and refined culture , Mr. Douglass enjoyed the high advantage of their assistance and counsel in the labor of self-culture , to which he now addressed himself with wonted energy . Yet , these gentlemen , although proud of Frederick Douglass , failed to fathom , and bring out to the light of day , the highest qualities of his mind ; the force of their own education stood in their own way : they did not delve into the mind of a colored man for capacities which the pride of race led them to believe to be restricted to their own Saxon blood . Bitter and vindictive sarcasm , irresistible mimicry , and a pathetic narrative of his own experiences of slavery , were the intellectual manifestations which they encouraged him to exhibit on the platform or in the lecture desk . A visit to England , in 1845 , threw Mr. Douglass among men and women of earnest souls and high culture , and who , moreover , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time in his life , he breathed an atmosphere congenial to the longings of his spirit , and felt his manhood free and11 unrestricted . The cordial and manly greetings of the British and Irish audiences in public , and the refinement and elegance of the social circles in which he mingled , not only as an equal , but as a recognized man of genius , were , doubtless , genial and pleasant resting places in his hitherto thorny and troubled journey through life . There are joys on the earth , and , to the wayfaring fugitive from American slavery or American caste , this is one of them . But his sojourn in England was more than a joy to Mr. Douglass . Like the platform at Nantucket , it awakened him to the consciousness of new powers that lay in him . From the pupilage of Garrisonism he rose to the dignity of a teacher and a thinker ; his opinions on the broader aspects of the great American question were earnestly and incessantly sought , from various points of view , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With that prompt and truthful perception which has led their sisters in all ages of the world to gather at the feet and support the hands of reformers , the gentlewomen of England 2 were foremost to encourage and strengthen him to carve out for himself a path fitted to his powers and energies , in the life-battle against slavery and caste to which he was pledged . And one stirring thought , inseparable from the British idea of the evangel of freedom , must have smote his ear from every side  --  Hereditary bondmen ! know ye not Who would be free , themselves mast strike the blow ? The result of this visit was , that on his return to the United States , he established a newspaper . This proceeding was sorely against the wishes and the advice of the leaders of the American Anti-Slavery Society , but our author had fully grown up to the conviction of a truth which they had once promulged , but now12 forgotten , to wit : that in their own elevation  --  self-elevation  --  colored men have a blow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caste . Differing from his Boston friends in this matter , diffident in his own abilities , reluctant at their dissuadings , how beautiful is the loyalty with which he still clung to their principles in all things else , and even in this . Now came the trial hour . Without cordial support from any large body of men or party on this side the Atlantic , and too far distant in space and immediate interest to expect much more , after the much already done , on the other side , he stood up , almost alone , to the arduous labor and heavy expenditure of editor and lecturer . The Garrison party , to which he still adhered , did not want a colored newspaper  --  there was an odor of caste about it ; the Liberty party could hardly be expected to give warm support to a man who smote their principles as with a hammer ; and the wide gulf which separated the free colored people from the Garrisonians , also separated them from their brother , Frederick Douglass . The arduous nature of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , may be estimated by the fact , that anti-slavery papers in the United States , even while organs of , and when supported by , anti-slavery parties , have , with a single exception , failed to pay expenses . Mr. Douglass has maintained , and does maintain , his paper without the support of any party , and even in the teeth of the opposition of those from whom he had reason to expect counsel and encouragement . He has been compelled , at one and the same time , and almost constantly , during the past seven years , to contribute matter to its columns as editor , and to raise funds for its support as lecturer . It is within bounds to say , that he has expended twelve thousand dollars of his own hard earned money , in publishing this paper , a larger sum than has been contributed by any one individual for the general advancement of the colored people . There had been many other papers published and edited by colored men , beginning as far back as13 1827 , when the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bowdoin college , and afterward Governor of Cape Palmas ) published the Freedom 's Journal , in New York City ; probably not less than one hundred newspaper enterprises have been started in the United States , by free colored men , born free , and some of them of liberal education and fair talents for this work ; but , one after another , they have fallen through , although , in several instances , anti-slavery friends contributed to their support . 3 It had almost been given up , as an impracticable thing , to maintain a colored newspaper , when Mr. Douglass , with fewest early advantages of all his competitors , essayed , and has proved the thing perfectly practicable , and , moreover , of great public benefit . This paper , in addition to its power in holding up the hands of those to whom it is especially devoted , also affords irrefutable evidence of the justice , safety and practicability of Immediate Emancipation ; it further proves the immense loss which slavery inflicts on the land while it dooms such energies as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in this Introduction , that Mr. Douglass had raised himself by his own efforts to the highest position in society . As a successful editor , in our land , he occupies this position . Our editors rule the land , and he is one of them . As an orator and thinker , his position is equally high , in the opinion of his countrymen . If a stranger in the United States would seek its most distinguished men  --  the movers of public opinion  --  he will find their names mentioned , and their movements chronicled , under the head of " BY MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH , " in the daily papers . The keen caterers for the public attention , set down , in this column , such men only as have won high mark in the public esteem . During the past winter  --  1854-5  --  very frequent mention of Frederick Douglass was made under this head in the daily papers ; his name glided as often  --  this week from Chicago , next14 week from Boston  --  over the lightning wires , as the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did the people more widely nor more earnestly say , " Tell me thy thought ! " And , somehow or other , revolution seemed to follow in his wake . His were not the mere words of eloquence which Kossuth speaks of , that delight the ear and then pass away . No ! They were work-able , do-able words , that brought forth fruits in the revolution in Illinois , and in the passage of the franchise resolutions by the Assembly of New York . And the secret of his power , what is it ? He is a Representative American man  --  a type of his countrymen . Naturalists tell us that a full grown man is a resultant or representative of all animated nature on this globe ; beginning with the early embryo state , then representing the lowest forms of organic life , 4 and passing through every subordinate grade or type , until he reaches the last and highest  --  manhood . In like manner , and to the fullest extent , has Frederick Douglass passed through every gradation of rank comprised in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul every thing that is American . And he has not only full sympathy with every thing American ; his proclivity or bent , to active toil and visible progress , are in the strictly national direction , delighting to outstrip " all creation . " Nor have the natural gifts , already named as his , lost anything by his severe training . When unexcited , his mental processes are probably slow , but singularly clear in perception , and wide in vision , the unfailing memory bringing up all the facts in their every aspect ; incongruities he lays hold of incontinently , and holds up on the edge of his keen and telling wit . But this wit never descends to frivolity ; it is rigidly in the keeping of his truthful common sense , and always used in illustration or proof of some point which could not so readily be reached any other way . " Beware of a Yankee when he is feeding , " is a shaft that strikes home15 in a matter never so laid bare by satire before . " The Garrisonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would only place the people of the north in the same relation to American slavery which they now bear to the slavery of Cuba or the Brazils , " is a statement , in a few words , which contains the result and the evidence of an argument which might cover pages , but could not carry stronger conviction , nor be stated in less pregnable form . In proof of this , I may say , that having been submitted to the attention of the Garrisonians in print , in March , it was repeated before them at their business meeting in May  --  the platform , par excellence , on which they invite free fight , a l'outrance , to all comers . It was given out in the clear , ringing tones , wherewith the hall of shields was wont to resound of old , yet neither Garrison , nor Phillips , nor May , nor Remond , nor Foster , nor Burleigh , with his subtle steel of " the ice brook 's temper , " ventured to break a lance upon it ! The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the abolition of American slavery , was silenced upon the lips that gave it birth , and in the presence of an array of defenders who compose the keenest intellects in the land . " The man who is right is a majority " is an aphorism struck out by Mr. Douglass in that great gathering of the friends of freedom , at Pittsburgh , in 1852 , where he towered among the highest , because , with abilities inferior to none , and moved more deeply than any , there was neither policy nor party to trammel the outpourings of his soul . Thus we find , opposed to all disadvantages which a black man in the United States labors and struggles under , is this one vantage ground  --  when the chance comes , and the audience where he may have a say , he stands forth the freest , most deeply moved and most earnest of all men . It has been said of Mr. Douglass , that his descriptive and declamatory powers , admitted to be of the very highest order , take precedence of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the exhibition of the formulas of deductive16 logic , nature and circumstances forced him into the exercise of the higher faculties required by induction . The first ninety pages of this " Life in Bondage , " afford specimens of observing , comparing , and careful classifying , of such superior character , that it is difficult to believe them the results of a child 's thinking ; he questions the earth , and the children and the slaves around him again and again , and finally looks to " God in the sky " for the why and the wherefore of the unnatural thing , slavery . " Yes , if indeed thou art , wherefore dost thou suffer us to be slain ? " is the only prayer and worship of the God-forsaken Dodos in the heart of Africa . Almost the same was his prayer . One of his earliest observations was that white children should know their ages , while the colored children were ignorant of theirs ; and the songs of the slaves grated on his inmost soul , because a something told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not consociate with miserable degradation . To such a mind , the ordinary processes of logical deduction are like proving that two and two make four . Mastering the intermediate steps by an intuitive glance , or recurring to them as Ferguson resorted to geometry , it goes down to the deeper relation of things , and brings out what may seem , to some , mere statements , but which are new and brilliant generalizations , each resting on a broad and stable basis . Thus , Chief Justice Marshall gave his decisions , and then told Brother Story to look up the authorities  --  and they never differed from him . Thus , also , in his " Lecture on the Anti-Slavery Movement , " delivered before the Rochester Ladies ' Anti-Slavery Society , Mr. Douglass presents a mass of thought , which , without any showy display of logic on his part , requires an exercise of the reasoning faculties of the reader to keep pace with him . And his " Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered , " is full of new and fresh thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been stated , his intellection is slow , when unexcited , it is most prompt and rapid when he is thoroughly aroused. 17 Memory , logic , wit , sarcasm , invective pathos and bold imagery of rare structural beauty , well up as from a copious fountain , yet each in its proper place , and contributing to form a whole , grand in itself , yet complete in the minutest proportions . It is most difficult to hedge him in a corner , for his positions are taken so deliberately , that it is rare to find a point in them undefended aforethought . Professor Reason tells me the following : " On a recent visit of a public nature , to Philadelphia , and in a meeting composed mostly of his colored brethren , Mr. Douglass proposed a comparison of views in the matters of the relations and duties of ' our people ; ' he holding that prejudice was the result of condition , and could be conquered by the efforts of the degraded themselves . A gentleman present , distinguished for logical acumen and subtlety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty-five years to the study and elucidation of this very question , held the opposite view , that prejudice is innate and unconquerable . He terminated a series of well dove-tailed , Socratic questions to Mr. Douglass , with the following : ' If the legislature at Harrisburgh should awaken , to-morrow morning , and find each man 's skin turned black and his hair woolly , what could they do to remove prejudice ? ' ' Immediately pass laws entitling black men to all civil , political and social privileges , ' was the instant reply  --  and the questioning ceased . " The most remarkable mental phenomenon in Mr. Douglass , is his style in writing and speaking . In March , 1855 , he delivered an address in the assembly chamber before the members of the legislature of the state of New York . An eye witness 5 describes the crowded and most intelligent audience , and their rapt attention to the speaker , as the grandest scene he ever witnessed in the capitol . Among those whose eyes were riveted on the speaker full two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond ; the latter , at the conclusion of the address , exclaimed to a friend , " I would give twenty thousand dollars , 18 if I could deliver that address in that manner . " Mr. Raymond is a first class graduate of Dartmouth , a rising politician , ranking foremost in the legislature ; of course , his ideal of oratory must be of the most polished and finished description . The style of Mr. Douglass in writing , is to me an intellectual puzzle . The strength , affluence and terseness may easily be accounted for , because the style of a man is the man ; but how are we to account for that rare polish in his style of writing , which , most critically examined , seems the result of careful early culture among the best classics of our language ; it equals if it does not surpass the style of Hugh Miller , which was the wonder of the British literary public , until he unraveled the mystery in the most interesting of autobiographies . But Frederick Douglass was still calking the seams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , " at the age when Miller 's style was already formed . I asked William Whipper , of Pennsylvania , the gentleman alluded to above , whether he thought Mr. Douglass 's power inherited from the Negroid , or from what is called the Caucasian side of his make up ? After some reflection , he frankly answered , " I must admit , although sorry to do so , that the Caucasian predominates . " At that time , I almost agreed with him ; but , facts narrated in the first part of this work , throw a different light on this interesting question . We are left in the dark as to who was the paternal ancestor of our author ; a fact which generally holds good of the Romuluses and Remuses who are to inaugurate the new birth of our republic . In the absence of testimony from the Caucasian side , we must see what evidence is given on the other side of the house . " My grandmother , though advanced in years , * * * was yet a woman of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic and muscular . " ( p. 46 . ) After describing her skill in constructing nets , her perseverance in using them , and her wide-spread fame in the agricultural way he adds , " It happened to her  --  as it will happen to any careful19 and thrifty person residing in an ignorant and improvident neighborhood  --  to enjoy the reputation of being born to good luck . " And his grandmother was a black woman . " My mother was tall , and finely proportioned ; of deep black , glossy complexion ; had regular features ; and among other slaves was remarkably sedate in her manners . " " Being a field hand , she was obliged to walk twelve miles and return , between nightfall and daybreak , to see her children " ( p. 54 . ) " I shall never forget the indescribable expression of her countenance when I told her that I had had no food since morning . * * * There was pity in her glance at me , and a fiery indignation at Aunt Katy at the same time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she never forgot . " ( p. 56 . ) " I learned after my mother 's death , that she could read , and that she was the only one of all the slaves and colored people in Tuckahoe who enjoyed that advantage . How she acquired this knowledge , I know not , for Tuckahoe is the last place in the world where she would be apt to find facilities for learning . " ( p. 57 . ) " There is , in Prichard 's Natural History of Man , the head of a figure  --  on page 157  --  the features of which so resemble those of my mother , that I often recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose others experience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones . " ( p. 52 . ) The head alluded to is copied from the statue of Ramses the Great , an Egyptian king of the nineteenth dynasty .

In Talbot county , Eastern Shore , Maryland , near Easton , the county town of that county , there is a small district of country , thinly populated , and remarkable for nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out , sandy , desert-like appearance of its soil , the general dilapidation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its inhabitants , and the prevalence of ague and fever . The name of this singularly unpromising and truly famine stricken district is Tuckahoe , a name well known to all Marylanders , black and white . It was given to this section of country probably , at the first , merely in derision ; or it may possibly have been applied to it , as I have heard , because some one of its earlier inhabitants had been guilty of the petty meanness of stealing a hoe  --  or taking a hoe that did not belong to him . Eastern Shore men usually pronounce the word took , as tuck ; Took-a-hoe , therefore , is , in Maryland parlance , Tuckahoe . But , whatever may have been its origin  --  and about this I will not be 26 positive  --  that name has stuck to the district in question ; and it is seldom mentioned but with contempt and derision , on account of the barrenness of its soil , and the ignorance , indolence , and poverty of its people . Decay and ruin are everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have quitted it long ago , but for the Choptank river , which runs through it , from which they take abundance of shad and herring , and plenty of ague and fever . It was in this dull , flat , and unthrifty district , or neighborhood , surrounded by a white population of the lowest order , indolent and drunken to a proverb , and among slaves , who seemed to ask , " Oh ! what 's the use ? " every time they lifted a hoe , that I  --  without any fault of mine was born , and spent the first years of my childhood . The reader will pardon so much about the place of my birth , on the score that it is always a fact of some importance to know where a man is born , if , indeed , it be important to know anything about him . In regard to the time of my birth , I can not be as definite as I have been respecting the place . Nor , indeed , can I impart much knowledge concerning my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A person of some consequence here in the north , sometimes designated father , is literally abolished in slave law and slave practice . It is only once in a while that an exception is found to this statement . I never met with a slave who could tell me how old he was . Few slave-mothers know anything of the months of the year , nor of the days of the month . They keep no family records , with marriages , births , and deaths . They measure the ages of their children by spring time , winter time , harvest time , planting time , and the like ; but these soon become undistinguishable and forgotten . Like other slaves , I can not tell how old I am . This destitution was among my earliest troubles . I learned when I grew up , that my master  --  and this is the case with masters generally  --  allowed no questions to be put to him , by which a slave might learn his27 GRANDPARENTS age . Such questions deemed evidence of impatience , and even of impudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I have since learned , I suppose myself to have been born about the year 1817 . The first experience of life with me that I now remember  --  and I remember it but hazily  --  began in the family of my grandmother and grandfather . Betsey and Isaac Baily . They were quite advanced in life , and had long lived on the spot where they then resided . They were considered old settlers in the neighborhood , and , from certain circumstances , I infer that my grandmother , especially , was held in high esteem , far higher than is the lot of most colored persons in the slave states . She was a good nurse , and a capital hand at making nets for catching shad and herring ; and these nets were in great demand , not only in Tuckahoe , but at Denton and Hillsboro , neighboring villages . She was not only good at making the nets , but was also somewhat famous for her good fortune in taking the fishes referred to . I have known her to be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most of her neighbors in the preservation of seedling sweet potatoes , and it happened to her  --  as it will happen to any careful and thrifty person residing in an ignorant and improvident community  --  to enjoy the reputation of having been born to " good luck . " Her " good luck " was owing to the exceeding care which she took in preventing the succulent root from getting bruised in the digging , and in placing it beyond the reach of frost , by actually burying it under the hearth of her cabin during the winter months . In the time of planting sweet potatoes , " Grandmother Betty , " as she was familiarly called , was sent for in all directions , simply to place the seedling potatoes in the hills ; for superstition had it , that if " Grandmamma Betty but touches them at planting , they will be sure to grow and flourish . " This high reputation was full of advantage to her , and to the children around her . Though Tuckahoe had but few of the good things of28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a full share , in the way of presents . If good potato crops came after her planting , she was not forgotten by those for whom she planted ; and as she was remembered by others , so she remembered the hungry little ones around her . The dwelling of my grandmother and grandfather had few pretensions . It was a log hut , or cabin , built of clay , wood , and straw . At a distance it resembled  --  though it was smaller , less commodious and less substantial  --  the cabins erected in the western states by the first settlers . To my child 's eye , however , it was a noble structure , admirably adapted to promote the comforts and conveniences of its inmates . A few rough , Virginia fence-rails , flung loosely over the rafters above , answered the triple purpose of floors , ceilings , and bedsteads . To be sure , this upper apartment was reached only by a ladder  --  but what in the world for climbing could be better than a ladder ? To me , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of charm as I played with delight upon the rounds of it . In this little hut there was a large family of children : I dare not say how many . My grandmother  --  whether because too old for field service , or because she had so faithfully discharged the duties of her station in early life , I know not  --  enjoyed the high privilege of living in a cabin , separate from the quarter , with no other burden than her own support , and the necessary care of the little children , imposed . She evidently esteemed it a great fortune to live so . The children were not her own , but her grandchildren  --  the children of her daughters . She took delight in having them around her , and in attending to their few wants . The practice of separating children from their mother , and hiring the latter out at distances too great to admit of their meeting , except at long intervals , is a marked feature of the cruelty and barbarity of the slave system . But it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always and everywhere , is to reduce man to a level with the brute . It is a successful method of obliterating29 " OLD MASTER " from the mind and heart of the slave , all just ideas of the sacredness of the family , as an institution . Most of the children , however , in this instance , being the children of my grandmother 's daughters , the notions of family , and the reciprocal duties and benefits of the relation , had a better chance of being understood than where children are placed  --  as they often are in the hands of strangers , who have no care for them , apart from the wishes of their masters . The daughters of my grandmother were five in number . Their names were JENNY , ESTHER , MILLY , PRISCILLA , and HARRIET . The daughter last named was my mother , of whom the reader shall learn more by-and-by . Living here , with my dear old grandmother and grandfather , it was a long time before I knew myself to be a slave . I knew many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the greatest people in the world to me ; and being with them so snugly in their own little cabin  --  I supposed it be their own  --  knowing no higher authority over me or the other children than the authority of grandmamma , for a time there was nothing to disturb me ; but , as I grew larger and older , I learned by degrees the sad fact , that the " little hut , " and the lot on which it stood , belonged not to my dear old grandparents , but to some person who lived a great distance off , and who was called , by grandmother , " OLD MASTER . " I further learned the sadder fact , that not only the house and lot , but that grandmother herself , ( grandfather was free , ) and all the little children around her , belonged to this mysterious personage , called by grandmother , with every mark of reverence , " Old Master . " Thus early did clouds and shadows begin to fall upon my path . Once on the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in finding out another fact , still more grievous to my childish heart . I was told that this " old master , " whose name seemed ever to be mentioned with fear and shuddering , only allowed the children to live with grandmother for a limited time , and that in fact as soon30 as they were big enough , they were promptly taken away , to live with the said " old master . " These were distressing revelations indeed ; and though I was quite too young to comprehend the full import of the intelligence , and mostly spent my childhood days in gleesome sports with the other children , a shade of disquiet rested upon me . The absolute power of this distant " old master " had touched my young spirit with but the point of its cold , cruel iron , and left me something to brood over after the play and in moments of repose . Grandmammy was , indeed , at that time , all the world to me ; and the thought of being separated from her , in any considerable time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerable . Children have their sorrows as well as men and women ; and it would be well to remember this in our dealings with them . SLAVE-children are children , and prove no exceptions to the general rule . The liability to be separated from my grandmother , seldom or never to see her again , haunted me . I dreaded the thought of going to live with that mysterious " old master , " whose name I never heard mentioned with affection , but always with fear . I look back to this as among the heaviest of my childhood 's sorrows . My grandmother ! my grandmother ! and the little hut , and the joyous circle under her care , but especially she , who made us sorry when she left us but for an hour , and glad on her return ,  --  how could I leave her and the good old home ? But the sorrows of childhood , like the pleasures of after life , are transient . It is not even within the power of slavery to write indelible sorrow , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tear down childhood 's cheek that flows , Is like the dew-drop on the rose  - -  When next the summer breeze comes by , And waves the bush  --  the flower is dry . There is , after all , but little difference in the measure of contentment felt by the slave-child neglected and the slaveholder's31 COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS child cared for and petted . The spirit of the All Just mercifully holds the balance for the young . The slaveholder , having nothing to fear from impotent childhood , easily affords to refrain from cruel inflictions ; and if cold and hunger do not pierce the tender frame , the first seven or eight years of the slave-boy 's life are about as full of sweet content as those of the most favored and petted white children of the slaveholder . The slave-boy escapes many troubles which befall and vex his white brother . He seldom has to listen to lectures on propriety of behavior , or on anything else . He is never chided for handling his little knife and fork improperly or awkwardly , for he uses none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes his meals on the clay floor . He never has the misfortune , in his games or sports , of soiling or tearing his clothes , for he has almost none to soil or tear . He is never expected to act like a nice little gentleman , for he is only a rude little slave . Thus , freed from all restraint , the slave-boy can be , in his life and conduct , a genuine boy , doing whatever his boyish nature suggests ; enacting , by turns , all the strange antics and freaks of horses , dogs , pigs , and barn-door fowls , without in any manner compromising his dignity , or incurring reproach of any sort . He literally runs wild ; has no pretty little verses to learn in the nursery ; no nice little speeches to make for aunts , uncles , or cousins , to show how smart he is ; and , if he can only manage to keep out of the way of the heavy feet and fists of the older slave boys , he may trot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any little heathen under the palm trees of Africa . To be sure , he is occasionally reminded , when he stumbles in the path of his master  --  and this he early learns to avoid  --  that he is eating his " white bread , " and that he will be made to " see sights " by-and-by . The threat is soon forgotten ; the shadow soon passes , and our sable boy continues to roll in the dust , or play in the mud , as bests suits him , and in the veriest freedom . If he feels uncomfortable , from mud or from dust , the coast is clear ; he can plunge into32 the river or the pond , without the ceremony of undressing , or the fear of wetting his clothes ; his little tow-linen shirt  --  for that is all he has on  --  is easily dried ; and it needed ablution as much as did his skin . His food is of the coarsest kind , consisting for the most part of cornmeal mush , which often finds it way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His days , when the weather is warm , are spent in the pure , open air , and in the bright sunshine . He always sleeps in airy apartments ; he seldom has to take powders , or to be paid to swallow pretty little sugar-coated pills , to cleanse his blood , or to quicken his appetite . He eats no candies ; gets no lumps of loaf sugar ; always relishes his food ; cries but little , for nobody cares for his crying ; learns to esteem his bruises but slight , because others so esteem them . In a word , he is , for the most part of the first eight years of his life , a spirited , joyous , uproarious , and happy boy , upon whom troubles fall only like water on a duck 's back . And such a boy , so far as I can now remember , was the boy whose life in slavery I am now narrating . CHAPTER II . Removed from My First Home THE NAME " OLD MASTER " A TERROR  --  COLONEL LLOYD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POSITION OF THE LLOYDS  --  HOME ATTRACTION  --  MEET OFFERING  --  JOURNEY FROM TUCKAHOE TO WYE RIVER  --  SCENE ON REACHING OLD MASTER 'S  --  DEPARTURE OF GRANDMOTHER  --  STRANGE MEETING OF SISTERS AND BROTHERS  --  REFUSAL TO BE COMFORTED  --  SWEET SLEEP . That mysterious individual referred to in the first chapter as an object of terror among the inhabitants of our little cabin , under the ominous title of " old master , " was really a man of some consequence . He owned several farms in Tuckahoe ; was the chief clerk and butler on the home plantation of Col. Edward Lloyd ; had overseers on his own farms ; and gave directions to overseers on the farms belonging to Col. Lloyd . This plantation is situated on Wye river  --  the river receiving its name , doubtless , from Wales , where the Lloyds originated . They ( the Lloyds ) are an old and honored family in Maryland , exceedingly wealthy . The home plantation , where they have resided , perhaps for a century or more , is one of the largest , most fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plantation , and about that queer old master  --  who must be something more than a man , and something worse than an angel  --  the reader will easily imagine that I was not only curious , but eager , to know all that could be known . Unhappily for me , however , all the information I could get concerning him increased my great dread of being carried thither  --  of being34 separated from and deprived of the protection of my grandmother and grandfather . It was , evidently , a great thing to go to Col. Lloyd 's ; and I was not without a little curiosity to see the place ; but no amount of coaxing could induce in me the wish to remain there . The fact is , such was my dread of leaving the little cabin , that I wished to remain little forever , for I knew the taller I grew the shorter my stay . The old cabin , with its rail floor and rail bedsteads upstairs , and its clay floor downstairs , and its dirt chimney , and windowless sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the fireplace , beneath which grandmammy placed the sweet potatoes to keep them from the frost , was MY HOME  --  the only home I ever had ; and I loved it , and all connected with it . The old fences around it , and the stumps in the edge of the woods near it , and the squirrels that ran , skipped , and played upon them , were objects of interest and affection . There , too , right at the side of the hut , stood the old well , with its stately and skyward-pointing beam , so aptly placed between the limbs of what had once been a tree , and so nicely balanced that I could move it up and down with only one hand , and could get a drink myself without calling for help . Where else in the world could such a well be found , and where could such another home be met with ? Nor were these all the attractions of the place . Down in a little valley , not far from grandmammy 's cabin , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large numbers to get their corn ground . It was a watermill ; and I never shall be able to tell the many things thought and felt , while I sat on the bank and watched that mill , and the turning of that ponderous wheel . The mill-pond , too , had its charms ; and with my pinhook , and thread line , I could get nibbles , if I could catch no fish . But , in all my sports and plays , and in spite of them , there would , occasionally , come the painful foreboding that I was not long to remain there , and that I must soon be called away to the home of old master . I was A SLAVE  --  born a slave and though the fact was in35 DEPARTURE FROM TUCKAHOE comprehensible to me , it conveyed to my mind a sense of my entire dependence on the will of somebody I had never seen ; and , from some cause or other , I had been made to fear this somebody above all else on earth . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin flock I was soon to be selected as a meet offering to the fearful and inexorable demigod , whose huge image on so many occasions haunted my childhood 's imagination . When the time of my departure was decided upon , my grandmother , knowing my fears , and in pity for them , kindly kept me ignorant of the dreaded event about to transpire . Up to the morning ( a beautiful summer morning ) when we were to start , and , indeed , during the whole journey  --  a journey which , child as I was , I remember as well as if it were yesterday  --  she kept the sad fact hidden from me . This reserve was necessary ; for , could I have known all , I should have given grandmother some trouble in getting me started . As it was , I was helpless , and she  --  dear woman !  --  led me along by the hand , resisting , with the reserve and solemnity of a priestess , all my inquiring looks to the last . The distance from Tuckahoe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full twelve miles , and the walk was quite a severe test of the endurance of my young legs . The journey would have proved too severe for me , but that my dear old grandmother  --  blessings on her memory !  --  afforded occasional relief by " toting " me ( as Marylanders have it ) on her shoulder . My grandmother , though advanced in years  --  as was evident from more than one gray hair , which peeped from between the ample and graceful folds of her newly-ironed bandana turban  --  was yet a woman of power and spirit . She was marvelously straight in figure , elastic , and muscular . I seemed hardly to be a burden to her . She would have " toted " me farther , but that I felt myself too much of a man to allow it , and insisted on walking . Releasing dear grandmamma from carrying me , did not make me altogether independent of her , when we happened to pass through portions of the somber woods which lay between Tuckahoe and36 Wye river . She often found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clothing , lest something should come out of the woods and eat me up . Several old logs and stumps imposed upon me , and got themselves taken for wild beasts . I could see their legs , eyes , and ears , or I could see something like eyes , legs , and ears , till I got close enough to them to see that the eyes were knots , washed white with rain , and the legs were broken limbs , and the ears , only ears owing to the point from which they were seen . Thus early I learned that the point from which a thing is viewed is of some importance . As the day advanced the heat increased ; and it was not until the afternoon that we reached the much dreaded end of the journey . I found myself in the midst of a group of children of many colors ; black , brown , copper colored , and nearly white . I had not seen so many children before . Great houses loomed up in different directions , and a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this hurry , noise , and singing was very different from the stillness of Tuckahoe . As a new comer , I was an object of special interest ; and , after laughing and yelling around me , and playing all sorts of wild tricks , they ( the children ) asked me to go out and play with them . This I refused to do , preferring to stay with grandmamma . I could not help feeling that our being there boded no good to me . Grandmamma looked sad . She was soon to lose another object of affection , as she had lost many before . I knew she was unhappy , and the shadow fell from her brow on me , though I knew not the cause . All suspense , however , must have an end ; and the end of mine , in this instance , was at hand . Affectionately patting me on the head , and exhorting me to be a good boy , grandmamma told me to go and play with the little children . " They are kin to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Among a number of cousins were Phil , Tom , Steve , and Jerry , Nance and Betty . Grandmother pointed out my brother PERRY , my sister SARAH , and my sister ELIZA , who stood in the group . I had never seen37 BROTHERS AND SISTERS my brother nor my sisters before ; and , though I had sometimes heard of them , and felt a curious interest in them , I really did not understand what they were to me , or I to them . We were brothers and sisters , but what of that ? Why should they be attached to me , or I to them ? Brothers and sisters we were by blood ; but slavery had made us strangers . I heard the words brother and sisters , and knew they must mean something ; but slavery had robbed these terms of their true meaning . The experience through which I was passing , they had passed through before . They had already been initiated into the mysteries of old master 's domicile , and they seemed to look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart clave to my grandmother . Think it not strange , dear reader , that so little sympathy of feeling existed between us . The conditions of brotherly and sisterly feeling were wanting  --  we had never nestled and played together . My poor mother , like many other slave-women , had many children , but NO FAMILY ! The domestic hearth , with its holy lessons and precious endearments , is abolished in the case of a slave-mother and her children . " Little children , love one another , " are words seldom heard in a slave cabin . I really wanted to play with my brother and sisters , but they were strangers to me , and I was full of fear that grandmother might leave without taking me with her . Entreated to do so , however , and that , too , by my dear grandmother , I went to the back part of the house , to play with them and the other children . Play , however , I did not , but stood with my back against the wall , witnessing the playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the children , who had been in the kitchen , ran up to me , in a sort of roguish glee , exclaiming , " Fed , Fed ! grandmammy gone ! grandmammy gone ! " I could not believe it ; yet , fearing the worst , I ran into the kitchen , to see for myself , and found it even so . Grandmammy had indeed gone , and was now far away , " clean " out of sight . I need not tell all that happened now . Almost heart-broken at the discovery , I fell upon the ground , and38 wept a boy 's bitter tears , refusing to be comforted . My brother and sisters came around me , and said , " Do n't cry , " and gave me peaches and pears , but I flung them away , and refused all their kindly advances . I had never been deceived before ; and I felt not only grieved at parting  --  as I supposed forever  --  with my grandmother , but indignant that a trick had been played upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the afternoon . The day had been an exciting and wearisome one , and I knew not how or where , but I suppose I sobbed myself to sleep . There is a healing in the angel wing of sleep , even for the slave-boy ; and its balm was never more welcome to any wounded soul than it was to mine , the first night I spent at the domicile of old master . The reader may be surprised that I narrate so minutely an incident apparently so trivial , and which must have occurred when I was not more than seven years old ; but as I wish to give a faithful history of my experience in slavery , I can not withhold a circumstance which , at the time , affected me so deeply . Besides , this was , in fact , my first introduction to the realities of slavery . CHAPTER III . Parentage MY FATHER SHROUDED IN MYSTERY  --  MY MOTHER  --  HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE  --  INTERFERENCE OF SLAVERY WITH THE NATURAL AFFECTIONS OF MOTHER AND CHILDREN  --  SITUATION OF MY MOTHER  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HER DEATH  --  HER PLACE OF BURIAL . If the reader will now be kind enough to allow me time to grow bigger , and afford me an opportunity for my experience to become greater , I will tell him something , by-and-by , of slave life , as I saw , felt , and heard it , on Col. Edward Lloyd 's plantation , and at the house of old master , where I had now , despite of myself , most suddenly , but not unexpectedly , been dropped . Meanwhile , I will redeem my promise to say something more of my dear mother . I say nothing of father , for he is shrouded in a mystery I have never been able to penetrate . Slavery does away with fathers , as it does away with families . Slavery has no use for either fathers or families , and its laws do not recognize their existence in the social arrangements of the plantation . When they do exist , they are not the outgrowths of slavery , but are antagonistic to that system . The order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not expected to be that of its father , and his condition does not necessarily affect that of the child . He may be the slave of Mr. Tilgman ; and his child , when born , may be the slave of Mr. Gross . He may be a freeman ; and yet his child may be a chattel . He may be white , glorying in the purity of his Anglo-Saxon40 blood ; and his child may be ranked with the blackest slaves . Indeed , he may be , and often is , master and father to the same child . He can be father without being a husband , and may sell his child without incurring reproach , if the child be by a woman in whose veins courses one thirty-second part of African blood . My father was a white man , or nearly white . It was sometimes whispered that my master was my father . But to return , or rather , to begin . My knowledge of my mother is very scanty , but very distinct . Her personal appearance and bearing are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finely proportioned ; of deep black , glossy complexion ; had regular features , and , among the other slaves , was remarkably sedate in her manners . There is in Prichard 's Natural History of Man , the head of a figure  --  on page 157  --  the features of which so resemble those of my mother , that I often recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose others experience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones . Yet I can not say that I was very deeply attached to my mother ; certainly not so deeply as I should have been had our relations in childhood been different . We were separated , according to the common custom , when I was but an infant , and , of course , before I knew my mother from any one else . The germs of affection with which the Almighty , in his wisdom and mercy , arms the hopeless infant against the ills and vicissitudes of his lot , had been directed in their growth toward that loving old grandmother , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of my infantile understanding to comprehend and appreciate . Accordingly , the tenderest affection which a beneficent Father allows , as a partial compensation to the mother for the pains and lacerations of her heart , incident to the maternal relation , was , in my case , diverted from its true and natural object , by the envious , greedy , and treacherous hand of slavery . The slave-mother can be spared long enough from41 MY MOTHER the field to endure all the bitterness of a mother 's anguish , when it adds another name to a master 's ledger , but not long enough to receive the joyous reward afforded by the intelligent smiles of her child . I never think of this terrible interference of slavery with my infantile affections , and its diverting them from their natural course , without feelings to which I can give no adequate expression . I do not remember to have seen my mother at my grandmother 's at any time . I remember her only in her visits to me at Col. Lloyd 's plantation , and in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were few in number , brief in duration , and mostly made in the night . The pains she took , and the toil she endured , to see me , tells me that a true mother 's heart was hers , and that slavery had difficulty in paralyzing it with unmotherly indifference . My mother was hired out to a Mr. Stewart , who lived about twelve miles from old master 's , and , being a field hand , she seldom had leisure , by day , for the performance of the journey . The nights and the distance were both obstacles to her visits . She was obliged to walk , unless chance flung into her way an opportunity to ride ; and the latter was sometimes her good luck . But she always had to walk one way or the other . It was a greater luxury than slavery could afford , to allow a black slave-mother a horse or a mule , upon which to travel twenty-four miles , when she could walk the distance . Besides , it is deemed a foolish whim for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in one point of view , the case is made out  --  she can do nothing for them . She has no control over them ; the master is even more than the mother , in all matters touching the fate of her child . Why , then , should she give herself any concern ? She has no responsibility . Such is the reasoning , and such the practice . The iron rule of the plantation , always passionately and violently enforced in that neighborhood , makes flogging the penalty of42 failing to be in the field before sunrise in the morning , unless special permission be given to the absenting slave . " I went to see my child , " is no excuse to the ear or heart of the overseer . One of the visits of my mother to me , while at Col. Lloyd 's , I remember very vividly , as affording a bright gleam of a mother 's love , and the earnestness of a mother 's care . " I had on that day offended " Aunt Katy , " ( called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook of old master 's establishment . I do not now remember the nature of my offense in this instance , for my offenses were numerous in that quarter , greatly depending , however , upon the mood of Aunt Katy , as to their heinousness ; but she had adopted , that day , her favorite mode of punishing me , namely , making me go without food all day  --  that is , from after breakfast . The first hour or two after dinner , I succeeded pretty well in keeping up my spirits ; but though I made an excellent stand against the foe , and fought bravely during the afternoon , I knew I must be conquered at last , unless I got the accustomed reenforcement of a slice of corn bread , at sundown . Sundown came , but no bread , and , in its stead , their came the threat , with a scowl well suited to its terrible import , that she " meant to starve the life out of me ! " Brandishing her knife , she chopped off the heavy slices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , muttering , all the while , her savage designs upon myself . Against this disappointment , for I was expecting that her heart would relent at last , I made an extra effort to maintain my dignity ; but when I saw all the other children around me with merry and satisfied faces , I could stand it no longer . I went out behind the house , and cried like a fine fellow ! When tired of this , I returned to the kitchen , sat by the fire , and brooded over my hard lot . I was too hungry to sleep . While I sat in the corner , I caught sight of an ear of Indian corn on an upper shelf of the kitchen . I watched my chance , and got it , and , shelling off a few grains , I put it back again . The grains in my hand , I quickly put in some ashes , and covered them with embers , to roast them . All this I43 did at the risk of getting a brutual thumping , for Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My corn was not long in roasting , and , with my keen appetite , it did not matter even if the grains were not exactly done . I eagerly pulled them out , and placed them on my stool , in a clever little pile . Just as I began to help myself to my very dry meal , in came my dear mother . And now , dear reader , a scene occurred which was altogether worth beholding , and to me it was instructive as well as interesting . The friendless and hungry boy , in his extremest need  --  and when he did not dare to look for succor  --  found himself in the strong , protecting arms of a mother ; a mother who was , at the moment ( being endowed with high powers of manner as well as matter ) more than a match for all his enemies . I shall never forget the indescribable expression of her countenance , when I told her that I had had no food since morning ; and that Aunt Katy said she " meant to starve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glance at me , and a fiery indignation at Aunt Katy at the same time ; and , while she took the corn from me , and gave me a large ginger cake , in its stead , she read Aunt Katy a lecture which she never forgot . My mother threatened her with complaining to old master in my behalf ; for the latter , though harsh and cruel himself , at times , did not sanction the meanness , injustice , partiality and oppressions enacted by Aunt Katy in the kitchen . That night I learned the fact , that I was , not only a child , but somebody 's child . The " sweet cake " my mother gave me was in the shape of a heart , with a rich , dark ring glazed upon the edge of it . I was victorious , and well off for the moment ; prouder , on my mother 's knee , than a king upon his throne . But my triumph was short . I dropped off to sleep , and waked in the morning only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of the sable virago , dominant in my old master 's kitchen , whose fiery wrath was my constant dread . I do not remember to have seen my mother after this occurrence . Death soon ended the little communication that had44 existed between us ; and with it , I believe , a life judging from her weary , sad , down-cast countenance and mute demeanor  --  full of heartfelt sorrow . I was not allowed to visit her during any part of her long illness ; nor did I see her for a long time before she was taken ill and died . The heartless and ghastly form of slavery rises between mother and child , even at the bed of death . The mother , at the verge of the grave , may not gather her children , to impart to them her holy admonitions , and invoke for them her dying benediction . The bond-woman lives as a slave , and is left to die as a beast ; often with fewer attentions than are paid to a favorite horse . Scenes of sacred tenderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest the vicious and confirm the virtuous during life , must be looked for among the free , though they sometimes occur among the slaves . It has been a life-long , standing grief to me , that I knew so little of my mother ; and that I was so early separated from her . The counsels of her love must have been beneficial to me . The side view of her face is imaged on my memory , and I take few steps in life , without feeling her presence ; but the image is mute , and I have no striking words of her 's treasured up . I learned , after my mother 's death , that she could read , and that she was the only one of all the slaves and colored people in Tuckahoe who enjoyed that advantage . How she acquired this knowledge , I know not , for Tuckahoe is the last place in the world where she would be apt to find facilities for learning . I can , therefore , fondly and proudly ascribe to her an earnest love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read , in any slave state , is remarkable ; but the achievement of my mother , considering the place , was very extraordinary ; and , in view of that fact , I am quite willing , and even happy , to attribute any love of letters I possess , and for which I have got  --  despite of prejudices only too much credit , not to my admitted Anglo-Saxon paternity , but to the native genius of my sable , unprotected , and uncultivated mother  --  a woman , who belonged to a race45 PENALTY FOR HAVING A WHITE FATHER whose mental endowments it is , at present , fashionable to hold in disparagement and contempt . Summoned away to her account , with the impassable gulf of slavery between us during her entire illness , my mother died without leaving me a single intimation of who my father was . There was a whisper , that my master was my father ; yet it was only a whisper , and I can not say that I ever gave it credence . Indeed , I now have reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains , in all its glaring odiousness , that , by the laws of slavery , children , in all cases , are reduced to the condition of their mothers . This arrangement admits of the greatest license to brutal slaveholders , and their profligate sons , brothers , relations and friends , and gives to the pleasure of sin , the additional attraction of profit . A whole volume might be written on this single feature of slavery , as I have observed it . One might imagine , that the children of such connections , would fare better , in the hands of their masters , than other slaves . The rule is quite the other way ; and a very little reflection will satisfy the reader that such is the case . A man who will enslave his own blood , may not be safely relied on for magnanimity . Men do not love those who remind them of their sins unless they have a mind to repent  --  and the mulatto child 's face is a standing accusation against him who is master and father to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child is a constant offense to the wife . She hates its very presence , and when a slaveholding woman hates , she wants not means to give that hate telling effect . Women  --  white women , I mean  --  are IDOLS at the south , not WIVES , for the slave women are preferred in many instances ; and if these idols but nod , or lift a finger , woe to the poor victim : kicks , cuffs and stripes are sure to follow . Masters are frequently compelled to sell this class of their slaves , out of deference to the feelings of their white wives ; and shocking and scandalous as it may seem for a man to sell his own blood to the traffickers in human flesh , it is often an act of humanity46 toward the slave-child to be thus removed from his merciless tormentors . It is not within the scope of the design of my simple story , to comment upon every phase of slavery not within my experience as a slave . But , I may remark , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enslaved , according to the scriptures , slavery in this country will soon become an unscriptural institution ; for thousands are ushered into the world , annually , who  --  like myself  --  owe their existence to white fathers , and , most frequently , to their masters , and master 's sons . The slave-woman is at the mercy of the fathers , sons or brothers of her master . The thoughtful know the rest . After what I have now said of the circumstances of my mother , and my relations to her , the reader will not be surprised , nor be disposed to censure me , when I tell but the simple truth , viz : that I received the tidings of her death with no strong emotions of sorrow for her , and with very little regret for myself on account of her loss . I had to learn the value of my mother long after her death , and by witnessing the devotion of other mothers to their children . There is not , beneath the sky , an enemy to filial affection so destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers to me ; it converted the mother that bore me , into a myth ; it shrouded my father in mystery , and left me without an intelligible beginning in the world . My mother died when I could not have been more than eight or nine years old , on one of old master 's farms in Tuckahoe , in the neighborhood of Hillsborough . Her grave is , as the grave of the dead at sea , unmarked , and without stone or stake . CHAPTER IV . A General Survey of the Slave Plantation ISOLATION OF LLOYD S PLANTATION  --  PUBLIC OPINION THERE NO PROTECTION TO THE SLAVE  --  ABSOLUTE POWER OF THE OVERSEER  --  NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CHARMS OF THE PLACE  --  ITS BUSINESS-LIKE APPEARANCE  --  SUPERSTITION ABOUT THE BURIAL GROUND  --  GREAT IDEAS OF COL .

It is generally supposed that slavery , in the state of Maryland , exists in its mildest form , and that it is totally divested of those harsh and terrible peculiarities , which mark and characterize the slave system , in the southern and south-western states of the American union . The argument in favor of this opinion , is the contiguity of the free states , and the exposed condition of slavery in Maryland to the moral , religious and humane sentiment of the free states . I am not about to refute this argument , so far as it relates to slavery in that state , generally ; on the contrary , I am willing to admit that , to this general point , the arguments is well grounded . Public opinion is , indeed , an unfailing restraint upon the cruelty and barbarity of masters , overseers , and slave-drivers , whenever and wherever it can reach them ; but there are certain secluded and out-of-the-way places , even in the state of Maryland , seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where48 slavery , wrapt in its own congenial , midnight darkness , can , and does , develop all its malign and shocking characteristics ; where it can be indecent without shame , cruel without shuddering , and murderous without apprehension or fear of exposure . Just such a secluded , dark , and out-of-the-way place , is the " home plantation " of Col. Edward Lloyd , on the Eastern Shore , Maryland . It is far away from all the great thoroughfares , and is proximate to no town or village . There is neither school-house , nor town-house in its neighborhood . The school-house is unnecessary , for there are no children to go to school . The children and grand-children of Col. Lloyd were taught in the house , by a private tutor  --  a Mr. Page a tall , gaunt sapling of a man , who did not speak a dozen words to a slave in a whole year . The overseers ' children go off somewhere to school ; and they , therefore , bring no foreign or dangerous influence from abroad , to embarrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not even the mechanics  --  through whom there is an occasional out-burst of honest and telling indignation , at cruelty and wrong on other plantations  --  are white men , on this plantation . Its whole public is made up of , and divided into , three classes  --  SLAVEHOLDERS , SLAVES and OVERSEERS . Its blacksmiths , wheelwrights , shoemakers , weavers , and coopers , are slaves . Not even commerce , selfish and iron-hearted at it is , and ready , as it ever is , to side with the strong against the weak  --  the rich against the poor  --  is trusted or permitted within its secluded precincts . Whether with a view of guarding against the escape of its secrets , I know not , but it is a fact , the every leaf and grain of the produce of this plantation , and those of the neighboring farms belonging to Col. Lloyd , are transported to Baltimore in Col. Lloyd 's own vessels ; every man and boy on board of which  --  except the captain  --  are owned by him . In return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same channel . Thus , even the glimmering and unsteady light of trade , which sometimes exerts a civilizing influence , is excluded from this " tabooed " spot. 49 Nearly all the plantations or farms in the vicinity of the " home plantation " of Col. Lloyd , belong to him ; and those which do not , are owned by personal friends of his , as deeply interested in maintaining the slave system , in all its rigor , as Col. Lloyd himself . Some of his neighbors are said to be even more stringent than he . The Skinners , the Peakers , the Tilgmans , the Lockermans , and the Gipsons , are in the same boat ; being slaveholding neighbors , they may have strengthened each other in their iron rule . They are on intimate terms , and their interests and tastes are identical . Public opinion in such a quarter , the reader will see , is not likely to very efficient in protecting the slave from cruelty . On the contrary , it must increase and intensify his wrongs . Public opinion seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint upon cruelty and vice , public opinion must emanate from a humane and virtuous community . To no such humane and virtuous community , is Col. Lloyd 's plantation exposed . That plantation is a little nation of its own , having its own language , its own rules , regulations and customs . The laws and institutions of the state , apparently touch it nowhere . The troubles arising here , are not settled by the civil power of the state . The overseer is generally accuser , judge , jury , advocate and executioner . The criminal is always dumb . The overseer attends to all sides of a case . There are no conflicting rights of property , for all the people are owned by one man ; and they can themselves own no property . Religion and politics are alike excluded . One class of the population is too high to be reached by the preacher ; and the other class is too low to be cared for by the preacher . The poor have the gospel preached to them , in this neighborhood , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves , having no money , get no gospel . The politician keeps away , because the people have no votes , and the preacher keeps away , because the people have no money . The rich planter can afford to learn politics in the parlor , and to dispense with religion altogether. 50 In its isolation , seclusion , and self-reliant independence , Col. Lloyd 's plantation resembles what the baronial domains were during the middle ages in Europe . Grim , cold , and unapproachable by all genial influences from communities without , there it stands ; full three hundred years behind the age , in all that relates to humanity and morals . This , however , is not the only view that the place presents . Civilization is shut out , but nature can not be . Though separated from the rest of the world ; though public opinion , as I have said , seldom gets a chance to penetrate its dark domain ; though the whole place is stamped with its own peculiar , ironlike individuality ; and though crimes , high-handed and atrocious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as upon the deck of a pirate ship  --  it is , nevertheless , altogether , to outward seeming , a most strikingly interesting place , full of life , activity , and spirit ; and presents a very favorable contrast to the indolent monotony and languor of Tuckahoe . Keen as was my regret and great as was my sorrow at leaving the latter , I was not long in adapting myself to this , my new home . A man 's troubles are always half disposed of , when he finds endurance his only remedy . I found myself here ; there was no getting away ; and what remained for me , but to make the best of it ? Here were plenty of children to play with , and plenty of places of pleasant resort for boys of my age , and boys older . The little tendrils of affection , so rudely and treacherously broken from around the darling objects of my grandmother 's hut , gradually began to extend , and to entwine about the new objects by which I now found myself surrounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's eye ) on Long Point  --  a tract of land dividing Miles river from the Wye a mile or more from my old master 's house . There was a creek to swim in , at the bottom of an open flat space , of twenty acres or more , called " the Long Green "  --  a very beautiful play-ground for the children. 51 In the river , a short distance from the shore , lying quietly at anchor , with her small boat dancing at her stern , was a large sloop  --  the Sally Lloyd ; called by that name in honor of a favorite daughter of the colonel . The sloop and the mill were wondrous things , full of thoughts and ideas . A child can not well look at such objects without thinking . Then here were a great many houses ; human habitations , full of the mysteries of life at every stage of it . There was the little red house , up the road , occupied by Mr. Sevier , the overseer . A little nearer to my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low building , literally alive with slaves , of all ages , conditions and sizes . This was called " the Longe Quarter . " Perched upon a hill , across the Long Green , was a very tall , dilapidated , old brick building  --  the architectural dimensions of which proclaimed its erection for a different purpose  --  now occupied by slaves , in a similar manner to the Long Quarter . Besides these , there were numerous other slave houses and huts , scattered around in the neighborhood , every nook and corner of which was completely occupied . Old master 's house , a long , brick building , plain , but substantial , stood in the center of the plantation life , and constituted one independent establishment on the premises of Col. Lloyd . Besides these dwellings , there were barns , stables , store-houses , and tobacco-houses ; blacksmiths ' shops , wheelwrights ' shops , coopers ' shops  --  all objects of interest ; but , above all , there stood the grandest building my eyes had then ever beheld , called , by every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was occupied by Col. Lloyd and his family . They occupied it ; I enjoyed it . The great house was surrounded by numerous and variously shaped out-buildings . There were kitchens , wash-houses , dairies , summer-house , green-houses , hen-houses , turkey-houses , pigeon-houses , and arbors , of many sizes and devices , all neatly painted , and altogether interspersed with grand old trees , ornamental and primitive , which afforded delightful shade in52 summer , and imparted to the scene a high degree of stately beauty . The great house itself was a large , white , wooden building , with wings on three sides of it . In front , a large portico , extending the entire length of the building , and supported by a long range of columns , gave to the whole establishment an air of solemn grandeur . It was a treat to my young and gradually opening mind , to behold this elaborate exhibition of wealth , power , and vanity . The carriage entrance to the house was a large gate , more than a quarter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful lawn , very neatly trimmed , and watched with the greatest care . It was dotted thickly over with delightful trees , shrubbery , and flowers . The road , or lane , from the gate to the great house , was richly paved with white pebbles from the beach , and , in its course , formed a complete circle around the beautiful lawn . Carriages going in and retiring from the great house , made the circuit of the lawn , and their passengers were permitted to behold a scene of almost Eden-like beauty . Outside this select inclosure , were parks , where as about the residences of the English nobility  --  rabbits , deer , and other wild game , might be seen , peering and playing about , with none to molest them or make them afraid . The tops of the stately poplars were often covered with the red-winged black-birds , making all nature vocal with the joyous life and beauty of their wild , warbling notes . These all belonged to me , as well as to Col. Edward Lloyd , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the great house , were the stately mansions of the dead , a place of somber aspect . Vast tombs , embowered beneath the weeping willow and the fir tree , told of the antiquities of the Lloyd family , as well as of their wealth . Superstition was rife among the slaves about this family burying ground . Strange sights had been seen there by some of the older slaves . Shrouded ghosts , riding on great black horses , had been seen to enter ; balls of fire had been seen to fly there at midnight , and horrid sounds had been repeatedly heard . Slaves know53 enough of the rudiments of theology to believe that those go to hell who die slaveholders ; and they often fancy such persons wishing themselves back again , to wield the lash . Tales of sights and sounds , strange and terrible , connected with the huge black tombs , were a very great security to the grounds about them , for few of the slaves felt like approaching them even in the day time . It was a dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that the spirits of the sleeping dust there deposited , reigned with the blest in the realms of eternal peace . The business of twenty or thirty farms was transacted at this , called , by way of eminence , " great house farm . " These farms all belonged to Col. Lloyd , as did , also , the slaves upon them . Each farm was under the management of an overseer . As I have said of the overseer of the home plantation , so I may say of the overseers on the smaller ones ; they stand between the slave and all civil constitutions  --  their word is law , and is implicitly obeyed . The colonel , at this time , was reputed to be , and he apparently was , very rich . His slaves , alone , were an immense fortune . These , small and great , could not have been fewer than one thousand in number , and though scarcely a month passed without the sale of one or more lots to the Georgia traders , there was no apparent diminution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely groaned at a removal of the young increase , or human crop , then proceeded as lively as ever . Horse-shoeing , cart-mending , plow-repairing , coopering , grinding , and weaving , for all the neighboring farms , were performed here , and slaves were employed in all these branches . " Uncle Tony " was the blacksmith ; " Uncle Harry " was the cartwright ; " Uncle Abel " was the shoemaker ; and all these had hands to assist them in their several departments . These mechanics were called " uncles " by all the younger slaves , not because they really sustained that relationship to any , but according to plantation etiquette , as a mark of respect , due54 from the younger to the older slaves . Strange , and even ridiculous as it may seem , among a people so uncultivated , and with so many stern trials to look in the face , there is not to be found , among any people , a more rigid enforcement of the law of respect to elders , than they maintain . I set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly conventional . There is no better material in the world for making a gentleman , than is furnished in the African . He shows to others , and exacts for himself , all the tokens of respect which he is compelled to manifest toward his master . A young slave must approach the company of the older with hat in hand , and woe betide him , if he fails to acknowledge a favor , of any sort , with the accustomed " tank'ee , " &c.; So uniformly are good manners enforced among slaves , I can easily detect a " bogus " fugitive by his manners . Among other slave notabilities of the plantation , was one called by everybody Uncle Isaac Copper . It is seldom that a slave gets a surname from anybody in Maryland ; and so completely has the south shaped the manners of the north , in this respect , that even abolitionists make very little of the surname of a Negro . The only improvement on the " Bills , " " Jacks , " " Jims , " and " Neds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " William , " " John , " " James , " " Edward , " are substituted . It goes against the grain to treat and address a Negro precisely as they would treat and address a white man . But , once in a while , in slavery as in the free states , by some extraordinary circumstance , the Negro has a surname fastened to him , and holds it against all conventionalities . This was the case with Uncle Isaac Copper . When the " uncle " was dropped , he generally had the prefix " doctor , " in its stead . He was our doctor of medicine , and doctor of divinity as well . Where he took his degree I am unable to say , for he was not very communicative to inferiors , and I was emphatically such , being but a boy seven or eight years old . He was too well established in his profession to permit questions as to his native skill , or his attainments . One qualification he undoubtedly had  --  he55 PRAYING AND FLOGGING was a confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bring anything if offered for sale in the market . The old man , though lame , was no sluggard . He was a man that made his crutches do him good service . He was always on the alert , four articles . For diseases of the body , Epsom salts and castor oil ; for those of the soul , the Lord 's Prayer , and hickory switches ! I was not long at Col. Lloyd 's before I was placed under the care of Doctor Issac Copper . I was sent to him with twenty or thirty other children , to learn the " Lord 's Prayer . " I found the old gentleman seated on a huge three-legged oaken stool , armed with several large hickory switches ; and , from his position , he could reach  --  lame as he was  --  any boy in the room . After standing awhile to learn what was expected of us , the old gentleman , in any other than a devotional tone , commanded us to kneel down . This done , he commenced telling us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was repeated after him with promptness and uniformity ; " Who art in heaven "  --  was less promptly and uniformly repeated ; and the old gentleman paused in the prayer , to give us a short lecture upon the consequences of inattention , both immediate and future , and especially those more immediate . About these he was absolutely certain , for he held in his right hand the means of bringing all his predictions and warnings to pass . On he proceeded with the prayer ; and we with our thick tongues and unskilled ears , followed him to the best of our ability . This , however , was not sufficient to please the old gentleman . Everybody , in the south , wants the privilege of whipping somebody else . Uncle Isaac shared the common passion of his country , and , therefore , seldom found any means of keeping his disciples in order short of flogging . " Say everything I say ; " and bang would come the switch on some poor boy 's undevotional head . " What you looking at there " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come the lash. 56 The whip is all in all . It is supposed to secure obedience to the slaveholder , and is held as a sovereign remedy among the slaves themselves , for every form of disobedience , temporal or spiritual . Slaves , as well as slaveholders , use it with an unsparing hand . Our devotions at Uncle Isaac 's combined too much of the tragic and comic , to make them very salutary in a spiritual point of view ; and it is due to truth to say , I was often a truant when the time for attending the praying and flogging of Doctor Isaac Copper came on . The windmill under the care of Mr. Kinney , a kind hearted old Englishman , was to me a source of infinite interest and pleasure . The old man always seemed pleased when he saw a troop of darkey little urchins , with their tow-linen shirts fluttering in the breeze , approaching to view and admire the whirling wings of his wondrous machine . From the mill we could see other objects of deep interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their way to Baltimore . It was a source of much amusement to view the flowing sails and complicated rigging , as the little crafts dashed by , and to speculate upon Baltimore , as to the kind and quality of the place . With so many sources of interest around me , the reader may be prepared to learn that I began to think very highly of Col. L. 's plantation . It was just a place to my boyish taste . There were fish to be caught in the creek , if one only had a hook and line ; and crabs , clams and oysters were to be caught by wading , digging and raking for them . Here was a field for industry and enterprise , strongly inviting ; and the reader may be assured that I entered upon it with spirit . Even the much dreaded old master , whose merciless fiat had brought me from Tuckahoe , gradually , to my mind , parted with his terrors . Strange enough , his reverence seemed to take no particular notice of me , nor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he scarcely seemed conscious of my presence . The fact is , he was occupied with matters more weighty and important than either looking after or vexing me . He probably thought as57 " OLD MASTER " LOSING ITS TERRORS little of my advent , as he would have thought of the addition of a single pig to his stock ! As the chief butler on Col. Lloyd 's plantation , his duties were numerous and perplexing . In almost all important matters he answered in Col. Lloyd 's stead . The overseers of all the farms were in some sort under him , and received the law from his mouth . The colonel himself seldom addressed an overseer , or allowed an overseer to address him . Old master carried the keys of all store houses ; measured out the allowance for each slave at the end of every month ; superintended the storing of all goods brought to the plantation ; dealt out the raw material to all the handicraftsmen ; shipped the grain , tobacco , and all saleable produce of the plantation to market , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelwrights ' shop , blacksmiths ' shop , and shoemakers ' shop . Besides the care of these , he often had business for the plantation which required him to be absent two and three days . Thus largely employed , he had little time , and perhaps as little disposition , to interfere with the children individually . What he was to Col. Lloyd , he made Aunt Katy to him . When he had anything to say or do about us , it was said or done in a wholesale manner ; disposing of us in classes or sizes , leaving all minor details to Aunt Katy , a person of whom the reader has already received no very favorable impression . Aunt Katy was a woman who never allowed herself to act greatly within the margin of power granted to her , no matter how broad that authority might be . Ambitious , ill-tempered and cruel , she found in her present position an ample field for the exercise of her ill-omened qualities . She had a strong hold on old master she was considered a first rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , therefore , greatly favored by old master , and as one mark of his favor , she was the only mother who was permitted to retain her children around her . Even to these children she was often fiendish in her brutality . She pursued her son Phil , one day , in58 my presence , with a huge butcher knife , and dealt a blow with its edge which left a shocking gash on his arm , near the wrist . For this , old master did sharply rebuke her , and threatened that if she ever should do the like again , he would take the skin off her back . Cruel , however , as Aunt Katy was to her own children , at times she was not destitute of maternal feeling , as I often had occasion to know , in the bitter pinches of hunger I had to endure . Differing from the practice of Col. Lloyd , old master , instead of allowing so much for each slave , committed the allowance for all to the care of Aunt Katy , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting of coarse corn-meal , was not very abundant  --  indeed , it was very slender ; and in passing through Aunt Katy 's hands , it was made more slender still , for some of us . William , Phil and Jerry were her children , and it is not to accuse her too severely , to allege that she was often guilty of starving myself and the other children , while she was literally cramming her own . Want of food was my chief trouble the first summer at my old master 's . Oysters and clams would do very well , with an occasional supply of bread , but they soon failed in the absence of bread . I speak but the simple truth , when I say , I have often been so pinched with hunger , that I have fought with the dog  --  " Old Nep "  --  for the smallest crumbs that fell from the kitchen table , and have been glad when I won a single crumb in the combat . Many times have I followed , with eager step , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get the crumbs and small bones flung out for the cats . The water , in which meat had been boiled , was as eagerly sought for by me . It was a great thing to get the privilege of dipping a piece of bread in such water ; and the skin taken from rusty bacon , was a positive luxury . Nevertheless , I sometimes got full meals and kind words from sympathizing old slaves , who knew my sufferings , and received the comforting assurance that I should be a man some day . " Never mind , honey  --  better day comin ' , " was even then a solace , a cheering consolation to me in my59 troubles . Nor were all the kind words I received from slaves . I had a friend in the parlor , as well , and one to whom I shall be glad to do justice , before I have finished this part of my story . I was not long at old master 's , before I learned that his surname was Anthony , and that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he probably acquired by sailing a craft in the Chesapeake Bay . Col. Lloyd 's slaves never called Capt . Anthony " old master , " but always Capt . Anthony ; and me they called " Captain Anthony Fred . " There is not , probably , in the whole south , a plantation where the English language is more imperfectly spoken than on Col. Lloyd 's . It is a mixture of Guinea and everything else you please . At the time of which I am now writing , there were slaves there who had been brought from the coast of Africa . They never used the " s " in indication of the possessive case . " Cap'n Ant'ney Tom , " " Lloyd Bill , " " Aunt Rose Harry , " means " Captain Anthony 's Tom , " " Lloyd 's Bill , " &c.; " Oo you dem long to ? " means , " Whom do you belong to ? " " Oo dem got any peachy ? " means , " Have you got any peaches ? " I could scarcely understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their speech ; and I am persuaded that I could not have been dropped anywhere on the globe , where I could reap less , in the way of knowledge , from my immediate associates , than on this plantation . Even " MAS ' DANIEL , " by his association with his father 's slaves , had measurably adopted their dialect and their ideas , so far as they had ideas to be adopted . The equality of nature is strongly asserted in childhood , and childhood requires children for associates . Color makes no difference with a child . Are you a child with wants , tastes and pursuits common to children , not put on , but natural ? then , were you black as ebony you would be welcome to the child of alabaster whiteness . The law of compensation holds here , as well as elsewhere . Mas ' Daniel could not associate with ignorance without sharing its shade ; and he could not give his black playmates his company , without giving them his intelligence , as well . Without knowing60 this , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some cause or other , spent much of my time with Mas ' Daniel , in preference to spending it with most of the other boys . Mas ' Daniel was the youngest son of Col. Lloyd ; his older brothers were Edward and Murray  --  both grown up , and fine looking men . Edward was especially esteemed by the children , and by me among the rest ; not that he ever said anything to us or for us , which could be called especially kind ; it was enough for us , that he never looked nor acted scornfully toward us . There were also three sisters , all married ; one to Edward Winder ; a second to Edward Nicholson ; a third to Mr. Lownes . The family of old master consisted of two sons , Andrew and Richard ; his daughter , Lucretia , and her newly married husband , Capt . Auld . This was the house family . The kitchen family consisted of Aunt Katy , Aunt Esther , and ten or a dozen children , most of them older than myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was pretty well off in the world . He owned about thirty " head " of slaves , and three farms in Tuckahoe . The most valuable part of his property was his slaves , of whom he could afford to sell one every year . This crop , therefore , brought him seven or eight hundred dollars a year , besides his yearly salary , and other revenue from his farms . The idea of rank and station was rigidly maintained on Col. Lloyd 's plantation . Our family never visited the great house , and the Lloyds never came to our home . Equal non-intercourse was observed between Capt . Anthony 's family and that of Mr. Sevier , the overseer . Such , kind reader , was the community , and such the place , in which my earliest and most lasting impressions of slavery , and of slave-life , were received ; of which impressions you will learn more in the coming chapters of this book . CHAPTER V. Gradual Initiation to the Mysteries of Slavery GROWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH OLD MASTER  --  HIS CHARACTER  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A MAN OF TROUBLE  --  CUSTOM OF MUTTERING TO HIMSELF  --  NECESSITY OF BEING AWARE OF HIS WORDS  --  THE SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN  --  BRUTAL OUTRAGE  --  DRUNKEN OVERSEER  --  SLAVEHOLDER 'S IMPATIENCE  --  WISDOM OF APPEALING TO SUPERIORS  --  THE SLAVEHOLDER S WRATH BAD AS THAT OF THE OVERSEER  --  A BASE AND SELFISH ATTEMPT TO BREAK UP A COURTSHIP  --  A HARROWING SCENE . Although my old master  --  Capt . Anthony  --  gave me at first , ( as the reader will have already seen ) very little attention , and although that little was of a remarkably mild and gentle description , a few months only were sufficient to convince me that mildness and gentleness were not the prevailing or governing traits of his character . These excellent qualities were displayed only occasionally . He could , when it suited him , appear to be literally insensible to the claims of humanity , when appealed to by the helpless against an aggressor , and he could himself commit outrages , deep , dark and nameless . Yet he was not by nature worse than other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surrounded by the just restraints of free society  --  restraints which are necessary to the freedom of all its members , alike and equally  --  Capt . Anthony might have been as humane a man , and every way as respectable , as many who now oppose the slave system ; certainly as humane and respectable as are members of society generally . The slaveholder , as well as the slave , is the victim of the slave62 system . A man 's character greatly takes its hue and shape from the form and color of things about him . Under the whole heavens there is no relation more unfavorable to the development of honorable character , than that sustained by the slaveholder to the slave . Reason is imprisoned here , and passions run wild . Like the fires of the prairie , once lighted , they are at the mercy of every wind , and must burn , till they have consumed all that is combustible within their remorseless grasp . Capt . Anthony could be kind , and , at times , he even showed an affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by the hand  --  as he sometimes did  --  patting me on the head , speaking to me in soft , caressing tones and calling me his " little Indian boy , " he would have deemed him a kind old man , and really , almost fatherly . But the pleasant moods of a slaveholder are remarkably brittle ; they are easily snapped ; they neither come often , nor remain long . His temper is subjected to perpetual trials ; but , since these trials are never borne patiently , they add nothing to his natural stock of patience . Old master very early impressed me with the idea that he was an unhappy man . Even to my child 's eye , he wore a troubled , and at times , a haggard aspect . His strange movements excited my curiosity , and awakened my compassion . He seldom walked alone without muttering to himself ; and he occasionally stormed about , as if defying an army of invisible foes . " He would do this , that , and the other ; he 'd be d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual form of his threats . Most of his leisure was spent in walking , cursing and gesticulating , like one possessed by a demon . Most evidently , he was a wretched man , at war with his own soul , and with all the world around him . To be overheard by the children , disturbed him very little . He made no more of our presence , than of that of the ducks and geese which he met on the green . He little thought that the little black urchins around him , could see , through those vocal crevices , the very secrets of his heart . Slaveholders ever underrate the intelligence with which63 SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN they have to grapple . I really understood the old man 's mutterings , attitudes and gestures , about as well as he did himself . But slaveholders never encourage that kind of communication , with the slaves , by which they might learn to measure the depths of his knowledge . Ignorance is a high virtue in a human chattel ; and as the master studies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the master think he succeeds . The slave fully appreciates the saying , " where ignorance is bliss , ' t is folly to be wise . " When old master 's gestures were violent , ending with a threatening shake of the head , and a sharp snap of his middle finger and thumb , I deemed it wise to keep at a respectable distance from him ; for , at such times , trifling faults stood , in his eyes , as momentous offenses ; and , having both the power and the disposition , the victim had only to be near him to catch the punishment , deserved or undeserved . One of the first circumstances that opened my eyes to the cruelty and wickedness of slavery , and the heartlessness of my old master , was the refusal of the latter to interpose his authority , to protect and shield a young woman , who had been most cruelly abused and beaten by his overseer in Tuckahoe . This overseer  --  a Mr. Plummer  --  was a man like most of his class , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his general profligacy and repulsive coarseness , the creature was a miserable drunkard . He was , probably , employed by my old master , less on account of the excellence of his services , than for the cheap rate at which they could be obtained . He was not fit to have the management of a drove of mules . In a fit of drunken madness , he committed the outrage which brought the young woman in question down to my old master 's for protection . This young woman was the daughter of Milly , an own aunt of mine . The poor girl , on arriving at our house , presented a pitiable appearance . She had left in haste , and without preparation ; and , probably , without the knowledge of Mr. Plummer . She had traveled twelve miles , bare-footed , bare-necked and bare-headed . Her neck and shoulders64 were covered with scars , newly made ; and not content with marring her neck and shoulders , with the cowhide , the cowardly brute had dealt her a blow on the head with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her face literally covered with blood . In this condition , the poor young woman came down , to implore protection at the hands of my old master . I expected to see him boil over with rage at the revolting deed , and to hear him fill the air with curses upon the brutual Plummer ; but I was disappointed . He sternly told her , in an angry tone , he " believed she deserved every bit of it , " and , if she did not go home instantly , he would himself take the remaining skin from her neck and back . Thus was the poor girl compelled to return , without redress , and perhaps to receive an additional flogging for daring to appeal to old master against the overseer . Old master seemed furious at the thought of being troubled by such complaints . I did not , at that time , understand the philosophy of his treatment of my cousin . It was stern , unnatural , violent . Had the man no bowels of compassion ? Was he dead to all sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This treatment is a part of the system , rather than a part of the man . Were slaveholders to listen to complaints of this sort against the overseers , the luxury of owning large numbers of slaves , would be impossible . It would do away with the office of overseer , entirely ; or , in other words , it would convert the master himself into an overseer . It would occasion great loss of time and labor , leaving the overseer in fetters , and without the necessary power to secure obedience to his orders . A privilege so dangerous as that of appeal , is , therefore , strictly prohibited ; and any one exercising it , runs a fearful hazard . Nevertheless , when a slave has nerve enough to exercise it , and boldly approaches his master , with a well-founded complaint against an overseer , though he may be repulsed , and may even have that of which he complains repeated at the time , and , though he may be beaten by his master , as well as by the overseer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complaining is , generally , vindicated by the relaxed rigor of the overseer 's treatment . The latter becomes more careful , and less disposed to use the lash upon such slaves thereafter . It is with this final result in view , rather than with any expectation of immediate good , that the outraged slave is induced to meet his master with a complaint . The overseer very naturally dislikes to have the ear of the master disturbed by complaints ; and , either upon this consideration , or upon advice and warning privately given him by his employers , he generally modifies the rigor of his rule , after an outbreak of the kind to which I have been referring . Howsoever the slaveholder may allow himself to act toward his slave , and , whatever cruelty he may deem it wise , for example 's sake , or for the gratification of his humor , to inflict , he can not , in the absence of all provocation , look with pleasure upon the bleeding wounds of a defenseless slave-woman . When he drives her from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he acts , generally , from motives of policy , rather than from a hardened nature , or from innate brutality . Yet , let but his own temper be stirred , his own passions get loose , and the slave-owner will go far beyond the overseer in cruelty . He will convince the slave that his wrath is far more terrible and boundless , and vastly more to be dreaded , than that of the underling overseer . What may have been mechanically and heartlessly done by the overseer , is now done with a will . The man who now wields the lash is irresponsible . He may , if he pleases , cripple or kill , without fear of consequences ; except in so far as it may concern profit or loss . To a man of violent temper  --  as my old master was  --  this was but a very slender and inefficient restraint . I have seen him in a tempest of passion , such as I have just described  --  a passion into which entered all the bitter ingredients of pride , hatred , envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances which I am about to narrate , and which gave rise to this fearful tempest of passion , are not singular nor66 isolated in slave life , but are common in every slaveholding community in which I have lived . They are incidental to the relation of master and slave , and exist in all sections of slave-holding countries . The reader will have noticed that , in enumerating the names of the slaves who lived with my old master , Esther is mentioned . This was a young woman who possessed that which is ever a curse to the slave-girl ; namely  --  personal beauty . She was tall , well formed , and made a fine appearance . The daughters of Col. Lloyd could scarcely surpass her in personal charms . Esther was courted by Ned Roberts , and he was as fine looking a young man , as she was a woman . He was the son of a favorite slave of Col. Lloyd . Some slaveholders would have been glad to promote the marriage of two such persons ; but , for some reason or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the growing intimacy between Esther and Edward . He strictly ordered her to quit the company of said Roberts , telling her that he would punish her severely if he ever found her again in Edward 's company . This unnatural and heartless order was , of course , broken . A woman 's love is not to be annihilated by the peremptory command of any one , whose breath is in his nostrils . It was impossible to keep Edward and Esther apart . Meet they would , and meet they did . Had old master been a man of honor and purity , his motives , in this matter , might have been viewed more favorably . As it was , his motives were as abhorrent , as his methods were foolish and contemptible . It was too evident that he was not concerned for the girl 's welfare . It is one of the damning characteristics of the slave system , that it robs its victims of every earthly incentive to a holy life . The fear of God , and the hope of heaven , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangers of their strange lot ; but , this side of God and heaven , a slave-woman is at the mercy of the power , caprice and passion of her owner . Slavery provides no means for the honorable continuance of the race . Marriage as imposing obligations on the parties to it  --  has no67 A HARROWING SCENE existence here , except in such hearts as are purer and higher than the standard morality around them . It is one of the consolations of my life , that I know of many honorable instances of persons who maintained their honor , where all around was corrupt . Esther was evidently much attached to Edward , and abhorred  --  as she had reason to do  --  the tyrannical and base behavior of old master . Edward was young , and fine looking , and he loved and courted her . He might have been her husband , in the high sense just alluded to ; but WHO and what was this old master ? His attentions were plainly brutal and selfish , and it was as natural that Esther should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abhorred and circumvented as he was , old master , having the power , very easily took revenge . I happened to see this exhibition of his rage and cruelty toward Esther . The time selected was singular . It was early in the morning , when all besides was still , and before any of the family , in the house or kitchen , had left their beds . I saw but few of the shocking preliminaries , for the cruel work had begun before I awoke . I was probably awakened by the shrieks and piteous cries of poor Esther . My sleeping place was on the floor of a little , rough closet , which opened into the kitchen ; and through the cracks of its unplaned boards , I could distinctly see and hear what was going on , without being seen by old master . Esther 's wrists were firmly tied , and the twisted rope was fastened to a strong staple in a heavy wooden joist above , near the fireplace . Here she stood , on a bench , her arms tightly drawn over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist . Behind her stood old master , with cowskin in hand , preparing his barbarous work with all manner of harsh , coarse , and tantalizing epithets . The screams of his victim were most piercing . He was cruelly deliberate , and protracted the torture , as one who was delighted with the scene . Again and again he drew the hateful whip through his hand , adjusting it with a view of dealing the most pain-giving blow . Poor Esther had never yet been severely whipped , and her shoulders68 were plump and tender . Each blow , vigorously laid on , brought screams as well as blood . " Have mercy ; Oh ! have mercy " she cried ; " I wo n't do so no more ; " but her piercing cries seemed only to increase his fury . His answers to them are too coarse and blasphemous to be produced here . The whole scene , with all its attendants , was revolting and shocking , to the last degree ; and when the motives of this brutal castigation are considered ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its awful criminality . After laying on some thirty or forty stripes , old master untied his suffering victim , and let her get down . She could scarcely stand , when untied . From my heart I pitied her , and  --  child though I was  --  the outrage kindled in me a feeling far from peaceful ; but I was hushed , terrified , stunned , and could do nothing , and the fate of Esther might be mine next . The scene here described was often repeated in the case of poor Esther , and her life , as I knew it , was one of wretchedness . CHAPTER VI . Treatment of Slaves on Lloyd 's Plantation EARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY  --  PRESENTIMENT OF ONE DAY BEING A FREEMAN  --  COMBAT BETWEEN AN OVERSEER AND A SLAVEWOMAN  --  THE ADVANTAGES OF RESISTANCE  --  ALLOWANCE DAY ON THE HOME PLANTATION  --  THE SINGING OF SLAVES  --  AN EXPLANATION  --  THE SLAVES FOOD AND CLOTHING  --  NAKED CHILDREN  --  LIFE IN THE QUARTER  --  DEPRIVATION OF SLEEP  --  NURSING CHILDREN CARRIED TO THE FIELD  --  DESCRIPTION OF THE COWSKIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DINNER HOUR  --  THE CONTRAST . The heart-rending incidents , related in the foregoing chapter , led me , thus early , to inquire into the nature and history of slavery . Why am I a slave ? Why are some people slaves , and others masters ? Was there ever a time this was not so ? How did the relation commence ? These were the perplexing questions which began now to claim my thoughts , and to exercise the weak powers of my mind , for I was still but a child , and knew less than children of the same age in the free states . As my questions concerning these things were only put to children a little older , and little better informed than myself , I was not rapid in reaching a solid footing . By some means I learned from these inquiries that " God , up in the sky , " made every body ; and that he made white people to be masters and mistresses , and black people to be slaves . This did not satisfy me , nor lessen my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that God was good , and that He knew what was best for me , and best for everybody . This was less satisfactory than the first statement ; because it came , point blank , against all my70 notions of goodness . It was not good to let old master cut the flesh off Esther , and make her cry so . Besides , how did people know that God made black people to be slaves ? Did they go up in the sky and learn it ? or , did He come down and tell them so ? All was dark here . It was some relief to my hard notions of the goodness of God , that , although he made white men to be slaveholders , he did not make them to be bad slaveholders , and that , in due time , he would punish the bad slaveholders ; that he would , when they died , send them to the bad place , where they would be " burnt up . " Nevertheless , I could not reconcile the relation of slavery with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that there were puzzling exceptions to this theory of slavery on both sides , and in the middle . I knew of blacks who were not slaves ; I knew of whites who were not slaveholders ; and I knew of persons who were nearly white , who were slaves . Color , therefore , was a very unsatisfactory basis for slavery . Once , however , engaged in the inquiry , I was not very long in finding out the true solution of the matter . It was not color , but crime , not God , but man , that afforded the true explanation of the existence of slavery ; nor was I long in finding out another important truth , viz : what man can make , man can unmake . The appalling darkness faded away , and I was master of the subject . There were slaves here , direct from Guinea ; and there were many who could say that their fathers and mothers were stolen from Africa  --  forced from their homes , and compelled to serve as slaves . This , to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge which filled me with a burning hatred of slavery , increased my suffering , and left me without the means of breaking away from my bondage . Yet it was knowledge quite worth possessing . I could not have been more than seven or eight years old , when I began to make this subject my study . It was with me in the woods and fields ; along the shore of the river , and wherever my boyish wanderings led me ; and though I was , at that time , 71 EARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY quite ignorant of the existence of the free states , I distinctly remember being , even then , most strongly impressed with the idea of being a freeman some day . This cheering assurance was an inborn dream of my human nature a constant menace to slavery  --  and one which all the powers of slavery were unable to silence or extinguish . Up to the time of the brutal flogging of my Aunt Esther  --  for she was my own aunt  --  and the horrid plight in which I had seen my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cruel Mr. Plummer , my attention had not been called , especially , to the gross features of slavery . I had , of course , heard of whippings and of savage rencontres between overseers and slaves , but I had always been out of the way at the times and places of their occurrence . My plays and sports , most of the time , took me from the corn and tobacco fields , where the great body of the hands were at work , and where scenes of cruelty were enacted and witnessed . But , after the whipping of Aunt Esther , I saw many cases of the same shocking nature , not only in my master 's house , but on Col. Lloyd 's plantation . One of the first which I saw , and which greatly agitated me , was the whipping of a woman belonging to Col. Lloyd , named Nelly . The offense alleged against Nelly , was one of the commonest and most indefinite in the whole catalogue of offenses usually laid to the charge of slaves , viz : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all , just according to the caprice of the master or overseer , at the moment . But , whatever it is , or is not , if it gets the name of " impudence , " the party charged with it is sure of a flogging . This offense may be committed in various ways ; in the tone of an answer ; in answering at all ; in not answering ; in the expression of countenance ; in the motion of the head ; in the gait , manner and bearing of the slave . In the case under consideration , I can easily believe that , according to all slaveholding standards , here was a genuine instance of impudence . In Nelly there were all the necessary conditions for committing the offense . She was72 a bright mulatto , the recognized wife of a favorite " hand " on board Col. Lloyd 's sloop , and the mother of five sprightly children . She was a vigorous and spirited woman , and one of the most likely , on the plantation , to be guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the noise , curses and screams that proceeded from it ; and , on going a little in that direction , I came upon the parties engaged in the skirmish . Mr. Siever , the overseer , had hold of Nelly , when I caught sight of them ; he was endeavoring to drag her toward a tree , which endeavor Nelly was sternly resisting ; but to no purpose , except to retard the progress of the overseer 's plans . Nelly  --  as I have said  --  was the mother of five children ; three of them were present , and though quite small ( from seven to ten years old , I should think ) they gallantly came to their mother 's defense , and gave the overseer an excellent pelting with stones . One of the little fellows ran up , seized the overseer by the leg and bit him ; but the monster was too busily engaged with Nelly , to pay any attention to the assaults of the children . There were numerous bloody marks on Mr. Sevier 's face , when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . The imprints of Nelly 's fingers were visible , and I was glad to see them . Amidst the wild screams of the children  --  " Let my mammy go "  --  " let my mammy go "  --  there escaped , from between the teeth of the bullet-headed overseer , a few bitter curses , mingled with threats , that " he would teach the d  --  d b  --  h how to give a white man impudence . " There is no doubt that Nelly felt herself superior , in some respects , to the slaves around her . She was a wife and a mother ; her husband was a valued and favorite slave . Besides , he was one of the first hands on board of the sloop , and the sloop hands  --  since they had to represent the plantation abroad  --  were generally treated tenderly . The overseer never was allowed to whip Harry ; why then should he be allowed to whip Harry 's wife ? Thoughts of this kind , no doubt , influenced her ; but , for whatever reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaves , 73 COMBAT BETWEEN MR . SEVIER AND NELLY seemed determined to make her whipping cost Mr. Sevier as much as possible . The blood on his ( and her ) face , attested her skill , as well as her courage and dexterity in using her nails . Maddened by her resistance , I expected to see Mr. Sevier level her to the ground by a stunning blow ; but no ; like a savage bull-dog  --  which he resembled both in temper and appearance  --  he maintained his grip , and steadily dragged his victim toward the tree , disregarding alike her blows , and the cries of the children for their mother 's release . He would , doubtless , have knocked her down with his hickory stick , but that such act might have cost him his place . It is often deemed advisable to knock a man slave down , in order to tie him , but it is considered cowardly and inexcusable , in an overseer , thus to deal with a woman . He is expected to tie her up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " genteel flogging , " without any very great outlay of strength or skill . I watched , with palpitating interest , the course of the preliminary struggle , and was saddened by every new advantage gained over her by the ruffian . There were times when she seemed likely to get the better of the brute , but he finally overpowered her , and succeeded in getting his rope around her arms , and in firmly tying her to the tree , at which he had been aiming . This done , and Nelly was at the mercy of his merciless lash ; and now , what followed , I have no heart to describe . The cowardly creature made good his every threat ; and wielded the lash with all the hot zest of furious revenge . The cries of the woman , while undergoing the terrible infliction , were mingled with those of the children , sounds which I hope the reader may never be called upon to hear . When Nelly was untied , her back was covered with blood . The red stripes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped ; but she was not subdued , for she continued to denounce the overseer , and to call him every vile name . He had bruised her flesh , but had left her invincible spirit undaunted . Such floggings are seldom repeated by the same overseer . They prefer to whip those74 who are most easily whipped . The old doctrine that submission is the very best cure for outrage and wrong , does not hold good on the slave plantation . He is whipped oftenest , who is whipped easiest ; and that slave who has the courage to stand up for himself against the overseer , although he may have many hard stripes at the first , becomes , in the end , a freeman , even though he sustain the formal relation of a slave . " You can shoot me but you ca n't whip me , " said a slave to Rigby Hopkins ; and the result was that he was neither whipped nor shot . If the latter had been his fate , it would have been less deplorable than the living and lingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know that Mr. Sevier ever undertook to whip Nelly again . He probably never did , for it was not long after his attempt to subdue her , that he was taken sick , and died . The wretched man died as he had lived , unrepentant ; and it was said  --  with how much truth I know not  --  that in the very last hours of his life , his ruling passion showed itself , and that when wrestling with death , he was uttering horrid oaths , and flourishing the cowskin , as though he was tearing the flesh off some helpless slave . One thing is certain , that when he was in health , it was enough to chill the blood , and to stiffen the hair of an ordinary man , to hear Mr. Sevier talk . Nature , or his cruel habits , had given to his face an expression of unusual savageness , even for a slave-driver . Tobacco and rage had worn his teeth short , and nearly every sentence that escaped their compressed grating , was commenced or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field alike the field of blood , and of blasphemy . Hated for his cruelty , despised for his cowardice , his death was deplored by no one outside his own house  --  if indeed it was deplored there ; it was regarded by the slaves as a merciful interposition of Providence . Never went there a man to the grave loaded with heavier curses . Mr. Sevier 's place was promptly taken by a Mr. Hopkins , and the change was quite a relief , he being a very different man . He was , in75 all respects , a better man than his predecessor ; as good as any man can be , and yet be an overseer . His course was characterized by no extraordinary cruelty ; and when he whipped a slave , as he sometimes did , he seemed to take no especial pleasure in it , but , on the contrary , acted as though he felt it to be a mean business . Mr. Hopkins stayed but a short time ; his place much to the regret of the slaves generally  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said hereafter . It is enough , for the present , to say , that he was no improvement on Mr. Sevier , except that he was less noisy and less profane . I have already referred to the business-like aspect of Col. Lloyd 's plantation . This business-like appearance was much increased on the two days at the end of each month , when the slaves from the different farms came to get their monthly allowance of meal and meat . These were gala days for the slaves , and there was much rivalry among them as to who should be elected to go up to the great house farm for the allowance , and , indeed , to attend to any business at this ( for them ) the capital . The beauty and grandeur of the place , its numerous slave population , and the fact that Harry , Peter and Jake the sailors of the sloop  --  almost always kept , privately , little trinkets which they bought at Baltimore , to sell , made it a privilege to come to the great house farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed a high honor . It was taken as a proof of confidence and favor ; but , probably , the chief motive of the competitors for the place , was , a desire to break the dull monotony of the field , and to get beyond the overseer 's eye and lash . Once on the road with an ox team , and seated on the tongue of his cart , with no overseer to look after him , the slave was comparatively free ; and , if thoughtful , he had time to think . Slaves are generally expected to sing as well as to work . A silent slave is not liked by masters or overseers . " Make a noise , " " make a noise , " and " bear a hand , " are the words usually addressed to the slaves when there is silence amongst them . This may account for the almost constant singing76 heard in the southern states . There was , generally , more or less singing among the teamsters , as it was one means of letting the overseer know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the work . But , on allowance day , those who visited the great house farm were peculiarly excited and noisy . While on their way , they would make the dense old woods , for miles around , reverberate with their wild notes . These were not always merry because they were wild . On the contrary , they were mostly of a plaintive cast , and told a tale of grief and sorrow . In the most boisterous outbursts of rapturous sentiment , there was ever a tinge of deep melancholy . I have never heard any songs like those anywhere since I left slavery , except when in Ireland . There I heard the same wailing notes , and was much affected by them . It was during the famine of 1845-6 . In all the songs of the slaves , there was ever some expression in praise of the great house farm ; something which would flatter the pride of the owner , and , possibly , draw a favorable glance from him . I am going away to the great house farm , O yea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good old master , O yea ! O yea ! O yea ! This they would sing , with other words of their own improvising  --  jargon to others , but full of meaning to themselves . I have sometimes thought , that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress truly spiritual-minded men and women with the soul-crushing and death-dealing character of slavery , than the reading of whole volumes of its mere physical cruelties . They speak to the heart and to the soul of the thoughtful . I can not better express my sense of them now , than ten years ago , when , in sketching my life , I thus spoke of this feature of my plantation experience : I did not , when a slave , understand the deep meanings of those rude , and apparently incoherent songs . I was myself within the circle , so that I neither saw or heard as those without might see and hear . They told a tale which was77 then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension ; they were tones , loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish . Every tone was a testimony against slavery , and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains . The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirits , and filled my heart with ineffable sadness . The mere recurrence , even now , afflicts my spirit , and while I am writing these lines , my tears are falling . To those songs I trace my first glimmering conceptions of the dehumanizing character of slavery . I can never get rid of that conception . Those songs still follow me , to deepen my hatred of slavery , and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds . If any one wishes to be impressed with a sense of the soul-killing power of slavery , let him go to Col. Lloyd 's plantation , and , on allowance day , place himself in the deep , pine woods , and there let him , in silence , thoughtfully analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul , and if he is not thus impressed , it will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . " The remark is not unfrequently made , that slaves are the most contended and happy laborers in the world . They dance and sing , and make all manner of joyful noises  --  so they do ; but it is a great mistake to suppose them happy because they sing . The songs of the slave represent the sorrows , rather than the joys , of his heart ; and he is relieved by them , only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears . Such is the constitution of the human mind , that , when pressed to extremes , it often avails itself of the most opposite methods . Extremes meet in mind as in matter . When the slaves on board of the " Pearl " were overtaken , arrested , and carried to prison  --  their hopes for freedom blasted  --  as they marched in chains they sang , and found ( as Emily Edmunson tells us ) a melancholy relief in singing . The singing of a man cast away on a desolate island , might be as appropriately considered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a slave . Sorrow and desolation have their songs , as well as joy and peace . Slaves sing more to make themselves happy , than to express their happiness . It is the boast of slaveholders , that their slaves enjoy more of the physical comforts of life than the peasantry of any country in the world . My experience contradicts this . The men and the women slaves on Col. Lloyd 's farm , received , as their monthly78 allowance of food , eight pounds of pickled pork , or their equivalent in fish . The pork was often tainted , and the fish was of the poorest quality  --  herrings , which would bring very little if offered for sale in any northern market . With their pork or fish , they had one bushel of Indian meal  --  unbolted  --  of which quite fifteen per cent was fit only to feed pigs . With this , one pint of salt was given ; and this was the entire monthly allowance of a full grown slave , working constantly in the open field , from morning until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living on a fraction more than a quarter of a pound of meat per day , and less than a peck of corn-meal per week . There is no kind of work that a man can do which requires a better supply of food to prevent physical exhaustion , than the field-work of a slave . So much for the slave 's allowance of food ; now for his raiment . The yearly allowance of clothing for the slaves on this plantation , consisted of two tow-linen shirts  --  such linen as the coarsest crash towels are made of ; one pair of trowsers of the same material , for summer , and a pair of trowsers and a jacket of woolen , most slazily put together , for winter ; one pair of yarn stockings , and one pair of shoes of the coarsest description . The slave 's entire apparel could not have cost more than eight dollars per year . The allowance of food and clothing for the little children , was committed to their mothers , or to the older slavewomen having the care of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had neither shoes , stockings , jackets nor trowsers given them . Their clothing consisted of two coarse tow-linen shirts  --  already described  --  per year ; and when these failed them , as they often did , they went naked until the next allowance day . Flocks of little children from five to ten years old , might be seen on Col. Lloyd 's plantation , as destitute of clothing as any little heathen on the west coast of Africa ; and this , not merely during the summer months , but during the frosty weather of March . The little girls were no better off than the boys ; all were nearly in a state of nudity. 79 As to beds to sleep on , they were known to none of the field hands ; nothing but a coarse blanket  --  not so good as those used in the north to cover horses  --  was given them , and this only to the men and women . The children stuck themselves in holes and corners , about the quarters ; often in the corner of the huge chimneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . The want of beds , however , was not considered a very great privation . Time to sleep was of far greater importance , for , when the day 's work is done , most of the slaves have their washing , mending and cooking to do ; and , having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing such things , very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in necessary preparations for the duties of the coming day . The sleeping apartments  --  if they may be called such  --  have little regard to comfort or decency . Old and young , male and female , married and single , drop down upon the common clay floor , each covering up with his or her blanket ,  --  the only protection they have from cold or exposure . The night , however , is shortened at both ends . The slaves work often as long as they can see , and are late in cooking and mending for the coming day ; and , at the first gray streak of morning , they are summoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are whipped for oversleeping than for any other fault . Neither age nor sex finds any favor . The overseer stands at the quarter door , armed with stick and cowskin , ready to whip any who may be a few minutes behind time . When the horn is blown , there is a rush for the door , and the hindermost one is sure to get a blow from the overseer . Young mothers who worked in the field , were allowed an hour , about ten o'clock in the morning , to go home to nurse their children . Sometimes they were compelled to take their children with them , and to leave them in the corner of the fences , to prevent loss of time in nursing them . The overseer generally rides about the field on horseback . A cowskin and a hickory stick are his constant companions . The80 cowskin is a kind of whip seldom seen in the northern states . It is made entirely of untanned , but dried , ox hide , and is about as hard as a piece of well-seasoned live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual length is about three feet . The part held in the hand is nearly an inch in thickness ; and , from the extreme end of the butt or handle , the cowskin tapers its whole length to a point . This makes it quite elastic and springy . A blow with it , on the hardest back , will gash the flesh , and make the blood start . Cowskins are painted red , blue and green , and are the favorite slave whip . I think this whip worse than the " cat-o'nine-tails . " It condenses the whole strength of the arm to a single point , and comes with a spring that makes the air whistle . It is a terrible instrument , and is so handy , that the overseer can always have it on his person , and ready for use . The temptation to use it is ever strong ; and an overseer can , if disposed , always have cause for using it . With him , it is literally a word and a blow , and , in most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slaves do not come to the quarters for either breakfast or dinner , but take their " ash cake " with them , and eat it in the field . This was so on the home plantation ; probably , because the distance from the quarter to the field , was sometimes two , and even three miles . The dinner of the slaves consisted of a huge piece of ash cake , and a small piece of pork , or two salt herrings . Not having ovens , nor any suitable cooking utensils , the slaves mixed their meal with a little water , to such thickness that a spoon would stand erect in it ; and , after the wood had burned away to coals and ashes , they would place the dough between oak leaves and lay it carefully in the ashes , completely covering it ; hence , the bread is called ash cake . The surface of this peculiar bread is covered with ashes , to the depth of a sixteenth part of an inch , and the ashes , certainly , do not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very palatable . The bran , or coarse part of the meal , is baked with the fine , and bright scales run through the bread. 81 This bread , with its ashes and bran , would disgust and choke a northern man , but it is quite liked by the slaves . They eat it with avidity , and are more concerned about the quantity than about the quality . They are far too scantily provided for , and are worked too steadily , to be much concerned for the quality of their food . The few minutes allowed them at dinner time , after partaking of their coarse repast , are variously spent . Some lie down on the " turning row , " and go to sleep ; others draw together , and talk ; and others are at work with needle and thread , mending their tattered garments . Sometimes you may hear a wild , hoarse laugh arise from a circle , and often a song . Soon , however , the overseer comes dashing through the field . " Tumble up ! Tumble up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , now , from twelve o'clock ( mid-day ) till dark , the human cattle are in motion , wielding their clumsy hoes ; hurried on by no hope of reward , no sense of gratitude , no love of children , no prospect of bettering their condition ; nothing , save the dread and terror of the slave-driver 's lash . So goes one day , and so comes and goes another . But , let us now leave the rough usage of the field , where vulgar coarseness and brutal cruelty spread themselves and flourish , rank as weeds in the tropics ; where a vile wretch , in the shape of a man , rides , walks , or struts about , dealing blows , and leaving gashes on broken-spirited men and helpless women , for thirty dollars per month  --  a business so horrible , hardening and disgraceful , that , rather , than engage in it , a decent man would blow his own brains out  --  and let the reader view with me the equally wicked , but less repulsive aspects of slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; where the toil of a thousand men supports a single family in easy idleness and sin . This is the great house ; it is the home of the LLOYDS ! Some idea of its splendor has already been given  --  and , it is here that we shall find that height of luxury which is the opposite of that depth of poverty and physical wretchedness that we have just now been contemplating . But , there is this difference in the two extremes ; 82 viz : that in the case of the slave , the miseries and hardships of his lot are imposed by others , and , in the master 's case , they are imposed by himself . The slave is a subject , subjected by others ; the slaveholder is a subject , but he is the author of his own subjection . There is more truth in the saying , that slavery is a greater evil to the master than to the slave , than many , who utter it , suppose . The self-executing laws of eternal justice follow close on the heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making escape from all its penalties impossible . But , let others philosophize ; it is my province here to relate and describe ; only allowing myself a word or two , occasionally , to assist the reader in the proper understanding of the facts narrated .

LLOYD  --  CURIOUS INCIDENT  --  SLAVES PREFER RICH MASTERS TO POOR ONES . The close-fisted stinginess that fed the poor slave on coarse corn-meal and tainted meat ; that clothed him in crashy tow-linen , and hurried him to toil through the field , in all weathers , with wind and rain beating through his tattered garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse her hungry infant in the fence corner ; wholly vanishes on approaching the sacred precincts of the great house , the home of the Lloyds . There the scriptural phrase finds an exact illustration ; the highly favored inmates of this mansion are literally arrayed " in purple and fine linen , " and fare sumptuously every day ! The table groans under the heavy and blood-bought luxuries gathered with painstaking care , at home and abroad . Fields , forests , rivers and seas , are made tributary here . Immense wealth , and its lavish expenditure , fill the great house with all that can please the eye , or tempt the taste . Here , appetite , not food , is the great desideratum . Fish , flesh and fowl , are here in profusion . Chickens , of84 all breeds ; ducks , of all kinds , wild and tame , the common , and the huge Muscovite ; Guinea fowls , turkeys , geese , and pea fowls , are in their several pens , fat and fatting for the destined vortex . The graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partridges , quails , pheasants and pigeons ; choice water fowl , with all their strange varieties , are caught in this huge family net . Beef , veal , mutton and venison , of the most select kinds and quality , roll bounteously to this grand consumer . The teeming riches of the Chesapeake bay , its rock , perch , drums , crocus , trout , oysters , crabs , and terrapin , are drawn hither to adorn the glittering table of the great house . The dairy , too , probably the finest on the Eastern Shore of Maryland  --  supplied by cattle of the best English stock , imported for the purpose , pours its rich donations of fragant cheese , golden butter , and delicious cream , to heighten the attraction of the gorgeous , unending round of feasting . Nor are the fruits of the earth forgotten or neglected . The fertile garden , many acres in size , constituting a separate establishment , distinct from the common farm  --  with its scientific gardener , imported from Scotland ( a Mr. McDermott ) with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the abundance or in the delicacy of its contributions to the same full board . The tender asparagus , the succulent celery , and the delicate cauliflower ; egg plants , beets , lettuce , parsnips , peas , and French beans , early and late ; radishes , cantelopes , melons of all kinds ; the fruits and flowers of all climes and of all descriptions , from the hardy apple of the north , to the lemon and orange of the south , culminated at this point . Baltimore gathered figs , raisins , almonds and juicy grapes from Spain . Wines and brandies from France ; teas of various flavor , from China ; and rich , aromatic coffee from Java , all conspired to swell the tide of high life , where pride and indolence rolled and lounged in magnificence and satiety . Behind the tall-backed and elaborately wrought chairs , stand the servants , men and maidens  --  fifteen in number  --  discriminately selected , not only with a view to their industry and faithfulness , 85 but with special regard to their personal appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are armed with fans , and are fanning reviving breezes toward the over-heated brows of the alabaster ladies ; others watch with eager eye , and with fawn-like step anticipate and supply wants before they are sufficiently formed to be announced by word or sign . These servants constituted a sort of black aristocracy on Col. Lloyd 's plantation . They resembled the field hands in nothing , except in color , and in this they held the advantage of a velvet-like glossiness , rich and beautiful . The hair , too , showed the same advantage . The delicate colored maid rustled in the scarcely worn silk of her young mistress , while the servant men were equally well attired from the over-flowing wardrobe of their young masters ; so that , in dress , as well as in form and feature , in manner and speech , in tastes and habits , the distance between these favored few , and the sorrow and hunger-smitten multitudes of the quarter and the field , was immense ; and this is seldom passed over . Let us now glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same evidences of pride and luxurious extravagance . Here are three splendid coaches , soft within and lustrous without . Here , too , are gigs , phaetons , barouches , sulkeys and sleighs . Here are saddles and harnesses  --  beautifully wrought and silver mounted  --  kept with every care . In the stable you will find , kept only for pleasure , full thirty-five horses , of the most approved blood for speed and beauty . There are two men here constantly employed in taking care of these horses . One of these men must be always in the stable , to answer every call from the great house . Over the way from the stable , is a house built expressly for the hounds  --  a pack of twenty-five or thirty  --  whose fare would have made glad the heart of a dozen slaves . Horses and hounds are not the only consumers of the slave 's toil . There was practiced , at the Lloyd 's , a hospitality which would have86 astonished and charmed any health-seeking northern divine or merchant , who might have chanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not from the field , the colonel was a model of generous hospitality . His house was , literally , a hotel , for weeks during the summer months . At these times , especially , the air was freighted with the rich fumes of baking , boiling , roasting and broiling . The odors I shared with the winds ; but the meats were under a more stringent monopoly except that , occasionally , I got a cake from Mas ' Daniel . In Mas ' Daniel I had a friend at court , from whom I learned many things which my eager curiosity was excited to know . I always knew when company was expected , and who they were , although I was an outsider , being the property , not of Col. Lloyd , but of a servant of the wealthy colonel . On these occasions , all that pride , taste and money could do , to dazzle and charm , was done . Who could say that the servants of Col. Lloyd were not well clad and cared for , after witnessing one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to glory in being the slaves of such a master ? Who , but a fanatic , could get up any sympathy for persons whose every movement was agile , easy and graceful , and who evinced a consciousness of high superiority ? And who would ever venture to suspect that Col. Lloyd was subject to the troubles of ordinary mortals ? Master and slave seem alike in their glory here ? Can it all be seeming ? Alas ! it may only be a sham at last ! This immense wealth ; this gilded splendor ; this profusion of luxury ; this exemption from toil ; this life of ease ; this sea of plenty ; aye , what of it all ? Are the pearly gates of happiness and sweet content flung open to such suitors ? far from it ! The poor slave , on his hard , pine plank , but scantily covered with his thin blanket , sleeps more soundly than the feverish voluptuary who reclines upon his feather bed and downy pillow . Food , to the indolent lounger , is poison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible spirits of evil , ready to feed the self-deluded gormandizers87 which aches , pains , fierce temper , uncontrolled passions , dyspepsia , rheumatism , lumbago and gout ; and of these the Lloyds got their full share . To the pampered love of ease , there is no resting place . What is pleasant today , is repulsive tomorrow ; what is soft now , is hard at another time ; what is sweet in the morning , is bitter in the evening . Neither to the wicked , nor to the idler , is there any solid peace : " Troubled , like the restless sea . " I had excellent opportunities of witnessing the restless discontent and the capricious irritation of the Lloyds . My fondness for horses  --  not peculiar to me more than to other boys attracted me , much of the time , to the stables . This establishment was especially under the care of " old " and " young " Barney  --  father and son . Old Barney was a fine looking old man , of a brownish complexion , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave . He was , evidently , much devoted to his profession , and held his office an honorable one . He was a farrier as well as an ostler ; he could bleed , remove lampers from the mouths of the horses , and was well instructed in horse medicines . No one on the farm knew , so well as Old Barney , what to do with a sick horse . But his gifts and acquirements were of little advantage to him . His office was by no means an enviable one . He often got presents , but he got stripes as well ; for in nothing was Col. Lloyd more unreasonable and exacting , than in respect to the management of his pleasure horses . Any supposed inattention to these animals were sure to be visited with degrading punishment . His horses and dogs fared better than his men . Their beds must be softer and cleaner than those of his human cattle . No excuse could shield Old Barney , if the colonel only suspected something wrong about his horses ; and , consequently , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to the many unreasonable and fretful scoldings , poured out at the stable , by Col. Lloyd , his sons and sons-in-law . Of the latter , he had three  --  Messrs . Nicholson , Winder and Lownes . These all88 lived at the great house a portion of the year , and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased , which was by no means unfrequently . A horse was seldom brought out of the stable to which no objection could be raised . " There was dust in his hair ; " " there was a twist in his reins ; " " his mane did not lie straight ; " " he had not been properly grained ; " " his head did not look well ; " " his fore-top was not combed out ; " " his fetlocks had not been properly trimmed ; " something was always wrong . Listening to complaints , however groundless , Barney must stand , hat in hand , lips sealed , never answering a word . He must make no reply , no explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his power is absolute and irresponsible . In a free state , a master , thus complaining without cause , of his ostler , might be told  --  " Sir , I am sorry I can not please you , but , since I have done the best I can , your remedy is to dismiss me . " Here , however , the ostler must stand , listen and tremble . One of the most heart-saddening and humiliating scenes I ever witnessed , was the whipping of Old Barney , by Col. Lloyd himself . Here were two men , both advanced in years ; there were the silvery locks of Col. L. , and there was the bald and toil-worn brow of Old Barney ; master and slave ; superior and inferior here , but equals at the bar of God ; and , in the common course of events , they must both soon meet in another world , in a world where all distinctions , except those based on obedience and disobedience , are blotted out forever . " Uncover your head ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your jacket , you old rascal ! " and off came Barney 's jacket . " Down on your knees ! " down knelt the old man , his shoulders bare , his bald head glistening in the sun , and his aged knees on the cold , damp ground . In his humble and debasing attitude , the master  --  that master to whom he had given the best years and the best strength of his life  --  came forward , and laid on thirty lashes , with his horse whip . The old man bore it patiently , to the last , answering each blow with a slight shrug of the shoulders , and a groan . I can not think that89 Col. Lloyd succeeded in marring the flesh of Old Barney very seriously , for the whip was a light , riding whip ; but the spectacle of an aged man  --  a husband and a father  --  humbly kneeling before a worm of the dust , surprised and shocked me at the time ; and since I have grown old enough to think on the wickedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me than this , to which I was a witness . It reveals slavery in its true color , and in its maturity of repulsive hatefulness . I owe it to truth , however , to say , that this was the first and the last time I ever saw Old Barney , or any other slave , compelled to kneel to receive a whipping . I saw , at the stable , another incident , which I will relate , as it is illustrative of a phase of slavery to which I have already referred in another connection . Besides two other coachmen , Col. Lloyd owned one named William , who , strangely enough , was often called by his surname , Wilks , by white and colored people on the home plantation . Wilks was a very fine looking man . He was about as white as anybody on the plantation ; and in manliness of form , and comeliness of features , he bore a very striking resemblance to Mr. Murray Lloyd . It was whispered , and pretty generally admitted as a fact , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly favored slave-woman , who was still on the plantation . There were many reasons for believing this whisper , not only in William 's appearance , but in the undeniable freedom which he enjoyed over all others , and his apparent consciousness of being something more than a slave to his master . It was notorious , too , that William had a deadly enemy in Murray Lloyd , whom he so much resembled , and that the latter greatly worried his father with importunities to sell William . Indeed , he gave his father no rest until he did sell him , to Austin Woldfolk , the great slave-trader at that time . Before selling him , however , Mr. L. tried what giving William a whipping would do , toward making things smooth ; but this was a failure . It was a compromise , and defeated itself ; for , 90 immediately after the infliction , the heart-sickened colonel atoned to William for the abuse , by giving him a gold watch and chain . Another fact , somewhat curious , is , that though sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cast into prison , with a view to being driven to the south , William , by some means  --  always a mystery to me  --  outbid all his purchasers , paid for himself , and now resides in Baltimore , a FREEMAN . Is there not room to suspect , that , as the gold watch was presented to atone for the whipping , a purse of gold was given him by the same hand , with which to effect his purchase , as an atonement for the indignity involved in selling his own flesh and blood . All the circumstances of William , on the great house farm , show him to have occupied a different position from the other slaves , and , certainly , there is nothing in the supposed hostility of slaveholders to amalgamation , to forbid the supposition that William Wilks was the son of Edward Lloyd . Practical amalgamation is common in every neighborhood where I have been in slavery . Col. Lloyd was not in the way of knowing much of the real opinions and feelings of his slaves respecting him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit of such knowledge . His slaves were so numerous , that he did not know them when he saw them . Nor , indeed , did all his slaves know him . In this respect , he was inconveniently rich . It is reported of him , that , while riding along the road one day , he met a colored man , and addressed him in the usual way of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south : " Well , boy , who do you belong to ? " " To Col. Lloyd , " replied the slave . " Well , does the colonel treat you well ? " " No , sir , " was the ready reply . " What ? does he work you too hard ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , do n't he give enough to eat ? " " Yes , sir , he gives me enough , such as it is . " The colonel , after ascertaining where the slave belonged , rode on ; the slave also went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been conversing with his master . He thought , said and heard nothing more of the matter , until two or three weeks afterwards. 91 The poor man was then informed by his overseer , that , for having found fault with his master , he was now to be sold to a Georgia trader . He was immediately chained and handcuffed ; and thus , without a moment 's warning he was snatched away , and forever sundered from his family and friends , by a hand more unrelenting than that of death . This is the penalty of telling the simple truth , in answer to a series of plain questions . It is partly in consequence of such facts , that slaves , when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters , almost invariably say they are contented , and that their masters are kind . Slaveholders have been known to send spies among their slaves , to ascertain , if possible , their views and feelings in regard to their condition . The frequency of this had the effect to establish among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wise head . They suppress the truth rather than take the consequence of telling it , and , in so doing , they prove themselves a part of the human family . If they have anything to say of their master , it is , generally , something in his favor , especially when speaking to strangers . I was frequently asked , while a slave , if I had a kind master , and I do not remember ever to have given a negative reply . Nor did I , when pursuing this course , consider myself as uttering what was utterly false ; for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up by slaveholders around us . However , slaves are like other people , and imbibe similar prejudices . They are apt to think their condition better than that of others . Many , under the influence of this prejudice , think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves ; and this , too , in some cases , when the very reverse is true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative kindness of their masters , contending for the superior goodness of his own over that of others . At the very same time , they mutually execrate their masters , when viewed separately . It was so on our plantation . When Col. Lloyd 's slaves met those of Jacob Jepson , they92 seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters ; Col. Lloyd 's slaves contending that he was the richest , and Mr. Jepson 's slaves that he was the smartest , man of the two . Col. Lloyd 's slaves would boost his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson ; Mr. Jepson 's slaves would boast his ability to whip Col. Lloyd . These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties ; those that beat were supposed to have gained the point at issue . They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves . To be a SLAVE , was thought to be bad enough ; but to be a poor man 's slave , was deemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horrors AUSTIN GORE  --  A SKETCH OF HIS CHARACTER  --  OVERSEERS AS A CLASS  --  THEIR PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS  --  THE MARKED INDIVIDUALITY OF AUSTIN GORE  --  HIS SENSE OF DUTY  --  HOW HE WHIPPED  --  MURDER OF POOR DENBY  --  HOW IT OCCURRED  --  SENSATION  --  HOW GORE MADE PEACE WITH COL . LLOYD  --  THE MURDER UNPUNISHED  --  ANOTHER DREADFUL MURDER NARRATED  --  NO LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF SLAVES CAN BE ENFORCED IN THE SOUTHERN STATES . As I have already intimated elsewhere , the slaves on Col. Lloyd 's plantation , whose hard lot , under Mr. Sevier , the reader has already noticed and deplored , were not permitted to enjoy the comparatively moderate rule of Mr. Hopkins . The latter was succeeded by a very different man . The name of the new overseer was Austin Gore . Upon this individual I would fix particular attention ; for under his rule there was more suffering from violence and bloodshed than had  --  according to the older slaves ever been experienced before on this plantation . I confess , I hardly know how to bring this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , an overseer , and possessed , to a large extent , the peculiar characteristics of his class ; yet , to call him merely an overseer , would not give the reader a fair notion of the man . I speak of overseers as a class . They are such . They are as distinct from the slaveholding gentry of the south , as are the fishwomen of Paris , and the coal-heavers of London , distinct from other members of society . They constitute a separate fraternity at the south , not less marked than is the fraternity of Park Lane bullies in New York . They have been arranged and classified94 by that great law of attraction , which determines the spheres and affinities of men ; which ordains , that men , whose malign and brutal propensities predominate over their moral and intellectual endowments , shall , naturally , fall into those employments which promise the largest gratification to those predominating instincts or propensities . The office of overseer takes this raw material of vulgarity and brutality , and stamps it as a distinct class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all other classes , there are characters of marked individuality , even while they bear a general resemblance to the mass . Mr. Gore was one of those , to whom a general characterization would do no manner of justice . He was an overseer ; but he was something more . With the malign and tyrannical qualities of an overseer , he combined something of the lawful master . He had the artfulness and the mean ambition of his class ; but he was wholly free from the disgusting swagger and noisy bravado of his fraternity . There was an easy air of independence about him ; a calm self-possession , and a sternness of glance , which might well daunt hearts less timid than those of poor slaves , accustomed from childhood and through life to cower before a driver 's lash . The home plantation of Col. Lloyd afforded an ample field for the exercise of the qualifications for overseership , which he possessed in such an eminent degree . Mr. Gore was one of those overseers , who could torture the slightest word or look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent , but to punish , promptly and severely . He never allowed himself to be answered back , by a slave . In this , he was as lordly and as imperious as Col. Edward Lloyd , himself ; acting always up to the maxim , practically maintained by slaveholders , that it is better that a dozen slaves suffer under the lash , without fault , than that the master or the overseer should seem to have been wrong in the presence of the slave . Everything must be absolute here . Guilty or not guilty , it is enough to be accused , to be sure of a flogging . The very presence of this man Gore was95 painful , and I shunned him as I would have shunned a rattlesnake . His piercing , black eyes , and sharp , shrill voice , ever awakened sensations of terror among the slaves . For so young a man ( I describe him as he was , twenty-five or thirty years ago ) Mr. Gore was singularly reserved and grave in the presence of slaves . He indulged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own counsels . Other overseers , how brutal soever they might be , were , at times , inclined to gain favor with the slaves , by indulging a little pleasantry ; but Gore was never known to be guilty of any such weakness . He was always the cold , distant , unapproachable overseer of Col. Edward Lloyd 's plantation , and needed no higher pleasure than was involved in a faithful discharge of the duties of his office . When he whipped , he seemed to do so from a sense of duty , and feared no consequences . What Hopkins did reluctantly , Gore did with alacrity . There was a stern will , an iron-like reality , about this Gore , which would have easily made him the chief of a band of pirates , had his environments been favorable to such a course of life . All the coolness , savage barbarity and freedom from moral restraint , which are necessary in the character of a pirate-chief , centered , I think , in this man Gore . Among many other deeds of shocking cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , was the murder of a young colored man , named Denby . He was sometimes called Bill Denby , or Demby ; ( I write from sound , and the sounds on Lloyd 's plantation are not very certain . ) I knew him well . He was a powerful young man , full of animal spirits , and , so far as I know , he was among the most valuable of Col. Lloyd 's slaves . In something  --  I know not what  --  he offended this Mr. Austin Gore , and , in accordance with the custom of the latter , he under took to flog him . He gave Denby but few stripes ; the latter broke away from him and plunged into the creek , and , standing there to the depth of his neck in water , he refused to come out at the order of the overseer ; whereupon , for this refusal , Gore shot him dead ! It is said that Gore gave Denby three calls , telling him that96 if he did not obey the last call , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Denby stood his ground firmly ; and this raised the question , in the minds of the by-standing slaves  --  " Will he dare to shoot ? " Mr. Gore , without further parley , and without making any further effort to induce Denby to come out of the water , raised his gun deliberately to his face , took deadly aim at his standing victim , and , in an instant , poor Denby was numbered with the dead . His mangled body sank out of sight , and only his warm , red blood marked the place where he had stood . This devilish outrage , this fiendish murder , produced , as it was well calculated to do , a tremendous sensation . A thrill of horror flashed through every soul on the plantation , if I may except the guilty wretch who had committed the hell-black deed . While the slaves generally were panic-struck , and howling with alarm , the murderer himself was calm and collected , and appeared as though nothing unusual had happened . The atrocity roused my old master , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing proved to be less than a nine days ' wonder . Both Col. Lloyd and my old master arraigned Gore for his cruelty in the matter , but this amounted to nothing . His reply , or explanation  --  as I remember to have heard it at the time was , that the extraordinary expedient was demanded by necessity ; that Denby had become unmanageable ; that he had set a dangerous example to the other slaves ; and that , without some such prompt measure as that to which he had resorted , were adopted , there would be an end to all rule and order on the plantation . That very convenient covert for all manner of cruelty and outrage that cowardly alarm-cry , that the slaves would " take the place , " was pleaded , in extenuation of this revolting crime , just as it had been cited in defense of a thousand similar ones . He argued , that if one slave refused to be corrected , and was allowed to escape with his life , when he had been told that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other slaves would soon copy his example ; the result of which would be , the freedom of the slaves , and the enslavement of the97 whites . I have every reason to believe that Mr. Gore 's defense , or explanation , was deemed satisfactory  --  at least to Col. Lloyd . He was continued in his office on the plantation . His fame as an overseer went abroad , and his horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation . The murder was committed in the presence of slaves , and they , of course , could neither institute a suit , nor testify against the murderer . His bare word would go further in a court of law , than the united testimony of ten thousand black witnesses . All that Mr. Gore had to do , was to make his peace with Col. Lloyd . This done , and the guilty perpetrator of one of the most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice , and uncensured by the community in which he lives . Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael 's , Talbot county , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably yet resides there ; and I have no reason to doubt that he is now as highly esteemed , and as greatly respected , as though his guilty soul had never been stained with innocent blood . I am well aware that what I have now written will by some be branded as false and malicious . It will be denied , not only that such a thing ever did transpire , as I have now narrated , but that such a thing could happen in Maryland . I can only say  --  believe it or not  --  that I have said nothing but the literal truth , gainsay it who may . I speak advisedly when I say this ,  --  that killing a slave , or any colored person , in Talbot county , Maryland , is not treated as a crime , either by the courts or the community . Mr. Thomas Lanman , ship carpenter , of St. Michael 's , killed two slaves , one of whom he butchered with a hatchet , by knocking his brains out . He used to boast of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him do so , laughingly , saying , among other things , that he was the only benefactor of his country in the company , and that when " others would do as much as he had done , we should be relieved of the d  --  d niggers . " As an evidence of the reckless disregard of human life where the life is that of a slave I may state the notorious fact , that the98 wife of Mr. Giles Hicks , who lived but a short distance from Col. Lloyd 's , with her own hands murdered my wife 's cousin , a young girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age  --  mutilating her person in a most shocking manner . The atrocious woman , in the paroxysm of her wrath , not content with murdering her victim , literally mangled her face , and broke her breast bone . Wild , however , and infuriated as she was , she took the precaution to cause the slave-girl to be buried ; but the facts of the case coming abroad , very speedily led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coroner 's jury was assembled , who decided that the girl had come to her death by severe beating . It was ascertained that the offense for which this girl was thus hurried out of the world , was this : she had been set that night , and several preceding nights , to mind Mrs. Hicks 's baby , and having fallen into a sound sleep , the baby cried , waking Mrs. Hicks , but not the slave-girl . Mrs. Hicks , becoming infuriated at the girl 's tardiness , after calling several times , jumped from her bed and seized a piece of fire-wood from the fireplace ; and then , as she lay fast asleep , she deliberately pounded in her skull and breast-bone , and thus ended her life . I will not say that this most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community . It did produce a sensation ; but , incredible to tell , the moral sense of the community was blunted too entirely by the ordinary nature of slavery horrors , to bring the murderess to punishment . A warrant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other , that warrant was never served . Thus did Mrs. Hicks not only escape condign punishment , but even the pain and mortification of being arraigned before a court of justice . Whilst I am detailing the bloody deeds that took place during my stay on Col. Lloyd 's plantation , I will briefly narrate another dark transaction , which occurred about the same time as the murder of Denby by Mr. Gore . On the side of the river Wye , opposite from Col. Lloyd 's , there lived a Mr. Beal Bondley , a wealthy slaveholder . In the direction99 of his land , and near the shore , there was an excellent oyster fishing ground , and to this , some of the slaves of Col. Lloyd occasionally resorted in their little canoes , at night , with a view to make up the deficiency of their scanty allowance of food , by the oysters that they could easily get there . This , Mr. Bondley took it into his head to regard as a trespass , and while an old man belonging to Col. Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oysters that lined the bottom of that creek , to satisfy his hunger , the villainous Mr. Bondley , lying in ambush , without the slightest ceremony , discharged the contents of his musket into the back and shoulders of the poor old man . As good fortune would have it , the shot did not prove mortal , and Mr. Bondley came over , the next day , to see Col. Lloyd  --  whether to pay him for his property , or to justify himself for what he had done , I know not ; but this I can say , the cruel and dastardly transaction was speedily hushed up ; there was very little said about it at all , and nothing was publicly done which looked like the application of the principle of justice to the man whom chance , only , saved from being an actual murderer . One of the commonest sayings to which my ears early became accustomed , on Col. Lloyd 's plantation and elsewhere in Maryland , was , that it was " worth but half a cent to kill a nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the facts of my experience go far to justify the practical truth of this strange proverb . Laws for the protection of the lives of the slaves , are , as they must needs be , utterly incapable of being enforced , where the very parties who are nominally protected , are not permitted to give evidence , in courts of law , against the only class of persons from whom abuse , outrage and murder might be reasonably apprehended . While I heard of numerous murders committed by slaveholders on the Eastern Shores of Maryland , I never knew a solitary instance in which a slaveholder was either hung or imprisoned for having murdered a slave . The usual pretext for killing a slave is , that the slave has offered resistance . Should a slave , when assaulted , but raise his hand in self defense , the white assaulting100 party is fully justified by southern , or Maryland , public opinion , in shooting the slave down . Sometimes this is done , simply because it is alleged that the slave has been saucy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early childhood , and will relieve the kind reader of these heart-sickening details .

SOPHIA AULD  --  LITTLE TOMMY  --  MY NEW POSITION  --  MY NEW DUTIES  --  A TURNING POINT IN MY HISTORY . I have nothing cruel or shocking to relate of my own personal experience , while I remained on Col. Lloyd 's plantation , at the home of my old master . An occasional cuff from Aunt Katy , and a regular whipping from old master , such as any heedless and mischievous boy might get from his father , is all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough to work in the field , and , there being little else than field work to perform , I had much leisure . The most I had to do , was , to drive up the cows in the evening , to keep the front yard clean , and to perform small errands for my young mistress , Lucretia Auld . I have reasons for thinking this lady was very kindly disposed toward me , and , although I was not often the object of her attention , I constantly regarded her as my friend , and was always glad when it was my privilege to do her a service . In a family where there was so much that was harsh , cold and indifferent , the slightest word or look of kindness passed , with me , for its full value . Miss Lucretia  --  as102 we all continued to call her long after her marriage  --  had bestowed upon me such words and looks as taught me that she pitied me , if she did not love me . In addition to words and looks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a thing not set down in the bill of fare , and which must have been an extra ration , planned aside from either Aunt Katy or old master , solely out of the tender regard and friendship she had for me . Then , too , I one day got into the wars with Uncle Able 's son , " Ike , " and had got sadly worsted ; in fact , the little rascal had struck me directly in the forehead with a sharp piece of cinder , fused with iron , from the old blacksmith 's forge , which made a cross in my forehead very plainly to be seen now . The gash bled very freely , and I roared very loudly and betook myself home . The coldhearted Aunt Katy paid no attention either to my wound or my roaring , except to tell me it served me right ; I had no business with Ike ; it was good for me ; I would now keep away " from dem Lloyd niggers . " Miss Lucretia , in this state of the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that manifested by Aunt Katy , she called me into the parlor ( an extra privilege of itself ) and , without using toward me any of the hard-hearted and reproachful epithets of my kitchen tormentor , she quietly acted the good Samaritan . With her own soft hand she washed the blood from my head and face , fetched her own balsam bottle , and with the balsam wetted a nice piece of white linen , and bound up my head . The balsam was not more healing to the wound in my head , than her kindness was healing to the wounds in my spirit , made by the unfeeling words of Aunt Katy . After this , Miss Lucretia was my friend . I felt her to be such ; and I have no doubt that the simple act of binding up my head , did much to awaken in her mind an interest in my welfare . It is quite true , that this interest was never very marked , and it seldom showed itself in anything more than in giving me a piece of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor on a slave plantation , and I was the only one of the children to whom such attention was paid. 103 When very hungry , I would go into the back yard and play under Miss Lucretia 's window . When pretty severely pinched by hunger , I had a habit of singing , which the good lady very soon came to understand as a petition for a piece of bread . When I sung under Miss Lucretia 's window , I was very apt to get well paid for my music . The reader will see that I now had two friends , both at important points  --  Mas ' Daniel at the great house , and Miss Lucretia at home . From Mas ' Daniel I got protection from the bigger boys ; and from Miss Lucretia I got bread , by singing when I was hungry , and sympathy when I was abused by that termagant , who had the reins of government in the kitchen . For such friendship I felt deeply grateful , and bitter as are my recollections of slavery , I love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment , which found way to my soul through the iron grating of my house of bondage . Such beams seem all the brighter from the general darkness into which they penetrate , and the impression they make is vividly distinct and beautiful . As I have before intimated , I was seldom whipped  --  and never severely  --  by my old master . I suffered little from the treatment I received , except from hunger and cold . These were my two great physical troubles . I could neither get a sufficiency of food nor of clothing ; but I suffered less from hunger than from cold . In hottest summer and coldest winter , I was kept almost in a state of nudity ; no shoes , no stockings , no jacket , no trowsers ; nothing but coarse sackcloth or tow-linen , made into a sort of shirt , reaching down to my knees . This I wore night and day , changing it once a week . In the day time I could protect myself pretty well , by keeping on the sunny side of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen chimney . The great difficulty was , to keep warm during the night . I had no bed . The pigs in the pen had leaves , and the horses in the stable had straw , but the children had no beds . They lodged anywhere in the ample kitchen . I slept , generally , in a little closet , without even a blanket to cover me . In very cold weather . I sometimes got down the bag in which corn104 meal was usually carried to the mill , and crawled into that . Sleeping there , with my head in and feet out , I was partly protected , though not comfortable . My feet have been so cracked with the frost , that the pen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes . The manner of taking our meals at old master 's , indicated but little refinement . Our corn-meal mush , when sufficiently cooled , was placed in a large wooden tray , or trough , like those used in making maple sugar here in the north . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , or out of doors on the ground ; and the children were called , like so many pigs ; and like so many pigs they would come , and literally devour the mush  --  some with oyster shells , some with pieces of shingles , and none with spoons . He that eat fastest got most , and he that was strongest got the best place ; and few left the trough really satisfied . I was the most unlucky of any , for Aunt Katy had no good feeling for me ; and if I pushed any of the other children , or if they told her anything unfavorable of me , she always believed the worst , and was sure to whip me . As I grew older and more thoughtful , I was more and more filled with a sense of my wretchedness . The cruelty of Aunt Katy , the hunger and cold I suffered , and the terrible reports of wrong and outrage which came to my ear , together with what I almost daily witnessed , led me , when yet but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been born . I used to contrast my condition with the black-birds , in whose wild and sweet songs I fancied them so happy ! Their apparent joy only deepened the shades of my sorrow . There are thoughtful days in the lives of children  --  at least there were in mine when they grapple with all the great , primary subjects of knowledge , and reach , in a moment , conclusions which no subsequent experience can shake . I was just as well aware of the unjust , unnatural and murderous character of slavery , when nine years old , as I am now . Without any appeal to books , to laws , or to authorities of any kind , it was enough to accept God as a father , to regard slavery as a crime. 105 I was not ten years old when I left Col. Lloyd 's plantation for Balitmore(sic) . I left that plantation with inexpressible joy . I never shall forget the ecstacy with which I received the intelligence from my friend , Miss Lucretia , that my old master had determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auld , a brother to Mr. Thomas Auld , my old master 's son-in-law . I received this information about three days before my departure . They were three of the happiest days of my childhood . I spent the largest part of these three days in the creek , washing off the plantation scurf , and preparing for my new home . Mrs. Lucretia took a lively interest in getting me ready . She told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees , before I could go to Baltimore , for the people there were very cleanly , and would laugh at me if I looked dirty ; and , besides , she was intending to give me a pair of trowsers , which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off . This was a warning to which I was bound to take heed ; for the thought of owning a pair of trowsers , was great , indeed . It was almost a sufficient motive , not only to induce me to scrub off the mange ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . So I went at it in good earnest , working for the first time in the hope of reward . I was greatly excited , and could hardly consent to sleep , lest I should be left . The ties that , ordinarily , bind children to their homes , were all severed , or they never had any existence in my case , at least so far as the home plantation of Col. L. was concerned . I therefore found no severe trail at the moment of my departure , such as I had experienced when separated from my home in Tuckahoe . My home at my old master 's was charmless to me ; it was not home , but a prison to me ; on parting from it , I could not feel that I was leaving anything which I could have enjoyed by staying . My mother was now long dead ; my grandmother was far away , so that I seldom saw her ; Aunt Katy was my unrelenting tormentor ; and my two sisters and brothers , owing to our early separation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comparatively , strangers106 to me . The fact of our relationship was almost blotted out . I looked for home elsewhere , and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one I was leaving . If , however , I found in my new home to which I was going with such blissful anticipations  --  hardship , whipping and nakedness , I had the questionable consolation that I should not have escaped any one of these evils by remaining under the management of Aunt Katy . Then , too , I thought , since I had endured much in this line on Lloyd 's plantation , I could endure as much elsewhere , and especially at Baltimore ; for I had something of the feeling about that city which is expressed in the saying , that being " hanged in England , is better than dying a natural death in Ireland . " I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore . My cousin Tom  --  a boy two or three years older than I  --  had been there , and though not fluent ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with that desire , by his eloquent description of the place . Tom was , sometimes , Capt . Auld 's cabin boy ; and when he came from Baltimore , he was always a sort of hero amongst us , at least till his Baltimore trip was forgotten . I could never tell him of anything , or point out anything that struck me as beautiful or powerful , but that he had seen something in Baltimore far surpassing it . Even the great house itself , with all its pictures within , and pillars without , he had the hardihood to say " was nothing to Baltimore . " He bought a trumpet ( worth six pence ) and brought it home ; told what he had seen in the windows of stores ; that he had heard shooting crackers , and seen soldiers ; that he had seen a steamboat ; that there were ships in Baltimore that could carry four such sloops as the " Sally Lloyd . " He said a great deal about the market-house ; he spoke of the bells ringing ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , indeed , which heightened my hopes of happiness in my new home . We sailed out of Miles river for Baltimore early on a Saturday morning . I remember only the day of the week ; for , at that time , 107 I had no knowledge of the days of the month , nor , indeed , of the months of the year . On setting sail , I walked aft , and gave to Col. Lloyd 's plantation what I hoped would be the last look I should ever give to it , or to any place like it . My strong aversion to the great farm , was not owing to my own personal suffering , but the daily suffering of others , and to the certainty that I must , sooner or later , be placed under the barbarous rule of an overseer , such as the accomplished Gore , or the brutal and drunken Plummer . After taking this last view , I quitted the quarter deck , made my way to the bow of the sloop , and spent the remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the distance , rather than what was near by or behind . The vessels , sweeping along the bay , were very interesting objects . The broad bay opened like a shoreless ocean on my boyish vision , filling me with wonder and admiration . Late in the afternoon , we reached Annapolis , the capital of the state , stopping there not long enough to admit of my going ashore . It was the first large town I had ever seen ; and though it was inferior to many a factory village in New England , my feelings , on seeing it , were excited to a pitch very little below that reached by travelers at the first view of Rome . The dome of the state house was especially imposing , and surpassed in grandeur the appearance of the great house . The great world was opening upon me very rapidly , and I was eagerly acquainting myself with its multifarious lessons . We arrived in Baltimore on Sunday morning , and landed at Smith 's wharf , not far from Bowly 's wharf . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Baltimore market ; and , after assisting in driving them to the slaughter house of Mr. Curtis , on Loudon Slater 's Hill , I was speedily conducted by Rich  --  one of the hands belonging to the sloop  --  to my new home in Alliciana street , near Gardiner 's ship-yard , on Fell 's Point . Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Auld , my new mistress and master , were both at home , and met me at the door with their rosy cheeked little son , Thomas , 108 to take care of whom was to constitute my future occupation . In fact , it was to " little Tommy , " rather than to his parents , that old master made a present of me ; and though there was no legal form or arrangement entered into , I have no doubt that Mr. and Mrs. Auld felt that , in due time , I should be the legal property of their bright-eyed and beloved boy , Tommy . I was struck with the appearance , especially , of my new mistress . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her countenance , as well as the tenderness with which she seemed to regard me , while asking me sundry little questions , greatly delighted me , and lit up , to my fancy , the pathway of my future . Miss Lucretia was kind ; but my new mistress , " Miss Sophy , " surpassed her in kindness of manner . Little Thomas was affectionately told by his mother , that " there was his Freddy , " and that " Freddy would take care of him ; " and I was told to " be kind to little Tommy "  --  an injunction I scarcely needed , for I had already fallen in love with the dear boy ; and with these little ceremonies I was initiated into my new home , and entered upon my peculiar duties , with not a cloud above the horizon . I may say here , that I regard my removal from Col. Lloyd 's plantation as one of the most interesting and fortunate events of my life . Viewing it in the light of human likelihoods , it is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus removed before the rigors of slavery had fastened upon me ; before my young spirit had been crushed under the iron control of the slave-driver , instead of being , today , a FREEMAN , I might have been wearing the galling chains of slavery . I have sometimes felt , however , that there was something more intelligent than chance , and something more certain than luck , to be seen in the circumstance . If I have made any progress in knowledge ; if I have cherished any honorable aspirations , or have , in any manner , worthily discharged the duties of a member of an oppressed people ; this little circumstance must be allowed its due weight109 in giving my life that direction . I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that Divinity that shapes our ends , Rough hew them as we will . I was not the only boy on the plantation that might have been sent to live in Baltimore . There was a wide margin from which to select . There were boys younger , boys older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old master some at his own house , and some at his farm  --  but the high privilege fell to my lot . I may be deemed superstitious and egotistical , in regarding this event as a special interposition of Divine Providence in my favor ; but the thought is a part of my history , and I should be false to the earliest and most cherished sentiments of my soul , if I suppressed , or hesitated to avow that opinion , although it may be characterized as irrational by the wise , and ridiculous by the scoffer . From my earliest recollections of serious matters , I date the entertainment of something like an ineffaceable conviction , that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace ; and this conviction , like a word of living faith , strengthened me through the darkest trials of my lot . This good spirit was from God ; and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise . CHAPTER X.

Once in Baltimore , with hard brick pavements under my feet , which almost raised blisters , by their very heat , for it was in the height of summer ; walled in on all sides by towering brick buildings ; with troops of hostile boys ready to pounce upon me at every street corner ; with new and strange objects glaring upon me at every step , and with startling sounds reaching my ears from all directions , I for a time thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable place of residence than my home on Alliciana street , in Baltimore . My country eyes and ears were confused and bewildered here ; but the boys were my chief trouble .

I had to undergo a sort of moral acclimation , and when that was over , I did much better . My new mistress happily proved to be all she seemed to be , when , with her husband , she met me at111 the door , with a most beaming , benignant countenance . She was , naturally , of an excellent disposition , kind , gentle and cheerful . The supercilious contempt for the rights and feelings of the slave , and the petulance and bad humor which generally characterize slaveholding ladies , were all quite absent from kind " Miss " Sophia 's manner and bearing toward me . She had , in truth , never been a slaveholder , but had  --  a thing quite unusual in the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . To this fact the dear lady , no doubt , owed the excellent preservation of her natural goodness of heart , for slavery can change a saint into a sinner , and an angel into a demon . I hardly knew how to behave toward " Miss Sopha , " as I used to call Mrs. Hugh Auld . I had been treated as a pig on the plantation ; I was treated as a child now . I could not even approach her as I had formerly approached Mrs. Thomas Auld . How could I hang down my head , and speak with bated breath , when there was no pride to scorn me , no coldness to repel me , and no hatred to inspire me with fear ? I therefore soon learned to regard her as something more akin to a mother , than a slaveholding mistress . The crouching servility of a slave , usually so acceptable a quality to the haughty slaveholder , was not understood nor desired by this gentle woman . So far from deeming it impudent in a slave to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , she seemed ever to say , " look up , child ; do n't be afraid ; see , I am full of kindness and good will toward you . " The hands belonging to Col. Lloyd 's sloop , esteemed it a great privilege to be the bearers of parcels or messages to my new mistress ; for whenever they came , they were sure of a most kind and pleasant reception . If little Thomas was her son , and her most dearly beloved child , she , for a time , at least , made me something like his half-brother in her affections . If dear Tommy was exalted to a place on his mother 's knee , " Feddy " was honored by a place at his mother 's side . Nor did he lack the caressing strokes of her gentle hand , to convince him that , though motherless , he was not friendless . Mrs. Auld112 was not only a kind-hearted woman , but she was remarkably pious ; frequent in her attendance of public worship , much given to reading the bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hugh Auld was altogether a different character . He cared very little about religion , knew more of the world , and was more of the world , than his wife . He set out , doubtless to be  --  as the world goes  --  a respectable man , and to get on by becoming a successful ship builder , in that city of ship building . This was his ambition , and it fully occupied him . I was , of course , of very little consequence to him , compared with what I was to good Mrs. Auld ; and , when he smiled upon me , as he sometimes did , the smile was borrowed from his lovely wife , and , like all borrowed light , was transient , and vanished with the source whence it was derived . While I must characterize Master Hugh as being a very sour man , and of forbidding appearance , it is due to him to acknowledge , that he was never very cruel to me , according to the notion of cruelty in Maryland . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left me almost exclusively to the management of his wife . She was my law-giver . In hands so tender as hers , and in the absence of the cruelties of the plantation , I became , both physically and mentally , much more sensitive to good and ill treatment ; and , perhaps , suffered more from a frown from my mistress , than I formerly did from a cuff at the hands of Aunt Katy . Instead of the cold , damp floor of my old master 's kitchen , I found myself on carpets ; for the corn bag in winter , I now had a good straw bed , well furnished with covers ; for the coarse corn-meal in the morning , I now had good bread , and mush occasionally ; for my poor tow-lien shirt , reaching to my knees , I had good , clean clothes . I was really well off . My employment was to run errands , and to take care of Tommy ; to prevent his getting in the way of carriages , and to keep him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mother , got on swimmingly together , for a time . I say for a time , because the fatal poison of irresponsible power , and the natural influence113 of slavery customs , were not long in making a suitable impression on the gentle and loving disposition of my excellent mistress . At first , Mrs. Auld evidently regarded me simply as a child , like any other child ; she had not come to regard me as property . This latter thought was a thing of conventional growth . The first was natural and spontaneous . A noble nature , like hers , could not , instantly , be wholly perverted ; and it took several years to change the natural sweetness of her temper into fretful bitterness . In her worst estate , however , there were , during the first seven years I lived with her , occasional returns of her former kindly disposition . The frequent hearing of my mistress reading the bible for she often read aloud when her husband was absent soon awakened my curiosity in respect to this mystery of reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear of my kind mistress before my eyes , ( she had then given me no reason to fear , ) I frankly asked her to teach me to read ; and , without hesitation , the dear woman began the task , and very soon , by her assistance , I was master of the alphabet , and could spell words of three or four letters . My mistress seemed almost as proud of my progress , as if I had been her own child ; and , supposing that her husband would be as well pleased , she made no secret of what she was doing for me . Indeed , she exultingly told him of the aptness of her pupil , of her intention to persevere in teaching me , and of the duty which she felt it to teach me , at least to read the bible . Here arose the first cloud over my Baltimore prospects , the precursor of drenching rains and chilling blasts . Master Hugh was amazed at the simplicity of his spouse , and , probably for the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the peculiar rules necessary to be observed by masters and mistresses , in the management of their human chattels . Mr. Auld promptly forbade continuance of her instruction ; telling her , in the first place , that the thing itself was unlawful ; that it was also unsafe , and could only lead to mischief . To use114 his own words , further , he said , " if you give a nigger an inch , he will take an ell ; " " he should know nothing but the will of his master , and learn to obey it . " " if you teach that nigger  --  speaking of myself  --  how to read the bible , there will be no keeping him ; " " it would forever unfit him for the duties of a slave ; " and " as to himself , learning would do him no good , but probably , a great deal of harm  --  making him disconsolate and unhappy . " " If you learn him now to read , he 'll want to know how to write ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Such was the tenor of Master Hugh 's oracular exposition of the true philosophy of training a human chattel ; and it must be confessed that he very clearly comprehended the nature and the requirements of the relation of master and slave . His discourse was the first decidedly anti-slavery lecture to which it had been my lot to listen . Mrs. Auld evidently felt the force of his remarks ; and , like an obedient wife , began to shape her course in the direction indicated by her husband . The effect of his words , on me , was neither slight nor transitory . His iron sentences  --  cold and harsh  --  sunk deep into my heart , and stirred up not only my feelings into a sort of rebellion , but awakened within me a slumbering train of vital thought . It was a new and special revelation , dispelling a painful mystery , against which my youthful understanding had struggled , and struggled in vain , to wit : the white man 's power to perpetuate the enslavement of the black man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child to be a slave . " I instinctively assented to the proposition ; and from that moment I understood the direct pathway from slavery to freedom . This was just what I needed ; and I got it at a time , and from a source , whence I least expected it . I was saddened at the thought of losing the assistance of my kind mistress ; but the information , so instantly derived , to some extent compensated me for the loss I had sustained in this direction . Wise as Mr. Auld was , he evidently underrated my comprehension , and had little idea of the use to which I was capable of putting115 the impressive lesson he was giving to his wife . He wanted me to be a slave ; I had already voted against that on the home plantation of Col. Lloyd . That which he most loved I most hated ; and the very determination which he expressed to keep me in ignorance , only rendered me the more resolute in seeking intelligence . In learning to read , therefore , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the opposition of my master , as to the kindly assistance of my amiable mistress . I acknowledge the benefit rendered me by the one , and by the other ; believing , that but for my mistress , I might have grown up in ignorance . I had resided but a short time in Baltimore , before I observed a marked difference in the manner of treating slaves , generally , from which I had witnessed in that isolated and out-of-the-way part of the country where I began life . A city slave is almost a free citizen , in Baltimore , compared with a slave on Col. Lloyd 's plantation . He is much better fed and clothed , is less dejected in his appearance , and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the whip-driven slave on the plantation . Slavery dislikes a dense population , in which there is a majority of non-slaveholders . The general sense of decency that must pervade such a population , does much to check and prevent those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty , and those dark crimes without a name , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaveholder who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors , by the cries of the lacerated slaves ; and very few in the city are willing to incur the odium of being cruel masters . I found , in Baltimore , that no man was more odious to the white , as well as to the colored people , than he , who had the reputation of starving his slaves . Work them , flog them , if need be , but do n't starve them . These are , however , some painful exceptions to this rule . While it is quite true that most of the slaveholders in Baltimore feed and clothe their slaves well , there are others who keep up their country cruelties in the city . An instance of this sort is furnished in the case of a family116 who lived directly opposite to our house , and were named Hamilton . Mrs. Hamilton owned two slaves . Their names were Henrietta and Mary . They had always been house slaves . One was aged about twenty-two , and the other about fourteen . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they received was enough to break down the constitution of a horse . Of all the dejected , emaciated , mangled and excoriated creatures I ever saw , those two girls  --  in the refined , church going and Christian city of Baltimore were the most deplorable . Of stone must that heart be made , that could look upon Henrietta and Mary , without being sickened to the core with sadness . Especially was Mary a heart-sickening object . Her head , neck and shoulders , were literally cut to pieces . I have frequently felt her head , and found it nearly covered over with festering sores , caused by the lash of her cruel mistress . I do not know that her master ever whipped her , but I have often been an eye witness of the revolting and brutal inflictions by Mrs. Hamilton ; and what lends a deeper shade to this woman 's conduct , is the fact , that , almost in the very moments of her shocking outrages of humanity and decency , she would charm you by the sweetness of her voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large rocking chair , near the middle of the room , with a heavy cowskin , such as I have elsewhere described ; and I speak within the truth when I say , that these girls seldom passed that chair , during the day , without a blow from that cowskin , either upon their bare arms , or upon their shoulders . As they passed her , she would draw her cowskin and give them a blow , saying , " move faster , you black jip ! " and , again , " take that , you black jip ! " continuing , " if you do n't move faster , I will give you more . " Then the lady would go on , singing her sweet hymns , as though her righteous soul were sighing for the holy realms of paradise . Added to the cruel lashings to which these poor slave-girls were subjected  --  enough in themselves to crush the spirit of men  --  they were , really , kept nearly half starved ; they seldom knew117 what it was to eat a full meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less mean and stingy than the psalm-singing Mrs. Hamilton . I have seen poor Mary contending for the offal , with the pigs in the street . So much was the poor girl pinched , kicked , cut and pecked to pieces , that the boys in the street knew her only by the name of " pecked , " a name derived from the scars and blotches on her neck , head and shoulders . It is some relief to this picture of slavery in Baltimore , to say  --  what is but the simple truth  --  that Mrs. Hamilton 's treatment of her slaves was generally condemned , as disgraceful and shocking ; but while I say this , it must also be remembered , that the very parties who censured the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton , would have condemned and promptly punished any attempt to interfere with Mrs. Hamilton 's right to cut and slash her slaves to pieces . There must be no force between the slave and the slaveholder , to restrain the power of the one , and protect the weakness of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chargeable to the upholders of the slave system , as drunkenness is chargeable on those who , by precept and example , or by indifference , uphold the drinking system .

The most interesting feature of my history here , was my learning to read and write , under somewhat marked disadvantages . In attaining this knowledge , I was compelled to resort to indirections by no means congenial to my nature , and which were really humiliating to me . My mistress  --  who , as the reader has already seen , had begun to teach me was suddenly checked in her benevolent design , by the strong advice of her husband . In faithful compliance with this advice , the good lady had not only ceased to instruct me , herself , but had set her face as a flint against my learning to read by any means . It is due , however , to my mistress to say , that she did not adopt this course in all its stringency at the first . She either thought it unnecessary , or she lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in119 mental darkness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some training , and some hardening , in the exercise of the slaveholder 's prerogative , to make her equal to forgetting my human nature and character , and to treating me as a thing destitute of a moral or an intellectual nature . Mrs. Auld  --  my mistress  --  was , as I have said , a most kind and tender-hearted woman ; and , in the humanity of her heart , and the simplicity of her mind , she set out , when I first went to live with her , to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another . It is easy to see , that , in entering upon the duties of a slaveholder , some little experience is needed . Nature has done almost nothing to prepare men and women to be either slaves or slaveholders . Nothing but rigid training , long persisted in , can perfect the character of the one or the other . One can not easily forget to love freedom ; and it is as hard to cease to respect that natural love in our fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress , Mrs. Auld was singularly deficient ; nature , which fits nobody for such an office , had done less for her than any lady I had known . It was no easy matter to induce her to think and to feel that the curly-headed boy , who stood by her side , and even leaned on her lap ; who was loved by little Tommy , and who loved little Tommy in turn ; sustained to her only the relation of a chattel . I was more than that , and she felt me to be more than that . I could talk and sing ; I could laugh and weep ; I could reason and remember ; I could love and hate . I was human , and she , dear lady , knew and felt me to be so . How could she , then , treat me as a brute , without a mighty struggle with all the noble powers of her own soul . That struggle came , and the will and power of the husband was victorious . Her noble soul was overthrown ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , escape the consequences . He , not less than the other parties , was injured in his domestic peace by the fall . When I went into their family , it was the abode of happiness and contentment . The mistress of the house was a model of affection120 and tenderness . Her fervent piety and watchful uprightness made it impossible to see her without thinking and feeling  --  " that woman is a Christian . " There was no sorrow nor suffering for which she had not a tear , and there was no innocent joy for which she did not a smile . She had bread for the hungry , clothes for the naked , and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach . Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these excellent qualities , and her home of its early happiness . Conscience can not stand much violence . Once thoroughly broken down , who is he that can repair the damage ? It may be broken toward the slave , on Sunday , and toward the master on Monday . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it does not stand at all . If my condition waxed bad , that of the family waxed not better . The first step , in the wrong direction , was the violence done to nature and to conscience , in arresting the benevolence that would have enlightened my young mind . In ceasing to instruct me , she must begin to justify herself to herself ; and , once consenting to take sides in such a debate , she was riveted to her position . One needs very little knowledge of moral philosophy , to see where my mistress now landed . She finally became even more violent in her opposition to my learning to read , than was her husband himself . She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as her husband had commanded her , but seemed resolved to better his instruction . Nothing appeared to make my poor mistress  --  after her turning toward the downward path  --  more angry , than seeing me , seated in some nook or corner , quietly reading a book or a newspaper . I have had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatch from my hand such newspaper or book , with something of the wrath and consternation which a traitor might be supposed to feel on being discovered in a plot by some dangerous spy . Mrs. Auld was an apt woman , and the advice of her husband , and her own experience , soon demonstrated , to her entire satisfaction , that education and slavery are incompatible with each other . When this conviction was thoroughly established , I was121 most narrowly watched in all my movements . If I remained in a separate room from the family for any considerable length of time , I was sure to be suspected of having a book , and was at once called upon to give an account of myself . All this , however , was entirely too late . The first , and never to be retraced , step had been taken . In teaching me the alphabet , in the days of her simplicity and kindness , my mistress had given me the " inch , " and now , no ordinary precaution could prevent me from taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read , at any cost , I hit upon many expedients to accomplish the desired end . The plea which I mainly adopted , and the one by which I was most successful , was that of using my young white playmates , with whom I met in the streets as teachers . I used to carry , almost constantly , a copy of Webster 's spelling book in my pocket ; and , when sent of errands , or when play time was allowed me , I would step , with my young friends , aside , and take a lesson in spelling . I generally paid my tuition fee to the boys , with bread , which I also carried in my pocket . For a single biscuit , any of my hungry little comrades would give me a lesson more valuable to me than bread . Not every one , however , demanded this consideration , for there were those who took pleasure in teaching me , whenever I had a chance to be taught by them . I am strongly tempted to give the names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them , but prudence forbids ; not that it would injure me , but it might , possibly , embarrass them ; for it is almost an unpardonable offense to do any thing , directly or indirectly , to promote a slave 's freedom , in a slave state . It is enough to say , of my warm-hearted little play fellows , that they lived on Philpot street , very near Durgin &; Bailey 's shipyard . Although slavery was a delicate subject , and very cautiously talked about among grown up people in Maryland , I frequently talked about it  --  and that very freely  --  with the white boys . I122 would , sometimes , say to them , while seated on a curb stone or a cellar door , " I wish I could be free , as you will be when you get to be men . " " You will be free , you know , as soon as you are twenty-one , and can go where you like , but I am a slave for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free as you have ? " Words like these , I observed , always troubled them ; and I had no small satisfaction in wringing from the boys , occasionally , that fresh and bitter condemnation of slavery , that springs from nature , unseared and unperverted . Of all consciences let me have those to deal with which have not been bewildered by the cares of life . I do not remember ever to have met with a boy , while I was in slavery , who defended the slave system ; but I have often had boys to console me , with the hope that something would yet occur , by which I might be made free . Over and over again , they have told me , that " they believed I had as good a right to be free as they had ; " and that " they did not believe God ever made any one to be a slave . " The reader will easily see , that such little conversations with my play fellows , had no tendency to weaken my love of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave . When I was about thirteen years old , and had succeeded in learning to read , every increase of knowledge , especially respecting the FREE STATES , added something to the almost intolerable burden of the thought  --  I AM A SLAVE FOR LIFE . To my bondage I saw no end . It was a terrible reality , and I shall never be able to tell how sadly that thought chafed my young spirit . Fortunately , or unfortunately , about this time in my life , I had made enough money to buy what was then a very popular school book , viz : the Columbian Orator . I bought this addition to my library , of Mr. Knight , on Thames street , Fell 's Point , Baltimore , and paid him fifty cents for it . I was first led to buy this book , by hearing some little boys say they were going to learn some little pieces out of it for the Exhibition . This volume was , indeed , a rich treasure , and every opportunity afforded me , for123 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much other interesting matter , that which I had perused and reperused with unflagging satisfaction , was a short dialogue between a master and his slave . The slave is represented as having been recaptured , in a second attempt to run away ; and the master opens the dialogue with an upbraiding speech , charging the slave with ingratitude , and demanding to know what he has to say in his own defense . Thus upbraided , and thus called upon to reply , the slave rejoins , that he knows how little anything that he can say will avail , seeing that he is completely in the hands of his owner ; and with noble resolution , calmly says , " I submit to my fate . " Touched by the slave 's answer , the master insists upon his further speaking , and recapitulates the many acts of kindness which he has performed toward the slave , and tells him he is permitted to speak for himself . Thus invited to the debate , the quondam slave made a spirited defense of himself , and thereafter the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The master was vanquished at every turn in the argument ; and seeing himself to be thus vanquished , he generously and meekly emancipates the slave , with his best wishes for his prosperity . It is scarcely neccessary(sic) to say , that a dialogue , with such an origin , and such an ending  --  read when the fact of my being a slave was a constant burden of grief  --  powerfully affected me ; and I could not help feeling that the day might come , when the well-directed answers made by the slave to the master , in this instance , would find their counterpart in myself . This , however , was not all the fanaticism which I found in this Columbian Orator . I met there one of Sheridan 's mighty speeches , on the subject of Catholic Emancipation , Lord Chatham 's speech on the American war , and speeches by the great William Pitt and by Fox . These were all choice documents to me , and I read them , over and over again , with an interest that was ever increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more I read them , the better I understood them . The reading of124 these speeches added much to my limited stock of language , and enabled me to give tongue to many interesting thoughts , which had frequently flashed through my soul , and died away for want of utterance . The mighty power and heart-searching directness of truth , penetrating even the heart of a slaveholder , compelling him to yield up his earthly interests to the claims of eternal justice , were finely illustrated in the dialogue , just referred to ; and from the speeches of Sheridan , I got a bold and powerful denunciation of oppression , and a most brilliant vindication of the rights of man . Here was , indeed , a noble acquisition . If I ever wavered under the consideration , that the Almighty , in some way , ordained slavery , and willed my enslavement for his own glory , I wavered no longer . I had now penetrated the secret of all slavery and oppression , and had ascertained their true foundation to be in the pride , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speeches were all redolent of the principles of liberty , and poured floods of light on the nature and character of slavery . With a book of this kind in my hand , my own human nature , and the facts of my experience , to help me , I was equal to a contest with the religious advocates of slavery , whether among the whites or among the colored people , for blindness , in this matter , is not confined to the former . I have met many religious colored people , at the south , who are under the delusion that God requires them to submit to slavery , and to wear their chains with meekness and humility . I could entertain no such nonsense as this ; and I almost lost my patience when I found any colored man weak enough to believe such stuff . Nevertheless , the increase of knowledge was attended with bitter , as well as sweet results . The more I read , the more I was led to abhor and detest slavery , and my enslavers . " Slaveholders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful robbers , who left their homes and went into Africa for the purpose of stealing and reducing my people to slavery . " I loathed them as the meanest and the most wicked of men . As I read , behold ! the very discontent so graphically pre125 dicted by Master Hugh , had already come upon me . I was no longer the light-hearted , gleesome boy , full of mirth and play , as when I landed first at Baltimore . Knowledge had come ; light had penetrated the moral dungeon where I dwelt ; and , behold ! there lay the bloody whip , for my back , and here was the iron chain ; and my good , kind master , he was the author of my situation . The revelation haunted me , stung me , and made me gloomy and miserable . As I writhed under the sting and torment of this knowledge , I almost envied my fellow slaves their stupid contentment . This knowledge opened my eyes to the horrible pit , and revealed the teeth of the frightful dragon that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for my escape . I have often wished myself a beast , or a bird  --  anything , rather than a slave . I was wretched and gloomy , beyond my ability to describe . I was too thoughtful to be happy . It was this everlasting thinking which distressed and tormented me ; and yet there was no getting rid of the subject of my thoughts . All nature was redolent of it . Once awakened by the silver trump of knowledge , my spirit was roused to eternal wakefulness . Liberty ! the inestimable birthright of every man , had , for me , converted every object into an asserter of this great right . It was heard in every sound , and beheld in every object . It was ever present , to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition . The more beautiful and charming were the smiles of nature , the more horrible and desolate was my condition . I saw nothing without seeing it , and I heard nothing without hearing it . I do not exaggerate , when I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , breathed in every wind , and moved in every storm . I have no doubt that my state of mind had something to do with the change in the treatment adopted , by my once kind mistress toward me . I can easily believe , that my leaden , downcast , and discontented look , was very offensive to her . Poor lady ! She did not know my trouble , and I dared not tell her . Could I have freely made her acquainted with the real state of my mind , and126 given her the reasons therefor , it might have been well for both of us . Her abuse of me fell upon me like the blows of the false prophet upon his ass ; she did not know that an angel stood in the way ; and  --  such is the relation of master and slave I could not tell her . Nature had made us friends ; slavery made us enemies . My interests were in a direction opposite to hers , and we both had our private thoughts and plans . She aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although knowledge only increased my discontent . My feelings were not the result of any marked cruelty in the treatment I received ; they sprung from the consideration of my being a slave at all . It was slavery  --  not its mere incidents  --  that I hated . I had been cheated . I saw through the attempt to keep me in ignorance ; I saw that slaveholders would have gladly made me believe that they were merely acting under the authority of God , in making a slave of me , and in making slaves of others ; and I treated them as robbers and deceivers . The feeding and clothing me well , could not atone for taking my liberty from me . The smiles of my mistress could not remove the deep sorrow that dwelt in my young bosom . Indeed , these , in time , came only to deepen my sorrow . She had changed ; and the reader will see that I had changed , too . We were both victims to the same overshadowing evil  --  she , as mistress , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she can not censure me , for she knows I speak but the truth , and have acted in my opposition to slavery , just as she herself would have acted , in a reverse of circumstances .

I was all ears , all eyes , whenever the words slave , slavery , dropped from the lips of any white person , and the occasions were not unfrequent when these words became leading ones , in high , social debate , at our house . Every little while , I could hear Master Hugh , or some of his company , speaking with much warmth and excitement about " abolitionists . " Of who or what these were , I was totally ignorant . I found , however , that whatever they might be , they were most cordially hated and soundly abused by slaveholders , of every grade . I very soon discovered , too , that slavery was , in some128 sort , under consideration , whenever the abolitionists were alluded to . This made the term a very interesting one to me .

If , also , a slave killed his master  --  as was sometimes the case  --  or struck down his overseer , or set fire to his master 's dwelling , or committed any violence or crime , out of the common way , it was certain to be said , that such a crime was the legitimate fruits of the abolition movement . Hearing such charges often repeated , I , naturally enough , received the impression that abolition  --  whatever else it might be  --  could not be unfriendly to the slave , nor very friendly to the slaveholder . I therefore set about finding out , if possible , who and what the abolitionists were , and why they were so obnoxious to the slaveholders . The dictionary afforded me very little help . It taught me that abolition was the " act of abolishing ; " but it left me in ignorance at the very point where I most wanted information  --  and that was , as to the thing to be abolished . A city newspaper , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dictionary . In its columns I found , that , on a certain day , a vast number of petitions and memorials had been presented to congress , praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia , and for the abolition of the slave trade between the states of the Union . This was enough . The vindictive bitterness , the marked caution , the studied reverse , and the cumbrous ambiguity , practiced by our white folks , when alluding to this subject , was now fully explained . Ever , after that , when I heard the words " abolition , " or " abolition movement , " mentioned , I felt the matter one of a personal concern ; and I drew near to listen , when I could do so , without seeming too solicitous and prying . There was HOPE in those words . Ever and anon , too , I could see some terrible denunciation of slavery , in our papers  --  copied from abolition papers at the north  --  and the injustice of such denunciation commented on . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thought , that the rascality of slaveholders was not concealed from the eyes of the world , and that I was not alone in abhorring the cruelty and brutality of slavery . A still deeper train of thought was stirred . I saw that there was fear , as well as rage , in the manner of speaking of the abolitionists . The latter , therefore , I was compelled to regard as having some power in the country ; and I felt that they might , possibly , succeed in their designs . When I met with a slave to whom I deemed it safe to talk on the subject , I would impart to him so much of the mystery as I had been able to penetrate . Thus , the light of this grand movement broke in upon my mind , by degrees ; and I must say , that , ignorant as I then was of the philosophy of that movement , I believe in it from the first  --  and I believed in it , partly , because I saw that it alarmed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been quelled , but the alarm and terror had not subsided . The cholera was on its way , and the thought was present , that God was angry with the white people because of their slaveholding wickedness , and , therefore , his judgments were abroad in the land . It was impossible for me not to hope much from the abolition movement , when I saw it supported by the Almighty , and armed with DEATH ! Previous to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement , and its probable results , my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of religion . I was not more than thirteen years old , when I felt the need of God , as a father and protector . My religious nature was awakened by the preaching of a white Methodist minister , named Hanson . He thought that all men , great and small , bond and free , were sinners in the sight of God ; that they were , by nature , rebels against His government ; and that they must repent of their sins , and be reconciled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me ; but one thing I knew very well  --  I was wretched , and had no means of making myself otherwise . Moreover , I knew that I could pray for light . I consulted a good colored man , named130 Charles Johnson ; and , in tones of holy affection , he told me to pray , and what to pray for . I was , for weeks , a poor , brokenhearted mourner , traveling through the darkness and misery of doubts and fears . I finally found that change of heart which comes by " casting all one 's care " upon God , and by having faith in Jesus Christ , as the Redeemer , Friend , and Savior of those who diligently seek Him . After this , I saw the world in a new light . I seemed to live in a new world , surrounded by new objects , and to be animated by new hopes and desires . I loved all mankind  --  slaveholders not excepted ; though I abhorred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , to have the world converted . The desire for knowledge increased , and especially did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the bible . I have gathered scattered pages from this holy book , from the filthy street gutters of Baltimore , and washed and dried them , that in the moments of my leisure , I might get a word or two of wisdom from them . While thus religiously seeking knowledge , I became acquainted with a good old colored man , named Lawson . A more devout man than he , I never saw . He drove a dray for Mr. James Ramsey , the owner of a rope-walk on Fell 's Point , Baltimore . This man not only prayed three time a day , but he prayed as he walked through the streets , at his work  --  on his dray everywhere . His life was a life of prayer , and his words ( when he spoke to his friends , ) were about a better world . Uncle Lawson lived near Master Hugh 's house ; and , becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him to prayer-meeting , and spent much of my leisure time with him on Sunday . The old man could read a little , and I was a great help to him , in making out the hard words , for I was a better reader than he . I could teach him " the letter , " but he could teach me " the spirit ; " and high , refreshing times we had together , in singing , praying and glorifying God . These meetings with Uncle Lawson went on for a long time , without the knowledge of Master Hugh or my mistress . Both knew , how131 ever , that I had become religious , and they seemed to respect my conscientious piety . My mistress was still a professor of religion , and belonged to class . Her leader was no less a person than the Rev. Beverly Waugh , the presiding elder , and now one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church . Mr. Waugh was then stationed over Wilk street church . I am careful to state these facts , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precise influences which had to do with shaping and directing my mind . In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was then leading , and , especially , in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected , my mistress had , as I have before stated , become lukewarm , and needed to be looked up by her leader . This brought Mr. Waugh to our house , and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray . But my chief instructor , in matters of religion , was Uncle Lawson . He was my spiritual father ; and I loved him intensely , and was at his house every chance I got . This pleasure was not long allowed me . Master Hugh became averse to my going to Father Lawson 's , and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again . I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man ; and I would go to Father Lawson 's , notwithstanding the threat . The good old man had told me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; " and I must prepare to do it ; and that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel . His words made a deep impression on my mind , and I verily felt that some such work was before me , though I could not see how I should ever engage in its performance . " The good Lord , " he said , " would bring it to pass in his own good time , " and that I must go on reading and studying the scriptures . The advice and the suggestions of Uncle Lawson , were not without their influence upon my character and destiny . He threw my thoughts into a channel from which they have never entirely diverged . He fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame , by assuring me that I was to be a useful man in the world . When I would132 say to him , " How can these things be and what can I do ? " his simple reply was , " Trust in the Lord . " When I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave FOR LIFE , " he said , " the Lord can make you free , my dear . All things are possible with him , only have faith in God . " " Ask , and it shall be given . " " If you want liberty , " said the good old man , " ask the Lord for it , in faith , AND HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU . " Thus assured , and cheered on , under the inspiration of hope , I worked and prayed with a light heart , believing that my life was under the guidance of a wisdom higher than my own . With all other blessings sought at the mercy seat , I always prayed that God would , of His great mercy , and in His own good time , deliver me from my bondage . I went , one day , on the wharf of Mr. Waters ; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a large scow of stone , or ballast I went on board , unasked , and helped them . When we had finished the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asked me a number of questions , and among them , if I were a slave . I told him " I was a slave , and a slave for life . " The good Irishman gave his shoulders a shrug , and seemed deeply affected by the statement . He said , " it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life . " They both had much to say about the matter , and expressed the deepest sympathy with me , and the most decided hatred of slavery . They went so far as to tell me that I ought to run away , and go to the north ; that I should find friends there , and that I would be as free as anybody . I , however , pretended not to be interested in what they said , for I feared they might be treacherous . White men have been known to encourage slaves to escape , and then  --  to get the reward  --  they have kidnapped them , and returned them to their masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men were honest and meant me no ill , I feared it might be otherwise . I nevertheless remembered their words and their advice , and looked forward to an escape to the north , as a possible means of gaining the liberty133 for which my heart panted . It was not my enslavement , at the then present time , that most affected me ; the being a slave for life , was the saddest thought . I was too young to think of running away immediately ; besides , I wished to learn how to write , before going , as I might have occasion to write my own pass . I now not only had the hope of freedom , but a foreshadowing of the means by which I might , some day , gain that inestimable boon . Meanwhile , I resolved to add to my educational attainments the art of writing . After this manner I began to learn to write : I was much in the ship yard  --  Master Hugh 's , and that of Durgan &; Bailey  --  and I observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber ready for use , wrote on it the initials of the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended . When , for instance , a piece of timber was ready for the starboard side , it was marked with a capital " S. " A piece for the larboard side was marked " L ; " larboard forward , " L. F. ; " larboard aft , was marked " L. A. ; " starboard aft , " S. A. ; " and starboard forward " S. F. " I soon learned these letters , and for what they were placed on the timbers . My work was now , to keep fire under the steam box , and to watch the ship yard while the carpenters had gone to dinner . This interval gave me a fine opportunity for copying the letters named . I soon astonished myself with the ease with which I made the letters ; and the thought was soon present , " if I can make four , I can make more . " But having made these easily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our play-grounds , I entered the lists with them in the art of writing , and would make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn , and ask them to " beat that if they could . " With playmates for my teachers , fences and pavements for my copy books , and chalk for my pen and ink , I learned the art of writing . I , however , afterward adopted various methods of improving my hand . The most successful , was copying the italics in Webster 's spelling book , until134 I could make them all without looking on the book . By this time , my little " Master Tommy " had grown to be a big boy , and had written over a number of copy books , and brought them home . They had been shown to the neighbors , had elicited due praise , and were now laid carefully away . Spending my time between the ship yard and house , I was as often the lone keeper of the latter as of the former . When my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a grand time ; I got Master Tommy 's copy books and a pen and ink , and , in the ample spaces between the lines , I wrote other lines , as nearly like his as possible . The process was a tedious one , and I ran the risk of getting a flogging for marring the highly prized copy books of the oldest son . In addition to those opportunities , sleeping , as I did , in the kitchen loft  --  a room seldom visited by any of the family  --  I got a flour barrel up there , and a chair ; and upon the head of that barrel I have written ( or endeavored to write ) copying from the bible and the Methodist hymn book , and other books which had accumulated on my hands , till late at night , and when all the family were in bed and asleep . I was supported in my endeavors by renewed advice , and by holy promises from the good Father Lawson , with whom I continued to meet , and pray , and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going there , I must say , for his credit , that he never executed his threat to whip me , for having thus , innocently , employed-my leisure time . CHAPTER XIII . The Vicissitudes of Slave Life DEATH OF OLD MASTER 'S SON RICHARD , SPEEDILY FOLLOWED BY THAT OF OLD MASTER  --  VALUATION AND DIVISION OF ALL THE PROPERTY , INCLUDING THE SLAVES  --  MY PRESENCE REQUIRED AT HILLSBOROUGH TO BE APPRAISED AND ALLOTTED TO A NEW OWNER  --  MY SAD PROSPECTS AND GRIEF  --  PARTING  --  THE UTTER POWERLESSNESS OF THE SLAVES TO DECIDE THEIR OWN DESTINY  --  A GENERAL DREAD OF MASTER ANDREW  --  HIS WICKEDNESS AND CRUELTY  --  MISS LUCRETIA MY NEW OWNER  --  MY RETURN TO BALTIMORE  --  JOY UNDER THE ROOF OF MASTER HUGH  --  DEATH OF MRS .

I must now ask the reader to go with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humble story , and to notice another circumstance that entered into my slavery experience , and which , doubtless , has had a share in deepening my horror of slavery , and increasing my hostility toward those men and measures that practically uphold the slave system . It has already been observed , that though I was , after my removal from Col. Lloyd 's plantation , in form the slave of Master Hugh , I was , in fact , and in law , the slave of my old master , Capt . Anthony . Very well . In a very short time after I went to Baltimore , my old master 's youngest son , Richard , died ; and , in three years and six months after his death , my old master himself died , leaving only his son , Andrew , and his daughter , Lucretia , to share his estate . The136 old man died while on a visit to his daughter , in Hillsborough , where Capt . Auld and Mrs. Lucretia now lived . The former , having given up the command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that town . Cut off , thus unexpectedly , Capt . Anthony died intestate ; and his property must now be equally divided between his two children , Andrew and Lucretia . The valuation and the division of slaves , among contending heirs , is an important incident in slave life . The character and tendencies of the heirs , are generally well understood among the slaves who are to be divided , and all have their aversions and preferences . But , neither their aversions nor their preferences avail them anything . On the death of old master , I was immediately sent for , to be valued and divided with the other property . Personally , my concern was , mainly , about my possible removal from the home of Master Hugh , which , after that of my grandmother , was the most endeared to me . But , the whole thing , as a feature of slavery , shocked me . It furnished me anew insight into the unnatural power to which I was subjected . My detestation of slavery , already great , rose with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad day for me , a sad day for little Tommy , and a sad day for my dear Baltimore mistress and teacher , when I left for the Eastern Shore , to be valued and divided . We , all three , wept bitterly that day ; for we might be parting , and we feared we were parting , forever . No one could tell among which pile of chattels I should be flung . Thus early , I got a foretaste of that painful uncertainty which slavery brings to the ordinary lot of mortals . Sickness , adversity and death may interfere with the plans and purposes of all ; but the slave has the added danger of changing homes , changing hands , and of having separations unknown to other men . Then , too , there was the intensified degradation of the spectacle . What an assemblage ! Men and women , young and old , married and single ; moral and intellectual beings , in open contempt of their humanity , level at a blow with137 horses , sheep , horned cattle and swine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children  --  all holding the same rank in the scale of social existence ; and all subjected to the same narrow inspection , to ascertain their value in gold and silver  --  the only standard of worth applied by slaveholders to slaves ! How vividly , at that moment , did the brutalizing power of slavery flash before me ! Personality swallowed up in the sordid idea of property ! Manhood lost in chattelhood ! After the valuation , then came the division . This was an hour of high excitement and distressing anxiety . Our destiny was now to be fixed for life , and we had no more voice in the decision of the question , than the oxen and cows that stood chewing at the haymow . One word from the appraisers , against all preferences or prayers , was enough to sunder all the ties of friendship and affection , and even to separate husbands and wives , parents and children . We were all appalled before that power , which , to human seeming , could bless or blast us in a moment . Added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slaves , we all had a decided horror of the thought of falling into the hands of Master Andrew . He was distinguished for cruelty and intemperance . Slaves generally dread to fall into the hands of drunken owners . Master Andrew was almost a confirmed sot , and had already , by his reckless mismanagement and profligate dissipation , wasted a large portion of old master 's property . To fall into his hands , was , therefore , considered merely as the first step toward being sold away to the far south . He would spend his fortune in a few years , and his farms and slaves would be sold , we thought , at public outcry ; and we should be hurried away to the cotton fields , and rice swamps , of the sunny south . This was the cause of deep consternation . The people of the north , and free people generally , I think , have less attachment to the places where they are born and brought up , than have the slaves . Their freedom to go and come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prevents any extravagant attachment to any one particular place , in their case . On the other hand , the slave is a fixture ; he has no choice , no goal , no destination ; but is pegged down to a single spot , and must take root here , or nowhere . The idea of removal elsewhere , comes , generally , in the shape of a threat , and in punishment of crime . It is , therefore , attended with fear and dread . A slave seldom thinks of bettering his condition by being sold , and hence he looks upon separation from his native place , with none of the enthusiasm which animates the bosoms of young freemen , when they contemplate a life in the far west , or in some distant country where they intend to rise to wealth and distinction . Nor can those from whom they separate , give them up with that cheerfulness with which friends and relations yield each other up , when they feel that it is for the good of the departing one that he is removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correspondence , and there is , at least , the hope of reunion , because reunion is possible . But , with the slave , all these mitigating circumstances are wanting . There is no improvement in his condition probable ,  --  no correspondence possible ,  --  no reunion attainable . His going out into the world , is like a living man going into the tomb , who , with open eyes , sees himself buried out of sight and hearing of wife , children and friends of kindred tie . In contemplating the likelihoods and possibilities of our circumstances , I probably suffered more than most of my fellow servants . I had known what it was to experience kind , and even tender treatment ; they had known nothing of the sort . Life , to them , had been rough and thorny , as well as dark . They had  --  most of them  --  lived on my old master 's farm in Tuckahoe , and had felt the reign of Mr. Plummer 's rule . The overseer had written his character on the living parchment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; my back ( thanks to my early removal from the plantation to Baltimore ) was yet tender . I had left a kind mistress139 at Baltimore , who was almost a mother to me . She was in tears when we parted , and the probabilities of ever seeing her again , trembling in the balance as they did , could not be viewed without alarm and agony . The thought of leaving that kind mistress forever , and , worse still , of being the slave of Andrew Anthony  --  a man who , but a few days before the division of the property , had , in my presence , seized my brother Perry by the throat , dashed him on the ground , and with the heel of his boot stamped him on the head , until the blood gushed from his nose and ears  --  was terrible ! This fiendish proceeding had no better apology than the fact , that Perry had gone to play , when Master Andrew wanted him for some trifling service . This cruelty , too , was of a piece with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother , on observing me looking at him with intense astonishment , he said , " That is the way I will serve you , one of these days ; " meaning , no doubt , when I should come into his possession . This threat , the reader may well suppose , was not very tranquilizing to my feelings . I could see that he really thirsted to get hold of me . But I was there only for a few days . I had not received any orders , and had violated none , and there was , therefore , no excuse for flogging me . At last , the anxiety and suspense were ended ; and they ended , thanks to a kind Providence , in accordance with my wishes . I fell to the portion of Mrs. Lucretia  --  the dear lady who bound up my head , when the savage Aunt Katy was adding to my sufferings her bitterest maledictions . Capt . Thomas Auld and Mrs. Lucretia at once decided on my return to Baltimore . They knew how sincerely and warmly Mrs. Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh 's son would be to have me back ; and , withal , having no immediate use for one so young , they willingly let me off to Baltimore . I need not stop here to narrate my joy on returning to Baltimore , nor that of little Tommy ; nor the tearful joy of his mother ; 140 nor the evident saticfaction(sic) of Master Hugh . I was just one month absent from Baltimore , before the matter was decided ; and the time really seemed full six months . One trouble over , and on comes another . The slave 's life is full of uncertainty . I had returned to Baltimore but a short time , when the tidings reached me , that my friend , Mrs. Lucretia , who was only second in my regard to Mrs. Hugh Auld , was dead , leaving her husband and only one child  --  a daughter , named Amanda . Shortly after the death of Mrs. Lucretia , strange to say , Master Andrew died , leaving his wife and one child . Thus , the whole family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this happened within five years of my leaving Col. Lloyd 's . No alteration took place in the condition of the slaves , in consequence of these deaths , yet I could not help feeling less secure , after the death of my friend , Mrs. Lucretia , than I had done during her life . While she lived , I felt that I had a strong friend to plead for me in any emergency . Ten years ago , while speaking of the state of things in our family , after the events just named , I used this language : Now all the property of my old master , slaves included , was in the hands of strangers  --  strangers who had nothing to do in accumulating it . Not a slave was left free . All remained slaves , from youngest to oldest . If any one thing in my experience , more than another , served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery , and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders , it was their base ingratitude to my poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth to old age . She had been the source of all his wealth ; she had peopled his plantation with slaves ; she had become a great-grandmother in his service . She had rocked him in infancy , attended him in childhood , served him through life , and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat , and closed his eyes forever . She was nevertheless left a slave  --  a slave for life  --  a slave in the hands of strangers ; and in their hands she saw her children , her grandchildren , and her great-grandchildren , divided , like so many sheep , without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word , as to their or her own destiny . And , to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity , my grandmother , who was now very old , having outlived my old master and all his children , having seen the beginning and end of all of them , and her present owners finding she141 was of but little value , her frame already racked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast stealing over her once active limbs , they took her to the woods , built her a little hut , put up a little mud-chimney , and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness ; thus virtually turning her out to die ! If my poor old grandmother now lives , she lives to suffer in utter loneliness ; she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children , the loss of grandchildren , and the loss of great-grandchildren . They are , in the language of the slave 's poet , Whittier  --  Gone , gone , sold and gone , To the rice swamp dank and lone , Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings , Where the noisome insect stings , Where the fever-demon strews Poison with the falling dews , Where the sickly sunbeams glare Through the hot and misty air :  - -  Gone , gone , sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone , From Virginia hills and waters  - -  Woe is me , my stolen daughters ! The hearth is desolate . The children , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , are gone . She gropes her way , in the darkness of age , for a drink of water . Instead of the voices of her children , she hears by day the moans of the dove , and by night the screams of the hideous owl . All is gloom . The grave is at the door . And now , when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age , when the head inclines to the feet , when the beginning and ending of human existence meet , and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together  --  at this time , this most needful time , the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can exercise toward a declining parent  --  my poor old grandmother , the devoted mother of twelve children , is left all alone , in yonder little hut , before a few dim embers . Two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia , Master Thomas married his second wife . Her name was Rowena Hamilton , the eldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived about five miles from St. Michael 's , the then place of my master 's residence . Not long after his marriage , Master Thomas had a misunderstanding with Master Hugh , and , as a means of punishing his brother , he ordered him to send me home. 142 As the ground of misunderstanding will serve to illustrate the character of southern chivalry , and humanity , I will relate it . Among the children of my Aunt Milly , was a daughter , named Henny . When quite a child , Henny had fallen into the fire , and burnt her hands so bad that they were of very little use to her . Her fingers were drawn almost into the palms of her hands . She could make out to do something , but she was considered hardly worth the having  --  of little more value than a horse with a broken leg . This unprofitable piece of human property , ill shapen , and disfigured , Capt . Auld sent off to Baltimore , making his brother Hugh welcome to her services . After giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife came to the conclusion , that they had no use for the crippled servant , and they sent her back to Master Thomas . Thus , the latter took as an act of ingratitude , on the part of his brother ; and , as a mark of his displeasure , he required him to send me immediately to St. Michael 's , saying , if he can not keep " Hen , " he shall not have " Fred . " Here was another shock to my nerves , another breaking up of my plans , and another severance of my religious and social alliances . I was now a big boy . I had become quite useful to several young colored men , who had made me their teacher . I had taught some of them to read , and was accustomed to spend many of my leisure hours with them . Our attachment was strong , and I greatly dreaded the separation . But regrets , especially in a slave , are unavailing . I was only a slave ; my wishes were nothing , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at now leaving Baltimore , were not for the same reasons as when I before left that city , to be valued and handed over to my proper owner . My home was not now the pleasant place it had formerly been . A change had taken place , both in Master Hugh , and in his once pious and affectionate wife . The influence of brandy and bad company on him , and the influence of slavery and social isolation upon her , had wrought disastrously upon the143 characters of both . Thomas was no longer " little Tommy , " but was a big boy , and had learned to assume the airs of his class toward me . My condition , therefore , in the house of Master Hugh , was not , by any means , so comfortable as in former years . My attachments were now outside of our family . They were felt to those to whom I imparted instruction , and to those little white boys from whom I received instruction . There , too , was my dear old father , the pious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very counterpart of " Uncle " Tom . The resemblance is so perfect , that he might have been the original of Mrs. Stowe 's christian hero . The thought of leaving these dear friends , greatly troubled me , for I was going without the hope of ever returning to Baltimore again ; the feud between Master Hugh and his brother being bitter and irreconcilable , or , at least , supposed to be so . In addition to thoughts of friends from whom I was parting , as I supposed , forever , I had the grief of neglected chances of escape to brood over . I had put off running away , until now I was to be placed where the opportunities for escaping were much fewer than in a large city like Baltimore . On my way from Baltimore to St. Michael 's , down the Chesapeake bay , our sloop  --  the " Amanda "  --  was passed by the steamers plying between that city and Philadelphia , and I watched the course of those steamers , and , while going to St. Michael 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which plan , and matters connected therewith the kind reader shall learn more hereafter .

St. Michael 's , the village in which was now my new home , compared favorably with villages in slave states , generally . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , as a whole , wore a dull , slovenly , enterprise-forsaken aspect . The mass of the buildings were wood ; they had never enjoyed the artificial adornment of paint , and time and storms had worn off the bright color of the wood , leaving them almost as black as buildings charred by a conflagration . St. Michael 's had , in former years , ( previous to 1833 , for that was the year I went to reside there , ) enjoyed some reputation as a ship building community , but that business had almost entirely given place to oyster fishing , for the Baltimore and Philadelphia markets  --  a course of life highly unfavorable to morals , industry , and manners . Miles river was broad , and its oyster fishing145 grounds were extensive ; and the fishermen were out , often , all day , and a part of the night , during autumn , winter and spring . This exposure was an excuse for carrying with them , in considerable quanties(sic) , spirituous liquors , the then supposed best antidote for cold . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tippling , among this class of the citizens of St. Michael 's , became general . This drinking habit , in an ignorant population , fostered coarseness , vulgarity and an indolent disregard for the social improvement of the place , so that it was admitted , by the few sober , thinking people who remained there , that St. Michael 's had become a very unsaintly , as well as unsightly place , before I went there to reside . I left Baltimore for St. Michael 's in the month of March , 1833 . I know the year , because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in Baltimore , and was the year , also , of that strange phenomenon , when the heavens seemed about to part with its starry train . I witnessed this gorgeous spectacle , and was awe-struck . The air seemed filled with bright , descending messengers from the sky . It was about daybreak when I saw this sublime scene . I was not without the suggestion , at the moment , that it might be the harbinger of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then state of mind , I was prepared to hail Him as my friend and deliverer . I had read , that the " stars shall fall from heaven " ; and they were now falling . I was suffering much in my mind . It did seem that every time the young tendrils of my affection became attached , they were rudely broken by some unnatural outside power ; and I was beginning to look away to heaven for the rest denied me on earth . But , to my story . It was now more than seven years since I had lived with Master Thomas Auld , in the family of my old master , on Col. Lloyd 's plantation . We were almost entire strangers to each other ; for , when I knew him at the house of my old master , it was not as a master , but simply as " Captain Auld , " who had married old master 's daughter . All my lessons concerning his146 temper and disposition , and the best methods of pleasing him , were yet to be learnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching a slave ; and my ignorance of the new material in shape of a master was but transient . Nor was my mistress long in making known her animus . She was not a " Miss Lucretia , " traces of whom I yet remembered , and the more especially , as I saw them shining in the face of little Amanda , her daughter , now living under a step-mother 's government . I had not forgotten the soft hand , guided by a tender heart , that bound up with healing balsam the gash made in my head by Ike , the son of Abel . Thomas and Rowena , I found to be a well-matched pair . He was stingy , and she was cruel ; and  --  what was quite natural in such cases  --  she possessed the ability to make him as cruel as herself , while she could easily descend to the level of his meanness . In the house of Master Thomas , I was made  --  for the first time in seven years to feel the pinchings of hunger , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the changes of Master Hugh 's family , there was no change in the bountifulness with which they supplied me with food . Not to give a slave enough to eat , is meanness intensified , and it is so recognized among slaveholders generally , in Maryland . The rule is , no matter how coarse the food , only let there be enough of it . This is the theory , and  --  in the part of Maryland I came from  --  the general practice accords with this theory . Lloyd 's plantation was an exception , as was , also , the house of Master Thomas Auld . All know the lightness of Indian corn-meal , as an article of food , and can easily judge from the following facts whether the statements I have made of the stinginess of Master Thomas , are borne out . There were four slaves of us in the kitchen , and four whites in the great house Thomas Auld , Mrs. Auld , Hadaway Auld ( brother of Thomas Auld ) and little Amanda . The names of the slaves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my aunt ; Henny , my cousin ; and myself . There were eight persons147 in the family . There was , each week , one half bushel of corn-meal brought from the mill ; and in the kitchen , corn-meal was almost our exclusive food , for very little else was allowed us . Out of this bushel of corn-meal , the family in the great house had a small loaf every morning ; thus leaving us , in the kitchen , with not quite a half a peck per week , apiece . This allowance was less than half the allowance of food on Lloyd 's plantation . It was not enough to subsist upon ; and we were , therefore , reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors . We were compelled either to beg , or to steal , and we did both . I frankly confess , that while I hated everything like stealing , as such , I nevertheless did not hesitate to take food , when I was hungry , wherever I could find it . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was , in my case , the result of a clear apprehension of the claims of morality . I weighed and considered the matter closely , before I ventured to satisfy my hunger by such means . Considering that my labor and person were the property of Master Thomas , and that I was by him deprived of the necessaries of life necessaries obtained by my own labor  --  it was easy to deduce the right to supply myself with what was my own . It was simply appropriating what was my own to the use of my master , since the health and strength derived from such food were exerted in his service . To be sure , this was stealing , according to the law and gospel I heard from St. Michael 's pulpit ; but I had already begun to attach less importance to what dropped from that quarter , on that point , while , as yet , I retained my reverence for religion . It was not always convenient to steal from master , and the same reason why I might , innocently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stealing from others . In the case of my master , it was only a question of removal  --  the taking his meat out of one tub , and putting it into another ; the ownership of the meat was not affected by the transaction . At first , he owned it in the tub , and last , he owned it in me . His meat house was not always open . There was a strict watch kept on that148 point , and the key was on a large bunch in Rowena 's pocket . A great many times have we , poor creatures , been severely pinched with hunger , when meat and bread have been moulding under the lock , while the key was in the pocket of our mistress . This had been so when she knew we were nearly half starved ; and yet , that mistress , with saintly air , would kneel with her husband , and pray each morning that a merciful God would bless them in basket and in store , and save them , at last , in his kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary that right to steal from others should be established ; and this could only rest upon a wider range of generalization than that which supposed the right to steal from my master . It was sometime before I arrived at this clear right . The reader will get some idea of my train of reasoning , by a brief statement of the case . " I am , " thought I , " not only the slave of Thomas , but I am the slave of society at large . Society at large has bound itself , in form and in fact , to assist Master Thomas in robbing me of my rightful liberty , and of the just reward of my labor ; therefore , whatever rights I have against Master Thomas , I have , equally , against those confederated with him in robbing me of liberty . As society has marked me out as privileged plunder , on the principle of self-preservation I am justified in plundering in turn . Since each slave belongs to all ; all must , therefore , belong to each . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock some , offend others , and be dissented from by all . It is this : Within the bounds of his just earnings , I hold that the slave is fully justified in helping himself to the gold and silver , and the best apparel of his master , or that of any other slaveholder ; and that such taking is not stealing in any just sense of that word . The morality of free society can have no application to slave society . Slaveholders have made it almost impossible for the slave to commit any crime , known either to the laws of God or to the laws of man . If he steals , he takes his own ; if he kills his master , 149 he imitates only the heroes of the revolution . Slaveholders I hold to be individually and collectively responsible for all the evils which grow out of the horrid relation , and I believe they will be so held at the judgment , in the sight of a just God . Make a man a slave , and you rob him of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability . But my kind readers are , probably , less concerned about my opinions , than about that which more nearly touches my personal experience ; albeit , my opinions have , in some sort , been formed by that experience . Bad as slaveholders are , I have seldom met with one so entirely destitute of every element of character capable of inspiring respect , as was my present master , Capt . Thomas Auld . When I lived with him , I thought him incapable of a noble action . The leading trait in his character was intense selfishness . I think he was fully aware of this fact himself , and often tried to conceal it . Capt . Auld was not a born slaveholder  --  not a birthright member of the slaveholding oligarchy . He was only a slaveholder by marriage-right ; and , of all slaveholders , these latter are , by far , the most exacting . There was in him all the love of domination , the pride of mastery , and the swagger of authority , but his rule lacked the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his methods of showing it were cowardly , and evinced his meanness rather than his spirit . His commands were strong , his enforcement weak . Slaves are not insensible to the whole-souled characteristics of a generous , dashing slaveholder , who is fearless of consequences ; and they prefer a master of this bold and daring kind  --  even with the risk of being shot down for impudence to the fretful , little soul , who never uses the lash but at the suggestion of a love of gain . Slaves , too , readily distinguish between the birthright bearing of the original slaveholder and the assumed attitudes of the accidental slaveholder ; and while they can not respect either , they certainly despise the latter more than the former. 150 The luxury of having slaves wait upon him was something new to Master Thomas ; and for it he was wholly unprepared . He was a slaveholder , without the ability to hold or manage his slaves . We seldom called him " master , " but generally addressed him by his " bay craft " title  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such conduct might do much to make him appear awkward , and , consequently , fretful . His wife was especially solicitous to have us call her husband " master . " Is your master at the store ? "  --  " Where is your master ? "  --  " Go and tell your master "  --  " I will make your master acquainted with your conduct "  --  she would say ; but we were inapt scholars . Especially were I and my sister Eliza inapt in this particular . Aunt Priscilla was less stubborn and defiant in her spirit than Eliza and myself ; and , I think , her road was less rough than ours . In the month of August , 1833 , when I had almost become desperate under the treatment of Master Thomas , and when I entertained more strongly than ever the oft-repeated determination to run away , a circumstance occurred which seemed to promise brighter and better days for us all . At a Methodist camp-meeting , held in the Bay Side ( a famous place for campmeetings ) about eight miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profession of religion . He had long been an object of interest to the church , and to the ministers , as I had seen by the repeated visits and lengthy exhortations of the latter . He was a fish quite worth catching , for he had money and standing . In the community of St. Michael 's he was equal to the best citizen . He was strictly temperate ; perhaps , from principle , but most likely , from interest . There was very little to do for him , to give him the appearance of piety , and to make him a pillar in the church . Well , the camp-meeting continued a week ; people gathered from all parts of the county , and two steamboat loads came from Baltimore . The ground was happily chosen ; seats were arranged ; a stand erected ; a rude altar fenced in , fronting the preachers ' stand , with straw in it for the accommodation of151 mourners . This latter would hold at least one hundred persons . In front , and on the sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , rose the first class of stately tents , each vieing with the other in strength , neatness , and capacity for accommodating its inmates . Behind this first circle of tents was another , less imposing , which reached round the camp-ground to the speakers ' stand . Outside this second class of tents were covered wagons , ox carts , and vehicles of every shape and size . These served as tents to their owners . Outside of these , huge fires were burning , in all directions , where roasting , and boiling , and frying , were going on , for the benefit of those who were attending to their own spiritual welfare within the circle . Behind the preachers ' stand , a narrow space was marked out for the use of the colored people . There were no seats provided for this class of persons ; the preachers addressed them , " over the left , " if they addressed them at all . After the preaching was over , at every service , an invitation was given to mourners to come into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to persuade men and women to come in . By one of these ministers , Master Thomas Auld was persuaded to go inside the pen . I was deeply interested in that matter , and followed ; and , though colored people were not allowed either in the pen or in front of the preachers ' stand , I ventured to take my stand at a sort of half-way place between the blacks and whites , where I could distinctly see the movements of mourners , and especially the progress of Master Thomas . " If he has got religion , " thought I , " he will emancipate his slaves ; and if he should not do so much as this , he will , at any rate , behave toward us more kindly , and feed us more generously than he has heretofore done . " Appealing to my own religious experience , and judging my master by what was true in my own case , I could not regard him as soundly converted , unless some such good results followed his profession of religion . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Thomas still . The fruits of his righteousness152 were to show themselves in no such way as I had anticipated . His conversion was not to change his relation toward men  --  at any rate not toward BLACK men  --  but toward God . My faith , I confess , was not great . There was something in his appearance that , in my mind , cast a doubt over his conversion . Standing where I did , I could see his every movement . I watched narrowly while he remained in the little pen ; and although I saw that his face was extremely red , and his hair disheveled , and though I heard him groan , and saw a stray tear halting on his cheek , as if inquiring " which way shall I go ? "  --  I could not wholly confide in the genuineness of his conversion . The hesitating behavior of that tear-drop and its loneliness , distressed me , and cast a doubt upon the whole transaction , of which it was a part . But people said , " Capt . Auld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hope for the best . I was bound to do this , in charity , for I , too , was religious , and had been in the church full three years , although now I was not more than sixteen years old . Slaveholders may , sometimes , have confidence in the piety of some of their slaves ; but the slaves seldom have confidence in the piety of their masters . " He cant go to heaven with our blood in his skirts , " is a settled point in the creed of every slave ; rising superior to all teaching to the contrary , and standing forever as a fixed fact . The highest evidence the slaveholder can give the slave of his acceptance with God , is the emancipation of his slaves . This is proof that he is willing to give up all to God , and for the sake of God . Not to do this , was , in my estimation , and in the opinion of all the slaves , an evidence of half-heartedness , and wholly inconsistent with the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Methodist Discipline , the following question and answer : " Question . What shall be done for the extirpation of slavery ? " Answer . We declare that we are much as ever convinced of the great evil of slavery ; therefore , no slaveholder shall be eligible to any official station in our church . " These words sounded in my ears for a long time , and153 encouraged me to hope . But , as I have before said , I was doomed to disappointment . Master Thomas seemed to be aware of my hopes and expectations concerning him . I have thought , before now , that he looked at me in answer to my glances , as much as to say , " I will teach you , young man , that , though I have parted with my sins , I have not parted with my sense . I shall hold my slaves , and go to heaven too . " Possibly , to convince us that we must not presume too much upon his recent conversion , he became rather more rigid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good nature about the man ; but now his whole countenance was soured over with the seemings of piety . His religion , therefore , neither made him emancipate his slaves , nor caused him to treat them with greater humanity . If religion had any effect on his character at all , it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways . The natural wickedness of his heart had not been removed , but only reinforced , by the profession of religion . Do I judge him harshly ? God forbid . Facts are facts . Capt . Auld made the greatest profession of piety . His house was , literally , a house of prayer . In the morning , and in the evening , loud prayers and hymns were heard there , in which both himself and his wife joined ; yet , no more meal was brought from the mill , no more attention was paid to the moral welfare of the kitchen ; and nothing was done to make us feel that the heart of Master Thomas was one whit better than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the preachers ' stand , on the camp ground . Our hopes ( founded on the discipline ) soon vanished ; for the authorities let him into the church at once , and before he was out of his term of probation , I heard of his leading class ! He distinguished himself greatly among the brethren , and was soon an exhorter . His progress was almost as rapid as the growth of the fabled vine of Jack 's bean . No man was more active than he , in revivals . He would go many miles to assist in carrying them on , and in getting outsiders interested in religion . His house being154 one of the holiest , if not the happiest in St. Michael 's , became the " preachers ' home . " These preachers evidently liked to share Master Thomas 's hospitality ; for while he starved us , he stuffed them . Three or four of these ambassadors of the gospel  --  according to slavery  --  have been there at a time ; all living on the fat of the land , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not often did we get a smile of recognition from these holy men . They seemed almost as unconcerned about our getting to heaven , as they were about our getting out of slavery . To this general charge there was one exception  --  the Rev. GEORGE COOKMAN . Unlike Rev. Messrs . Storks , Ewry , Hickey , Humphrey and Cooper ( all whom were on the St. Michael 's circuit ) he kindly took an interest in our temporal and spiritual welfare . Our souls and our bodies were all alike sacred in his sight ; and he really had a good deal of genuine anti-slavery feeling mingled with his colonization ideas . There was not a slave in our neighborhood that did not love , and almost venerate , Mr. Cookman . It was pretty generally believed that he had been chiefly instrumental in bringing one of the largest slaveholders  --  Mr. Samuel Harrison  --  in that neighborhood , to emancipate all his slaves , and , indeed , the general impression was , that Mr. Cookman had labored faithfully with slaveholders , whenever he met them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did this as a religious duty . When this good man was at our house , we were all sure to be called in to prayers in the morning ; and he was not slow in making inquiries as to the state of our minds , nor in giving us a word of exhortation and of encouragement . Great was the sorrow of all the slaves , when this faithful preacher of the gospel was removed from the Talbot county circuit . He was an eloquent preacher , and possessed what few ministers , south of Mason Dixon 's line , possess , or dare to show , viz : a warm and philanthropic heart . The Mr. Cookman , of whom I speak , was an Englishman by birth , and perished while on his way to England , on board the ill-fated " President " . Could the thousands of slaves155 in Maryland know the fate of the good man , to whose words of comfort they were so largely indebted , they would thank me for dropping a tear on this page , in memory of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me return to Master Thomas , and to my experience , after his conversion . In Baltimore , I could , occasionally , get into a Sabbath school , among the free children , and receive lessons , with the rest ; but , having already learned both to read and to write , I was more of a teacher than a pupil , even there . When , however , I went back to the Eastern Shore , and was at the house of Master Thomas , I was neither allowed to teach , nor to be taught . The whole community  --  with but a single exception , among the whites  --  frowned upon everything like imparting instruction either to slaves or to free colored persons . That single exception , a pious young man , named Wilson , asked me , one day , if I would like to assist him in teaching a little Sabbath school , at the house of a free colored man in St. Michael 's , named James Mitchell . The idea was to me a delightful one , and I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could command , to that most laudable work . Mr. Wilson soon mustered up a dozen old spelling books , and a few testaments ; and we commenced operations , with some twenty scholars , in our Sunday school . Here , thought I , is something worth living for ; here is an excellent chance for usefulness ; and I shall soon have a company of young friends , lovers of knowledge , like some of my Baltimore friends , from whom I now felt parted forever . Our first Sabbath passed delightfully , and I spent the week after very joyously . I could not go to Baltimore , but I could make a little Baltimore here . At our second meeting , I learned that there was some objection to the existence of the Sabbath school ; and , sure enough , we had scarcely got at work  --  good work , simply teaching a few colored children how to read the gospel of the Son of God  --  when in rushed a mob , headed by Mr. Wright Fairbanks and Mr. Garrison West  --  two class-leaders156 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other missiles , drove us off , and commanded us never to meet for such a purpose again . One of this pious crew told me , that as for my part , I wanted to be another Nat Turner ; and if I did not look out , I should get as many balls into me , as Nat did into him . Thus ended the infant Sabbath school , in the town of St. Michael 's . The reader will not be surprised when I say , that the breaking up of my Sabbath school , by these class-leaders , and professedly holy men , did not serve to strengthen my religious convictions . The cloud over my St. Michael 's home grew heavier and blacker than ever . It was not merely the agency of Master Thomas , in breaking up and destroying my Sabbath school , that shook my confidence in the power of southern religion to make men wiser or better ; but I saw in him all the cruelty and meanness , after his conversion , which he had exhibited before he made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed in his treatment of my unfortunate cousin , Henny , whose lameness made her a burden to him . I have no extraordinary personal hard usage toward myself to complain of , against him , but I have seen him tie up the lame and maimed woman , and whip her in a manner most brutal , and shocking ; and then , with blood-chilling blasphemy , he would quote the passage of scripture , " That servant which knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes . " Master would keep this lacerated woman tied up by her wrists , to a bolt in the joist , three , four and five hours at a time . He would tie her up early in the morning , whip her with a cowskin before breakfast ; leave her tied up ; go to his store , and , returning to his dinner , repeat the castigation ; laying on the rugged lash , on flesh already made raw by repeated blows . He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , at any rate , off his hands . In proof of this , he afterwards gave her away to his sister Sarah ( Mrs. Cline ) but , as in the case of Master157 Hugh , Henny was soon returned on his hands . Finally , upon a pretense that he could do nothing with her ( I use his own words ) he " set her adrift , to take care of herself . " Here was a recently converted man , holding , with tight grasp , the well-framed , and able bodied slaves left him by old master  --  the persons , who , in freedom , could have taken care of themselves ; yet , turning loose the only cripple among them , virtually to starve and die . No doubt , had Master Thomas been asked , by some pious northern brother , why he continued to sustain the relation of a slaveholder , to those whom he retained , his answer would have been precisely the same as many other religious slaveholders have returned to that inquiry , viz : " I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my condition was when I lived with Master Thomas , I was soon to experience a life far more goading and bitter . The many differences springing up between myself and Master Thomas , owing to the clear perception I had of his character , and the boldness with which I defended myself against his capricious complaints , led him to declare that I was unsuited to his wants ; that my city life had affected me perniciously ; that , in fact , it had almost ruined me for every good purpose , and had fitted me for everything that was bad . One of my greatest faults , or offenses , was that of letting his horse get away , and go down to the farm belonging to his father-in-law . The animal had a liking for that farm , with which I fully sympathized . Whenever I let it out , it would go dashing down the road to Mr. Hamilton 's , as if going on a grand frolic . My horse gone , of course I must go after it . The explanation of our mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found there good pasturage , and I found there plenty of bread . Mr. Hamilton had his faults , but starving his slaves was not among them . He gave food , in abundance , and that , too , of an excellent quality . In Mr. Hamilton 's cook  --  Aunt Mary  --  I found a most generous and considerate friend . She never allowed me to go there without giving me bread enough158 to make good the deficiencies of a day or two . Master Thomas at last resolved to endure my behavior no longer ; he could neither keep me , nor his horse , we liked so well to be at his father-in-law 's farm . I had now lived with him nearly nine months , and he had given me a number of severe whippings , without any visible improvement in my character , or my conduct ; and now he was resolved to put me out  --  as he said  --  " to be broken . " There was , in the Bay Side , very near the camp ground , where my master got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who enjoyed the execrated reputation , of being a first rate hand at breaking young Negroes . This Covey was a poor man , a farm renter ; and this reputation ( hateful as it was to the slaves and to all good men ) was , at the same time , of immense advantage to him . It enabled him to get his farm tilled with very little expense , compared with what it would have cost him without this most extraordinary reputation . Some slaveholders thought it an advantage to let Mr. Covey have the government of their slaves a year or two , almost free of charge , for the sake of the excellent training such slaves got under his happy management ! Like some horse breakers , noted for their skill , who ride the best horses in the country without expense , Mr. Covey could have under him , the most fiery bloods of the neighborhood , for the simple reward of returning them to their owners , well broken . Added to the natural fitness of Mr. Covey for the duties of his profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as strict in the cultivation of piety , as he was in the cultivation of his farm . I was made aware of his character by some who had been under his hand ; and while I could not look forward to going to him with any pleasure , I was glad to get away from St. Michael 's . I was sure of getting enough to eat at Covey 's , even if I suffered in other respects . This , to a hungry man , is not a prospect to be regarded with indifference . CHAPTER XV .

The morning of the first of January , 1834 , with its chilling wind and pinching frost , quite in harmony with the winter in my own mind , found me , with my little bundle of clothing on the end of a stick , swung across my shoulder , on the main road , bending my way toward Covey 's , whither I had been imperiously ordered by Master Thomas . The latter had been as good as his word , and had committed me , without reserve , to the mastery of Mr. Edward Covey . Eight or ten years had now passed since I had been taken from my grandmother 's cabin , in Tuckahoe ; and these years , for the most part , I had spent in Baltimore , where  --  as the reader has already seen  --  I was treated with comparative tenderness . I was now about to sound profounder depths in slave life . The rigors of a field , less tolerable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master was notorious for his fierce and savage disposition , and my only consolation in going to live160 with him was , the certainty of finding him precisely as represented by common fame . There was neither joy in my heart , nor elasticity in my step , as I started in search of the tyrant 's home . Starvation made me glad to leave Thomas Auld 's , and the cruel lash made me dread to go to Covey 's . Escape was impossible ; so , heavy and sad , I paced the seven miles , which separated Covey 's house from St. Michael 's  --  thinking much by the solitary way  --  averse to my condition ; but thinking was all I could do . Like a fish in a net , allowed to play for a time , I was now drawn rapidly to the shore , secured at all points . " I am , " thought I , " but the sport of a power which makes no account , either of my welfare or of my happiness . By a law which I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ruthlessly snatched from the hearth of a fond grandmother , and hurried away to the home of a mysterious ' old master ; ' again I am removed from there , to a master in Baltimore ; thence am I snatched away to the Eastern Shore , to be valued with the beasts of the field , and , with them , divided and set apart for a possessor ; then I am sent back to Baltimore ; and by the time I have formed new attachments , and have begun to hope that no more rude shocks shall touch me , a difference arises between brothers , and I am again broken up , and sent to St. Michael 's ; and now , from the latter place , I am footing my way to the home of a new master , where , I am given to understand , that , like a wild young working animal , I am to be broken to the yoke of a bitter and life-long bondage . " With thoughts and reflections like these , I came in sight of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , which , from the description I had received , at starting , I easily recognized as my new home . The Chesapeake bay  --  upon the jutting banks of which the little wood-colored house was standing  --  white with foam , raised by the heavy north-west wind ; Poplar Island , covered with a thick , black pine forest , standing out amid this half ocean ; and Kent Point , stretching its sandy , desert-like shores out into the foam-cested bay  --  were all in161 sight , and deepened the wild and desolate aspect of my new home . The good clothes I had brought with me from Baltimore were now worn thin , and had not been replaced ; for Master Thomas was as little careful to provide us against cold , as against hunger . Met here by a north wind , sweeping through an open space of forty miles , I was glad to make any port ; and , therefore , I speedily pressed on to the little wood-colored house . The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Covey ; Miss Kemp ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes , cousin to Edward Covey ; Caroline , the cook ; Bill Smith , a hired man ; and myself . Bill Smith , Bill Hughes , and myself , were the working force of the farm , which consisted of three or four hundred acres . I was now , for the first time in my life , to be a field hand ; and in my new employment I found myself even more awkward than a green country boy may be supposed to be , upon his first entrance into the bewildering scenes of city life ; and my awkwardness gave me much trouble . Strange and unnatural as it may seem , I had been at my new home but three days , before Mr. Covey ( my brother in the Methodist church ) gave me a bitter foretaste of what was in reserve for me . I presume he thought , that since he had but a single year in which to complete his work , the sooner he began , the better . Perhaps he thought that by coming to blows at once , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive , direct or indirect , the cause may be referred , I had not been in his possession three whole days , before he subjected me to a most brutal chastisement . Under his heavy blows , blood flowed freely , and wales were left on my back as large as my little finger . The sores on my back , from this flogging , continued for weeks , for they were kept open by the rough and coarse cloth which I wore for shirting . The occasion and details of this first chapter of my experience as a field hand , must be told , that the reader may see how unreasonable , as well as how cruel , my new master , Covey , was. 162 The whole thing I found to be characteristic of the man ; and I was probably treated no worse by him than scores of lads who had previously been committed to him , for reasons similar to those which induced my master to place me with him . But , here are the facts connected with the affair , precisely as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole month of January , 1834 , I was ordered , at day break , to get a load of wood , from a forest about two miles from the house . In order to perform this work , Mr. Covey gave me a pair of unbroken oxen , for , it seems , his breaking abilities had not been turned in this direction ; and I may remark , in passing , that working animals in the south , are seldom so well trained as in the north . In due form , and with all proper ceremony , I was introduced to this huge yoke of unbroken oxen , and was carefully told which was " Buck , " and which was " Darby "  --  which was the " in hand , " and which was the " off hand " ox . The master of this important ceremony was no less a person than Mr. Covey , himself ; and the introduction was the first of the kind I had ever had . My life , hitherto , had led me away from horned cattle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What was meant by the " in ox , " as against the " off ox , " when both were equally fastened to one cart , and under one yoke , I could not very easily divine ; and the difference , implied by the names , and the peculiar duties of each , were alike Greek to me . Why was not the " off ox " called the " in ox ? " Where and what is the reason for this distinction in names , when there is none in the things themselves ? After initiating me into the " woa , " " back " " gee , " " hither "  --  the entire spoken language between oxen and driver  --  Mr. Covey took a rope , about ten feet long and one inch thick , and placed one end of it around the horns of the " in hand ox , " and gave the other end to me , telling me that if the oxen started to run away , as the scamp knew they would , I must hold on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who is acquainted with either the strength of the disposition of an untamed ox , that this order163 was about as unreasonable as a command to shoulder a mad bull ! I had never driven oxen before , and I was as awkward , as a driver , as it is possible to conceive . It did not answer for me to plead ignorance , to Mr. Covey ; there was something in his manner that quite forbade that . He was a man to whom a slave seldom felt any disposition to speak . Cold , distant , morose , with a face wearing all the marks of captious pride and malicious sternness , he repelled all advances . Covey was not a large man ; he was only about five feet ten inches in height , I should think ; short necked , round shoulders ; of quick and wiry motion , of thin and wolfish visage ; with a pair of small , greenish-gray eyes , set well back under a forehead without dignity , and constantly in motion , and floating his passions , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in words . The creature presented an appearance altogether ferocious and sinister , disagreeable and forbidding , in the extreme . When he spoke , it was from the corner of his mouth , and in a sort of light growl , like a dog , when an attempt is made to take a bone from him . The fellow had already made me believe him even worse than he had been presented . With his directions , and without stopping to question , I started for the woods , quite anxious to perform my first exploit in driving , in a creditable manner . The distance from the house to the woods gate a full mile , I should think  --  was passed over with very little difficulty ; for although the animals ran , I was fleet enough , in the open field , to keep pace with them ; especially as they pulled me along at the end of the rope ; but , on reaching the woods , I was speedily thrown into a distressing plight . The animals took fright , and started off ferociously into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against trees , over stumps , and dashing from side to side , in a manner altogether frightful . As I held the rope , I expected every moment to be crushed between the cart and the huge trees , among which they were so furiously dashing . After running thus for several minutes , my oxen were , finally , brought to a stand , by a tree , against which they dashed 164 themselves with great violence , upsetting the cart , and entangling themselves among sundry young saplings . By the shock , the body of the cart was flung in one direction , and the wheels and tongue in another , and all in the greatest confusion . There I was , all alone , in a thick wood , to which I was a stranger ; my cart upset and shattered ; my oxen entangled , wild , and enraged ; and I , poor soul ! but a green hand , to set all this disorder right . I knew no more of oxen than the ox driver is supposed to know of wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not without a presentiment that this trouble would draw after it others , even more distressing , I took one end of the cart body , and , by an extra outlay of strength , I lifted it toward the axle-tree , from which it had been violently flung ; and after much pulling and straining , I succeeded in getting the body of the cart in its place . This was an important step out of the difficulty , and its performance increased my courage for the work which remained to be done . The cart was provided with an ax , a tool with which I had become pretty well acquainted in the ship yard at Baltimore . With this , I cut down the saplings by which my oxen were entangled , and again pursued my journey , with my heart in my mouth , lest the oxen should again take it into their senseless heads to cut up a caper . My fears were groundless . Their spree was over for the present , and the rascals now moved off as soberly as though their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the forest where I had been , the day before , chopping wood , I filled the cart with a heavy load , as a security against another running away . But , the neck of an ox is equal in strength to iron . It defies all ordinary burdens , when excited . Tame and docile to a proverb , when well trained , the ox is the most sullen and intractable of animals when but half broken to the yoke . I now saw , in my situation , several points of similarity with that of the oxen . They were property , so was I ; they were to be165 broken , so was I. Covey was to break me , I was to break them ; break and be broken  --  such is life . Half the day already gone , and my face not yet homeward ! It required only two day 's experience and observation to teach me , that such apparent waste of time would not be lightly overlooked by Covey . I therefore hurried toward home ; but , on reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day . This gate was a fair specimen of southern handicraft . There were two huge posts , eighteen inches in diameter , rough hewed and square , and the heavy gate was so hung on one of these , that it opened only about half the proper distance . On arriving here , it was necessary for me to let go the end of the rope on the horns of the " in hand ox ; " and now as soon as the gate was open , and I let go of it to get the rope , again , off went my oxen  --  making nothing of their load  --  full tilt ; and in doing so they caught the huge gate between the wheel and the cart body , literally crushing it to splinters , and coming only within a few inches of subjecting me to a similar crushing , for I was just in advance of the wheel when it struck the left gate post . With these two hair-breadth escape , I thought I could sucessfully(sic) explain to Mr. Covey the delay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of being commended for the stern resolution which I had displayed in accomplishing the difficult task  --  a task which , I afterwards learned , even Covey himself would not have undertaken , without first driving the oxen for some time in the open field , preparatory to their going into the woods . But , in this I was disappointed . On coming to him , his countenance assumed an aspect of rigid displeasure , and , as I gave him a history of the casualties of my trip , his wolfish face , with his greenish eyes , became intensely ferocious . " Go back to the woods again , " he said , muttering something else about wasting time . I hastily obeyed ; but I had not gone far on my way , when I saw him coming after me . My oxen now behaved themselves with singular166 propriety , opposing their present conduct to my representation of their former antics . I almost wished , now that Covey was coming , they would do something in keeping with the character I had given them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they could afford now to be extra good , readily obeying my orders , and seeming to understand them quite as well as I did myself . On reaching the woods , my tormentor  --  who seemed all the way to be remarking upon the good behavior of his oxen  --  came up to me , and ordered me to stop the cart , accompanying the same with the threat that he would now teach me how to break gates , and idle away my time , when he sent me to the woods . Suiting the action to the word , Covey paced off , in his own wiry fashion , to a large , black gum tree , the young shoots of which are generally used for ox goads , they being exceedingly tough . Three of these goads , from four to six feet long , he cut off , and trimmed up , with his large jack-knife . This done , he ordered me to take off my clothes . To this unreasonable order I made no reply , but sternly refused to take off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I , " you shall do so over my clothes . " After many threats , which made no impression on me , he rushed at me with something of the savage fierceness of a wolf , tore off the few and thinly worn clothes I had on , and proceeded to wear out , on my back , the heavy goads which he had cut from the gum tree . This flogging was the first of a series of floggings ; and though very severe , it was less so than many which came after it , and these , for offenses far lighter than the gate breaking . I remained with Mr. Covey one year ( I can not say I lived with him ) and during the first six months that I was there , I was whipped , either with sticks or cowskins , every week . Aching bones and a sore back were my constant companions . Frequent as the lash was used , Mr. Covey thought less of it , as a means of breaking down my spirit , than that of hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of my powers of endurance . From the dawn of day in the morning , till the darkness167 was complete in the evening , I was kept at hard work , in the field or the woods . At certain seasons of the year , we were all kept in the field till eleven and twelve o'clock at night . At these times , Covey would attend us in the field , and urge us on with words or blows , as it seemed best to him . He had , in his life , been an overseer , and he well understood the business of slave driving . There was no deceiving him . He knew just what a man or boy could do , and he held both to strict account . When he pleased , he would work himself , like a very Turk , making everything fly before him . It was , however , scarcely necessary for Mr. Covey to be really present in the field , to have his work go on industriously . He had the faculty of making us feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adroitly managed surprises , which he practiced , I was prepared to expect him at any moment . His plan was , never to approach the spot where his hands were at work , in an open , manly and direct manner . No thief was ever more artful in his devices than this man Covey . He would creep and crawl , in ditches and gullies ; hide behind stumps and bushes , and practice so much of the cunning of the serpent , that Bill Smith and I  --  between ourselves  --  never called him by any other name than " the snake . " We fancied that in his eyes and his gait we could see a snakish resemblance . One half of his proficiency in the art of Negro breaking , consisted , I should think , in this species of cunning . We were never secure . He could see or hear us nearly all the time . He was , to us , behind every stump , tree , bush and fence on the plantation . He carried this kind of trickery so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he was going to St. Michael 's ; and , in thirty minutes afterward , you might find his horse tied in the woods , and the snake-like Covey lying flat in the ditch , with his head lifted above its edge , or in a fence corner , watching every movement of the slaves ! I have known him walk up to us and give us special orders , as to our work , in advance , as if he were leaving home with a view to being absent several days ; and before he got half way to the168 house , he would avail himself of our inattention to his movements , to turn short on his heels , conceal himself behind a fence corner or a tree , and watch us until the going down of the sun . Mean and contemptible as is all this , it is in keeping with the character which the life of a slaveholder is calculated to produce . There is no earthly inducement , in the slave 's condition , to incite him to labor faithfully . The fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with him . Knowing this fact , as the slaveholder does , and judging the slave by himself , he naturally concludes the slave will be idle whenever the cause for this fear is absent . Hence , all sorts of petty deceptions are practiced , to inspire this fear . But , with Mr. Covey , trickery was natural . Everything in the shape of learning or religion , which he possessed , was made to conform to this semi-lying propensity . He did not seem conscious that the practice had anything unmanly , base or contemptible about it . It was a part of an important system , with him , essential to the relation of master and slave . I thought I saw , in his very religious devotions , this controlling element of his character . A long prayer at night made up for the short prayer in the morning ; and few men could seem more devotional than he , when he had nothing else to do . Mr. Covey was not content with the cold style of family worship , adopted in these cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ! the voice of praise , as well as of prayer , must be heard in his house , night and morning . At first , I was called upon to bear some part in these exercises ; but the repeated flogging given me by Covey , turned the whole thing into mockery . He was a poor singer , and mainly relied on me for raising the hymn for the family , and when I failed to do so , he was thrown into much confusion . I do not think that he ever abused me on account of these vexations . His religion was a thing altogether apart from his worldly concerns . He knew nothing of it as a holy principle , directing and controlling his daily life , 169 making the latter conform to the requirements of the gospel . One or two facts will illustrate his character better than a volume of generalties(sic) . I have already said , or implied , that Mr. Edward Covey was a poor man . He was , in fact , just commencing to lay the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . The first condition of wealth and respectability there , being the ownership of human property , every nerve is strained , by the poor man , to obtain it , and very little regard is had to the manner of obtaining it . In pursuit of this object , pious as Mr. Covey was , he proved himself to be as unscrupulous and base as the worst of his neighbors . In the beginning , he was only able  --  as he said  --  " to buy one slave ; " and , scandalous and shocking as is the fact , he boasted that he bought her simply " as a breeder . " But the worst is not told in this naked statement . This young woman ( Caroline was her name ) was virtually compelled by Mr. Covey to abandon herself to the object for which he had purchased her ; and the result was , the birth of twins at the end of the year . At this addition to his human stock , both Edward Covey and his wife , Susan , were ecstatic with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of finding fault with the hired man  --  Bill Smith  --  the father of the children , for Mr. Covey himself had locked the two up together every night , thus inviting the result . But I will pursue this revolting subject no further . No better illustration of the unchaste and demoralizing character of slavery can be found , than is furnished in the fact that this professedly Christian slaveholder , amidst all his prayers and hymns , was shamelessly and boastfully encouraging , and actually compelling , in his own house , undisguised and unmitigated fornication , as a means of increasing his human stock . I may remark here , that , while this fact will be read with disgust and shame at the north , it will be laughed at , as smart and praiseworthy in Mr. Covey , at the south ; for a man is no more condemned there for buying a woman and devoting her to this life of dishonor , 170 than for buying a cow , and raising stock from her . The same rules are observed , with a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of the latter . I will here reproduce what I said of my own experience in this wretched place , more than ten years ago : If at any one time of my life , more than another , I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery , that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey . We were worked all weathers . It was never too hot or too cold ; it could never rain , blow , snow , or hail too hard for us to work in the field . Work , work , work , was scarcely more the order of the day than the night . The longest days were too short for him , and the shortest nights were too long for him . I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there ; but a few months of his discipline tamed me . Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me . I was broken in body , soul and spirit . My natural elasticity was crushed ; my intellect languished ; the disposition to read departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me ; and behold a man transformed into a brute ! Sunday was my only leisure time . I spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor , between sleep and wake , under some large tree . At times , I would rise up , a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul , accompanied with a faint beam of hope , flickered for a moment , and then vanished . I sank down again , mourning over my wretched condition . I was sometimes prompted to take my life , and that of Covey , but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear . My sufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality . Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake bay , whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe . Those beautiful vessels , robed in purest white , so delightful to the eye of freemen , were to me so many shrouded ghosts , to terrify and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have often , in the deep stillness of a summer 's Sabbath , stood all alone upon the banks of that noble bay , and traced , with saddened heart and tearful eye , the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean . The sight of these always affected me powerfully . My thoughts would compel utterance ; and there , with no audience but the Almighty , I would pour out my soul 's complaint in my rude way , with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships : " You are loosed from your moorings , and free ; I am fast in my chains , and am a slave ! You move merrily before the gentle gale , and I sadly before the bloody whip ! You are freedom 's swift-winged angels , that fly around the world ; I am confined in bands of iron ! O , that I were free ! O , that I were on one of your gallant decks , and under your protecting wing ! Alas ! betwixt me171 and you the turbid waters roll . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ! Could I but swim ! If I could fly ! O , why was I born a man , of whom to make a brute ! The glad ship is gone ; she hides in the dim distance . I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery . O God , save me ! God , deliver me ! Let me be free ! Is there any God ? Why am I a slave ? I will run away . I will not stand it . Get caught , or get clear , I 'll try it . I had as well die with ague as with fever . I have only one life to lose . I had as well be killed running as die standing . Only think of it ; one hundred miles straight north , and I am free ! Try it ? Yes ! God helping me , I will . It can not be that I shall live and die a slave . I will take to the water . This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do the same ; and when I get to the head of the bay , I will turn my canoe adrift , and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania . When I get there , I shall not be required to have a pass ; I will travel without being disturbed . Let but the first opportunity offer , and come what will , I am off . Meanwhile , I will try to bear up under the yoke . I am not the only slave in the world . Why should I fret ? I can bear as much as any of them . Besides , I am but a boy , and all boys are bound to some one . It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free . There is a better day coming . " I shall never be able to narrate the mental experience through which it was my lot to pass during my stay at Covey 's . I was completely wrecked , changed and bewildered ; goaded almost to madness at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything in the way of kindness , which I had experienced at Baltimore ; all my former hopes and aspirations for usefulness in the world , and the happy moments spent in the exercises of religion , contrasted with my then present lot , but increased my anguish . I suffered bodily as well as mentally . I had neither sufficient time in which to eat or to sleep , except on Sundays . The overwork , and the brutal chastisements of which I was the victim , combined with that ever-gnawing and soul-devouring thought  --  " I am a slave  --  a slave for life  --  a slave with no rational ground to hope for freedom "  --  rendered me a living embodiment of mental and physical wretchedness .

The foregoing chapter , with all its horrid incidents and shocking features , may be taken as a fair representation of the first six months of my life at Covey 's . The reader has but to repeat , in his own mind , once a week , the scene in the woods , where Covey subjected me to his merciless lash , to have a true idea of my bitter experience there , during the first period of the breaking process through which Mr. Covey carried me . I have no heart to repeat each separate transaction , in which I was victim of his violence and brutality . Such a narration would fill a volume much larger than the present one . I aim only to give the reader a truthful impression of my slave life , without unnecessarily affecting him with harrowing details . As I have elsewhere intimated that my hardships were much greater during the first six months of my stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as the change in my condition was owing to causes which may help the reader to a better understanding of human nature , when subjected to the terrible extremities of slavery , I will narrate the circumstances of this173 change , although I may seem thereby to applaud my own courage . You have , dear reader , seen me humbled , degraded , broken down , enslaved , and brutalized , and you understand how it was done ; now let us see the converse of all this , and how it was brought about ; and this will take us through the year 1834 . On one of the hottest days of the month of August , of the year just mentioned , had the reader been passing through Covey 's farm , he might have seen me at work , in what is there called the " treading yard "  --  a yard upon which wheat is trodden out from the straw , by the horses ' feet . I was there , at work , feeding the " fan , " or rather bringing wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our force consisted of Bill Hughes , Bill Smith , and a slave by the name of Eli ; the latter having been hired for this occasion . The work was simple , and required strength and activity , rather than any skill or intelligence , and yet , to one entirely unused to such work , it came very hard . The heat was intense and overpowering , and there was much hurry to get the wheat , trodden out that day , through the fan ; since , if that work was done an hour before sundown , the hands would have , according to a promise of Covey , that hour added to their night 's rest . I was not behind any of them in the wish to complete the day 's work before sundown , and , hence , I struggled with all my might to get the work forward . The promise of one hour 's repose on a week day , was sufficient to quicken my pace , and to spur me on to extra endeavor . Besides , we had all planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in that . But I was disappointed , and the day turned out to be one of the bitterest I ever experienced . About three o'clock , while the sun was pouring down his burning rays , and not a breeze was stirring , I broke down ; my strength failed me ; I was seized with a violent aching of the head , attended with extreme dizziness , and trembling in every limb . Finding what was coming , and feeling it would never do to stop work , I nerved myself up , and staggered on until I fell by the side of the wheat fan , feeling that the earth had fallen174 upon me . This brought the entire work to a dead stand . There was work for four ; each one had his part to perform , and each part depended on the other , so that when one stopped , all were compelled to stop . Covey , who had now become my dread , as well as my tormentor , was at the house , about a hundred yards from where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he came down to the treading yard , to inquire into the cause of our stopping . Bill Smith told him I was sick , and that I was unable longer to bring wheat to the fan . I had , by this time , crawled away , under the side of a post-and-rail fence , in the shade , and was exceeding ill . The intense heat of the sun , the heavy dust rising from the fan , the stooping , to take up the wheat from the yard , together with the hurrying , to get through , had caused a rush of blood to my head . In this condition , Covey finding out where I was , came to me ; and , after standing over me a while , he asked me what the matter was . I told him as well as I could , for it was with difficulty that I could speak . He then gave me a savage kick in the side , which jarred my whole frame , and commanded me to get up . The man had obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do any possible thing , I should , in my then state of mind , have endeavored to comply . I made an effort to rise , but fell back in the attempt , before gaining my feet . The brute now gave me another heavy kick , and again told me to rise . I again tried to rise , and succeeded in gaining my feet ; but upon stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan , I again staggered and fell to the ground ; and I must have so fallen , had I been sure that a hundred bullets would have pierced me , as the consequence . While down , in this sad condition , and perfectly helpless , the merciless Negro breaker took up the hickory slab , with which Hughes had been striking off the wheat to a level with the sides of the half bushel measure ( a very hard weapon ) and with the sharp edge of it , he dealt me a heavy blow on my head which made a large gash , and caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , " If you have got the headache , I 'll cure you . " This done , he ordered me again to rise , but I made no effort to do so ; for I had made up my mind that it was useless , and that the heartless monster might now do his worst ; he could but kill me , and that might put me out of my misery . Finding me unable to rise , or rather despairing of my doing so , Covey left me , with a view to getting on with the work without me . I was bleeding very freely , and my face was soon covered with my warm blood . Cruel and merciless as was the motive that dealt that blow , dear reader , the wound was fortunate for me . Bleeding was never more efficacious . The pain in my head speedily abated , and I was soon able to rise . Covey had , as I have said , now left me to my fate ; and the question was , shall I return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Michael 's , and make Capt . Auld acquainted with the atrocious cruelty of his brother Covey , and beseech him to get me another master ? Remembering the object he had in view , in placing me under the management of Covey , and further , his cruel treatment of my poor crippled cousin , Henny , and his meanness in the matter of feeding and clothing his slaves , there was little ground to hope for a favorable reception at the hands of Capt . Thomas Auld . Nevertheless , I resolved to go straight to Capt . Auld , thinking that , if not animated by motives of humanity , he might be induced to interfere on my behalf from selfish considerations . " He can not , " thought I , " allow his property to be thus bruised and battered , marred and defaced ; and I will go to him , and tell him the simple truth about the matter . " In order to get to St. Michael 's , by the most favorable and direct road , I must walk seven miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no easy performance . I had already lost much blood ; I was exhausted by over exertion ; my sides were sore from the heavy blows planted there by the stout boots of Mr. Covey ; and I was , in every way , in an unfavorable plight for the journey . I however watched my chance , while the cruel and cunning Covey was looking in an opposite direction , and started176 off , across the field , for St. Michael 's . This was a daring step ; if it failed , it would only exasperate Covey , and increase the rigors of my bondage , during the remainder of my term of service under him ; but the step was taken , and I must go forward . I succeeded in getting nearly half way across the broad field , toward the woods , before Mr. Covey observed me . I was still bleeding , and the exertion of running had started the blood afresh . " Come back ! Come back ! " vociferated Covey , with threats of what he would do if I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats , I pressed on toward the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow . Seeing no signs of my stopping , Covey caused his horse to be brought out and saddled , as if he intended to pursue me . The race was now to be an unequal one ; and , thinking I might be overhauled by him , if I kept the main road , I walked nearly the whole distance in the woods , keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection and pursuit . But , I had not gone far , before my little strength again failed me , and I laid down . The blood was still oozing from the wound in my head ; and , for a time , I suffered more than I can describe . There I was , in the deep woods , sick and emaciated , pursued by a wretch whose character for revolting cruelty beggars all opprobrious speech  --  bleeding , and almost bloodless . I was not without the fear of bleeding to death . The thought of dying in the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buzzards , had not yet been rendered tolerable by my many troubles and hardships , and I was glad when the shade of the trees , and the cool evening breeze , combined with my matted hair to stop the flow of blood . After lying there about three quarters of an hour , brooding over the singular and mournful lot to which I was doomed , my mind passing over the whole scale or circle of belief and unbelief , from faith in the overruling providence of God , to the blackest atheism , I again took up my journey toward St. Michael 's , more weary and sad than in the morning when I left Thomas Auld 's for the home of Mr. Covey . I was bare-footed and bare-headed , and in177 my shirt sleeves . The way was through bogs and briers , and I tore my feet often during the journey . I was full five hours in going the seven or eight miles ; partly , because of the difficulties of the way , and partly , because of the feebleness induced by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my master 's store , I presented an appearance of wretchedness and woe , fitted to move any but a heart of stone . From the crown of my head to the sole of my feet , there were marks of blood . My hair was all clotted with dust and blood , and the back of my shirt was literally stiff with the same . Briers and thorns had scarred and torn my feet and legs , leaving blood marks there . Had I escaped from a den of tigers , I could not have looked worse than I did on reaching St. Michael 's . In this unhappy plight , I appeared before my professedly Christian master , humbly to invoke the interposition of his power and authority , to protect me from further abuse and violence . I had begun to hope , during the latter part of my tedious journey toward St. Michael 's , that Capt . Auld would now show himself in a nobler light than I had ever before seen him . I was disappointed . I had jumped from a sinking ship into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something worse . I told him all the circumstances , as well as I could ; how I was endeavoring to please Covey ; how hard I was at work in the present instance ; how unwilling I sunk down under the heat , toil and pain ; the brutal manner in which Covey had kicked me in the side ; the gash cut in my head ; my hesitation about troubling him ( Capt . Auld ) with complaints ; but , that now I felt it would not be best longer to conceal from him the outrages committed on me from time to time by Covey . At first , master Thomas seemed somewhat affected by the story of my wrongs , but he soon repressed his feelings and became cold as iron . It was impossible  --  as I stood before him at the first  --  for him to seem indifferent . I distinctly saw his human nature asserting its conviction against the slave system , which made cases like mine possible ; but , as I have said , humanity fell before the systematic tyranny of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my story , and the sad spectacle I presented ; but , presently , it was his turn to talk . He began moderately , by finding excuses for Covey , and ending with a full justification of him , and a passionate condemnation of me . " He had no doubt I deserved the flogging . He did not believe I was sick ; I was only endeavoring to get rid of work . My dizziness was laziness , and Covey did right to flog me , as he had done . " After thus fairly annihilating me , and rousing himself by his own eloquence , he fiercely demanded what I wished him to do in the case ! With such a complete knock-down to all my hopes , as he had given me , and feeling , as I did , my entire subjection to his power , I had very little heart to reply . I must not affirm my innocence of the allegations which he had piled up against me ; for that would be impudence , and would probably call down fresh violence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave is always , and everywhere , presumed ; and the innocence of the slaveholder or the slave employer , is always asserted . The word of the slave , against this presumption , is generally treated as impudence , worthy of punishment . " Do you contradict me , you rascal ? " is a final silencer of counter statements from the lips of a slave . Calming down a little in view of my silence and hesitation , and , perhaps , from a rapid glance at the picture of misery I presented , he inquired again , " what I would have him do ? " Thus invited a second time , I told Master Thomas I wished him to allow me to get a new home and to find a new master ; that , as sure as I went back to live with Mr. Covey again , I should be killed by him ; that he would never forgive my coming to him ( Capt . Auld ) with a complaint against him ( Covey ) ; that , since I had lived with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would ruin me for future service ; that my life was not safe in his hands . This , Master Thomas ( my brother in the church ) regarded as " nonsence(sic) . " " There was no danger of Mr. Covey 's killing me ; he was a good man , industrious and religious , and he would not think of179 removing me from that home ; besides , " said he and this I found was the most distressing thought of all to him  --  " if you should leave Covey now , that your year has but half expired , I should lose your wages for the entire year . You belong to Mr. Covey for one year , and you must go back to him , come what will . You must not trouble me with any more stories about Mr. Covey ; and if you do not go immediately home , I will get hold of you myself . " This was just what I expected , when I found he had prejudged the case against me . " But , Sir , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not get home to-night . " At this , he again relented , and finally he allowed me to remain all night at St. Michael 's ; but said I must be off early in the morning , and concluded his directions by making me swallow a huge dose of epsom salts  --  about the only medicine ever administered to slaves . It was quite natural for Master Thomas to presume I was feigning sickness to escape work , for he probably thought that were he in the place of a slave with no wages for his work , no praise for well doing , no motive for toil but the lash  --  he would try every possible scheme by which to escape labor . I say I have no doubt of this ; the reason is , that there are not , under the whole heavens , a set of men who cultivate such an intense dread of labor as do the slaveholders . The charge of laziness against the slave is ever on their lips , and is the standing apology for every species of cruelty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they , themselves , will not move them with one of their fingers . " My kind readers shall have , in the next chapter  --  what they were led , perhaps , to expect to find in this  --  namely : an account of my partial disenthrallment from the tyranny of Covey , and the marked change which it brought about . CHAPTER XVII . The Last Flogging A SLEEPLESS NIGHT  --  RETURN TO COVEY 'S  --  PURSUED BY COVEY  --  THE CHASE DEFEATED  --  VENGEANCE POSTPONED  --  MUSINGS IN THE WOODS  --  THE ALTERNATIVE  --  DEPLORABLE SPECTACLE  --  NIGHT IN THE WOODS  --  EXPECTED ATTACK  --  ACCOSTED BY SANDY , A FRIEND , NOT A HUNTER  --  SANDY 'S HOSPITALITY  --  THE " ASH CAKE " SUPPER  --  THE INTERVIEW WITH SANDY  --  HIS ADVICE  --  SANDY A CONJURER AS WELL AS A CHRISTIAN  --  THE MAGIC ROOT  --  STRANGE MEETING WITH COVEY  --  HIS MANNER  --  COVEY 'S SUNDAY FACE  --  MY DEFENSIVE RESOLVE  --  THE FIGHT  --  THE VICTORY , AND ITS RESULTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weary in body , and the broken in spirit ; especially when past troubles only foreshadow coming disasters . The last hope had been extinguished . My master , who I did not venture to hope would protect me as a man , had even now refused to protect me as his property ; and had cast me back , covered with reproaches and bruises , into the hands of a stranger to that mercy which was the soul of the religion he professed . May the reader never spend such a night as that allotted to me , previous to the morning which was to herald my return to the den of horrors from which I had made a temporary escape . I remained all night  --  sleep I did not  --  at St. Michael 's ; and in the morning ( Saturday ) I started off , according to the order of Master Thomas , feeling that I had no friend on earth , and doubting if I had one in heaven . I reached Covey 's about nine o'clock ; and just as I stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covey , true to his snakish habits , darted out at me181 from a fence corner , in which he had secreted himself , for the purpose of securing me . He was amply provided with a cowskin and a rope ; and he evidently intended to tie me up , and to wreak his vengeance on me to the fullest extent . I should have been an easy prey , had he succeeded in getting his hands upon me , for I had taken no refreshment since noon on Friday ; and this , together with the pelting , excitement , and the loss of blood , had reduced my strength . I , however , darted back into the woods , before the ferocious hound could get hold of me , and buried myself in a thicket , where he lost sight of me . The corn-field afforded me cover , in getting to the woods . But for the tall corn , Covey would have overtaken me , and made me his captive . He seemed very much chagrined that he did not catch me , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his angry movements , toward the house from which he had sallied , on his foray . Well , now I am clear of Covey , and of his wrathful lash , for present . I am in the wood , buried in its somber gloom , and hushed in its solemn silence ; hid from all human eyes ; shut in with nature and nature 's God , and absent from all human contrivances . Here was a good place to pray ; to pray for help for deliverance  --  a prayer I had often made before . But how could I pray ? Covey could pray  --  Capt . Auld could pray  --  I would fain pray ; but doubts ( arising partly from my own neglect of the means of grace , and partly from the sham religion which everywhere prevailed , cast in my mind a doubt upon all religion , and led me to the conviction that prayers were unavailing and delusive ) prevented my embracing the opportunity , as a religious one . Life , in itself , had almost become burdensome to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stay here and starve ( I was already hungry ) or go home to Covey 's , and have my flesh torn to pieces , and my spirit humbled under the cruel lash of Covey . This was the painful alternative presented to me . The day was long and irksome . My physical condition was deplorable . I was weak , from the toils of the previous day , and from the want of182 food and rest ; and had been so little concerned about my appearance , that I had not yet washed the blood from my garments . I was an object of horror , even to myself . Life , in Baltimore , when most oppressive , was a paradise to this . What had I done , what had my parents done , that such a life as this should be mine ? That day , in the woods , I would have exchanged my manhood for the brutehood of an ox . Night came . I was still in the woods , unresolved what to do . Hunger had not yet pinched me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the leaves to rest ; for I had been watching for hunters all day , but not being molested during the day , I expected no disturbance during the night . I had come to the conclusion that Covey relied upon hunger to drive me home ; and in this I was quite correct  --  the facts showed that he had made no effort to catch me , since morning . During the night , I heard the step of a man in the woods . He was coming toward the place where I lay . A person lying still has the advantage over one walking in the woods , in the day time , and this advantage is much greater at night . I was not able to engage in a physical struggle , and I had recourse to the common resort of the weak . I hid myself in the leaves to prevent discovery . But , as the night rambler in the woods drew nearer , I found him to be a friend , not an enemy ; it was a slave of Mr. William Groomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sandy . " Sandy lived with Mr. Kemp that year , about four miles from St. Michael 's . He , like myself had been hired out by the year ; but , unlike myself , had not been hired out to be broken . Sandy was the husband of a free woman , who lived in the lower part of " Potpie Neck , " and he was now on his way through the woods , to see her , and to spend the Sabbath with her . As soon as I had ascertained that the disturber of my solitude was not an enemy , but the good-hearted Sandy  --  a man as famous among the slaves of the neighborhood for his good nature , as for his good sense I came out from my hiding place , and made183 myself known to him . I explained the circumstances of the past two days , which had driven me to the woods , and he deeply compassionated my distress . It was a bold thing for him to shelter me , and I could not ask him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut , he would have suffered the penalty of thirty-nine lashes on his bare back , if not something worse . But Sandy was too generous to permit the fear of punishment to prevent his relieving a brother bondman from hunger and exposure ; and , therefore , on his own motion , I accompanied him to his home , or rather to the home of his wife  --  for the house and lot were hers . His wife was called up  --  for it was now about midnight  --  a fire was made , some Indian meal was soon mixed with salt and water , and an ash cake was baked in a hurry to relieve my hunger . Sandy 's wife was not behind him in kindness  --  both seemed to esteem it a privilege to succor me ; for , although I was hated by Covey and by my master , I was loved by the colored people , because they thought I was hated for my knowledge , and persecuted because I was feared . I was the only slave now in that region who could read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to Mr. Hugh Hamilton , who could read ( his name was " Jim " ) , but he , poor fellow , had , shortly after my coming into the neighborhood , been sold off to the far south . I saw Jim ironed , in the cart , to be carried to Easton for sale  --  pinioned like a yearling for the slaughter . My knowledge was now the pride of my brother slaves ; and , no doubt , Sandy felt something of the general interest in me on that account . The supper was soon ready , and though I have feasted since , with honorables , lord mayors and aldermen , over the sea , my supper on ash cake and cold water , with Sandy , was the meal , of all my life , most sweet to my taste , and now most vivid in my memory . Supper over , Sandy and I went into a discussion of what was possible for me , under the perils and hardships which now overshadowed my path . The question was , must I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away ? Upon a careful survey , the latter was found to be impossible ; for I was on a narrow neck of land , 184 every avenue from which would bring me in sight of pursuers . There was the Chesapeake bay to the right , and " Pot-pie " river to the left , and St. Michael 's and its neighborhood occupying the only space through which there was any retreat . I found Sandy an old advisor . He was not only a religious man , but he professed to believe in a system for which I have no name . He was a genuine African , and had inherited some of the so-called magical powers , said to be possessed by African and eastern nations . He told me that he could help me ; that , in those very woods , there was an herb , which in the morning might be found , possessing all the powers required for my protection ( I put his thoughts in my own language ) ; and that , if I would take his advice , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . He told me further , that if I would take that root and wear it on my right side , it would be impossible for Covey to strike me a blow ; that with this root about my person , no white man could whip me . He said he had carried it for years , and that he had fully tested its virtues . He had never received a blow from a slaveholder since he carried it ; and he never expected to receive one , for he always meant to carry that root as a protection . He knew Covey well , for Mrs. Covey was the daughter of Mr. Kemp ; and he ( Sandy ) had heard of the barbarous treatment to which I was subjected , and he wanted to do something for me . Now all this talk about the root , was to me , very absurd and ridiculous , if not positively sinful . I at first rejected the idea that the simple carrying a root on my right side ( a root , by the way , over which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess any such magic power as he ascribed to it , and I was , therefore , not disposed to cumber my pocket with it . I had a positive aversion to all pretenders to " divination . " It was beneath one of my intelligence to countenance such dealings with the devil , as this power implied . But , with all my learning  --  it was really precious little  --  Sandy was more than a match for me . " My book learning , " he said , " had not kept Covey off me " ( a powerful185 argument just then ) and he entreated me , with flashing eyes , to try this . If it did me no good , it could do me no harm , and it would cost me nothing , any way . Sandy was so earnest , and so confident of the good qualities of this weed , that , to please him , rather than from any conviction of its excellence , I was induced to take it . He had been to me the good Samaritan , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I could not help myself ; how did I know but that the hand of the Lord was in it ? With thoughts of this sort , I took the roots from Sandy , and put them in my right hand pocket . This was , of course , Sunday morning . Sandy now urged me to go home , with all speed , and to walk up bravely to the house , as though nothing had happened . I saw in Sandy too deep an insight into human nature , with all his superstition , not to have some respect for his advice ; and perhaps , too , a slight gleam or shadow of his superstition had fallen upon me . At any rate , I started off toward Covey 's , as directed by Sandy . Having , the previous night , poured my griefs into Sandy 's ears , and got him enlisted in my behalf , having made his wife a sharer in my sorrows , and having , also , become well refreshed by sleep and food , I moved off , quite courageously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as I entered his yard gate , I met him and his wife , dressed in their Sunday best  --  looking as smiling as angels  --  on their way to church . The manner of Covey astonished me . There was something really benignant in his countenance . He spoke to me as never before ; told me that the pigs had got into the lot , and he wished me to drive them out ; inquired how I was , and seemed an altered man . This extraordinary conduct of Covey , really made me begin to think that Sandy 's herb had more virtue in it than I , in my pride , had been willing to allow ; and , had the day been other than Sunday , I should have attributed Covey 's altered manner solely to the magic power of the root . I suspected , however , that the Sabbath , and not the root , was the real explanation of Covey 's manner . His religion hindered him from breaking the186 Sabbath , but not from breaking my skin . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom the day was mercifully given ; for while he would cut and slash my body during the week , he would not hesitate , on Sunday , to teach me the value of my soul , or the way of life and salvation by Jesus Christ . All went well with me till Monday morning ; and then , whether the root had lost its virtue , or whether my tormentor had gone deeper into the black art than myself ( as was sometimes said of him ) , or whether he had obtained a special indulgence , for his faithful Sabbath day 's worship , it is not necessary for me to know , or to inform the reader ; but , this I may say  --  the pious and benignant smile which graced Covey 's face on Sunday , wholly disappeared on Monday . Long before daylight , I was called up to go and feed , rub , and curry the horses . I obeyed the call , and would have so obeyed it , had it been made at an earilier(sic) hour , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sunday 's reflection , viz : to obey every order , however unreasonable , if it were possible , and , if Mr. Covey should then undertake to beat me , to defend and protect myself to the best of my ability . My religious views on the subject of resisting my master , had suffered a serious shock , by the savage persecution to which I had been subjected , and my hands were no longer tied by my religion . Master Thomas 's indifference had served the last link . I had now to this extent " backslidden " from this point in the slave 's religious creed ; and I soon had occasion to make my fallen state known to my Sunday-pious brother , Covey . Whilst I was obeying his order to feed and get the horses ready for the field , and when in the act of going up the stable loft for the purpose of throwing down some blades , Covey sneaked into the stable , in his peculiar snake-like way , and seizing me suddenly by the leg , he brought me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful jar . I now forgot my roots , and remembered my pledge to stand up in my own defense . The brute was endeavoring skillfully to get a slip-knot on my legs , before I could187 draw up my feet . As soon as I found what he was up to , I gave a sudden spring ( my two day 's rest had been of much service to me , ) and by that means , no doubt , he was able to bring me to the floor so heavily . He was defeated in his plan of tying me . While down , he seemed to think he had me very securely in his power . He little thought he was  --  as the rowdies say  --  " in " for a " rough and tumble " fight ; but such was the fact . Whence came the daring spirit necessary to grapple with a man who , eight-and-forty hours before , could , with his slightest word have made me tremble like a leaf in a storm , I do not know ; at any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better still , I was actually hard at it . The fighting madness had come upon me , and I found my strong fingers firmly attached to the throat of my cowardly tormentor ; as heedless of consequences , at the moment , as though we stood as equals before the law . The very color of the man was forgotten . I felt as supple as a cat , and was ready for the snakish creature at every turn . Every blow of his was parried , though I dealt no blows in turn . I was strictly on the defensive , preventing him from injuring me , rather than trying to injure him . I flung him on the ground several times , when he meant to have hurled me there . I held him so firmly by the throat , that his blood followed my nails . He held me , and I held him . All was fair , thus far , and the contest was about equal . My resistance was entirely unexpected , and Covey was taken all aback by it , for he trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you scoundrel ? " said he . To which , I returned a polite " Yes sir ; " steadily gazing my interrogator in the eye , to meet the first approach or dawning of the blow , which I expected my answer would call forth . But , the conflict did not long remain thus equal . Covey soon cried out lustily for help ; not that I was obtaining any marked advantage over him , or was injuring him , but because he was gaining none over me , and was not able , single handed , to conquer me . He called for his cousin Hughs , to come to his assistance , and now the scene was changed . I was compelled to188 give blows , as well as to parry them ; and , since I was , in any case , to suffer for resistance , I felt ( as the musty proverb goes ) that " I might as well be hanged for an old sheep as a lamb . " I was still defensive toward Covey , but aggressive toward Hughs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dealt a blow , in my desperation , which fairly sickened my youthful assailant . He went off , bending over with pain , and manifesting no disposition to come within my reach again . The poor fellow was in the act of trying to catch and tie my right hand , and while flattering himself with success , I gave him the kick which sent him staggering away in pain , at the same time that I held Covey with a firm hand . Taken completely by surprise , Covey seemed to have lost his usual strength and coolness . He was frightened , and stood puffing and blowing , seemingly unable to command words or blows . When he saw that poor Hughes was standing half bent with pain  --  his courage quite gone the cowardly tyrant asked if I " meant to persist in my resistance . " I told him " I did mean to resist , come what might ; " that I had been by him treated like a brute , during the last six months ; and that I should stand it no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and attempted to drag me toward a stick of wood , that was lying just outside the stable door . He meant to knock me down with it ; but , just as he leaned over to get the stick , I seized him with both hands by the collar , and , with a vigorous and sudden snatch , I brought my assailant harmlessly , his full length , on the not overclean ground  --  for we were now in the cow yard . He had selected the place for the fight , and it was but right that he should have all the advantges(sic) of his own selection . By this time , Bill , the hiredman , came home . He had been to Mr. Hemsley 's , to spend the Sunday with his nominal wife , and was coming home on Monday morning , to go to work . Covey and I had been skirmishing from before daybreak , till now , that the sun was almost shooting his beams over the eastern woods , and we were still at it . I could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to let me go , lest I should again189 make off to the woods ; otherwise , he would probably have obtained arms from the house , to frighten me . Holding me , Covey called upon Bill for assistance . The scene here , had something comic about it . " Bill , " who knew precisely what Covey wished him to do , affected ignorance , and pretended he did not know what to do . " What shall I do , Mr. Covey , " said Bill . " Take hold of him  --  take hold of him ! " said Covey . With a toss of his head , peculiar to Bill , he said , " indeed , Mr. Covey I want to go to work . " " This is your work , " said Covey ; " take hold of him . " Bill replied , with spirit , " My master hired me here , to work , and not to help you whip Frederick . " It was now my turn to speak . " Bill , " said I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To which he replied , " My GOD ! Frederick , I ai n't goin ' to tech ye , " and Bill walked off , leaving Covey and myself to settle our matters as best we might . But , my present advantage was threatened when I saw Caroline ( the slave-woman of Covey ) coming to the cow yard to milk , for she was a powerful woman , and could have mastered me very easily , exhausted as I now was . As soon as she came into the yard , Covey attempted to rally her to his aid . Strangely  --  and , I may add , fortunately  --  Caroline was in no humor to take a hand in any such sport . We were all in open rebellion , that morning . Caroline answered the command of her master to " take hold of me , " precisely as Bill had answered , but in her , it was at greater peril so to answer ; she was the slave of Covey , and he could do what he pleased with her . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris , to whom Bill belonged , did not allow his slaves to be beaten , unless they were guilty of some crime which the law would punish . But , poor Caroline , like myself , was at the mercy of the merciless Covey ; nor did she escape the dire effects of her refusal . He gave her several sharp blows . Covey at length ( two hours had elapsed ) gave up the contest . Letting me go , he said  --  puffing and blowing at a great rate  --  " Now , you scoundrel , go to your work ; I would not have whipped you half so much as I have had you not resisted . " The fact was , 190 he had not whipped me at all . He had not , in all the scuffle , drawn a single drop of blood from me . I had drawn blood from him ; and , even without this satisfaction , I should have been victorious , because my aim had not been to injure him , but to prevent his injuring me . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this transaction , he never laid on me the weight of his finger in anger . He would , occasionally , say he did not want to have to get hold of me again  --  a declaration which I had no difficulty in believing ; and I had a secret feeling , which answered , " You need not wish to get hold of me again , for you will be likely to come off worse in a second fight than you did in the first . " Well , my dear reader , this battle with Mr. Covey  --  undignified as it was , and as I fear my narration of it is  --  was the turning point in my " life as a slave . " It rekindled in my breast the smouldering embers of liberty ; it brought up my Baltimore dreams , and revived a sense of my own manhood . I was a changed being after that fight . I was nothing before ; I WAS A MAN NOW . It recalled to life my crushed self-respect and my self-confidence , and inspired me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without force , is without the essential dignity of humanity . Human nature is so constituted , that it can not honor a helpless man , although it can pity him ; and even this it can not do long , if the signs of power do not arise . He can only understand the effect of this combat on my spirit , who has himself incurred something , hazarded something , in repelling the unjust and cruel aggressions of a tyrant . Covey was a tyrant , and a cowardly one , withal . After resisting him , I felt as I had never felt before . It was a resurrection from the dark and pestiferous tomb of slavery , to the heaven of comparative freedom . I was no longer a servile coward , trembling under the frown of a brother worm of the dust , but , my long-cowed spirit was roused to an attitude of manly independence . I had reached the point , at which I was not afraid to die . This191 spirit made me a freeman in fact , while I remained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flogged he is more than half free . He has a domain as broad as his own manly heart to defend , and he is really " a power on earth . " While slaves prefer their lives , with flogging , to instant death , they will always find Christians enough , like unto Covey , to accommodate that preference . From this time , until that of my escape from slavery , I was never fairly whipped . Several attempts were made to whip me , but they were always unsuccessful . Bruises I did get , as I shall hereafter inform the reader ; but the case I have been describing , was the end of the brutification to which slavery had subjected me . The reader will be glad to know why , after I had so grievously offended Mr. Covey , he did not have me taken in hand by the authorities ; indeed , why the law of Maryland , which assigns hanging to the slave who resists his master , was not put in force against me ; at any rate , why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , and publicly whipped , for an example to other slaves , and as a means of deterring me from committing the same offense again . I confess , that the easy manner in which I got off , for a long time , a surprise to me , and I can not , even now , fully explain the cause . The only explanation I can venture to suggest , is the fact , that Covey was , probably , ashamed to have it known and confessed that he had been mastered by a boy of sixteen . Mr. Covey enjoyed the unbounded and very valuable reputation , of being a first rate overseer and Negro breaker . By means of this reputation , he was able to procure his hands for very trifling compensation , and with very great ease . His interest and his pride mutually suggested the wisdom of passing the matter by , in silence . The story that he had undertaken to whip a lad , and had been resisted , was , of itself , sufficient to damage him ; for his bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that imperial order that should make such an occurrence impossible . I judge from these circumstances , that Covey deemed it best to192 give me the go-by . It is , perhaps , not altogether creditable to my natural temper , that , after this conflict with Mr. Covey , I did , at times , purposely aim to provoke him to an attack , by refusing to keep with the other hands in the field , but I could never bully him to another battle . I had made up my mind to do him serious damage , if he ever again attempted to lay violent hands on me . Hereditary bondmen , know ye not Who would be free , themselves must strike the blow ?

My term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day , 1834 . I gladly left the snakish Covey , although he was now as gentle as a lamb . My home for the year 1835 was already secured  --  my next master was already selected . There is always more or less excitement about the matter of changing hands , but I had become somewhat reckless . I cared very little into whose hands I fell  --  I meant to fight my way . Despite of Covey , too , the report got abroad , that I was hard to whip ; that I was guilty of kicking back ; that though generally a good tempered Negro , I sometimes " got the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county , and they distinguished me among my servile brethren . Slaves , generally , will fight each other , and die at each other 's hands ; but there are few who are not held in awe by a white man . Trained from the cradle up , to think and194 feel that their masters are superior , and invested with a sort of sacredness , there are few who can outgrow or rise above the control which that sentiment exercises . I had now got free from it , and the thing was known . One bad sheep will spoil a whole flock . Among the slaves , I was a bad sheep . I hated slavery , slaveholders , and all pertaining to them ; and I did not fail to inspire others with the same feeling , wherever and whenever opportunity was presented . This made me a marked lad among the slaves , and a suspected one among the slaveholders . A knowledge of my ability to read and write , got pretty widely spread , which was very much against me . The days between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves as holidays . During these days , all regular work was suspended , and there was nothing to do but to keep fires , and look after the stock . This time was regarded as our own , by the grace of our masters , and we , therefore used it , or abused it , as we pleased . Those who had families at a distance , were now expected to visit them , and to spend with them the entire week . The younger slaves , or the unmarried ones , were expected to see to the cattle , and attend to incidental duties at home . The holidays were variously spent . The sober , thinking and industrious ones of our number , would employ themselves in manufacturing corn brooms , mats , horse collars and baskets , and some of these were very well made . Another class spent their time in hunting opossums , coons , rabbits , and other game . But the majority spent the holidays in sports , ball playing , wrestling , boxing , running foot races , dancing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was generally most agreeable to their masters . A slave who would work during the holidays , was thought , by his master , undeserving of holidays . Such an one had rejected the favor of his master . There was , in this simple act of continued work , an accusation against slaves ; and a slave could not help thinking , that if he made three dollars during the holidays , he might make three hundred during the year . Not to be drunk during the holidays , 195 was disgraceful ; and he was esteemed a lazy and improvident man , who could not afford to drink whisky during Christmas . The fiddling , dancing and " jubilee beating , " was going on in all directions . This latter performance is strictly southern . It supplies the place of a violin , or of other musical instruments , and is played so easily , that almost every farm has its " Juba " beater . The performer improvises as he beats , and sings his merry songs , so ordering the words as to have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass of nonsense and wild frolic , once in a while a sharp hit is given to the meanness of slaveholders . Take the following , for an example : We raise de wheat , Dey gib us de corn ; We bake de bread , Dey gib us de cruss ; We sif de meal , Dey gib us de huss ; We peal de meat , Dey gib us de skin , And dat 's de way Dey takes us in . We skim de pot , Dey gib us the liquor , And say dat 's good enough for nigger . Walk over ! walk over ! Tom butter and de fat ; Poor nigger you ca n't get over dat ; Walk over ! This is not a bad summary of the palpable injustice and fraud of slavery , giving  --  as it does  --  to the lazy and idle , the comforts which God designed should be given solely to the honest laborer . But to the holiday 's . Judging from my own observation and experience , I believe these holidays to be among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of keeping down the spirit of insurrection among the slaves . To enslave men , successfully and safely , it is necessary to196 have their minds occupied with thoughts and aspirations short of the liberty of which they are deprived . A certain degree of attainable good must be kept before them . These holidays serve the purpose of keeping the minds of the slaves occupied with prospective pleasure , within the limits of slavery . The young man can go wooing ; the married man can visit his wife ; the father and mother can see their children ; the industrious and money loving can make a few dollars ; the great wrestler can win laurels ; the young people can meet , and enjoy each other 's society ; the drunken man can get plenty of whisky ; and the religious man can hold prayer meetings , preach , pray and exhort during the holidays . Before the holidays , these are pleasures in prospect ; after the holidays , they become pleasures of memory , and they serve to keep out thoughts and wishes of a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of allowing their slaves these liberties , periodically , and to keep them , the year round , closely confined to the narrow circle of their homes , I doubt not that the south would blaze with insurrections . These holidays are conductors or safety valves to carry off the explosive elements inseparable from the human mind , when reduced to the condition of slavery . But for these , the rigors of bondage would become too severe for endurance , and the slave would be forced up to dangerous desperation . Woe to the slaveholder when he undertakes to hinder or to prevent the operation of these electric conductors . A succession of earthquakes would be less destructive , than the insurrectionary fires which would be sure to burst forth in different parts of the south , from such interference . Thus , the holidays , became part and parcel of the gross fraud , wrongs and inhumanity of slavery . Ostensibly , they are institutions of benevolence , designed to mitigate the rigors of slave life , but , practically , they are a fraud , instituted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice and oppression . The slave 's happiness is not the end sought , but , rather , the master's197 safety . It is not from a generous unconcern for the slave 's labor that this cessation from labor is allowed , but from a prudent regard to the safety of the slave system . I am strengthened in this opinion , by the fact , that most slaveholders like to have their slaves spend the holidays in such a manner as to be of no real benefit to the slaves . It is plain , that everything like rational enjoyment among the slaves , is frowned upon ; and only those wild and low sports , peculiar to semi-civilized people , are encouraged . All the license allowed , appears to have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom , and to make them as glad to return to their work , as they were to leave it . By plunging them into exhausting depths of drunkenness and dissipation , this effect is almost certain to follow . I have known slaveholders resort to cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . A usual plan is , to make bets on a slave , that he can drink more whisky than any other ; and so to induce a rivalry among them , for the mastery in this degradation . The scenes , brought about in this way , were often scandalous and loathsome in the extreme . Whole multitudes might be found stretched out in brutal drunkenness , at once helpless and disgusting . Thus , when the slave asks for a few hours of virtuous freedom , his cunning master takes advantage of his ignorance , and cheers him with a dose of vicious and revolting dissipation , artfully labeled with the name of LIBERTY . We were induced to drink , I among the rest , and when the holidays were over , we all staggered up from our filth and wallowing , took a long breath , and went away to our various fields of work ; feeling , upon the whole , rather glad to go from that which our masters artfully deceived us into the belief was freedom , back again to the arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , nor what it might have been , had it not been abused by us . It was about as well to be a slave to master , as to be a slave to rum and whisky . I am the more induced to take this view of the holiday system , 198 adopted by slaveholders , from what I know of their treatment of slaves , in regard to other things . It is the commonest thing for them to try to disgust their slaves with what they do not want them to have , or to enjoy . A slave , for instance , likes molasses ; he steals some ; to cure him of the taste for it , his master , in many cases , will go away to town , and buy a large quantity of the poorest quality , and set it before his slave , and , with whip in hand , compel him to eat it , until the poor fellow is made to sicken at the very thought of molasses . The same course is often adopted to cure slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , when their allowance has failed them . The same disgusting process works well , too , in other things , but I need not cite them . When a slave is drunk , the slaveholder has no fear that he will plan an insurrection ; no fear that he will escape to the north . It is the sober , thinking slave who is dangerous , and needs the vigilance of his master , to keep him a slave . But , to proceed with my narrative . On the first of January , 1835 , I proceeded from St. Michael 's to Mr. William Freeland 's , my new home . Mr. Freeland lived only three miles from St. Michael 's , on an old worn out farm , which required much labor to restore it to anything like a self-supporting establishment . I was not long in finding Mr. Freeland to be a very different man from Mr. Covey . Though not rich , Mr. Freeland was what may be called a well-bred southern gentleman , as different from Covey , as a well-trained and hardened Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the south . Though Freeland was a slaveholder , and shared many of the vices of his class , he seemed alive to the sentiment of honor . He had some sense of justice , and some feelings of humanity . He was fretful , impulsive and passionate , but I must do him the justice to say , he was free from the mean and selfish characteristics which distinguished the creature from which I had now , happily , escaped . He was open , frank , imperative , and practiced no concealments , 199 disdaining to play the spy . In all this , he was the opposite of the crafty Covey . Among the many advantages gained in my change from Covey 's to Freeland 's  --  startling as the statement may be  --  was the fact that the latter gentleman made no profession of religion . I assert most unhesitatingly , that the religion of the south  --  as I have observed it and proved it  --  is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes ; the justifier of the most appalling barbarity ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter , under which the darkest , foulest , grossest , and most infernal abominations fester and flourish . Were I again to be reduced to the condition of a slave , next to that calamity , I should regard the fact of being the slave of a religious slaveholder , the greatest that could befall me . For all slaveholders with whom I have ever met , religious slaveholders are the worst . I have found them , almost invariably , the vilest , meanest and basest of their class . Exceptions there may be , but this is true of religious slaveholders , as a class . It is not for me to explain the fact . Others may do that ; I simply state it as a fact , and leave the theological , and psychological inquiry , which it raises , to be decided by others more competent than myself . Religious slaveholders , like religious persecutors , are ever extreme in their malice and violence . Very near my new home , on an adjoining farm , there lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Weeden was a local preacher of the Protestant Methodist persuasion , and a most zealous supporter of the ordinances of religion , generally . This Weeden owned a woman called " Ceal , " who was a standing proof of his mercilessness . Poor Ceal 's back , always scantily clothed , was kept literally raw , by the lash of this religious man and gospel minister . The most notoriously wicked man  --  so called in distinction from church members  --  could hire hands more easily than this brute . When sent out to find a home , a slave would never enter the gates of the preacher Weeden , while a sinful sinner needed a hand . Be200 have ill , or behave well , it was the known maxim of Weeden , that it is the duty of a master to use the lash . If , for no other reason , he contended that this was essential to remind a slave of his condition , and of his master 's authority . The good slave must be whipped , to be kept good , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such was Weeden 's theory , and such was his practice . The back of his slave-woman will , in the judgment , be the swiftest witness against him . While I am stating particular cases , I might as well immortalize another of my neighbors , by calling him by name , and putting him in print . He did not think that a " chiel " was near , " taking notes , " and will , doubtless , feel quite angry at having his character touched off in the ragged style of a slave 's pen . I beg to introduce the reader to REV . RIGBY HOPKINS . Mr. Hopkins resides between Easton and St. Michael 's , in Talbot county , Maryland . The severity of this man made him a perfect terror to the slaves of his neighborhood . The peculiar feature of his government , was , his system of whipping slaves , as he said , in advance of deserving it . He always managed to have one or two slaves to whip on Monday morning , so as to start his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new assurance on Monday , that his preaching about kindness , mercy , brotherly love , and the like , on Sunday , did not interfere with , or prevent him from establishing his authority , by the cowskin . He seemed to wish to assure them , that his tears over poor , lost and ruined sinners , and his pity for them , did not reach to the blacks who tilled his fields . This saintly Hopkins used to boast , that he was the best hand to manage a Negro in the county . He whipped for the smallest offenses , by way of preventing the commission of large ones . The reader might imagine a difficulty in finding faults enough for such frequent whipping . But this is because you have no idea how easy a matter it is to offend a man who is on the look-out for offenses . The man , unaccustomed to slaveholding , would be astonished to observe how many foggable offenses there are in201 the slaveholder 's catalogue of crimes ; and how easy it is to commit any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A slaveholder , bent on finding fault , will hatch up a dozen a day , if he chooses to do so , and each one of these shall be of a punishable description . A mere look , word , or motion , a mistake , accident , or want of power , are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time . Does a slave look dissatisfied with his condition ? It is said , that he has the devil in him , and it must be whipped out . Does he answer loudly , when spoken to by his master , with an air of self-consciousness ? Then , must he be taken down a button-hole lower , by the lash , well laid on . Does he forget , and omit to pull off his hat , when approaching a white person ? Then , he must , or may be , whipped for his bad manners . Does he ever venture to vindicate his conduct , when harshly and unjustly accused ? Then , he is guilty of impudence , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To allow a slave to escape punishment , who has impudently attempted to exculpate himself from unjust charges , preferred against him by some white person , is to be guilty of great dereliction of duty . Does a slave ever venture to suggest a better way of doing a thing , no matter what ? He is , altogether , too officious  --  wise above what is written  --  and he deserves , even if he does not get , a flogging for his presumption . Does he , while plowing , break a plow , or while hoeing , break a hoe , or while chopping , break an ax ? No matter what were the imperfections of the implement broken , or the natural liabilities for breaking , the slave can be whipped for carelessness . The reverend slaveholder could always find something of this sort , to justify him in using the lash several times during the week . Hopkins  --  like Covey and Weeden  --  were shunned by slaves who had the privilege ( as many had ) of finding their own masters at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a man in all that section of country , who made a louder profession of religion , than did MR . RIGBY HOPKINS. 202 But , to continue the thread of my story , through my experience when at Mr. William Freeland 's . My poor , weather-beaten bark now reached smoother water , and gentler breezes . My stormy life at Covey 's had been of service to me . The things that would have seemed very hard , had I gone direct to Mr. Freeland 's , from the home of Master Thomas , were now ( after the hardships at Covey 's ) " trifles light as air . " I was still a field hand , and had come to prefer the severe labor of the field , to the enervating duties of a house servant . I had become large and strong ; and had begun to take pride in the fact , that I could do as much hard work as some of the older men . There is much rivalry among slaves , at times , as to which can do the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But some of us were too wise to race with each other very long . Such racing , we had the sagacity to see , was not likely to pay . We had our times for measuring each other 's strength , but we knew too much to keep up the competition so long as to produce an extraordinary day 's work . We knew that if , by extraordinary exertion , a large quantity of work was done in one day , the fact , becoming known to the master , might lead him to require the same amount every day . This thought was enough to bring us to a dead halt when over so much excited for the race . At Mr. Freeland 's , my condition was every way improved . I was no longer the poor scape-goat that I was when at Covey 's , where every wrong thing done was saddled upon me , and where other slaves were whipped over my shoulders . Mr. Freeland was too just a man thus to impose upon me , or upon any one else . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especial abuse , and to beat him often , with a view to its effect upon others , rather than with any expectation that the slave whipped will be improved by it , but the man with whom I now was , could descend to no such meanness and wickedness . Every man here was held individually responsible for his own conduct . This was a vast improvement on the rule at Covey 's . There , I203 was the general pack horse . Bill Smith was protected , by a positive prohibition made by his rich master , and the command of the rich slaveholder is LAW to the poor one ; Hughes was favored , because of his relationship to Covey ; and the hands hired temporarily , escaped flogging , except as they got it over my poor shoulders . Of course , this comparison refers to the time when Covey could whip me . Mr. Freeland , like Mr. Covey , gave his hands enough to eat , but , unlike Mr. Covey , he gave them time to take their meals ; he worked us hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest  --  another advantage to be set to the credit of the sinner , as against that of the saint . We were seldom in the field after dark in the evening , or before sunrise in the morning . Our implements of husbandry were of the most improved pattern , and much superior to those used at Covey 's . Nothwithstanding the improved condition which was now mine , and the many advantages I had gained by my new home , and my new master , I was still restless and discontented . I was about as hard to please by a master , as a master is by slave . The freedom from bodily torture and unceasing labor , had given my mind an increased sensibility , and imparted to it greater activity . I was not yet exactly in right relations . " How be it , that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural , and afterward that which is spiritual . " When entombed at Covey 's , shrouded in darkness and physical wretchedness , temporal wellbeing was the grand desideratum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its claims . Beat and cuff your slave , keep him hungry and spiritless , and he will follow the chain of his master like a dog ; but , feed and clothe him well  --  work him moderately  --  surround him with physical comfort  --  and dreams of freedom intrude . Give him a bad master , and he aspires to a good master ; give him a good master , and he wishes to become his own master . Such is human nature . You may hurl a man so low , beneath the level of his kind , that he loses all just ideas of his natural position ; 204 but elevate him a little , and the clear conception of rights arises to life and power , and leads him onward . Thus elevated , a little , at Freeland 's , the dreams called into being by that good man , Father Lawson , when in Baltimore , began to visit me ; and shoots from the tree of liberty began to put forth tender buds , and dim hopes of the future began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Freeland 's . There were Henry Harris , John Harris , Handy Caldwell , and Sandy Jenkins . 6 Henry and John were brothers , and belonged to Mr. Freeland . They were both remarkably bright and intelligent , though neither of them could read . Now for mischief ! I had not been long at Freeland 's before I was up to my old tricks . I early began to address my companions on the subject of education , and the advantages of intelligence over ignorance , and , as far as I dared , I tried to show the agency of ignorance in keeping men in slavery . Webster 's spelling book and the Columbian Orator were looked into again . As summer came on , and the long Sabbath days stretched themselves over our idleness , I became uneasy , and wanted a Sabbath school , in which to exercise my gifts , and to impart the little knowledge of letters which I possessed , to my brother slaves . A house was hardly necessary in the summer time ; I could hold my school under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any where else . The thing was , to get the scholars , and to have them thoroughly imbued with the desire to learn . Two such boys were quickly secured , in Henry and John , and from them the contagion spread . I was not long bringing around me twenty or thirty young men , who enrolled themselves , gladly , in my Sabbath school , and were willing to meet me regularly , under the trees or elsewhere , for the purpose of learning to read . It was205 surprising with what ease they provided themselves with spelling books . These were mostly the cast off books of their young masters or mistresses . I taught , at first , on our own farm . All were impressed with the necessity of keeping the matter as private as possible , for the fate of the St. Michael 's attempt was notorious , and fresh in the minds of all . Our pious masters , at St. Michael 's , must not know that a few of their dusky brothers were learning to read the word of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chain . We might have met to drink whisky , to wrestle , fight , and to do other unseemly things , with no fear of interruption from the saints or sinners of St. Michael 's . But , to meet for the purpose of improving the mind and heart , by learning to read the sacred scriptures , was esteemed a most dangerous nuisance , to be instantly stopped . The slaveholders of St. Michael 's , like slaveholders elsewhere , would always prefer to see the slaves engaged in degrading sports , rather than to see them acting like moral and accountable beings . Had any one asked a religious white man , in St. Michael 's , twenty years ago , the names of three men in that town , whose lives were most after the pattern of our Lord and Master , Jesus Christ , the first three would have been as follows : GARRISON WEST , Class Leader . WRIGHT FAIRBANKS , Class Leader . THOMAS AULD , Class Leader . And yet , these were men who ferociously rushed in upon my Sabbath school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I must say , I thought him a Christian , until he took part in bloody by the lash . This same Garrison West was my class leader , and I must say , I thought him a Christian , until he took part in breaking up my school . He led me no more after that . The plea for this outrage was then , as it is now and at all times  --  the danger to good order . If the slaves learnt to read , they would learn something else , and something worse . The peace of slavery would be disturbed ; slave rule would be endangered . I leave the reader to206 characterize a system which is endangered by such causes . I do not dispute the soundness of the reasoning . It is perfectly sound ; and , if slavery be right , Sabbath schools for teaching slaves to read the bible are wrong , and ought to be put down . These Christian class leaders were , to this extent , consistent . They had settled the question , that slavery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sabbath schools are wrong . To be sure , they were Protestant , and held to the great Protestant right of every man to " search the scriptures " for himself ; but , then , to all general rules , there are exceptions . How convenient ! What crimes may not be committed under the doctrine of the last remark . But , my dear , class leading Methodist brethren , did not condescend to give me a reason for breaking up the Sabbath school at St. Michael 's ; it was enough that they had determined upon its destruction . I am , however , digressing . After getting the school cleverly into operation , the second time holding it in the woods , behind the barn , and in the shade of trees  --  I succeeded in inducing a free colored man , who lived several miles from our house , to permit me to hold my school in a room at his house . He , very kindly , gave me this liberty ; but he incurred much peril in doing so , for the assemblage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , the name of this man ; for it might , even now , subject him to persecution , although the offenses were committed more than twenty years ago . I had , at one time , more than forty scholars , all of the right sort ; and many of them succeeded in learning to read . I have met several slaves from Maryland , who were once my scholars ; and who obtained their freedom , I doubt not , partly in consequence of the ideas imparted to them in that school . I have had various employments during my short life ; but I look back to none with more satisfaction , than to that afforded by my Sunday school . An attachment , deep and lasting , sprung up between me and my persecuted pupils , which made parting from them intensely grievous ; and , 207 when I think that most of these dear souls are yet shut up in this abject thralldom , I am overwhelmed with grief . Besides my Sunday school , I devoted three evenings a week to my fellow slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , that , in this christian country , men and women are hiding from professors of religion , in barns , in the woods and fields , in order to learn to read the holy bible . Those dear souls , who came to my Sabbath school , came not because it was popular or reputable to attend such a place , for they came under the liability of having forty stripes laid on their naked backs . Every moment they spend in my school , they were under this terrible liability ; and , in this respect , I was sharer with them . Their minds had been cramped and starved by their cruel masters ; the light of education had been completely excluded ; and their hard earnings had been taken to educate their master 's children . I felt a delight in circumventing the tyrants , and in blessing the victims of their curses . The year at Mr. Freeland 's passed off very smoothly , to outward seeming . Not a blow was given me during the whole year . To the credit of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , that he was the best master I ever had , until I became my own master , and assumed for myself , as I had a right to do , the responsibility of my own existence and the exercise of my own powers . For much of the happiness  --  or absence of misery  --  with which I passed this year with Mr. Freeland , I am indebted to the genial temper and ardent friendship of my brother slaves . They were , every one of them , manly , generous and brave , yes ; I say they were brave , and I will add , fine looking . It is seldom the lot of mortals to have truer and better friends than were the slaves on this farm . It is not uncommon to charge slaves with great treachery toward each other , and to believe them incapable of confiding in each other ; but I must say , that I never loved , esteemed , or confided in men , more than I did in these . They were as true as steel , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no mean advantages taken of each other , as is sometimes the case where slaves are situated as we were ; no tattling ; no giving each other bad names to Mr. Freeland ; and no elevating one at the expense of the other . We never undertook to do any thing , of any importance , which was likely to affect each other , without mutual consultation . We were generally a unit , and moved together . Thoughts and sentiments were exchanged between us , which might well be called very incendiary , by oppressors and tyrants ; and perhaps the time has not even now come , when it is safe to unfold all the flying suggestions which arise in the minds of intelligent slaves . Several of my friends and brothers , if yet alive , are still in some part of the house of bondage ; and though twenty years have passed away , the suspicious malice of slavery might punish them for even listening to my thoughts . The slaveholder , kind or cruel , is a slaveholder still  --  the every hour violator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , therefore , every hour silently whetting the knife of vengeance for his own throat . He never lisps a syllable in commendation of the fathers of this republic , nor denounces any attempted oppression of himself , without inviting the knife to his own throat , and asserting the rights of rebellion for his own slaves . The year is ended , and we are now in the midst of the Christmas holidays , which are kept this year as last , according to the general description previously given . CHAPTER XIX .

Sober people look both ways at the beginning of the year , surveying the errors of the past , and providing against possible errors of the future . I , too , was thus exercised .

My faculties and powers of body and soul are not my own , but are the property of a fellow mortal , in no sense superior to me , except that he has the physical power to compel me to be owned and controlled by him . By the combined physical force of the community , I am his slave  --  a slave for life . " With thoughts like these , I was perplexed and chafed ; they rendered me gloomy and disconsolate . The anguish of my mind may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Freeland , my temporary master , had bought me of Capt . Thomas Auld , for the year 1836 . His promptness in securing my services , would have been flattering to my vanity , had I been ambitious to win the reputation of being a valuable slave . Even as it was , I felt a slight degree of complacency at the circumstance . It showed he was as well pleased with me as a slave , as I was with him as a master . I have already intimated my regard for Mr. Freeland , and I may say here , in addressing northern readers  --  where is no selfish motive for speaking in praise of a slaveholder  --  that Mr. Freeland was a man of many excellent qualities , and to me quite preferable to any master I ever had . But the kindness of the slavemaster only gilds the chain of slavery , and detracts nothing from its weight or power . The thought that men are made for other and better uses than slavery , thrives best under the gentle treatment of a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no smiles which can fascinate the partially enlightened slave , into a forgetfulness of his bondage , nor of the desirableness of liberty . I was not through the first month of this , my second year with the kind and gentlemanly Mr. Freeland , before I was earnestly considering and advising plans for gaining that freedom , which , 211 when I was but a mere child , I had ascertained to be the natural and inborn right of every member of the human family . The desire for this freedom had been benumbed , while I was under the brutalizing dominion of Covey ; and it had been postponed , and rendered inoperative , by my truly pleasant Sunday school engagements with my friends , during the year 1835 , at Mr. Freeland 's . It had , however , never entirely subsided . I hated slavery , always , and the desire for freedom only needed a favorable breeze , to fan it into a blaze , at any moment . The thought of only being a creature of the present and the past , troubled me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hope in it . To be shut up entirely to the past and present , is abhorrent to the human mind ; it is to the soul  --  whose life and happiness is unceasing progress  --  what the prison is to the body ; a blight and mildew , a hell of horrors . The dawning of this , another year , awakened me from my temporary slumber , and roused into life my latent , but long cherished aspirations for freedom . I was now not only ashamed to be contented in slavery , but ashamed to seem to be contented , and in my present favorable condition , under the mild rule of Mr. F. , I am not sure that some kind reader will not condemn me for being over ambitious , and greatly wanting in proper humility , when I say the truth , that I now drove from me all thoughts of making the best of my lot , and welcomed only such thoughts as led me away from the house of bondage . The intense desires , now felt , to be free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the determination to act , as well as to think and speak . Accordingly , at the beginning of this year 1836 , I took upon me a solemn vow , that the year which had now dawned upon me should not close , without witnessing an earnest attempt , on my part , to gain my liberty . This vow only bound me to make my escape individually ; but the year spent with Mr. Freeland had attached me , as with " hooks of steel , " to my brother slaves . The most affectionate and confiding friendship existed between us ; and I felt it my duty to give them an opportunity to share in my212 virtuous determination by frankly disclosing to them my plans and purposes . Toward Henry and John Harris , I felt a friendship as strong as one man can feel for another ; for I could have died with and for them . To them , therefore , with a suitable degree of caution , I began to disclose my sentiments and plans ; sounding them , the while on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scarcely need tell the reader , that I did my very best to imbue the minds of my dear friends with my own views and feelings . Thoroughly awakened , now , and with a definite vow upon me , all my little reading , which had any bearing on the subject of human rights , was rendered available in my communications with my friends . That ( to me ) gem of a book , the Columbian Orator , with its eloquent orations and spicy dialogues , denouncing oppression and slavery  --  telling of what had been dared , done and suffered by men , to obtain the inestimable boon of liberty  --  was still fresh in my memory , and whirled into the ranks of my speech with the aptitude of well trained soldiers , going through the drill . The fact is , I here began my public speaking . I canvassed , with Henry and John , the subject of slavery , and dashed against it the condemning brand of God 's eternal justice , which it every hour violates . My fellow servants were neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more alike than our opinions . All , however , were ready to act , when a feasible plan should be proposed . " Show us how the thing is to be done , " said they , " and all is clear . " We were all , except Sandy , quite free from slaveholding priestcraft . It was in vain that we had been taught from the pulpit at St. Michael 's , the duty of obedience to our masters ; to recognize God as the author of our enslavement ; to regard running away an offense , alike against God and man ; to deem our enslavement a merciful and beneficial arrangement ; to esteem our condition , in this country , a paradise to that from which we had been snatched in Africa ; to consider our hard hands and dark color as God 's mark of displeasure , and as pointing us out as the proper213 subjects of slavery ; that the relation of master and slave was one of reciprocal benefits ; that our work was not more serviceable to our masters , than our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was in vain that the pulpit of St. Michael 's had constantly inculcated these plausible doctrine . Nature laughed them to scorn . For my own part , I had now become altogether too big for my chains . Father Lawson 's solemn words , of what I ought to be , and might be , in the providence of God , had not fallen dead on my soul . I was fast verging toward manhood , and the prophecies of my childhood were still unfulfilled . The thought , that year after year had passed away , and my resolutions to run away had failed and faded  --  that I was still a slave , and a slave , too , with chances for gaining my freedom diminished and still diminishing  --  was not a matter to be slept over easily ; nor did I easily sleep over it . But here came a new trouble . Thoughts and purposes so incendiary as those I now cherished , could not agitate the mind long , without danger of making themselves manifest to scrutinizing and unfriendly beholders . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether too transparent for the safe concealment of my hazardous enterprise . Plans of greater moment have leaked through stone walls , and revealed their projectors . But , here was no stone wall to hide my purpose . I would have given my poor , tell tale face for the immoveable countenance of an Indian , for it was far from being proof against the daily , searching glances of those with whom I met . It is the interest and business of slaveholders to study human nature , with a view to practical results , and many of them attain astonishing proficiency in discerning the thoughts and emotions of slaves . They have to deal not with earth , wood , or stone , but with men ; and , by every regard they have for their safety and prosperity , they must study to know the material on which they are at work . So much intellect as the slaveholder has around him , requires watching . Their safety depends upon their vigilance . Conscious of the injustice and wrong they are every hour214 perpetrating , and knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such wrongs , they are looking out for the first signs of the dread retribution of justice . They watch , therefore , with skilled and practiced eyes , and have learned to read , with great accuracy , the state of mind and heart of the slaves , through his sable face . These uneasy sinners are quick to inquire into the matter , where the slave is concerned . Unusual sobriety , apparent abstraction , sullenness and indifference  --  indeed , any mood out of the common way  --  afford ground for suspicion and inquiry . Often relying on their superior position and wisdom , they hector and torture the slave into a confession , by affecting to know the truth of their accusations . " You have got the devil in you , " say they , " and we will whip him out of you . " I have often been put thus to the torture , on bare suspicion . This system has its disadvantages as well as their opposite . The slave is sometimes whipped into the confession of offenses which he never committed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a man is to be held innocent until proved to be guilty "  --  does not hold good on the slave plantation . Suspicion and torture are the approved methods of getting at the truth , here . It was necessary for me , therefore , to keep a watch over my deportment , lest the enemy should get the better of me . But with all our caution and studied reserve , I am not sure that Mr. Freeland did not suspect that all was not right with us . It did seem that he watched us more narrowly , after the plan of escape had been conceived and discussed amongst us . Men seldom see themselves as others see them ; and while , to ourselves , everything connected with our contemplated escape appeared concealed , Mr. Freeland may have , with the peculiar prescience of a slaveholder , mastered the huge thought which was disturbing our peace in slavery . I am the more inclined to think that he suspected us , because , prudent as we were , as I now look back , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated to awaken suspicion . We were , 215 at times , remarkably buoyant , singing hymns and making joyous exclamations , almost as triumphant in their tone as if we reached a land of freedom and safety . A keen observer might have detected in our repeated singing of O Canaan , sweet Canaan , I am bound for the land of Canaan , something more than a hope of reaching heaven . We meant to reach the north  --  and the north was our Canaan . I//
