txt THE PALACES OF FRANCE . BY JOHN S. C. ABBOTT . FRANCE has recorded her past history and her present condition , in the regal palaces she has reared . Upon these monumental walls are inscribed , in letters more legible than the hieroglyphics of Egypt , and as ineffaceable , the long and dreary story of kingly vice , voluptuousness and pride , and of popular servility and oppression . The unthinkine tourist saunters through these magnificent saloons , upon which have been lavished the wealth of princes and the toil of ages , and admires their gorgeous grandeur . In marbled floors and gilded ceilings and damask tapestry , and all the appliances of boundless luxury and opulence , he sees but the triumphs of art , and bewildered by the dazzling spectacle , forgets the burning outrage upon human rights which it proclaims . Half-entranced , he wanders through uncounted acres of groves and lawns , and parterres of flowers , embellished with lakes , fountains , cascades , and the most voluptuous statuary , where kings and queens have reveled , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dewy morn till the shades of night , through long and joyless years , eating black bread , clothed in coarse raiment  --  the man , the woman , the ox , companions in toil , companions in thought  --  to minister to this indulgence . But the palaces of France proclaim , in trumpet tones . the shame of France . They say to her kings . Behold the undeniable monuments of your pride , your insatiate extortion , your measureless extravagance and luxury . They say to the people , Behold the proofs of the outrages which your fathers , for countless ages , have endured . They lived in mud hovels that their licentious kings might riot haughtily in the apartments , canopied with gold , of Versailles , the Tuileries , and St. Cloud-*.  --  the Palaces of France . The mind of the political economist lingers painfully upon them . They are gorgeous as specimens of art . They are sacred as memorials of the past . Vandalism alone would raze them to their foundations . Still , the judgment says , It would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bastile , their very foundations were plowed up , and sown with salt . For they are a perpetual provocative to every thinking man . They excite unceasingly democratic rage against aristocratic arrogance . Thousands of noble women , as they traverse those gorgeous halls , feel those fires of indignation glowing in their souls , which glowed in the bosom of Madame Roland . Thousands of young men , with compressed lip and moistened eye , lean against those marble pillars , lost in thought , and almost excuse even the demoniac and blood-thirsty mercilessness of Danton . Marat , and Robespierre . These palaces are a perpetual stimulus and provocative to governmental aggression . There they stand , in all their gorgeousness , empty , swept , and garnished . They are resplendently beautiful . They are supplied with every convenience , every luxury . King and Emperor dwelt there . Why should not the President ? Hence the palace becomes the home of the Republican President . The expenses of the palace , the retinue of the palace , the courf etiquette of the palace become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gov eminent , in his convenient and appropriate man sion , receives a salary of twenty-five thousand dollars a year . In France , the President of the Republic receives four hundred thousand dollars a year , and yet , even with that vast sum , can not keep up an establishment at all in accordance with the dwellings of grandeur which invite his occupancy , and which unceasingly and irresistibly stimulate to regal pomp and to regal extravagance . The palaces of France have a vast influence upon the present politics of France There is an unceasing conflict between those marble walls of monarchical splendor , and the principles of republican simplicity . This contest will not soon terminate , and its result no one can foresee . Never have I felt my indignation more thoroughly aroused than when ivan // dering hour after hour through the voluptuous sumptuousness of Versailles . The triumphs of taste and art are admirable , beyond the power of the pen to describe . But the moral of execrable oppression is deeply inscribed upon all . In a brief description of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in which I chanced to visit them . 1 . Palais des Thermes-In long-gone centuries , which have faded away into oblivion , a wandering tribe of barbarians alighted from their canoes , upon a small island in the Seine , and there reared their huts . They were called the Parisii . The slow lapse of centuries rolled over them , and there were wars and woes , bridals and burials , and still they increased in numbers and in strength , and fortified their little isle against the invasions of their enemies ; for man , whether civilized or savage , has ever been the most ferocious wild beast man has had to encounter . But soon the tramp of the Roman legions was heard upon the banks of the Seine , and all Gaul . with its sixty tribes , came under the power nf the Cnsars . Extensive marshes and gloomy forests surrounded the barbarian village ; hut , gradually , Roman laws and institutions were introduced ; and Roman energy changed the aspect of the country . Immediately the proud conquerors commenced rearing a palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , with its massive walls , and in imposing grandeur . Roman spears drove the people to the work ; and Roman ingenuity knew well how to extort from the populace the revenue which was required . Large remains of that palace continue to the present day . It is the most interesting memorial of the past which can now be found in France . The magnificence of its proportions still strike the beholder with awe . " Behold , " says a writer , who trod its marble floors nearly a thousand years ago : " Behold the Palace of the Kings , whose turrets pierce the skies , and whose foundations penetrate even to the empire of the dead . " Julius Ca3sar gazed proudly upon those turrets ; and here the shouts of Roman legions , fifteen hundred years ago , proclaimed Julian emperor ; and Roman maidens , with throbbing hearts , trod these floors in the mazy dance . No one can enter the grand hall of the baths , without being deeply impressed with the majestic aspect of the edifice , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand years has left its venerable impress upon those walls . Here Roman generai* proudly strode , encased in brass and steel , and the clatter of their arms resounded through these arches . In these mouldering , crumbling tubs of stone , they laved their sinewy limbs . But where are those fierce warriors now In what employments have their turbulent spirits been engaged , while generation after generation has passed on earth , in the enactment of the comedies and the tragedies of life Did their rzgh tutelage in the camp , and their proud bearing in the court , prepare them for the love , the kindness , the gentleness , the devotion of Heaven In fields of outrage , clamor , and blood , madly rushing to the assault , shouting in frenzy , dealing , with iron hand , every where around , destruction and death , did they acquire a taste for the " green pastures and the still waters ? " Alas ! for the mystery of our being They are gone , and gone forever ! Their name has perished-their language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more disturbs their deep repose , Than summer evening 's gentlest sigh , Which shuts the rose . " Upon a part of the ruins of this old palace of the Cusars , there has been reared , by more modern ancients , still another palace , where mirth and revelry have resounded , where pride has elevated her haughty head , and vanity displayed her costly robes  --  but over all those scenes of splendor , death has rolled its oblivious waves . About four hundred years ago , upon a portion of the crumbling walls of this old Roman mansion , the Palace of Cluny was reared . For three centuries , this palace was one of the abodes of the kings of France . The tide of regal life ebbed and flowed through those saloons , and along those corridors . There is the chamber where Mary of England . sister of Henry VIII. , and widow of Louis XII. , passed the weary years of her widowhood . It is still called the chamber of the white queen , " from the custom of the queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , these Gothic turrets , and gorgeously ornamented lucame windows , gleamed with illuminations , as the young King of Scotland , James V. , led Madeleine , the blooming daughter of Francis I. , to the bridal altar . Here the haughty family of the Guises ostentatiously displayed their regal retinue-vying with the kings of France in splendor , and outvying them in power . These two palaces , now blended by the nuptials of decay into one , are converted into a museum of antiquities-silent depositories of memorials of the dead . Sadly one loiters through their deserted balls . They present one of the most interesting sights of Paris . In the reflective mind they awaken emotions which the pen can not describe . 2 . Time Louvre-When Paris consisted only of the little island in the Seine , and kings and feudal lords , with wine and wassail were reveling in the saloons of Cluny , a hunting-seat was reared in the dense forest which spread itself along the banks of the river . As the city extended , and the forest disappeared , the huntingseat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state-prison Thus it continued for three hundred years . In its gloomy dungeons prisoners of state , and the victims of crime , groaned and died ; and countless tragedies of despotic power there transpired , which the Day of Judgment alone can reveal . Three hundred years ago , Francis I. tore down the dilapidated walls of this old castle , and commenced the magnificent Palace of the Louvre upon their foundations But its construction has required // the labor of ages , and upon it has been expended millions , which despotic power has extortcd from the hard hands of penury . This gorgeoris palace contains a wilderness of saloons and corridors , and flights of stairs ; and seems rather adapted to accommodate the population of a city , than to be merely one of the residences of a royal family . The visitor wanders bewildered through its boundless magnificence . The spirits of the dead rise again , and people these halls . Here the pure and the noble Jeanne d'Albret was received in courtly grandeur , by the impure and the ignoble Catherine de Medici @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride to the altar . From this window Charles IX . shot down the Protestants as they fled , amidst the horrors of the perfidious massacre of St. Bartholomew . in this gilded chamber , with its lofty ceiling and its tapestried walls , Catherine de Medici died in the glooms of remorse and despair . Her bed of down , her despotic power could present no refuge against the King of Terrors ; and the mind is appalled with the thought , that from this very room , now so silent and deserted , her guilty spirit took its flight to the tribunal of the King of kings , and the Lord of lords . Successive generations of haughty sovereigns have here risen and died . And if there be any truth in history , they have been , almost without exception , proud , merciless , licentious oppressors . The orgies of sin have filled this palace . Defiance to God and man has here held its high carnival . The mind is indeed bewildered with a flood of emotions rushing through it , as one is pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred years ago , and to the very spot where , in anguish , he gasped and died , after having been stabbed by Ravaillac . Here one sees the very helmet worn by Henry II . on that unfortunate day , when the tilting spear of the Count of Montgommeri , entering his eye , pierced his brain . It requires the labor of a day even to saunter through the innumeraVOL . V.-No. 27. -X ble rooms of this magnificent abode . But it will never again resound with the revelries of kings and queens . Royalty has forsaken it forever . Democracy has now taken strange and anomalous possession of its walls . It is converted into the most splendid museum in the world-filled with the richest productions of ancient and modem art . The people now enter freely that sanctuary , where once none but kings and courtiers ventured to appear . The Louvre now is useful to the world ; but upon its massive walls are registered deeds of violence , oppression , and crime which make the ear to tingle . 3 . Malmaison-When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote to Josephine , to purchase somewhere in the vicinity of Paris , a pleasant rural retreat , to which they could retire from the bustle of the metropolis , and enjoy the luxury of green fields and shady groves . Josephine soon found a delightful chateau , about nine miles from Paris , and five from Versailles , which she purchased , with many acres of land around it , for about one hundred thousand dollars The great value of the place was in the spacious and beautiful grounds , not in the buildings . The chateau itself was plain , substantial , simple , far less ostentatious in its appearance than many a country-seat erected upon the banks of the Hudson , or in the environs of Boston . Here Josephine resided most of the time during the eighteen months of Napoleon 's absence in Egypt . Upon Napoleon 's return , this became the favorite residence of them both . Amid all the splendors of the Empire , it was ever their great joy to escape to the rural quietude of Malmaison . There they often passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often Napoleon said , as he left those ioved haunts , to attend to the cares and toils of the Tuileries , " Now I must again put on the yoke of misery . " Napoleon ever spoke of the hours passed at Malmaison , as the happiest of his life . He erected for himself there , in a retired grove . THE LOUVRE . // a little pavilion , very simple , yet beautiful , in its structure , which still retains the name of the Pavilion of the Emperor . Here he passed many hours of uninterrupted solitude , in profound study of his majestic plans and enterprises . Directly behind the chateau there was a smooth and beautiful lawn , upon a level with the ground floor of the main saloon . The windows , extending to the floor , opened upon this lawn . When all the kings of Europe were doing homage to the mighty emperor , crowds of visitors were often assembled at Malmaison ; and upon this lawn , with the characteristic gayety of the French , many mirthful games were enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frequently , after dinner , the most distinguished gentlemen and ladies , not of France only , but of all Europe , were actively and mirthfully engaged in this sport . Kings and queens , and princes of the blood royal were seen upon the green esplanade , pursuing and pursued . Napoleon occasionally joined in the sport . He was a poor runner , and not unfrequently fell and rolled over upon the grass , while he and his companions were convulsed with laughter . Josephine , fond of deeds of benevolence , loved to visit the cottages in the vicinity of Malmaison ; and her sympathy and kindness gave her enthronement in the hearts of all their inmates . After the divorce of Josephine , the Palace of Malmaison , which Napoleon had embellished with all those attractions which he thought could soothe the anguish of his wounded , weeping , discarded wife , was assigned to Josephine . A jointure of six hundred thousand dollars a year was settled upon her , and she retained the title and the rank of Empress Queen . Here Napoleon frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he never saw her alone . Taking her arm , he would walk for hours through those embowered avenues , confiding to her all his plans . Just before Napoleon set out for his fatal campaign to Russia , he called to see Josephine . Taking her hand , he led her out to a circular seat in the garden , in front of the mansion , and for two hours continued engaged with her in the most earnest conversation . At last he rose and affectionately kissed her hand . She followed him to his carriage and bade him adieu . This was their last interview but one . He soon returned a fugitive from Moscow . All Europe was in arms against him . He earuestly sought a hurried interview with the faithful wife of his youth in her retreat at Malmaison . As he gazed upon her beloved features , tenderly and sadly he exclaimed , " Josephine I have been as fortunate as was ever man upon the face of this earth . But in this hour , when a storm is gathering over my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you upon whom I can repose . " With a moistened eye he bade her farewell . They met not again . When the allied armies entered Paris a guard was sent , out of respect to Josephine , to protect Malmaison . The Emperor Alexander , with a number of illustrious guests , dined with the Empress Queen , and in the evening walked out upon the beautiful lawn . Josephine , whose health was shattered by sympathy and sorrow , took cold , and after the illness of a few days died . It was the 29th of May , 1814 . It was the serene and cloudless evening of a tranquil summer 's day . The windows of the apartment were open where the Empress was dying . The sun was silently sinking behind the trees of Malmaison , and its rays , struggling through the foliage , shone cheerfully upon the bed of death . The air was filled with the songs of birds , warbling , as it were , the vespers of Josephine 's most eventful life . Thus sweetly her gentle spirit sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ruel , about two miles from Malmaison , the mortal remains of this most lovely of women now slumber . A beautiful monument of white marTIlE INNER COURT OF THE LouvaR. // hIs , with a statue representing the Empress kneeling in her coronation robes , is erected over her burial place , with this simple but afli*cting inscription TO JOSEPHINE , BY EUGENE AND HORTENSE . It was a bright and beautiful morning when I took a carriage , with a friend , and set out from Paris to visit Malmaison . We had been informed that the property had passed into the hands of Christina , the Queen-Mother of Spain , and that she had given strict injunctions that no visitors should be admitted to the grounds . My great desire , however , to visit Malmaison induced me to make special efforts to accomplish the object . A recent rain had laid the dust , the trees were in full leag the grass was green and rich , the grain was waving in the wind , and the highly cultivated landscape surrounding Paris presented an aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury of the emotions which the scene inspired , till we came to the village of Ruel . A French village has no aspect of beauty . It is merely the narrow street of a city set down by itself in the country . The street is paved , the cheerless , tasteless houses are huddled as closely as possible together . There is no yard for shrubbery and flowers , apparently no garden , no barn-yards with lowing herds . The flowers of the empire have been garnered in the palaces of the kings . The taste of the empire has been concentrated upon the Tuileries , Versailles , St. Cloud , Fontainebleau , and none has been left to embellish the home of the peasant . The man who tills the field must toil day and night , with his wife , his daughter , and his donkey , to obtain food and clothing for his family , as animals . This centralization of taste and opulence in particular localities , is one of the greatest of national mistakes and wrongs . America has no Versailles . May God grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers have homes where poets would love to dwell . Their daughters trim the shrubbery in the yard , and cultivate the rose , and partake themselves of the purity and the refinement of the rural scenes in the midst of which they are reared . In the village of Ruel , so unattractive to one accustomed to the rich beauty of New England towns , we found the church , an old , cracked , mouldering and crumbling stone edifice , built five hundred years ago . It was picturesque in its aspect , venerable from its historical associations , and as poorly adapted as can well be imagined for any purposes to which we in America appropriate our churches . The floor was of crumbling stone , worn by the footfalls of five centuries . There were enormous pillars supporting the roof , alcoves running in here and there , a pulpit stuck like the mud nest of a swallow upon a rock . The village priest was there catechising the children . A large number of straight-backed , rush-bottomed chairs were scattered about in confusion , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-barbarian age , and adapted to a style of worship in which the pomp of paganism and a corrupted Christianity were blended , are to my mind gloomy memorials of days of darkness . Visions of hooded monks , of deluded penitents , of ignorant , joyless generations toiling painfully through them to the grave , impress and oppress the spirit . In one corner of the church , occupying a space some twenty feet square , we saw the beautiful monument reared by Eugene and Hortense to their mother . It was indeed a privilege to stand by the grave of Josephine ; there to meditate upon life 's vicissitudes , there to breathe the prayer for preparation for that world of spirits to which Josephine has gone . How faithful her earthly love ; how affecting her dying prayer ! clasping the miniature of the Emperor fervently to her bosom , she exclaimed , " 0 God ! watch over Napoleon while he remains in the desert of this world . Alas ! though he bath committed great faults , bath he not expiated them by great sufferings Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hast seen by how ardent a desire for useful and durable improvements he was animated ! Deign to approve my last petition . And may this image of my husband bear me witness that my latest wish and my latest prayer were for him and for my children . " As the Emperor Alexander gazed upon her lifeless remains , he exclaimed , " She is no more ; that woman whom France named the Beneficent ; that angel of goodness is no more . Those who have known Josephine can never forget her . She dies regretted by her offspring , her friends , and her contemporaries . " In the same church , opposite to the tomb of Josephine , stands the monument of her daughter Hortense . Her life was another of those tragedies of which this world has been so full . Her son , the present President of France , has reared to her memory a tasteful monument of various colored marble , emblematic , as it were , of the vicissitudes of her eventful life . The monument bears the inscription- " To Queen Hortense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling in sorrowful meditation . As I stood by their silent monuments , and thought of the bodies mouldering to dust beneath them , the beautiful lines of Kirke White rose most forcibly to my mind : " Life 's labor done , securely laid In this their last retreat , Unlieeded o'er their silent dust The storms of life shall beat . " From Ruel we rode slowly along , through vineyards and fields of grain , with neither hedges nor fences to obstruct the view , for about two miles , when we arrived at the stone wall and iron entrance-gate of the chateau of Malmaison . The concierge , a pleasant-looking woman , came from the porter 's lodge , and looking through the bars of the gate very politely and kindly told us that we could not be admitted . I gave her my passport , my card , and a copy of the Life of Josephine , which I had writter in America , and requested her to take them te iho head man of the // establishment , and to say to him that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to France to visit localities which had been made memorable by Napoleon and Josephine , and that I was exceedingly desirous to see Malmaison . The good woman most obligingly took my parcel , and tripping away as lightly as a girl , disappeared in the windings of the well-graveled avenue , skirted with trees and shrubbery . In about ten minutes she returned , and smiling and shaking her head , said that the orders were positive , and that we could not be admitted . I then wrote a note to the keeper , in French , which I fear was not very classical , informing him " that I was writing the life of Napoleon ; that it was a matter of great importance that I should see Malmaison , his favorite residence ; that I had recently been favored with a private audience with the Prince President , and that he had assured me that he would do every thing in his power to facilitate my investigations , and that he would give me free access to all sources of information . But that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I bad made no efforts to obtain from the French authorities a ticket of admission . " Then for the first time I reflected that the proper course for me to have pursued was to have called upon the Spanish embassador , a very gentlemanly and obliging man , who would unquestionably have removed every obstacle from my way . Giving the good woman a franc to quicken her steps , again she disappeared , and after a considerable lapse of time came back , accompanied by the keeper . He was a plain , pleasant-looking man , and instead of addressing me with that angry rebuff , which , in all probability in America one , under similar circumstances , would have encountered , he politely touched his hat , and begged that I would not consider his refusal as caprice in him , but %hat the Queen of Spain did not allow any visitors to enter the grounds of Malmaison . The French are so polite , that an American is often mortified by the consciousness of his own want of corresponding courtesy . Assuming , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely touched my hat , and said : " My dear sir , is it not rather a hard case 3 I have crossed three thousand miles of stormy ocean to see Malmaison . Here I am at the very gate of the park , and these iron bars wo n't let me in . " The kindhearted man hesitated for a moment , looked down upon the ground as if deeply thinking , and then said , " Let me see your passports again , if you please . " My companion eagerly drew out his passport , and pointed to the cabalistic words " Bearer of dispatches . " Whether this were the talisman which at last touched the heart of our friend I know not , but suddenly relenting he exclaimed , with a good-natured smile , " Eh bien ! Messieurs , entrez , entrez , " and rolling the iron gate back upon its hinges , we found ourselves in the enchanting park of Malmaison . Passing along a beautiful serpentine avenue , embowered in trees and shrubbery , and presenting a scene of very attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comfortable home-like chateau . A pleasant garden , smiling with flowers . bloomed in solitude before the windows of the saloon , and a statue of Napoleon , in his familiar form , was standing silently there . An indiscribable air of loneliness and yet of loveliness was spread over the scene . It was one of the most lovely of May days . Nearly all the voices of nature are pensive ; the sighing of the zephyr and the wailing of the tempest , the trickling of the rill and the roar of the ocean , the vesper of the robin and the midnight cry of the wild beast in his lair . Nature this morning and in this scene displayed her mood of most plaintive pathos . There was Napoleon , standing in solitude in the garden . All was silence around him . The chateau was empty and deserted . Josephine and Hortense were mouldering to dust in the damp tombs of Ruel . The passing breeze rustled the leaves of the forest , and the birds with gushes of melody sung their touching requiems . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I freely wept 3 No ! For there are thousands who will read this page who will sympathize with me in these feelings , and who will mingle their tears with mine . We entered the house , and walked from room to room through all its apartments . Here was the library of Napoleon , for he loved books . Christina has converted it into a billiard-room , for she loves play . Here was the little boidoir where Napoleon and Josephine met in their hours of sacred confidence , and the tapestry and the window curtains , in their simplicity , remain as arranged by Josephine 's own hands . Here is the chamber in which Josephine died , and the very bed upon which she breathed her last . The afternoon sun was shining brilliantly in thorough the windows , which we had thrown open , as it shone forty years ago upon the wasted form and pallid cheek of the dying Josephine . The forest , so secluded and beautiful , waved brightly in the sun and in the breeze then as now ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scene of nature and of art-house , lawn , shrubbery , grove , cascade , grotto - remains unchanged ; but the billows of revolution and death have rolled over the world-renowned inmates of Malmaison , and they are all swept away . An old-serving man , eighty years of age , conducted us through the silent and deserted apartments . The affection with which he spoke of Napoleon and of Josephine amounted almost to adoration . He was in their service when the Emperor and Empress , arm-in-arm , sauntered through these apartments and these shady walks . There must have been some most extraordinary fascination in Napoleon , by which he bound to him so tenaciously all those who were brought near his person . His history in that respect is without a parallel . No mortal man , before or since , has been so enthusiastically loved . The column in the Place Vendome is still hung with garlands of flowers by the hand of affection . It is hardly too much to say , that the spirit of // Napoleon , emerging from his monumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome of the Invalids , still reigns in have seen in France has interested me so much France . Louis Napoleon is nothing in himself . as Malmaison . Galignani 's Guide-Book says : His power is but the reflected power of the " The park and extensive gardens in which Emperor . Josephine took so much delight are nearly de- qwq 4 . The Tuilerscs. - " Will Prince Louis Napoleon , " inquired a gentleman , of a French lady , " take up his residence in the Tuileries * " " He had better not , " was the laconic reply . " It is an unlucky place . " It requires not a little effort of imagination to invest this enormous pile of blackened buildings with an aspect of beauty . Three hundred years ago the palace was commenced by Catherine de Medici . But it has never been a favorite residence of the kings of France , and no effort of the imagination , and no concomitants of regal splendor can make it an agreeable home . It has probably witnessed more scenes of woe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace upon the surface of the globe . Its rooms are of spacious , lofty , cheerless grandeur . Though millions have been expended upon this structure , it has had but occasional occupants . A few evenings ago I was honored with an invitation to a party given by Prince Louis Napoleon in the palace of the Tuileries . Four thousand guests were invited . The vast palace , had all its rooms been thrown open , might perhaps have accommodated twice as many more . When I arrived at half-past nine o'clock at the massive gateway which opens an entrance to the court of the Tuileries , I found a band of soldiers stationed there to preserve order . Along the street , also , for some distance , armed sentinels were stationed on horseback , promptly to summon , in case of necessity , the 80,000 troops who , with spear and bayonet , keep the restless Parisians tranquil . The carriage , following a long train , and followed by a long train , entered , between files of soldiers with glittering bayonets , the immense court-yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forc. of the capital can there be assembled . The court-yard was illuminated with almost the brilliance of noon-day , by various pyramids of torches ; and dazzling light gleamed from the brilliant windows of the palace , proclaiming a scene of great splendor within . A band of musicians , stationed in the courtyard , pealed forth upon the night air the most animating strains of martial music . At the door , an armed sentry looked at my ticket of invitation , and I was ushered into a large hall . It was brilliantly lighted , and a swarm of servants , large , imposing-looking men in gorgeous livery . thronged it . One of these servants very respectfully conducted the guest through the ball to a spacious ante-room . This room also was dazzling with light , and numerous servants were there to take the outer garments of the guests , and to give them tickets in return . My number was 2004 . We then ascended a magnificent flight of marble stairs , so wide that twenty men could , with ease , maTch up them abreast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TUILERIES. // glittering bayonets . We were ushered into the suit of grand saloons extending in long perspective , with regal splendor . Innumerable chandeliers suspended from the lofty gilded ceilings , threw floods of light upon the brilliant throng which crowded this abode of royalty . In two different saloons bands of musicians were stationed , and their liquid notes floated through the hum of general conversation Men of lofty lineage were there , rejoicing in their illustrious birth , and bearing upon their breasts the jeweled insignia of their rank . Generals of armies were there , decorated with garments inwoven with gold . Ladies , almost aerial in their gossamer robes , floated like visions through the animated assembly . Occasionally the dense throng was pressed aside , and a little space made for the dancers . The rooms were warm , the crowd immense , the champagne abundant , and the dancers seemed elated and happy . As the hours of the night wore away , and the throng was a little diminished , and the bottles emptied , I thought that I could perceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of fervor . I must confess that , with my Puritan notions , I should not like to see a friend of mine , whose maiden delicacy I desired to cherish , exposed to such hugs and such twirls . About half-past ten o'clock , a wide door was thrown open at one end of the long suit of rooms , and the Prince President , accompanied by a long retinue of lords , ladies , embassadors , &amp;c. , entered the apartments . They passed along through the crowd , which opened respectfully before them , and entering one of the main saloons , took their seats upon an elevated platform , which had been arranged and reserved for them . All eyes were fastened upon the President . Every one seemed to feel an intense curiosity to see him . Wherever he moved , a circle , about ten feet in diameter , was left around him . It was curious to see the promptness with which the crowd woul I disperse before him , and close up behind him , whenever he changed his position . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the two ends of the suit of apartments , filled with guests . These rooms of vast capacity-for four thousand hun , , ry people were to be provided for-were fitted up with counters running along three of their sides like those of a shop . Behind these tounters stood an army of waiters ; before them , *. ll the evening lcng , a eager crowd . As soon as one had obtained his supply , there were two or three others ready to take his place . In one of the rooms there were provided wines , meats of all kinds , and a most luxurious variety of substantial viands . In the other refreshmentroom , at the other end of the thronged apartments , there were ices , confectionery , fruits , and all the delicacies of the dessert . This was seeing the Palace of the Tuileries in all its glory . Embassadors of all nations were there  --  the turbaned Turk , the proud Persian , the white-robed Arab . Many of the la4ies were glittering with diamonds and every variety of precious stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andall went merry as a marriage bell . " But as I sauntered through the brilliant scene , visions of other days , and of spectacles more impressive , filled my mind . Through these very halls , again and again , has rolled an inundation of all that Paris can furnish of vulgarity , degradation , and violence . Into the embrasure of this very window the drunken mob of men and women drove , with oaths and clubs , Louis XVI. , and compelled him to drink the cup of humiliation to its very dregs . It was from this window that the hapless Maria Antoinette looked , when the sentinel beneath brutally exclaimed to her , " I wish , Austrian woman , that I had youi head upon my bayonet here , that I might pitch it over the wall to the dogs in the street ! " It was upon this balcony that the sainted Madame Elizabeth and Maria Antoinette stepped , that dark and dreadful night when frenzied Paris , from all its garrets , and all its kennels , was surging like the billows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terror as they heard the tolling of the alarm bells , the rumbling of artillery wheels , and the rattle of musketry , as the infuriate populace thronged the palace , thirsting for their blood . From this balcony that awful night , Maria entered the chamber where her beautiful son was sleeping , gazed earnestly upon him , and left a mother 's loving kiss upon his cheek . She then went to the apartment of her daughter . The beautiful child , fifteen years of age , comprehentling the peril of the hour , could not sleep . Maria pressed her to her throbbing heart , and a mother 's tenderness triumphed over the stoicism of the Queen . Her pent-up feelings burst through all restraints , and she wept with anguish unendurable . The Tuileries It is , indeed , an " unlucky palace . " This saloon , now resounding with music and mirth , is the very spot where Josephine , with swollen eyes and heart of agony , signed that cruel deed of divorcement which sundered the dearest hopes and the fondest ties which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more affecting incident than her final adieu to her husband , which occurred in this chamber the night after the divorce . The Emperor , restless and wretched , had just placed himself in the bed from which he had ejected his faithful wife , when the door of his chamber was slowly opened , and Josephine tremblingly entered . She tottered into the middle of the room , and approached the bed . Here , irresolutely stopping , she burst into a flood of tears . She seemed for a moment to reflect that it was no longer proper for her to approach the bed of Napoleon . But suddenly the pent-up fountains of love and grief in her heart burst forth ; and , forgetting every thing , in the fullness of her anguish , she threw herself upon the bed , clasped Napoleon 's neck in her arms , and exclaiming , " My husband ! my husband ! " wept in agony whicll could not be // mutrolled . The firm spirit of Napoleon was vanquished : he folded her to his bosom , pressed her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He assured her of his love , of his ardent and undying love , and endeavored in every way to sooth her anguish . It was down this marble staircase , now thronged with brilliant guests , that the next morning Josephine descended , vailed from head to foot . Her grief was too deep for utterance . Waving an adieu to the affectionate and weeping friends who surrounded her , she entered her carriage , sank back upon the cushion , buried her face in her handkerchief , and , sobbing bitterly , left the Tuileries forever . It is not probable that tbe Tuileries will ever again be inhabited by royalty . 5 . The Palece Elys*e. - . This is a beautiful rural home in the very heart of Paris . It is now occupied by Prince Louis Napoleon . For a regal residence it is quite unostentatious , and few abodes could any where be found , comolning more attractions , for one of refined and simple tastes . Through the kindness of our minister , Mr. Rives , I obtained an audience with Count Roguet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through him secured an " audience particulidre " with Prince Louis Napoleon in the Elys6e . As I alighted from a hackney-coach at the massive gateway of the palace , armed sentinels were walking to and fro upon the pavements , surrounding the whole inclosure of the palace with a vigilant guard . At the open iron gate two more were stationed . I passed between their bayonets and was directed into a small office where a dignifled-looking official examined my credentials , and then pointed my steps along the spacious court-yard to the door of the mansion . Armed soldiers were walking their patrols along the yard , and upon the flight of steps two stood guarding the door , with their glittering steel . They glanced at my note of invitation , and I 327 There are too many mournful associations connected with the place ever to render it agreeable as a residence . When Louis Philippe was driven from the Tuileries , the mob again sacked it , and its vast saloons are unfurnished and empty . Four years ago , the Provisional Government passed a decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalid workmen . The Provisional Government , however , has passed away , and the decree has not been carried into effect . After the insurrection in June of 1848 it was used as a hospital for the wounded . More recently it has been used as a museum for the exhibition of paintings . Its days of regal pride and splendor have now passed away for ever . entered the door . Several servants were there evidently picked men , large and imposing ii figure , dressed in small-clothes , and silk stock ings , and laced with rich livery . One glancel at my letter , and conducting me across the hall introduced me into another room . There I found another set of servants and three clerks writing at a long table . One took my note of invitation and sat down , as if to copy it , and I was ushered into the third room . This was a large room in the interior of the palace , richly ornamented with gilded pilasters and ceiling . The walls were painted with landscapes , representing many scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come before me , waiting for an audience . Some were nobles , with the full display upon their breasts of the decorations of their rank . Others were generals , in brilliant military costume . Several I observed with the modest red ribbon in the button hole , indicating that they were members of the Legion of Honor . All spoke in low and subdued tones of voice , and with soft footsteps moved about the room . Occasionally , an officer of the household would enter the room with a paper in his hands , apparently containing a list GRAND AVENUE OF ' TEE TUiLEETES. // of the names of those who had arrived , and softly would call out the name of one , who immediately followed him into another room . As I at once saw that I had at least an hour to wait in the ante-room , I turned my thoughts to the scenes which , in years gone by , have transpired in this palace of Elysium . Nearly 150 years ago , the Count of Evreux built it for his aristocratic city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautified for the residence of Madame de Pompadour , the frail , voluptuous , intriguing paramour of Louis XV. ; and often have they , arm-in-arm , paced this floor . They have passed out at these open French windows into the beautiful lawn which spreads before the mansion , and sauntered until lost in the wilderness of fountains , flowers , shrubbery , grove , and serpentine walks which spread over these enchanting grounds . But inexorable death struck down both king and mistress , and they passed away to the Judgment . The Revolution came , the awful retribution for centuries of kingly pride and oppression , and the regal palace became a printing-office for the irreligion of Voltaire , and the Jacobinism of Marat . These saloons and houdoirs were turned into eating rooms , and smoking rooms . The girls of the street crowded this spacious parlor , and where kings and queens had danced before them , they proudly danced with libert* , fraterniti , igaliti , in red cap and blouse . Then came the young soldier from Corsica , and with a whip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . By his side stands the tall , athletic , mustached inn-keeper 's boy , who had learned to ride when grooming the horses of his father 's guests . With his whirlwind cloud of cavalry he had swept Italy and Egypt , and now enriched and powerful , Murat claims the hand of Caroline Bonaparte , the sister of the great conqueror . With his bride he takes the palace of the Elys6e , and lives here in extravagance which even Louis XV . could not surpass . These paintings on the wall , Murat placed here . These pyramids of Egypt ever remind his guests that Murat , with his crushing squadrons , trampled down the defiant Mamelukes upon the Nile . This lady , walking beneath the trees of the forest , is Caroline , his wife . The children filling this carriage so joyously , are his sons and daughters . But he who had crowns at his disposal , places his brother-in-law upon the throne of Naples , and Napoleon himself chooses this charming spot for his favorite city residence . Weary with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these shady bowers . But allied Europe drove him from his Elysium , and the combined forces of Russia , Prussia , and Austria , take possession of the capital of his empire , and reinstate the Bourbons upon the throne from which th' v had been driven . Napoleon returns from Elba , and again hastens to his beloved Elysie . A hundred days glide swiftly by , and he is a prisoner , bound to St. Helena , to die a captive in a dilapidated stable . As I was reflecting upon the changes , and upon the painful contrast which must have presented itself to Napoleon , between the tasteful and exquisite seclusion of the Elysie , and the cheerless , barren , mist-enveloped rock of St. Helena , I was awakened from my reverie by a low tone of voice calling my name . I followed the messenger through a door , expecting to enter the presence of Louis Napoleon . Instead of that I was ushered into a large , elegantly furnished saloon  --  the council chamber of the Emperor Napoleon , but it was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the account books of a merchant , lying open upon a table . The messenger who summoned me , with my note of invitation in his hand , went to the book , passed his finger down the page , and soon I saw it resting upon my name . He read , apparently , a brief description of my character , and then , leaving me alone , went into another room , I suppose to inform the President who was to be introduced to him . In a few moments he returned , and I was ushered into the presence of the Prince President of Republican France . He was seated in an arm-chair , at the side of a table covered with papers . Louis Napoleon is a small man , with a mild , liquid , rather languid eye , and a countenance expressive of much passive resolution rather than of active energy . In his address , he is courteous , gentle , and retiring , and those who know him best , assign him a far higher position in the grade of intellect than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is an utter despotism , sustained by the bayonets of the army . I have made great efforts , during the two months in which I have been in Paris , to ascertain the state of public opinion respecting the government of Louis Napoleon . Circumstances have thrown me much into French society , both into the society of those who are warm friends , and bitter enemies of the present government . So far as I can ascertain facts , they seem to be these . There are four parties who divide France  --  the Bourbonists , the Orleanists , the Socialists , and the Bonapartists . Like the military chieftains in Mexico , they are all struggling for dominion . There is not sufficient intelligence and virtue in France , for it to be governed by opinion , by a vote . The bayonet is the all-availing argument . If Louis Napoleon is overthrown , it must be to give place to some one , who , like him , must call the army and despotic power to his support . Consequently , multitudes say , What shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barricades in the street , new rivulets of blood trickling down our gutters , and simply another name in the Elysie. -I can see no indication that Louis Napoleon has any personal popularity . The glory of his uncle overshadows him and renders him available . The army and the church , but without any enthusiasm , are in his favor . Most of the men in active business who seek protection and good order , support his claims . The American merchants settled in Paris , generally feel that the overthrow of Louis Napoleon would be to them a serious calamity , and that they should hardly dare in // that case , to remain in Paris . His government Is submitted to , not merely as a choice of evils , but there is a kind of approval of his despotism as necessary to sustain him in power , and for the repose of France . I do not say that these dews are correct . I only say , that so far as I .. an learn , this appears to me to be the state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people regard Louis Napoleon with enthusiasm . At the great fete in the Champs Elys6e , which called all Europe to Paris , to witness the restoration of the ancient eagles of France to the standards of the army , it was almost universally supposed out of Paris , that the hundred thousand troops then passing in proud array before the President would hail him Emperor . A countless throng encircled the area of that vast field . It was estimated that nearly a million of people were there assembled . Yet when Louis Napoleon made his appearance with his brilliant staff , I did not hear one single citizen 's voice raised in applause . As he rode along the ranks of the army , a murmur of recognition followed his progress , but no shouts of enthusiasm . Immediately after the fite , a magnificent ball and entertainment were given by the army , to Prince Louis Napoleon . It is said , that one hundred and sixty thousand dollars were expended in canopying the vast court yard of the Ecole Militaire , and in decorating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene of brilliance and splendor , no pen can describe . About half-past twelve o'clock the President entered upon an elevated platform , accompanied by the foreign ministers and the members of his court . But not one single voice even shouted a welcome . He remained a couple of hours conversing with those around him , and then bowing to the enormous throng of those whose invited guest he was , retired . One man , by my side , shouted in a clear , shrill voice which filled the vast saloons , " Vive l'Empereur , " two others promptly responded , " Vive Napoleon . " No other acclaim was heard . The prospect of France is gloomy . Such a government as the present can not be popular . No other seems possible . No one seems to expect that the government can last for many years . And yet a change is dreaded . Rich men are transferring their property to England and America . Never did I love my own country as now . Never did I appreciate as now , the rich legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is centred in America . We must let Europe alone . To mortal vision her case is hopeless .

In half a century from now , the United States will be the most powerful nation upon which our son has ever shone . Then we can speak with a voice that shall be heard . Our advice will have the efficiency of commands . Europe now has VOL . V.-No. 27. -Y apparently but to choose between the evils Df despotism , and the evils of anarchy . And still it is undeniable that the progress , though slow and painful is steadily onward toward popular liberty . In this paper I have but commenced the description of the Palaces of France .
