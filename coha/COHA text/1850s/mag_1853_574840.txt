txt WORKS OF AMERICAN STATESMEN . E TOcQUEvILLE , who has written the JJ appreciative book on the United States that has been published , yet falls into many errors , among which we are disposed to class what he says of our want of permanent national records . His words are these : The public administration ( of the United States ) is oral and traditionary . But little is committed to writing , and that little is wafted away like the leaves of the Sibyl , by the smallest breeze . The only historical remains are the newspapers ; but , if a number be wanting , the chain of time is broken , and the Present is severed from the Past . I am convinced , that in fifty years it will be more difficult to collect authentic documents concerning the social condition of the Americans , at the present day , than it is to find the remains of the administration of France during the middle ages and , if the United States were ever invaded by barbarians , it would be necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn any thing of the people who now inhabit them . " It is a curious comment on this speculation of the distinguished Frenchman that we have , perhaps , more materials for the minute and faithful history of our political and social life , and for illustrating the characters of our great men , than any other nation ; and that the habit of preserving memorials , even insignificant ones , of public occurrences , as well as every trace of men who have made any conspicuous figure , is rather a vice than a deficiency of our literature . The voluminous correspondence of the revolutionary worthies , from Washington and Franklin down to the obscurer personages of their time ; the private memoirs , that the families , or friends , of the Adamses Morris , Livingston , Jay , Story , Randolph , Jefferson , and Hamilton , have so carefully compiled : the labored collections of the Historical Societies of the several States , extending to tracts , pamphlets , maps , state papers and books ; the records of local celebrations and festivities preserved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the newspapers , of which , in their multiplicity , there is no fear , as*e Tocqueville somewhat ludicrously intimates , that the issue of a single day will be lost , to break the chain of events-are so many hostages taken of Time to secure us against his fatal inroads . We are reminded also of another refutation of the remark we have quoted , by a series of the " Works " of some of our eminent later statesmen , put forth by themselves or their admirers , to give extension and permanence to whatever they may have said or done worthy of more than transient notice . There is now lying before us a score of volumes , issued within the last few months , which contain the speeches and writings of Levi Woodhury , William H. Seward , Henry Clay , John C. Calhoun , and Daniel Webster , tobether with attempts , more or less elaborate , in the form of biographies and notes , to convey " to other nations and to future times " some knowledge of their deeds and characters . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting mainly of his speeches as Senator , his reports as Secretary of the Treasury , and his occasional addresses ; Mr. Seward appears in three large tomes , similarly filled ; Mr. Clay in two , chiefly of speeches ; Mr. Calhoun in one , containing his dissertation on the Constitution , to be followed by two other volumes of reports and speeches ; and Mr. Webster in six , embracing his orations , diplomatic papers , forensic arguments , and debates . There is , therefore , // great similarity in the subject-matter of these publications ; but that fact rather heightens than impairs their utility , at least in a historical sense , because it furnishes us with the views of several different minds , in respect to the same great questions and events . Embraciab as they do , moreover , discussions of nearly all the more important issues that have arisen since the origin of our democratic government and under the peculiar structure of our mixed societies-questions of agriculture , industry , education and religion , as well as of State and Federal politics ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they caused , applying the best energies of mind and heart to the peaceful solution of each as it arose , they not only secure us , so far as they go , from the reproach of De Tocqueville , but are valuable contributions to letters , as well as to history . For , it should be remembered that the literature of a nation is not confined to magazines , books , journals and poems , or to those forms in which the intellectual life of a people is ordinarily expressed . All sincere and vigorous utterances of national feeling and thought , become , when recorded , a part of that literature . Political debates , especially in a nation where the powers and attainments of men are almost universally devoted to active pursuits , as they are with us , are likely to be a most original and vital part of it , and springing warm from the brains of foremost men , under the impulse of great exigencies , when their abilities are taxed to the highest extent , to overcome opposition , and to bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , freedom , and depth of purpose , which we do not always find in the colder essays of the professed man of letters . At least they will be truer to the form and pressure of the time , though , perhaps , less marked by scholastic perfections . The editors of these books then have , in our opinion , rightly called them " Works ; " for the men from whom they came were not only legislators , orators , magistrates , but authors as well . They did not , it is true , aim at literary reputation , yet their efforts have the characteristics of literary performances ; they are an expression of our national peculiarities ; they abound in pleasant narratives of facts , skilful dialectics , comprebensive and close argument , impassioned eloquence , and sarcastic retort ; and have a value beyond the occasion or interest in which they originated . Nor should we omit to mention the special interest which is communicated to these volumes by the f t , that the authors of them were rivals and competitors in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in those athletic grapplings of mind with mind , which have illustrated the history of parties for the last half cen tury , their books may be said , now that they have departed from the scene to renew their struggles . Recalling the ma*nificent picture of the great German painter , Kaulbach , descriptive of the battle of the iluns , the spirits of the combatants , thus when their bodies are laid in their dust , arise once more and resume the battle in the air . But we have this advantage in the books , that the ferocity and bitterness of the original strife are laid aside , and only the real life , the essential spirit of the conflict remains . Mr. Woodhury , the first on our list , was not a man who widely influenced his day and generation , and we may dismiss him in a few words . As a Senator of the United States , in which capacity he served for some years ; as Secretary of the Treasury during the administration of Mr. Van Buren , and latterly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he served his party with diligence , and was evidently a man of solid judgment and sincere faith in his opinions ; but he was scarcely a leader out of the small State of New Hampshire , in which he lived , and he never rose to such eminence as to become the representative of any distinctive or vital policy . He wrote with vigor , but yet without much grace or facility : his sentences are cumbrous ; what he saw clearly even , he did not always state clearly ; and when he seeks to illustrate a position , he rather overloads it with commonplace ornament than simplifies it by apt and lucid figures . A politician and a jurist , the habit of his mind was that of reserve and caution so that the propositions he utters come to us with so many qualifying phrases ,  - -  with so many * buts and provideds , that they are shorn of their strength , and are often more of a puzzle than an in-ipulse to the intellect . At the same time Justice Woodbury had strong popular sympathies , cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost , in his hopes of human progress , and only needed to surrender himself more entirely to the inspirations of this side of his nature , to have been an eloquent writer and a great man . Mr. Seward , we think , a higher order of mind , not because he is more comprehensive or profound , but because he has a finer fibre of brain , and rises more easily into the region of general principles . He is a yet living statesman , // surrounded by preposessions and hostilities , and we are therefore aware that our estimate of him may be influenced by current prejudices ; but we have read his writings attentively , and are prepared to give an honest judgment as to his merits . Most men , engaged in the actual contests of politics , are liable to be overrated by their friends , and underrated by their enemies ; but the peculiarity of Mr. Seward 's case has been that he has reversed the process , and , if not underrated by his friends , is at least overrated by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposition that he has encountered , have given him a prestige beyond the influence he is entitled to by his real abilities . The masses of the people hearing him decried so vehemently as a most dangerous fellow the contriver of every nefarious plot , and the secret agent of every disorgamzmg movement , are apt to take his opponents at their word , and to believe that one who is so fertile in expedients and so hard to baffle , must be a prodigious worker , destined sooner or later to the most commanding sway . Men admire success , and even the reputation of it , and have a secret liking for those who are roundly abused ; a fact which was evidenced in another case lately , that of Martin Van Buren , who was indebted as much to the magical influence his foes ascribed to him , as to the attachment of his friends or his native sagacity , for any elevation that he attained . Give a man a name for miraculous shrewdness and management , and you give him a host of friends ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own , to almost any advancement . The characteristics of Mr. Seward 's mind are clearness , activity and cunning , to use the term in its best sense . He grasps his subjects sharply , with penetration as well as power , manages them with subtle and quick dexterity , and being of a sanguine temperament , never wearies of the labor of elucidation and display . His logic is not of the close and compact sort which may be compared to mailed armor , impregnable to all assaults , for it is rather demonstrative than convincing , and consists more in the adroit linking together of facts , than the rigid deduction of principles . But he has great facility of expression , both as a writer and speaker ; is always perspicuous , generally pleasing , and sometimes eloquent ; he has read considerably , and understandingly ; and his style , without being idiomatic or classical , is not offensively incorrect . He avoids , for the most part , excessive ornament , that turgid floridity so common to our orators ; yet there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , languid wordiness in his hastier efforts which greatly debilitate their strength . lie expatiates too much , is too long in covering his ground , and is apt to be tedious when he ought to be concise . Had he compressed what he has published into one-third the space , he might have said every thing that he has now said , and much better . Nor is it any excuse for this carelessness of composition , to say that his addresses and letters were prepared in the midst of active occupations , on the spur of the moment , and without time for that ii ? nae labor which gives the last finish to language . This might have been an excuse for them , as originally uttered but not for them as deliberately collected and edited . Besides , it is not impossible to acquire a compact , precise and simple style , even in extemporaneous effusions  --  to make compression the habit of the mind  --  and when we consider what a lasting charm it lends to speech , the neglect of it , especially by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , seems a strange oversight . There is another defect of his compositions , arising partly in the same causes which produce diffuseness , and partly in a limited range of cultivation , which is , the use of worn and current metaphors , or commonplace turns of expression . Not remarkably original in his views , he is less so in his language . We miss that nice choice of words , those racy , idiomatic phrases , those graceftil or happy allusions , those pregnant epithets , which condense a whole argument into a word , and those novel and picturesque suggestions , relieving the weight of argument , which proclaim a thorough master of his art . Yet Mr. Seward goes far towards supplying the place of these finer strokes of genius by his amiable and conciliating manner , a temper singularly free from gall , his vivacious readiness , and his elastic , almost exuberant , vitality , answering the purpose of a genuine enthusiasm . If he does not produce deep and vivid impressions , he carries his readers with him by the lucidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meets difficulties and announces principles , and his obvious command of his position . Never impassioned , even in his most declamatory passages , he is yet always animated and fresh , full of hope , and thoroughly American . It is no part of our duty , as reviewers , to question the sincerity of Mr. Seward 's convictions , as the politicians are prone to do ; the less so , as we find his opinions cohering in a very intelligent and consistent system of political doctrine . Nor do // his volumes furnish us any occasion for doubting the perfectly unaffected nature of his popular tendencies , because he every where expresses his opinions frankly , even in the face of a known hostile sentiment . At the same time , we must say that we often rise from reading him with a stronger impression of his adroitness than of his soundness . We do not detect him in any of the meaner arts of the demagogue , can not lay our hands upon any single act of political trimming , but , on the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a manly assertion often of generous though unaccepted doctrines ; and yet we fear the while that his virtue is not of that incorrigible and losing sort , which would prefer , with old Andrew Marvell , " to scrape a blade bone of cold mutton " in a garret , to faring sumptuously in the palace of the king . Our utter disareement with the school of statesmen to which Mr. Seward belongs , may doubtless account for this uneasy feeling , as one is ever inclined to distrust the men whose principles he rejects . The school we allude to is that which tends to aggrandize government at the expense of the spontaneous action of the people , and make the state a sort of omnipotent and omnipresent , and consequently omnivorous power in society  --  a Jack-of-all-trades , a beneficent Providence , a Lady Bountiful of the parish , a supreme moralist , a universal pedagogue , and a high Justice Rotulorum as well as a low catchpole . In other words , it comprises within the sphere of government every function almost of society and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate commerce , encourage trade , equip steamships , promote agriculture , educate children , and , we suppose , support the poor ,  --  and all in addition to its ordinary and more legitimate duties of protecting , on terms of perfect equality and right , the persons and property of its citizens ! Now is it not obvious at a glance , that this theory of the objects of legislation , whatever advantages it may have in other respects , opens the way to enormous abuses , in* viting the assaults of schemers and profligates , and inflaming while it debases the contests of parties ? Wherever it is adopted , a state must come to be looked upon , not as the arbiter of an absolute justice between man and man , but as the dispenser of corrupt and mercenary favors ; and those statesmen who make thems*dves conspicuous in bending legislation from its lofty , important and true ends , to the advancement of local and individual privileges , must inevitably excite against themselves the suspicion of a sinister and unworthy motive . Of course that suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be denied . Only a man of Washington 's continence , or of Hampden 's integrity , could escape the taint of the imputation ; and Mr. Seward therefore , who has long been active in pushing projects of one-sided benefit should not complain if the public , in spite of his nobler and liberal performances , in the cause of universal human freedom , should confound his motives with those of his sordid clients . The whole system of special legislation and patronage , in our view , is deplorably wrong , and those who dabble in it can hardly avoid defilement . We think this idea of the sphere of government is deplorably wrong , and yet we are not prepared to state with any precision where the limit of its action properly begins or ends . how much should be left to the individual , and hoiv much the state may legitimately do , is the great unadjusted question of political science . If we adopt the extreme democratic theory , which confines the state to the simple protection of person and property , or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we deprive ourselves of an important means of advancing individual and social welfare , which could not be so well advanced in any other way ; whilst , on the other hand , if we assume the unlimited authority of government to interpose in every subject of public concern , we can not stop short either of gross despotism or gross corruption . The liberty of the citizen to achieve his own fortune in his own way , prOvi ( lCd he does not infringe on the same right in *others , ought to be sacred under all circumstances ; yet , who will deny that there are objects of vast general utility , " enterprises of pith and moment , " which can not or will not be accomplished , if abandoned to the voluntary efforts of individuals . Take a case in point , of immense interest just now ,  --  the railroad to the Pacific ! Ought it to be undertaken by the government , or by individuals ? If you say by individuals , the reply is that it would require an outlay of labor and capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were such a prodigious company itself not a dangerous thing to create . Again , if you say by the government , you must see that it would inevitably lead to a most pernicious concentration of patronage , to a wholesale jobbing in the Legislature , and to acts ofaggravatedinjustice in respect to different localities . Who will draw the line , therefore , between what the state ought to do , and what it ought not ? Who will tell us how far the indi* // vidual ought to surrender to society , or where its interference is an encroachment or where a right ? Every body admits that society ought to punish crime , for without such discipline , the continued existence of society would be impossible  --  but ought it not then for a stronger reason , to institute means for the prevention of crime - to guarantee the poor against anxiety and dependence , the most prolific causes of crime ; to educate the ignorant ; to remove the means of temptation , and to encourage virtue in every way ? You answer yes ! Then why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient agent of social regeneration ? But by establishing a religion you are a long way on towards despotism . Or to reverse the process of the argument , we may say , that if you leave religion to the voluntary action of the people , why not the whole subject of education ; why not the support of the insane and , poor ; why not the organization of the police ; why not the line of coast defences ; in short , why have any government at all , why not surrender the care of every interest of society to voluntary action ? But this would be anarchy , and thus on either hypothesis we fluctuate from one extreme to the other until our faith in the existence of any stable political science is quite lost . In reality there is no fixed political science , no absolute and unchangeable principles , that have yet been discovered : men and parties attach themselves to one side or the other , according to their constitutional tendencies , their education , or their interests ; and the violent contests which rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of right . Yet in the absence of a real and complete science , we think that both reason and experience are bringing us in the direction in which it lies . Every American now doubts that the world is governed too much ; every day proves that the people are to be trusted with larger measures of power , and a broader latitude of liberty , as they grow in intelligence andvirtue ; while the entire tendency of the age is towards the enfranchisement of society from old restrictive laws and fetters . The arrogant assumptions of the Church have long since been toppled down ; the pretensions of nobility and rank are crumbling away ; and ourfaith as wellas aspiration is , that every other barrier , in the way of complete individual freedom , will soon perish for ever . But this is a digression ; and we return to Mr. Seward , to say that the publication of his book will materially advance his reputation ; it will correct many false ideas that have gone abroad , and increase the general respect for his abilities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the next on our list , was by general consent the most finished and splendid orator of a nation , prolific of orators . Versatile , adroit , bold , profound , pathetic and imperious-a man of the noblest instincts , an able tactician , a far-sighted statesman . a born leader of men , - his eloquence was of that masterly order , which " wielded at will the fierce democratie " and commanded the selecter applause of listening senates . But great as was its influence on his contemporaries , and intense and fervent the admiration which it excited , it will be perpetuated , we suspect , rather as a remernbrance and a tradition , than as a still living power . The volumes in which it is recorded convey some idea of its combined fervor , grace , and force , but a most inadequate one . It is true , they are not like those skeletons of Whitfield 's sermons , which cause us to wonder how the man could have left such a reputationmere simulacra of the departed reality ; for they contain his arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , some indications of the large make and movement of the man ; but the charm and the spirit are gone . The flashing eye , the rich melodious voice , the commanding form , " the snowy front , curled with golden hair , " which gave them their original life , are gone ; and as we read them , we feel like those who walk through the cavern of some mighty magician-the tools and instruments of his spells are about us , his gems , his treasures his magic rings , his weird circles and diagrams ; in fine , all the evidences of his art  --  but the fire has gone out in his furnace , and he himself bath vanished into thin air . Both roof and door , and walls , are all of gold , But overgrown with dust and old decay . This is the disadvantage of the orator compared with the writer , that the best part of his performances escapes with the occasion ; and if he be an active politician . he has no time to compensate , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immaturity of his extemporaneous efforts . His words are given loosely to the wind . and the wind carries them , on its swif wings , to the distant interlunar caves , to be returned to him no more for ever . But the writer , ripened by nutritious culture , and purified from taint by the refining processes of his art , commits his treasures to the imperishable amber of books . Thus . being dead , he yet speaks , and , in addition to the effects he wrought while living and the honors he enjoyed , both diffusion and // perpetuity are given to his influence and his fame . Mr. Clay , perhaps , less than most other orators , requires to be embalmed in type , because his services as a statesman , though not always successful , were so largely beneficial , and actuated by such broad and ennobling views , that they have connected his name with the history of his country , and left an enduring mark upon its legislation . Yet , in spite of all this , we can not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal share of his time and talents which he allowed the cares of office , and the details of party management , to absorb . His endowments were so generous that he needed only to have nurtured and husbanded them , to have raised himself to the loftiest niche of cosmopolitan greatness . The love and admiration . which are now confined to his countrymen and his friends , would , in that case , have been expanded into the love and admiration of mankind ; and no position , in the universal respect , that it was possible for penetration , sagacity , vigorous powers of reason , affluent imagination , excellent sympathies and exalted aspirations to attain , could have been too exalted or permanent for his reach . Indeed , such were the capabilities of his nature , that with ample cultivation and a less careless expenditure of his means , old Greece might have been revived on this western continent , in the person of a second Pericles , and Rome renewed her youth in the splendors of a greater Cicero . We are rightly proud then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if no earthly excellence could satisfy us , the heart swells and thrills with an irrepressible emotion when it imagines what he might have been . Mr. Clay was the greatest of our postrevolutionary statesmen , and of those that went before , only Washington and Jefferson , are likely to have secured a more imperishable renown . But the great man of our past whom he most nearly resembled in genius and character , was Hamilton , whose work he may be said to have taken up where it was left , and to have carried on with even more indomitable purpose , and a more brilliant display of power . Cherishing the same tendencies toward a strong and splendid government , gifted with the same courteous and seductive personal qualities , dividing opposition by the assiduity of their address , and rallying support by their own exultant confidence in success ; alike bold , ambitious , and patriotic ,  --  they identified their names with every great question , both of domestic administration and of foreign policy , each in his day ; infused their own spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its opponents in check ; and after the glory of having founded our institutions , they share the next honor of having modified and controlled our character and development . It was the superior fortune of Mr. Clay , however , to have lived to the mellow fruitfulnes of his autumn : envious Death did not snatch him away untimely , while the glow of his young hopes was still fresh on his cheeks ; but full of honors , full of years , the little enmities of partisan warfare softened by his venerable ane , as the fierce heats of the sun are cooled by the coming night " Life 's blesoin*s all enjoyed , life 's labor done , Serenely to his final root he passed . " Mr. Calhoun , in respect to the preparation and finish of his works , enjoyed no inconsiderable advantage over Mr. Clay . Engaged , like him , for the greater part of his life in the arduous labors of leadership and office , yet the peculiar habits of his mind enabled him to preserve more pure and compact , and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never prevailed over his stern intellectual integrity . He read little , but reflected much , and when he spoke , which was not often , considering his multiplied opportunities , he spoke from a full mind , with extreme precision and directness , and always in view of some single and important end . His speeches , therefore , are models of chaste , severe , and cogent reasoning , and are no less complete as compositions than they are crowded as storehouses of thought . The intense will that pervades them , carrying the reader along with impetuous force , as if he were in the hands of a giant , stamps them with an individual and peculiar life . But Mr. Calhoun was permitted also , in his latter days , to embody in the permanent form of a treatise on government , the maturest results of his lifelong studies . Those original views of politics , which are scattered in incomplete expositions , through his reports and addresses , were thus condensed into an elaborate system , perfect in its parts , and finished as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political actions ; it explains whatever may have been supposed to be inconsistent in these ; and exhibits him to us as an acute and profound metaphysical philosopher as well as an orator and statesman .. The characteristics uniformly conceded to Mr. Calhoun , by men of all shades of Opinion , were , a powerful and subtle analytical intellect , a subdued and chastened but intense enthusiasm , fearless reliance upon the conclusions of his own mind , chivalric honor , and an almost seraphic purity of personal character . Another // June impression , however , was no less universal , that he carried his logical processes to an impracticable degree of refinement , allowing mere abstract speculations to override his more practical conclusions , while the earnestness of his convictions , hurrying him into local prejudices , narrowed his sympathies and blinded him to the broader interests of humanity . His Book strongly confirms , while it slightly relieves , this general estimate . It deepens our sense of his abilities , and also of the dangers they were exposed to from his metaphysics ; at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mere sectional bias , into a systematic principle . It is seen that a singular unity pervaded his opinions , which were legitimate outgrowths of his fundamental ideas , and in no sense transient or temporary feelings . He was the fanatic ,  --  using the word in no offensive sense ,  --  of his reason , and wherever that led him , he pursued it , regardless of the consequence . Two curious inconsistencies strike us in the intellectual constitution of Mr. Calhoun . Born in a region where the tropical sun is apt to ripen human passion into the rank luxuriance which it imparts to physical nature , he was yet the severest dialectician and the least ornamental writer among all our distinguished men . His style , though intense , was rigidly intellectual ,  --  plain , direct , cogent , sinewy , and unyielding . No flowers of fancy ever bloomed along its path ; it never wandered into rich meads or leafy woods ; but , arid and hot , like a way across the desert , it bore along its burdens of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade . The voluptuous life , the magnificence and pomp , the exuberant fulness and deep-toned harmonies of the Southern zones , seem not to have moved the springs of his being ,  --  never made his brain delirious or kindled his heart into poetry . As well might he have been born in Nova Zembla , or any where above the line of perpetual snow , as in the South , for any effect that it produced upon his imagination and fancy . On the contrary , the sobriquet given to him , of " the cast-iron man , " would show rather that he came out of the bowels of our rugged northern mountains ; for like iron he was capable of intense heat and a slight glow , but of no brilliancy or sparkle . Stern , dignified , and upright , he was at all times neither more nor less than the great Senator . A witticism , proceeding from his mouth , would have seemed a moral suicide ; and a capricious , fantastic , or grotesque conceit , the beginning of mental aberration . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his friends , neinhbors , and servants , he relaxed into some lambent play of the affections , but we who saw him only wrapped in his Senatorial robes , like a stern old Roman , must regard the report as a Straussian myth . The second peculiarity of Mr. Calhoun consisted in this ; - that he , the only one of our statesmen who defended the social anomaly of slavery , not as a political expedient or a necessity of circumstance , but as an intrinsic and actual good , yet passed his life in the elaboration of a scheme of government which should give the amplest security to individual freedom . A republican by conviction , as well as a democrat by party classification , he was so dissatisfied with that democracy which allows the majority of the people to rule , that he contrived an ingenious system of checks and negatives for protecting minorities against its unlimited and oppressive action . His posthumous treatise on Government has for its principal object a demonstration of the despotism of the many , and the absolute need of a constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible every man , should be represented . All the acumen of his analysis , all the craft and vigor of his logic , all his experience of affairs , and the untaxed energy of his imperious will , were turned to the elucidation and enforcement of these views , in the hope of restraining power and enlarging liberty . No man ever inveighed more vehemently than he against the encroachments of the State upon the rights of the citizen , except that when he depicted the blessings of slavery , he was equally vehement . He thus exhibited to the world the spectacle of a democrat who resisted the organized expression of the will of the majority , and a republican who consecrated his days to the support and extension of a state of society founded on the subjugation of one race by another . Nor was it less worthy of note , that his countrymen , convinced of his thorough simplicity and truthfulness , forgot the inconsistency of his opinions in their admiration of his character . Mr. Calhoun 's theory of government was simply this : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man prefers his own interests to the well-being of others , government is necessary to protect the social from the selfish propensity . But as its powers must be lodged in the hands of individuals who are equally prone to prefer their own interests to the general good , a constitution is necessary to restrain the government . How , then , is that constitution to be framed ? We see that it can only be administered by men ; and we soe too , that those men will be tempted by // the universal tendency of their natures to be unfaithful to their trusts ; by what contrivance then shall the public be secured against the abuse of their power , against extortion , oppression , and wrong ? Quis custodes custodiat ? If you say , by universal suffrage , you only substitute a dominant majority for your former authority , and which would have the same tendency to the misuse of its powers as any other irresponsible ruler . Nor would a free press be any restraint , because , firstly , it can not chan , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of govcrnments and constitutions originates ; and secondly , because the press always leans to the heavier side of the scale to the strongest interest or combination of interests , so that it exasperates rather than cures or palliates the evil . The only solution of the difficulty Mr. Calhoun finds in his doctrine of " concurrent majorities , " as opposed to numerical majorities , whereby he gives to separate parts or interests of society , a negative upon the oppressive action of the other parts or interests . Thus . iu the Roman republic , the power of the patricians , which would have been otherwise exorbitant . was restrained by the unqualified veto of the tribunes who represented the plebeian orders ; thus , in the Polish dict , each member had a liberuet veto an absolute negative upon the passage of offensive laws ; thus too , in the Iroquois confederacy or league of the Six Nations in our own history , each tribe possessed a power to resist its decisions ; and thus , in the United States he would ' have given a power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of grievance or outrage . This original and ingenious system , to which we only allude , not pretending to furnish even the meagrest outline of it , Mr. Calhoun developes with amazing energy of argument , while his incidental remarks in explanation , especially on the tyranny of majorities , the corruption of governments , and the odious practice known in this country as " the spoils , " are replete with the profoundest wisdom . But his system , as a whole , is in our opinion unsound in its premises , and impracticable in its applications . In the first place , we do not believe that government originates in this supposed conflict between the selfish and social propensities of mankind , but that it is as much an original impulse of nature as society itself . In other words we think , that the tendency of man to some form of unitary organizdtion is an instinct of his being , prior to all reflection , and as strong as his inmost soul ; for history has o'iven us no instance of society , even in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive of it as possible , without some kind of central authority and direction . Society , to be a society at all , i. e. , to act as a corporate existence in any sense , must also be a government , and that , too , whether we suppose its members to be the devils in hell , or angels in heaven . In the second place , admitting Mr. Calhoun 's notion of the predominance of the selfish propensity , it seems to us , that be does not allow sufficiently for those other , perhaps minor , tendencies which concur in mitigating and modifying its practical action , such as the affections which bind families and neighborhoods together , and even the governors to the governed  --  the natural sense of justice which restrains all men more or less-and the common interest which all men have in order , peace , and security . He takes his single principle , of the all-pervading force of individual selfishness , and pushes it to its conclusion without regard to opposing principles , or moderating circumstances . Again , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be runs into an impracticable conclusion , because his scheme , if carried out , could only result in anarchy . If you give to every interest in society a constitutional ability to arrest the action of the government , whenever it might please to withhold its concurrence from a law , we do not see how there could be any government at all . Some one or other of the parts would be for ever in conflict with the whole ; for though Mr. Calhoun alleges that the effect of his arranhement would only be to cause the different interests , portions or orders to desist from attempting to adopt any measure calculated to promote the prosperity of one or more by sacrificing that of the others and then to force them to unite in such measures as would promote the prosperity of all ,  - -  we are quite sure from the almost universal experience of our race in schemes of concerted action , that the practical operation would be an equilibrium with a yengeance ,  --  or no action at all . The case of a jury which he cites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in point , for the reason that a jury is chosen expressly on the ground that it has no interest in the verdict : but if we suppose that each of the twelve men who compose it had a separate personal interest to be determined , what would become of , not the unanimity only , but the concurrence ? A compromise , founded on the majority of their interests , is the nearest approach that they would be likely to make to any just decision . But while we are disinclined to adopt // the theory of Mr. Calhoun , we wish to rem ark that he seems to us to have been aiming at a most important principle in the sphere of political and social organization . It is this : The necessity of restricting the powers of our general governments , and of referring society back more and more to its local and individual elements . The leading peculiarity of our political system has been said to be the recognition of the township ; and we see no reason why the township itself should not be organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a larger scope to individual freedom , and at the same time provide for an affiliated or combined action . This , however , is not the place nor time for advancing new theories , and we return to our legitimate x ork . What Mr. Calhoun is supposed by many to have wanted , Mr. Webster had in perfection ; robust , broad , practical understanding . He was the personification of the Understanding , as distinnuished from the intuitive Reason and the creative Imagination . Our reading does not enable us to recall many men , of any epoch , more largely endowed with what is best expressed by the simple word , mind . There have boen many more brilliant men , men of more native original insight , of finer instincts of more versatile and comprehensive genius , of quicker and bolder and more susceptible imagination , of more delicate and irritable fancy , of loftier moral aspirations , but few of more masculine and reliable intellect . If we were required to designate him by a single phrase , we should say that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not , of course , be compared to Plato or Bacon , or any of that exalted order whose thought creates epochs in the history of the race ; nor yet to those commandin* geniuses of action , like C*sar or Napoleon , who handle nations as an artist handles his materials still less to the all-prevailing poets , the Shakspeares , Miltons , and Goethes , on whom the most exuberant measure of the divine glory is poured : for his faculties lay in a different line from all these ; his sphere was not that of creation , but of advocacy ; and we must look for his parallel , therefore , among the Ciceros , the Pitts , the Mirabeaus , the O'Connels , the Peels and the Clays of the Senate I-louse and the Forum . Less than some of them in certain respects , he is greater than either in others ; but for the union of stren , th with grace of intellect ,  --  for calm , easy dignity of manner ,  --  for ponderous facility of argumentation ,  --  for lawyer-like clearness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he occupies a position almost apart . deep on his front en aven , Deliberation sat , and public cars : With Atlantcan shoulders , fit to bear The wei*h*of mi bh tiest monarchies . " The late eulogists of Mr. Webster were fond of ccmparing him with Edmund Burke ; but , as we think , allowing for a certain resemblance between them , without a due and discriminating appreciation of their respective natures . Webster could never have spoken the speeches which grew out of the Warren Hastings affair , every sentence of which blazes with the splendors of a gorgeous rhetoric , nor written those burning and glowing reflections on the French Revolution , any more than Burke could have made that prodigious extempore reply to Mr. Hayne , so versatile , satiric , overwhelming and solemnly eloquent ; because they were men essentially different ; and the coupling of their names is suggestive mainly in the way of contrast . Webster possessed talent , but Burke genius . Burke , therefore , was the superior in imagination , in culture , in earnestness , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of style , in decorum and grave manly debate . The vocabulary of Burke was more rich and gorgeous ; that of Webster more chaste , terse , and manageable . Webster was pre-eminently an advocate , always argumentative , always collected , always addressing himself to the intellect , or to the feelings only so far as they might move the intellect ; Burke was a poet as well as an orator , irritable and impetuous , and operating through the will and fancy quite as much as the mind . Where Webster reasoned , Burke philosophized : where Webster was serene , equable , ponderous , dealing his blows almost unconsciously like an ancient catapult ; Burke was clamorous , fiery , multitudinous , rushing forward like his own " *vhirlwind of cavalry . " The one was Done in his grandeur and elegance , the other Corinthian in his elaboration and ornament . Webster was the Roman temple , stately , solid and massive ; Burke , the Gothic cathedral , fantastic , aspiring , arid many-colored . The sentences of Webster roll along like the blasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke are more like the echoes of an organ in some ancient minster . Webster advances , ill his heavy logical march , and his directness of purpose , like a C*sarean legion , close , , firm , serried , s quare ,  --  Burke like an oriental procession , with elephants and trophies , and the pomp of banners . it is implied in this parallel that Webster was deficient in imagination ; he was , however , not destitute of it , seeing that no man can be an orator at all without some degree of it ; but we mean to say , that his imagination fell short of the ample dimensions // of his other faculties . We use the term to designate that power of which the poets are " all compact , " which melts worlds of thought into a single phrase , which evokes a new Universe out of the commonest realities , which has an instant touch and feeling for all the subtle analogies of nature , which sees into the heart of things , and which , whenever it speaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought , melody , and tears . Every line almost of Shakspeare is pregnant with it , as for instance , when he says , " Our little life is rounded by a sleep , " on which Jean Paul always meditated when lie heard it , for three days : Homer exemplifies it , when the descent of the wrathful Apollo at noon is compared to the coming on of night : Dante , too , in that sad story of Francesca , which closes , " that day we read no more : " Byron in his " starry Galileo , " and our own Bryant when he hears in the domestic hum of the bee on the prairies " the tread of the advancing multitude which soon shall fill the borders . " Among orators , Burke , where he describes Hyder Ali , in his retreats , meditating vengeance on the Carnatic , as , " hanging like a cloud upon the declivities of the mountains , " gives a rare instance of this power . Mr. Webster in several places gives evidence of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill Monument : " Let it rise till it meet the sun in its coming : let the earliest light of the morning gild it , and parting day linger and play on its summit . " Again , speaking of the power of England , he says , " Her morning drum-beat , following the sun and keeping company with the hours circles the earth daily with one continuous and unbroken strain of martial airs . " There are also examples of fine imaginative power in his allusion to the slave-trade in the Plymouth oration , and in his description of the murder of the venerable Mr. White . But we think that it is rarely , that he rises to such heights , on occasions of intense excitement only , when he transcends himself and momently catches the fine madness of the poet . For in general we do not discover the play of this faculty , even that lambent and gentle flashing out of it which resembles its grander displays , as the aurora resembles some terrific blaze of lightning . Nor do we find the cultivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to suppose by the wondering terms in which it has been often admired . Out of his profession he does not appear to have been an extensive reader . A few well-known Latin books , the poetry of Pope and his school , who were the fashion in his youth , the historical plays of Shakspeare , and the Old Testament ,  --  the last two worlds in themselves we admit - were his principal resources . But it can not be said-at least it is not made manifest in his published works-that he had any profound or critical knowledge of English literature , as a whole ; to the German , Italian , Spanish , and French literatures , he made no pretensions ; while his classical stores were obviously quite as limited . We do not discover any evidences , at the same time , that he was well instructed in any of the sciences , or that he possessed any controlling love for the fine arts . If he had been a reaper in these fields , *t was inevitable that the rich and luscious juices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander through groves of bloom , catch the Sabean odors in their dress and afterwards exhale the sweet perfume with every breath . In respect to the degree , the thoroughness , and the variety of their culture , we can not but think that the statesmen of foreign nations , especially of France and England , greatly surpass those of our own country . Furnished , in the outset , by the superior discipline and more exacting standards of their schools , with a more solid education , they are also more apt to carry with them into the duties of active life the tastes of their scholastic days . A literary performance of some sort , a lecture , a poem , a memoir , or a history , becomes their relaxation from the fatigues of the forum or the bureau . In France , indeed , it is remarkable that the most eminent statesmen are better known as literateurs , as we see in the cases of Guizot , Thiers , Lamartine , De Tocqueville , &amp;c. ; and even in England , where literature , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell writes dramas and edits biographies ; Gladstone discourses of Church and State , the Earl of Carlisle lectures , and Brougham philosophizes , experiments , and disserts on Natural Theology and Athenian orators . But which of our statesnien , saving Everett , Sumner , and Legar*i , to whom politics seem a stray visiting-place rather than their native habitat , has the taste , or is competent to borrow a grace from such studies for his severer pursuits ? An annual address before some literary society or a mechanics ' institute , is generally the limit of their excursions in this field , while the barrenness , tautology , and sophomorical thought and ornament of these occasional displays , are dreary evidences that they are " not to the manner born . " This deficiency , it is true , is partly incident to the incessant demands of our active national life , but is owing , // still more , we suspect , to the want of a real appreciation of the value of literature , science , and art , among our public men . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flower-gardens of literature he his deficien compensated for cies , in part , by the possession of a fine natural taste . His modes of expression are always neat , correct , and forcible . Apt words aptly chosen , well planned and well executed sentences , an exquisite clearness of statement , a sober chastity of ornament , , a round , melodic , stately rhythm sometimes swelling and grand , but never grandiloquent , are the every-day beauties of his style . He is even remarkably graceful at times , and when excited , when deeply moved by his subject , there is a sonorous charm in the full , equable flow of his thoughts . No painful effort is apparent in him , no turgid labor , no gymnastic contortions , no nervous , spiteful , momentary flasheswhich are all symptoms of weakness . On the contrary , we may apply to him one of his own favorite quotationsStrong without rage , without o'erfiowin* , full . In this respect , indeed , he isamodel for our orators and writers , who , if they would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat of his moderation , and temper their fervors with somewhat of his dignity . It is a part of our national life to be excessive in action and ambitious in phrase ; but the best judges have yet to learn , that the suaviter in modo is in any sense a dilution of the fort iter in re . As an orator , however , his greatest defect was the want of a thoroughly profound and delicate moral sensibility ; of that noble , yet lively susceptibility to suffering and wrong , which makes the world 's woes and hopes our own and our own those of the world - which raises us to the heights of heroism while it softens us into the sweet tenderness of woman - which inspires generous devotion and the sternest spirit of self-sacrifice , at the moment when the heart swells with emotion , and the lips tremble , and the eye is suffused with tears  --  and which , when we come to the utterance of it , gushes over into deep pathos , or a " cry that shivers to the tingling stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain sort of religious sentiment , but it is not deep nor acute , nor apparently so much an original inspiration , as something learned from a wide study of human nature . He uses it as a material of his art , as one of the graceful and effective appliances of rhe tone , giving elevation to the tone of his thought , but not bursting out as an irrepressible , overwhelming impulse , and carrying both speaker and listener along in a whirl of agitation . His prevailing tone is cold , subdued , almost impassive . He had no fine lyric enthusiasms . No man , we suspect , was ever made a martyr by his persuasion ; few have ever wept over his pages or under the sound of his voice ; though many , we have no doubt , have been often lifted by him into higher ranges of thought and a loftier patriotism . He moved men by the commanding power of his intellect , but not by the appealing , pathetic , melting utterances of the heart , and still less by that spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He never , consequently , impresses us that he was a man terribly in earnest , but always bears about with bim the conscious air of an advocate , of one who pleads powerfully for his cause , but for the reason that it is a cause , and not that it is the truth of God . In reading Mr. Calhoun , though you differ from every word he utters , though you see that he is imposing on his uwn mind , you are still persuaded of his intense conviction of what he says , of his willingness to stake life and honor on each sentence , of his deep , ineradicable , personal interest in the success of his case . But no one feels that Mr. Webster would break his heart over a defeat , or swoon with joy at an unexpected triumph . It is probably because he carried this advocate spirit into his public life , that he achieved so little as a man of action . His successes were those of the lawyer . He expounded the Constitution well , and he conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will signalize his name . The measures that he supported , with the exception of the Compromise , have been condemned by the larger wisdom of the people , whilst those he opposed have been incorporated into the settled policy of the nation . He was , therefore , not too great to be popular , as some foolish people assert , but not great enough ,  --  not sufficiently original , unselfish and earnest . But , in spite of every objection that a nicer criticism may allege , the nation may well be , as it is , and long will be , proud of the fame of Daniel Webster . His eminent qualities as an advocate would have distinguished him as priinus inter iliustres in any age . Had he lived in the time of Demosthenes , his name would have come down to us as no unworthy compeer of that father of eloquence ; had he pleaded in the Roman forum , he would have shared the plaudits of the listeners with all-ac- // complished Tully himself ; in the most brilliant era of British oratory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who thundered in the Commons ; and our younc , country then may well cherish whatever was uood or great in the inheritance of his fame . And , when the foreigner asks to behold her achievements , she may confidently point to his capacious broxv , as , Jove-like , it protrudes from the monumental stone , fancying that she hears once more the silver echoes of his clarion voice . We must now , however , draw these desultory thoughts to a close . In doing so , let us express our pleasure in the practice which obtains more and more , of collecting the works of our conspicuous men . Let us also suggest to younger statesmen , the new accountability to literature to which they will be hereafter bound over . With the vision of a book in the distance , to transmit their folly or wisdom to larger audiences , and severer judges , than they are apt to find in the Senate , they should be encouraged or warned to a more careful husbandry of their powers . A more glorious trust than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our old revolutionary statesmen who laid the foundations of empire , have long since passed away ; their immediate successors who conducted it through the stormy transitions of its formative period , with the single exception of Benton , are likewise gone ; and a new race is advanced to the vacant places . But they advance also , to weightier responsibilities and broader duties Our country swells with such velocity in greatness of extent and greatness of power , that the very statistics of its growth startle us , and the figure of her future breaks , " Like a comet , out Far-spleudoring the sieepy realms of night . " In a quarter of a century the young Republic will have attained a dominion greater than that of Rome at the zenith of her s'trength , or of England , in the time of Pitt , and will stand the first among the nations . Every American is elated with the consciousness of this , but is he equally alive to the nobler ideals of action , both for himself and his fellows , that it imposes upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the meagre twenty millions of this age , but for the hundred millions of an age just at hand ? Oh ! what men they should be to be equal to their destinies ! What a deep base of learning they should lay for the superstructure of great . deeds to come , what inflexible integrity of character they should cherish , what comprehensive sympathies and exalted aspirations they should ask of Heaven ! With what moderation , what wisdom , what fearless independence and justice , what utter hatred of wrong , and aching love of right , they should strive to comprehend their position , to thrust aside with utter loathing and disgust the petty ends of party , and to rise with " a clear foresight , not a blindfold courage , " to the summits of their great office ! Would , therefore , to God , that we might address to each young statesman , as he rises in the councils of his country , those simple but pregnant words of Milton , " I see thou knowest what 's of use to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canst do ; Thy actions to thy words ascend thy words To thy large heart give utterance due , thy heart Contains of good , wise , just , the perfect shape .
