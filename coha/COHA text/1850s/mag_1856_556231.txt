By RICHARD HILDRETH* Author of " History of the United States , " etc . Boston : Phillips , Sampson , &amp; Co. 1855 . ON the eastern coast of Asia , there is a country of about the size of Italy , of something of its long , boot-like shape , kicking with its toe one or two southern Sicilies , from which it is separated by straits , which have doubtless-for what has not ? 20 // - their Seylla and Charybdis . A range of other Apennines is the backbone of this eastern Italy . Its name is Niphon , which means " the origin of the sun , " or " the east , " which name , in the various forms of Niphon , Zipon , Zipango , and Cipango , was known to our ancestors for some centuries , and now , for a long time , has slid into Japan . The analogy of this group of islands to the Italian peninsula , with Sicily , is not the mere resemblance of outline . Half down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese Rome , to which the governors of various provinces annually make procession with their tributary presents ; for the political constitution of the realm is that of an empire , where one state has won a supremacy over a number of others , formerly its rivals . The government at Yedo rules Japan , as Rome once ruled Italy , when the Alban , Etruscan , and other states had successively yielded to its sway ; or as each separate sovereign in Italy , and each individual patriot , hopes this day that his own province may at some time rule Italy again . It is the fashion to say that this Japan is an unknown land . For a century and a half , indeed ever since one sovereign got the control of the whole chain of islands , until Commodore Perry 's recent treaty , it has been the policy of the Japanese emperors to restrict , very severely , the communication between their own and other lands . It is therefore true , that very few persons have gone to Japan ; but it does not follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the proverbial expressions to which we have alluded would imply . There is a series of accounts of Japan , on the whole more lucid than ordinary books of travels are , beginning with Mendez Pinto 's time ; for it is a little curious that our first definite knowledge of Cipango is derived from the travels of this prince of liars , as he has been generally called . He has really been harshly treated , if in every regard his narratives bear test as well as do his descriptions of Japan . The great missionary Xavier planted the Catholic religion there , visiting the country with Pinto . A flourishing trade sprang up , in which English , Dutch , Portuguese , and Jesuits vied with one another . We have accounts of the country in those days , from Jesuit missionaries , and from travellers of each of the nations we have // named . We do not speak harshly , if we say that they all quarrelled with one another , and intrigued against one another with the various parties in Japan . Such study as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally expelled all foreigners leads us , not indeed to say that they were all rightly served , but to acknowledge that the measure was forced upon a government still insecure , by the imprudent and even outrageous behavior of Europeans of every name . It was , indeed , a great misfortune that the form of Christianity which had been planted there was so destitute of the eternal elements of our religion that it tempted the government to try to crush it , and then succumbed at once to the attempt when made ; for had this Japanese people united to the other peculiar elements of character which have been forming them an adequate religious culture , there seems no reason why they should not stand now among the most highly civilized people in the world . As it is , they have some things to teach us , and they have never been so secluded but that they have been apt to learn . There is not another nation in the world , of thirty millions of people , which has existed for a century and a half without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of government , then , or of administration , we may have something to learn from a nation vhi h has such good reason for clinging to the matchlocks and halberds which with us , alas ! were long ago superseded . The Japan of the fourteenth century was probably quite in advance of the Europe of the same time . The Japanese are not a people jealous of innovation . That character belongs rather to the Chinese , whom they despise . They have made steady advance , ever since the fourteenth century . Without a religion , it could not be expected that they should do more than they have done . It remains to be seen whether the twentieth century will not find them abreast of Europe again . The two forms of civilization will never be alike ; but there will be no difficulty in comparing them , in the training which they give to the manliness and real character of the people . Under the auspices of an expedition sent out , as we are proud to remember , by our own government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doubled , and the world 's respect for Japan will increase in proportion . We have before us the early sheets of the government narrative , we have the official volume of Captain Perry 's despatches , Mr. Spalding 's spirited sketches of his observations there , published in violation of the directions of the government , Mr. Bayard Taylor 's letters , published with permission , and several briefer narratives of this successful expedition . From these authorities we can now speak quite definitely of the degree of civilization of Japan , and of the relations which , under the new arrangements , it will assume in the great confederacy of nations . We have some little glimpse of the policy of its rulers . We have the most entertaining narratives of the customs of this strange people , where black teeth are a beauty , where war is a relic of barbarism , where the left hand is a place of honor , and where death is the reward of a politician who moves an unsuccessful bill in the councils , or of the emperor who vetoes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition has not yet received the credit which it deserves . It was set on foot by an administration which was scattered to the winds before it returned . It has been worth the while of no party or press to make much of the praises of Mr. Fillmore , of iIr . Webster , of Mr. Everett , or of Captain Perry , to whom it owed its origin , its outfit , and its consummation . The administration which succeeded Mr. Fillmore 's withdrew the force intended for it , not in time to defeat the project , but just in time to forfeit all credit for its success . Such reasons , when joined to the passion for exciting novelty close at hand , are enough to show why the funeral of Bill Poole , or the fillibustering operations in the Gulf of Mexico , should have awakened more display of interest among the people of this country , than has the opening , by peaceful diplomacy , of the Italy of the East to the intercourse of the world ,  --  a transaction which gives us access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated in the arts and in letters , though infants in the moral sciences and in war . This apparent indifference , however , is of course but temporary . The passage of time will set it all right , and the opening of the Japanese ports will be regarded as one of the most honorable triumphs of our age . // After infinife delays ,  --  for so is our government served ,  - -  Captain Perry sailed for Japan , in the Mississippi steamship , without consorts , on the 24th of November , 1832 . Having awaited , in China , the arrival of the rest of his squadron , he was able to sail for Lew Chew , with the Mississippi and Susquehanna steam-frigates , on the 24th of May . With the government of those islands he entered into satisfactory negotiations . On the 9th of June , with two of his ships , he sailed for the Bonin Islands , a little group , discovered by Captain Coffin , in the Transit , an American whaler , in 1823 , lying eastward of Yedo , about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some preparations for a coal station , and returned to Lew Chew . With his two steamers , and two sailing vessels , he then proceeded to the Bay of Yedo , which they entered on the 8th of July . Negotiations at once began with the Japanese officers . Captain Perry maintained his station in the bay ; the Japanese were compelled to desist from their accustomed surveillance of foreign vessels ; a prince of the highest rank was appointed to receive President Fillmore 's letter ; and on the 14th of July the Commodore landed , with a party of four hundred men , and , in great state , delivered it to this functionary . The document was kindly received , and friendly communications were at once opened with the natives . The stay of the squadron in the bay , however , was short . Having delivered his credentials and letter , and surveyed the bay with his boats , the Commodore gave notice that he should retnrn for an answer in the spring , and , after nine days , departed . The remainder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands , Lew Chew , and China . In January , 1834 , the squadron , now somewhat enlarged , sailed again for the Japanese Islands . Just as he sailed , Captain Perry received orders from home , detaching one of his three steamers . He proceeded , however , to Lew Chew , where the squadron rendezvoused , and arrived in Yedo Bay , this time with eight vessels , on the 13th of February . Meanwhile the Emperor of Japan had died . The altered policy of the government was evinced by the absence of almost all the warlike preparations of the year before . Batteries were destroyed , // which had then been begun . And so favorable was the impression made by Captain Perry 's firmness and good sense , that a treaty of intercourse was negotiated , presents of value interchanged between the governments , the most cordial relations established between the Japanese and American officers , and on the 4th of April , the treaty , as ratified by the Japanese government , was sent to America , for ratification by our President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hakodadi , which had been opened to the Americans by treaty , made arrangements for trade at these points , touched again at Lew Chew , made a compact with the government of that island , and returned to America . It is impossible for us to go at all into the details of the curious and really wonderful history of an expedition which accomplished so much in so short a time . It proved that the Japanese were entirely unwilling to enter into arrangements which should suffer Americans to form in Japan permanent homes , or indeed such commercial relations as they have with other nations . They have , however , consented to a treaty which permits our whalemen and other trading-vessels to touch there for supplies , and our steamers for coal , and has secured a certain beginning of trade between America and Japan . The following passages describe what was attempted , and what was effected . " In fact , not an article of the treaty was made but upon the most serious deliberation by the Japanese . In answer to a question from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they replied : The Japanese are unlike the Chinese ; they are averse to change ; and when they make a compact of any kind they intend it shall endure for a thousand years . For this reason it will be best to deliberate and examine well the facilities for trade and the suitableness of the port before any one is determined on . ' Probably nothing but the exercise of the most perfect truthfulness and patience would ever have succeeded in making with them a treaty at all ; and from the language of one of their communications , it is obvious that , with characteristic caution , they meant that their present action should be but a beg*nn*ng of intercourse , which might or might not be afterward made more extensive according to the results of what they deemed the experiment . Thus they say : As our ideas of things and what we each like are still very dissimilar , as arc also our notions of the prices or worth of ti1in*s , this makes it indispensable // that we both first make a mutual trial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiated " There is observable throughout , the predominating influence of the national prejudice against the permanent introduction of foreigners among them . The word reside ' is but once used in the whole treaty , and that in the eleventh article relative to consuls . The details of conferences , already given , show how anxiously they sought to avoid having consuls at all . Indeed , Commodore Perry says , I could only induce the commissioners to agree to this article , by endeavorin* to convince them that it would save the Japanese government much trouble , if an American agent were to reside at one or both of the ports opened by the treaty , to whom complaints might be made of any malepractice of the United States ' citizens who might visit the Japanese dominions . ' They want no permanent foreign residents among them , official or unofficial . This was shown most unequivocally in the remark already recorded in one of the conferences : We do not want any women to come and remain at Simoda . ' Simoda was one of the ports open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wives and daughters , and that a man 's family were ordinarily resident with him in his permanent abode , and that if the head of the family lived in Simoda as a Japanese would live , there would certainly be women who would come and remain at Simoda . ' But more than this . It will be remembered that the Commodore had submitted to them our treaty with China , and they had held it under consideration for a week , at the end of which time they said : As to opening a trade , such as is now carried on by China with your country , we certainly can not yet bring it about . The Chinese have long had intercourse with Western nations , while we have had dealings at Nagasaki with only the people of holland and China . ' Now what was such a trade ' as we carried on with China ? The Japanese read in our treaty that five ports were open to us , that permission was given to the citizens of the LTnited States to frequent ' them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . ' This they deliberately declined assenting to when they refused to make a treaty similar to that with China . They surely would not afterward knowingly insert it in any treaty they might make with us . The only permanent residence to which they gave assent , and tk t most reluctantly , was the residence of a consul . Temporary residence was allowed to our shipwrecked citizens , as well as to those who went to Simoda or Hakodadi on commercial business . They are allowed to land , to walk where the please within certain limits , to enter sho1s and temples without restriction , to purchase in the shops , and have the articles sent to the proper public office duly marked , where they will pay for // them , to resort to public houses or inns that are to be built for their refreshment , when on shore ' at Simoda and Hakodadi ; and until built , a temple , at each place , is assigned as a resting-place for persons in their walks . ' They may accept invitations to partake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not permitted to enter military establishments or private houses without leewe . ' Without leave , our citizens can not enter them within the territories of any nation with which we have a treaty . In short , the whole treaty shows that the purpose of the Japanese was to try the experiment of intercourse with us before they made it as extensive or as intimate as it is between us and the Chinese . It was all they would do at the time , and much , very much , was obtained on the part of our negotiator in procuring a concession even to this extent . " But , as he knew that our success would be but the forerunner of that of other powers , and as he believed that new relations of trade once commenced , not only with ourselves , but with England , France , Holland , and Russia , could not , in the progress of events , fail effectually and for ever not only to break up the old restrictive policy , and open Japan to the world , but must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ninth article , without consultation or delay , ' secured to the United States and their citizens all privileges and advantages which Japan might hereafter grant to any other nation or nations . " ' - Narrative , pp. 450 - 452 . Without attempting any detail which shall give the reader an idea of the narrative of this expedition , we have rather to show what light it throws upon the character of the Japanese , and what may be hoped from the Christian conduct of the intercourse now begun between the countries . Let the reader disabuse himself , as quickly as he can , of the notion that this is a nation of barbarians . It is true that their soldiers carried matebloeks , while even one of our chaplains drew his sword on a crowd of natives ; but we may balance this evidence of our superiority against such an experience as that of the American officers whom the Japanese boats took on board their own vessels , one stormy day . Their boats and their sculling were so much superior to our boats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry , while their comrades , in the squadron 's boats , were wet to the skin . The narrative dwells , with a little conceit , on the contrast between the entertainment which the Japanese Coinmissioners // gave the American gentlemen , and the American exhibition of the telegraph and the railroad . " It was a happy contrast , which a higher civilization presented , to the disgusting display on the part of the Japanese officials . " The Japanese display had been a disgusting display of brute force , as beastly , though not so protracted , as an English prize-fight . The dignity of the comparison with our " higher civilization " is , however , somewhat abated , when we find that the entertainment provided for the Japanese gentlemen by our officers , which comes in real contrast to the entertainment they had provided , is , - not , of course , the government presents , which , if any comparison is to be made , should be compared with the elegant imperial presents to us ,  --  but that - alas for high civilization ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of negro minstrelsy , got up by some of the sailors , who , blacking their faces , and dressing themselves in character , enacted their parts with a humor which would have gained them unbounded applause from a New York audience , even at Christy 's . " We have already intimated that the civilization of Japan lacks all the elements which it would have derived from religion . Its officers are false , and its government is a government of spies . But we have no right to call that a barbarous nation , which gives a wide-spread education to its people ; which has translated for its schools the works of Lalande and other French mathematicians ; which pays such attention to the health of its people that the fishing port of Simoda has a better system of sewerage than either New York or Washington , and keeps such a watch over their deportment that a squadron may lie for months in the Bay of Yedo , without a trace of the disgraceful licentiousness in the intercourse of the seamen with the shore which would accompany its visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be corrected , which exists in the popular impression regarding Japan . There is a supposition that the Japanese are as averse to change as the Chinese , and that they have a like bigoted enthusiasm for old customs . This impression springs , perhaps , from the popular idea that they belong to the Chinese subdivision of the hu // man species . This idea is , probably , entirely unfounded . In language , in the method of writing , and in personal appearance , there is so great a diversity as to make it quite certain that the two nations belong to widely parted races . The other impression , derived from this , that they always adhere with a tenacious obstinacy to their ancient customs , has as little foundation . There is , no doubt , a very curious conservative element in the constitution of their government , but we know of no nation which has ever shown itself more eager to learn the arts of another nation than the Japanese are now . Nor is this a new trait with them . Their progress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the naturalist , was at Yedo , in 1772 , there visited him two astronomers . They turned the talk on the calculation of eclipses , and admitted that they were often whole minutes out of the way in foretelling them , and sometimes hours . They asked Thunberg for help ; but poor Thunberg , who knew as much of the matter as the gentle reader of these pages probably does , had to excuse himself . Thirty-four years afterwards , IDoeff , the chief factor at Nagasaki , made a visit at Yedo , and the chief astronomer called on him . In the mean while they had studied and translated Lalande 's Astronomy , calculated eclipses with great precision , and knew much more of the matter than Doeff did . This was not to Doeff 's discredit . But Golownin , a Russian surveying officer , a prisoner among them , five years later , greatly disgusted a Japanese man of science , who called on him to ask how to find the longitude by a lunar observation . Golownin had no tables , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as the simple observation for latitude went , left him in indignation . The astronomer royal afterwards visited Golownin , and assured him that the Japanese calculated eclipses with precision . It appears from Goloxvniu and later authorities , that they have imported , by the agency of the Dutch , the best mathematical works of Europe , some of which are now published in the Japanese language . They also have such mathematical instruments as they have had occasion to make use of . Golownin says that the globe representing the world , which one of his friends had , was as good as any in Europe . // Constant illustrations of their eagerness to learn appeared in their intercourse with the American squadron . We may adduce the sad story of Isagi Kooda , and Kwansuchi Manji , two Japanese gentlemen , who attempted to come to America with the squadron . When the squadron was at Simoda , after the treaty was made , these two young men succeeded in speaking privately with some American officers on shore , and slipped into the breast of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter expressing their eagerness to visit America . The language is really touching in its earnestness . " We have read in books , and learned a little by hearsay , what are the customs and education in Europe and America , and we have been for many years desirous of going over the five great continents ' ; but the laws of our country on all maritime points are very strict ; for foreigners to come into the country , and for natives to go abroad , are both immutably forbidden . Our wish to visit other regions has consequently only gone to and fro , in our breasts , in continual agitation , ' as when one 's breathing is impeded , or his walking cramped . " The letter proceeded to beg that they might be taken to America , in one of the ships of the squadron , the arrival of which in Japan had awakened nll their hopes . Thus they would be able to visit all " the five continents , " and to do this they were ready to serve in any way on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the letter , " that , when a lame man sees others walking , he wishes to walk too ; but how shall the pedestrian gratify his desires when he sees another riding ? We have all our lives been going hither to you , unable to get more than thirty degrees east and west , or twenty-five degrees north and south . But now , when we see how you sail on the tempests , and cleave the huge billows , going , lightning speed , thousands and myriads of miles , skirting along the five great continents , can it not be likened to the lame finding a plan for walking , and the pedestrian seeing the mode by which he can ride ? " The letter closed by an earnest request that their wishes might be kept entirely secret from the government , though they said they were sure that , on their return from their travels , their countrymen would never think it worth while " to investigate bygone doings . " Another note enclosed in this stated that they had in vain attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yedo , and that they had come to Simoda in the hope of better success . These notes were not immediately translated . The same night , before they had been read , the officer of the mid-watch on the Mississippi was hailed from a boat at two o'clock in the morning , and the two Japanese gentlemen came on board , their hands blistered with rowing . Each was entitled , as a man of rank , to wear two swords , but they let their boat go adrift , with three of their four swords on board , in the hope that their countrymen would believe they were drowned ; for these swords are heirlooms , and a Japanese gentleman parts with them only in the last extremity . They at once expressed their desire to travel , and their hope that they mIght be allowed to come to the United States with the squadron . But the Commodore was obliged to tell them , that he could not take them without the permission of their government . Indeed , it would have been a violation of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just entered into friendly relations . They were greatly disturbed at this answer , and declared that , if they returned to land , they should lose their heads . A long discussion ensued , in which our conntrymen were obliged , kindly but firmly , to insist on setting them on shore . They descended the gangway , piteously deploring their fate , and were landed by one of the ship 's boats at a point where it was hoped they would be unobserved , and might find their own boat when she drifted on shore . The reasons for this necessary harshness on the part of Commodore Perry appear sound . The opportunity to bring two intelligent Japanese to America must have been very tempting . But he would have violated the imperial laws by doing so ; nay , he might have fallen into a trap set to test him , as some of his officers believed this transaction to be . The next day the Japanese authorities made inquiries on board the ships as to the two seekers for learning ; but no answer was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , a party of American officers recognized the unfortunate young men , imprisoned in one of the cages which are fixed up , like small pounds , for criminals . They had been pursued and arrested . They bore their misfortune with composure , and were greatly pleased with the visit of // the officers ; and one of them wrote on a piece of board which was handed to them this farexvell message - " When a hero fails in his purpose , his acts are then regarded as those of a villain and a robber . In public have we been seized and pinioned and caged for many days . The village elders and head men treat us disdainfully , their oppressions being grievous indeed . Therefore , looking up while yet we have nothing wherewith to reproach ourselves , it must now be seen whether a hero will prove himself to be one indeed . Regt*rding the liberty of going through the sixty states ns not enough for our desires , we wished to make the circuit of the five great continents . This was our heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are defeated and we find ourselves in a half-sized house , where eating , resting , sitting , and sleeping are difficult . How can we find our exit from this place ? Weeping , we seem as fools ; laughing , as rogues . Alas for us ! silent we can only be . " IsAGI I66DA , KWANSUCHI MANJI . " The Commodore at once sent on shore to inquire regarding the men ; but his messenger found that they had been conveyed to Yedo in obedience to an order from the capital . There seems reason to fear that they lost their lives as the penalty for their desire to learn . But the authorities assured the Commodore that he need not apprehend a serious termination . Is not this little romance of real life enough to rescue the nation from the reputation of resting brutishly satisfied with its own acquisi-tions ? The Japanese show their interest in the rest of the world by their passion for acquiring its languages . They have great skill in the acquisition of language , and they made constant demands for English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is surrounded by persons who ask the English names of familiar objects , and write them down at once . Indeed , they are a nation of reporters , as they certainly are a nation of readers . For it is hardly probable that even among ourselves does cheap literature extend more widely . As long ago as Golownin 's captivity , * he found that even the sentinels on guard read aloud almost continually . Sec North American Review , Vol. 1 . p. 61. // With these intimations of the nature of the civilization of Japan , which xviii , we hope , induce our readers to think of the expedition as something more than a curious visit to a barbarian court , we must leave to them further inquiries into this branch of our subject . Golownin , who was long imprisoned in Japan , thought it , early in this century , one of the most highly civilized nations in the world . We are disposed to think that Captain Perry and his officers took the same impression . It is gratifying to find passages , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to those claimed by the nations of Christendom . An instance of this occurs in the recognition of the right of sovereignty , in Japan , over the Bonin group of islands , where Captain Perry hoped to establish a coal depot , and where one probably will be established , when steam-navigation is regularly attempted across the Pacific . We confess that we should have been glad to see this recognition of equality carried into all the details of the arrangements made by the expedition . Mr. Spalding records it as a joke , that a young officer , very curious about our arms , should have put into one of his letters to the Americans the entreaty , " Give me the recipe for percussion-caps . " The government narrative takes no notice of this request . Now we confess , that it seems to us as reasonable as if one of our gentlemen should have asked how the Japanese made their matchless porcelain , or requested a " recipe " for the celebrated process of japanning . We may observe , by the way , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matchlocks , and that it is only a deficiency of flints in the geological formation of their country which has delayed the introduction of flint-locks in their army , little use for an army though they have . They showed , of course , at all times , great curiosity as to the introduction , or the manufacture , of percussion-caps or wafers . Now it may very well be that there was not an officer in the expedition who could give them " the recipe for making percnssion-caps . " In that case , the refusal was as pardonable as Dr. Thunberg 's refusal to show them how to calculate eclipses . But if the information could have been given , we do not hesitate to say that it would have been wise to give it . We were treating with Japan , as // with an equal power . We had no desire to acquire her territory ; we had no expectation of being at war with her . We conceive , therefore , that just the same courtesy which permits European officers to visit our arsenals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well applied in extending the knowledge of this or any other warlike invention . It would have been a distinct evidence of the spirit with which the negotiations were conducted . We are villing to add , that we trust Japan may acquire that skill in the use of European arms which shall protect her seaports from the insults of lawless seamen , and her territory from the covetousness of any foreign power . We trust that some early expedition may take out the " recipe for percussion-caps . " In what we have said of the degree of Japanese civilization , we do not deny that it is a very one-sided form of national culture . We have alluded to the immense deficiency of that religious spirit , which alone gives man or nation true courage , desire for improvement , and the eagerness to elevate the unfortunate , - the spirit , indeed , whose essential elements are faith , hope , and love . More than this , however , we must confess that the civilization of Japan is tainted by its long maintained insular policy . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breeds in and in , " and appoints its professors only from the knot of its recent graduates or its resident fellows , so does a nation show the evil of that system of culture which never rotates crops , but takes , year after year , the same declining harvest from the exhausted soil . Mr. Bancroft Davis , at a public dinner in London , asked the Englishmen who heard him , if England herself , in the insulation of the Napoleon war , did not suffer from her separation from Europe . " The Englishman of 1815 , " said he , " was a different man from the Englishman of 1851 , in the breadth of his ideas " ; and we believe that his audience fully assented to the proposition . Now take , as a convenient illustration , the inability of the British officers in the Crimea to carry their wounded in any better way than the wounded were carried in after the battle of Minden , and it will be easy to see how flat , tame , and unprofitable is the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It needs strength , // vivacity , originality , heart ; for it needs to cross the breed , not of men , perhaps , but of manners , letters , and arts . One of the most curious results of the expedition was its decided confirmation of an idea which had begun to transpire before , that there exists in Japan a sort of Young Japan party , well disposed to extend intercourse with foreign powers . The official recognition of this fact is in the following curious words from the princes ' acknowledgment of the President 's letter : - " It has been many times intimated that business relating to foreign countries can not be transacted here in Uraga , but at Nagasaki ; nevertheless , as it has been observed that the Admiral , in his quality of Ambassador of the President , would feel himself insulted by a refusal to receive the letter at this place , the justice of which has been aclcnowledged , the above-mentioned letter is hereby received , in opposition to the Japanese law . " The following passage also distinctly admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is in the formal reply to the President 's letter . " It is quite impossible to give satisfactory answers , at once , to all the proposals of your government , as it is most positively forbidden by the laws of our imperial ancestors ; but for us to continue attached to the ancient laws seems to misunderstand the spirit of the age . " Now it has been intimated by Siebold , that the Emperor whom Captain Perry found in office was eager to increase the restrictions on foreign trade , and under his administration the Dutch trade had fallen off . This fact suggests an inquiry , or suspicion , which we do not find , however , in any of the books before us , as to the change of administration between Perry 's first and second visits . For , according to the blind accounts we have of the constitution of Japan , there exists a pretty summary veto on the Siogoon , or Emperor . He appears to be , like the governors of some of our States , a sort of upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decisions , it is referred to a committee , consisting of the three next heirs to the throne . If they confirm his disapproval , the member of the council who moved the provision thus rejected is killed ! In some instances , all those who voted with him // are killed also . If , however , these three princes agree with the council , and disagree with the Emperor in his veto , the Emperor is dethroned , and the next heir takes his seat . It xviii be observed that there is a decided temptation to the three princes to disagree with the Emperor , if indeed the seat on such a throne is deemed a prize . The system , if applied in our politics , would work thus , in the case , for instance , of President Pierce 's recent veto of the St. Clair and Mlsslssippi improvement bills . This veto would be referred to the three heirs apparent , - shall we say to Mr. Buchanan , Mr. Fremont , and Mr. Fillmore ? If these gentlemen confirmed his views , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps all of both houses who voted for them , would be killed . But if the council of three disapproved the veto , President Pierce would be set aside , and the pretender highest in rank of the three ( whichever that may be ) must enter the White House . Now , if this account of the Japanese constitution be correct , and it is that given in Dr. Hawks 's narrative , ( though we confess we doubt if it do not originate in some myth or misconception , ) it suggests a suspicion as to the nature of the death of the late Siogoo n of Japan . It appears that he was jealously opposed to foreign trade . Commodore Perry sends to him the President 's letter , and retires while he waits for an answer . Coming for his answer , he finds that this anti-foreigner Siogoon is dead , after a reign of only eleven years , and that another Siogoon reigns in his stead , whose government destroys the hostile fortifications erected by his predecessor , displays no troops , acknowledges that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the fathers , and negotiates a treaty of amity and intercourse . We beg pardon of the new Siogoon if we are wrong , but we do suspect that the old one was deposed on account of his " alien laws , " as wise Siogoons in other countries have been , and that this new Siogoon came in , perhaps , on the very policy which has opened Japan to the visits of our seamen . It scarcely falls within our province to say what are the advantages which Japan will receive from the gradual opening of intercourse with other nations , or how far the civiliza // tion of European type may gain anything from the introduction of this Eastern stranger into society . First of all , the great question of the introduction of Christianity there , - infinite iii its relations indeed , - presents complications of peculiar interest and difficulty . A curious illustration of the difficulty is presented iu Dr. Hawks 's volume , in the answer of the Lew-Chewans to the English Bishop of Victoria - " Our gentry are without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confucianism , they have as yet been unable to arrive at perfection in it . If they should now , also , have to study , in addition , the religion of the Lord of Heaven ( Christianity ) , such an attempt would surpass our ability , and the heart does not incline to it . " Our impression is , that the Japanese passion for reading , and willingness to learn from abroad , may form the means of introducing Christian life by Christian literature ; - not by such baby tracts as disgust the intelligent natives of India , but by the literature which is the comfort of the strong men of Christendom . In the matter of commercial relations , the well-known excellence of many of the Japanese manufactures at once excited hopes of mercantile adventure there , which have thus far proved unfounded . In the early trade of the Portuguese and Dutch with Japan , the Japanese were in a condition to export the precious metals largely . But it has long since proved that the balance of trade was so turned that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , a most stringent law forbids the exportation of coin . It seems certain that the product of their mines has diminished , while the amount of these metals in the rest of the world has largely increased . The recent exports from Japan in the Dutch vessels have been chiefly camphor and copper , the latter furnished by the government , Mr. Hildreth tells us , much below the current price . Besides these , the Dutch imports from Japan are chiefly Japanese manufactures . The copper is famous for its purity . The lacquered ware is superior to anything made in the East . Silks are manufactured in every variety . The Japanese paper serves with them many uses to which we put cloth , - paper umbrellas , and oiled paper rain cloaks , for instance , prove // quite serviceable , and paper pocket-handkerchiefs are the only variety known . Their best porcelain is the best in the world . Those persons , however , who supposed that under the new treaty a large exchange of productions was to spring up immediately , were mistaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their articles , sold them to foreigners at a government bazaar , and demanded money almost exclusively in return . Dr. Hawks 's book defends the treaty with entire success against the intimation that it ought to have provided for more open trade . As we have said , Commodore Perry attempted a treaty of commerce , but the imperial negotiators steadily declined . He did what he could , therefore , and a great deal more than there was any reason to hope that he could do . He negotiated a treaty which secures intercourse , refreshment for vessels in need , and , to a limited extent , trade . The restriction of trade to the purchase by money of the articles which we require , is not more onerous than the practical restriction of the same sort under which all Chinese trade sprang into being . Indeed , as our ports nearest Japan are those of California , the exchange of gold against Japanese commodities might be regarded as a direct barter of products , - if the Japanese price of that metal permitted , - rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this trade , however , an obstacle has sprung up hitherto , resulting from the different ratios of gold , silver , and copper here and in Japan , and from the artificial value of Japanese coin . This is treated of at a good deal of length in the books before us . It seems to be thought more difficult to be surmounted than it appears to us . For as we regard it , it is one of those incidents of trade which will , so soon as the necessity is perceived , readily adjust itself . Commodore Perry appointed two pursers to study out this knotty matter of the rates at which our dollars and eagles should pass against the Japanese cattys , tacis , mace , and candareens , and to negotiate with the Japanese commissioners . They negotiated , but arrived at no result which satisfied them , - the Japanese insisting on taking our coins by weight , at the rate for which they sold uncoined bullion at the government mines , or which they paid at their mint for bullion to // coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing to them . Now their own coin , perhaps from its scarcity , or by force of government edicts , and probably by reason also of its superior purity , has a much higher value for the same weight than their bullion has . A quantity of silver bullion , as compared with the same weight of coin , is worth only about one third of the coin . The precise ratio is 1 to 2.87 . Gold bullion compared with a like weight of gold coin rates as 1 to 1.29 . Here was the first apparent disadvantage under which our coin labored . The Japanese weighed it as bullion , and gave it only the value as compared with their own coin which their own bullion - probably of very low purity - bore . Some American coins were sent to Yedo to be assayed ; but the squadron did not remain long enough for any result of that assay to be obtained . The chief difficulty in this matter , however , springs from the fact , which neither party appears to have borne sufficiently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gold in Japan and America are wholly different . This is a diversity which no negotiation can adjust . It will be adjusted only as the influx of different metals adjusts it . We shall , of course , use in trade the metal which we can use the easiest . There is no need , therefore , of attempting forcibly to adjust the ratio of the others , even if we could do it . In making the comparison of coins , the pursers and the nine Japanese commissioners hit on the Icas or cash as the standard , - a coin made of copper and iron . The hundred-cash-piece is , indeed , the Japanese standard , so far as they have any . The pursers appear to have supposed that the cash had the same value as the cash of China , which it resembles and with which they were familiar . The Japanese gentlemen then weighed a gold dollar , and said , " This is worth 836 cash . " The pursers calculated , and found that this was scarcely half the worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were struck vith horror at the profanation . The commissioners said again , " Your silver dollar is worth 1600 cash . " This is just the same value as the Japanese silver inchebu , and the pursers could see that the inchebu was only a third the size of the dollar . But the commissioners here said that the dollar was to them as bullion , and must take the government price of bullion. // The pursers say that " the injustice of this arrangement was shown . " But the Japanese commissioners did not relent for that . Doubtless they had instances enough at home of the difficulties of au arrangement which gives silver and gold a fictitious value when minted ; and the additional complication caused from the fact that cash made of copper and iron are more valuable with them than with us , in comparison with silver , could not have helped their progress towards adjustment. * The matter ended with their resolution to receive the silver *1ollar at 1,600 cash , and the gold dollar at 836 cash , - an arrangement which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be remembered that the government agents take this coin at the government bazaars at these rates . They pay the producers of the commodities sold in their own currency . The coin probably goes to the Japanese mint to be melted over again . Mr. Hildreth , who seems disposed to look unkindly on the expedition of Captain Perry , speaks of the result of this negotiation as one in which the Japanese " won the day . " Mr. Spalding says , " The result was anything but satisfactory . " Dr. Hawks , who is eager to represent everything as couleur de rose , says that the " Japanese readily assented " to this arrangement , when in fact they forced it on the Americans . Constant complaints have been made regarding it since . Vie see no cause for these complaints , and no difficulty in the transaction . It is nothing to us whether the Japanese change a silver dollar into 1,600 cash or 1,700 . We do not want cash of that sort ; we want Japanese manufactures . If it prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc such that copper currency rates higher with them than it does with us , all we have to do is to provide ourselves in Chinese I ) Orts with copper coin for purposes of trade . If it prove that , even at the unusual valuation of copper , silver , and gold against one another in Japan , we can buy camphor and coal at a profit with our silver coin , the use the Japanese government make of that coin is nothing to us ; we shall spend it . * The Japanese export copper to advantage . The alloy with iron is probably such as to make the coin more valuable than copper alone . The Japanese supply of iron is not large . The coin is well executed , and clearly moulded , not stamped . // regardless what becomes of it . We would suggest to the Californians who have private mints , where they stamp gold , not with the government stamp , but with their own , that it would facilitate the introduction of silver into this trade , if they were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , and shape of the Japanese inchebu . Tfhese pieces would be received by weight , it is true , but that would be a gain , probably , on the use of silver dollars for the same purpose . The use of gold , at its present value in Japan , - only 8 ? times the value of silver , - is , of course , out of the question on our side ; but this fact suggests at once , that the purchase of gold bullion or gold ornaments for our silver , or better , if possible , for our copper , will become a lucrative branch of this new trade , just so far as the government will permit it . If the pursers did not mistake when they supposed that of silver bullion worth 2,250 cash , the Japanese coin money worth 6,400 cash , and of gold bullion worth 19,000 cash , they coin money worth 23,730 cash , - and the authorities all agree in this remarkable statement , - the government of Japan has done that which Western governments have almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called science of Political Economy say is impossible . It is not impossible ; for the paper currency of our Revolution , intrinsically worthless , derived some value - now more , now less - from the stamp upon it , and the fact that government received it . The " iRelief Notes " of the last fifteen years in Pennsylvania have held almost the value on their faces , though paper irredeemable , because Pennsylvania had no other legal paper currency below five dollars , and these were taken by government at par . In both these cases the money could not be exported . In Japan , till now , it could not be exported . The government still forbids its exportation ; but we begin to see specimens of it , and the export will probably interfere with the remarkable provisions which have so held up its value in circulation . Probably great care has been taken to keep down the amount coined ; and the severity of the Japanese law has , we must suppose , completely checked counterfeiting . Of the authors whose books on Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hildreth does not speak with enthusiasm // of the expedition . He thinks that Mr. Everett 's draft of a letter to the Emperor was stolen from 1Ir . VV'ebster 's earlier draft , and in one point , where the resemblance is very faint , from the still earlier letter of Louis XIV. , and that it was not in Japanese taste . As it answered its purpose , it seems to have been in taste that served . As it was written eighteen months after Mr. Webster 's , it might well add some allusions , which , when he wrote , could not be made . Any one who reads the two letters will see that Mr. Everett 's is not a mere expansion of Mr. Webster 's , - that it may , indeed , be doubted whether he had that before him . Mr. Web ster seems to have conceived of the Emperor as a potentate of less intelligence than Mr. Everett thought him . We may add , by the way , that the fling which Mr. Hildreth makes when he says , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings edited by Nir . Everett , " is singularly unfair . Mr. Webster himself withheld all his diplomatic correspondence which had not been published , and at the time those volumes were printed , this letter had not been published by the government . 1Ir . Hildreth thinks that the daguerreotype views will be the principal addition which the expedition gives to our information about Japan . The result proves , fortunately , more important . Mr. Spalding conceives that the Commodore took airs on himself , and was too fond of show and parade . He ridicules the processions and formality with which the parties landed . The newspapers of this country , in general , as xve have intimated , have expressed , in different forms , dissatisfaction that an immense trade was not at once secured by the opening of the ports , and , in particular , that the Commodore did to them that Dr. Hawks 's narrative , of which we have already expressed our high appreciation , * sometimes takes a tone of national congratulation , or of eulogy on his hero , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official narrative . It defends itself . Commodore Perry needs no praise in that narrative . His work speaks for him . The // sneers at his assumption of dignity are preposterous , in face of the manly statements which he makes to the Secretary of his well-considered reasons for it ; and the success of his policy xviii be sufficient to secure him always against the innuendoes of those who think they could have done better what he has done completely . When the laudation passes beyond the Commodore to extol the character of the American people , it seems to us not in good taste for a government publication . It is the people who publish it. * It scarcely becomes them to blow their own trumpets . In the midst of such occasional congratulation , it is a little mortifying to find Commodore Perry telling the Lew Chew people , very coolly , that the " Americans are people of few words , but they always mean what they say . " After this declaration , we looked with some dread at the list of presents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent them ,  --  as it was , we believe , to the Emperor of China . Few words , alas ! Nor does the narrative come off quite clearly as to the Americans ' " meaning what they say . " It was only a few days before , that the Japanese commissioners asked how large a retinue would accompany Captain Perry on shore , and were told that " it is the custom of the United States , when an officer of high rank bears a communication from the President to the sovereign of another country , for him to go with such an attendance as is respectful to the power to which he is sent . " Did they mean just what they said here ? And did the Japanese gentlemen , well read , perhaps , in Western history , know that no American ambassador ever had a retinue of five mcii before ? The American customs figured much more respectably when the squadron first arrived at Uraga . A cordon of boats was formed around the ships . The Japanese functionary who first boarded was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese custom . He was told that it was American * McDonald , a young man horn at Astoria , and only twenty-four years old , was taken prisoner by the Japanese in 1848 . His captors asked him the rank of Commander Glynn of our navy , - bidding him name " the order of succession from the highest chief " And this Oregon boy promptly answered that the highest chief was the people . But this the Japanese , he says , " could not comprehend . " - Senate Document , 1852 , p. 57. // custom to tolerate no such thing , and if the boats were not gone in fifteen minutes they wonld be fired into . The boats were at once sent to shore . Here was an instance where the Americans did mean what they said , and their hosts knew it . We have been , in a few instances , sorry that Captain Perry 's professional engagements had not permitted him to bring forth this'xvhole narrative himself , in the manly English , and with the vigorous and eloquent common sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can easily see that he could not have used the despatches and reports of his inferior officers with quite the freedom of Dr. Hawks ; and as xve have already said in our last number , this gentleman has brought to his great work a variety of accomplishments , and an enthusiasm for the subject , which make him the very editor we should have selected , if the chief was not to be his own editor . A few inconsistencies slip from a pen which is at work digesting a mass of varied accounts ; but when this is the pen of a landsman descanting on sea affairs , the wonder is only that they are so few . It should be understood , that all the journals of the various officers were submitted to him , and that the result in this splendid volume is drawn , not from one record only , but from all the memoirs and despatches of the cruise . We must speak with care on so delicate a subject as ethnological affinities , particularly in discussing a work by Dr. Hawks ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copied from some officer 's journal , that there is no affinity between the Lew Chew , Malay , and Tagalla languages . The learned and successfnl effort of Bopp to show the connection between the Malayan-Polynesian tongues and the Indo-European , is assisted so often by his introduction of Taghalian roots , and the hints given by Taghalian comparisons , that we can not believe his illustrations from those sources are erroneous . We look , indeed , to the study of the Japanese language for a good deal of new light on the remarkable questions which are called out by the occasional resem See Bopp , Ueber die Verwandtsdiaft der Malayisch-Polyncsischen Sprachen mit den Indi : *ch-EurouaYscher . Berlin . 1841. 22 // blances between the Sanscrit , the Taghalian , and the 1lalayanPolynesian languages . Where Japan does belong , in the distribution of the nations , it seems as yet very hard to say . But it is almost impossible that her language should not throw some light on the languages of Polynesia , and possibly on some of those of the northxvest coast of America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these volumes , fulfils , we may say , a desire which has long lingered in the minds of many of our citizens , and of course of our public men . It would seem almost as if there were an omen for America in the design with which Columbus sailed , which , as Dr. Hawks reminds us , was the discovery of Cipango . Mr. Hildreth informs us that La Salle , the discoverer of the Mississippi , left France with a view to an overland western passage to China and Japan . Thus early were the fortunes of our Western continent linked with this eastern outpost of the Eastern , which takes the name of " the cradle of the sun . " In our own generation , the opening of Japan was a favorite notion with John Quincy Adams . Some of our readers may remember the ingenious , and , we may say , vehement address , in which he urged the right , and even the duty , of Christian nations to open the ports of Japan , and the duty of Japan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right more than any man has to withdraw its private contribution to the welfare of the whole . As early as 1832 , authority was given to Iir . Edmund Roberts , by our government , to attempt a negotiat ion , with the assistance of the Peacock man-of-war . No use , however , was made of this authority . Iii 1837 an American mercantile house at Macao fitted out the Morrison , with the view of returning some shipwrecked Japanese to their country , in the hope that a communication might thus be opened . But she was fired into , and forbidden to land them . Mr. Alexander H. Everett , when he went on his mission to China , had strong hopes of the possibility of a successful negotiation . He was intrusted with powers for such a negotiation , Vhich he afterwards transferred to Commodore Biddle , who attempted it in the Columbus in 1846 . Commodore Biddle 's visit to Yedo was unfortunate . A Japanese soldier threw him down into his boat , as he was entering a Japanese // junk , to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in offensive language , declining all intercourse , and bidding the ship depart . Every apology was offered to Commodore Biddle for the insult to him , and he left the offender to the mercy of his own government . It proved , however , afterwards , that the Japanese officers took lofty airs on themselves regarding this transaction , and it was made to detract greatly among them from the credit of our country . Mr. Everett 's death at Macao the next year prevented his following up the effort , as he was disposed to do , if opportunity offered . Early in 1849 , however , Commodore Geisinger at Macao heard of some shipwrecked American seamen at Nagasaki , and sent Commander Glynn in the Preble to bring them off . His spirited treatment of the Japanese fnnctionaries succeeded , and undoubtedly did much to raise the credit of our government with theirs . Among the seamen whom he took off was Ranald McDonald , the Oregonian republican , whose description of sovereignty we have quoted . This young man had landed voluntarily at Japan for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , among our different plenipotentiarie s . The visit of Commander Glynn prepared the way for the expedition which has now succeeded . It was a favorite object with Mr. Webster , a ad the first act of Mr. Everett 's official life as his successor was to draft the official letter of Mr. Fillmore to the Emperor . In closing our review , we are bound to say , that , with the single exception of the delay in the preparation of the vessels , the expedition seems to us to reflect singular credit upon the country , and upon the officers concerned . The outfit was very carefully devised , the officers were well selected , the ships generally accomplished all that they were expected to do , and an honorable liberality seems to have presided over the details . The presents to the Emperor were judiciously chosen . The supply of coal in China was such , that Captain Perry was able to relieve both English and French squadrons in stress of need . The interpreting force was intelligent ; and though no corps of savans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point . Of the services of the Commodore we have // tried to give our impression . They were mild in the manner , they were effective in the issue . His judgment was severely tried , but in every particular of importance it served him with singular correctness ; and in reading his compact and vigorous despatches , we have been surprised to see the amount of attention he was able to bestow upon various subjects of high importance , which required study and careful thought before he could arrive at his decision . For all that appears , he was admirably seconded . With the single exception of Mr. Bayard Taylor , who joined hiLn at Canton for the first visit to Yedo , no civilians were on board . Mr. Taylor wrote out some valuable notes on Lew Chew and Japan , part of which are incorporated in this volume , while part are in his own Eastern travels . All the rest of the work of the expedition is distinctly due to the navy , and great credit does it reflect on the commander and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that Dr. Hawks 's book , besides its narrative , contains an admirable sketch of the history , productions , religion , and civil condition of Japan . Mr. Hildreth has , with diligence and spirit , given a digested history of the empire , - so far as it is made known by different travellers and many native works , - and a very careful sketch of all the leading European works on Japan , to the present time . His book is a valuable compendium of the knowledge the European world had of the country before Captain Perry 's expedition ; and he has investigated with great care some of the most curious questions of its history , literature , and manners . Mr. Spalding 's is a lively sketch of the expedition , which occasionally supplies an anecdote not in the larger work , but which did its whole duty when it fed the appetite of a public eager for that work to appear .
