txt ART . 11. - THE PURITAN CLERGY OF NEW ENGLAND . Annals of the American Pulpit ; or , Comm*norative Notices of distinguished Clergymen of various Denominations , from the Settlement of the Country to the close of the Year 1855 . With Historical Introductions . By WILLIAM B. SPRAGUE , ID . D. Yols . I and IT . New York : Robert Carter and Brothers . 1856 . B* the time these sheets are issued , the first installment of this long expected work will probably be in the hands of many of our readers . Having ourselves been permitted to look over , in advance , a considerable part of these volumes , we take this // early opportunity to express our sense of the service done to the living ministry , and to the Church at large , by the erection of such a monument to the memory of deceased clergymen who were distinguished in their day . It was a work ot urgent necessity . The names of the good and great are the wealth of history . The names of such in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and she can not afford to lose them . Such men belong to no single period , place , or country . They belong to all time , to all ages , to all nations . A sacred obligation , therefore , rests on those who have it in their power to see that suitable memorials of them are preserved . So rarely is this work attended to , however , by those on whom it properly devolves , that the task of forming anything like a complete encyclop*edia of clerical biography is rendered extremely difficult . Although Dr. Sprague has not , perhaps , proposed to himself to accomplish quite so much as this , yet when we think of the wide field covered by his annals , and of the vast amount of labor and trouble involved in the collection and arrangement of the materials they contain , we certainly admire the courage Which deliberately undertook the work , and the patience which has at last completed it . If it shall hereafter be found that many persons are not noticed in its pages , whose characters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! this will appear far less surprising to us , than the fact that materials have been obtained out of which to form satisfactory sketches of so very large a number . It is not every able minister that becomes extensively known even to his own generation . The days of many pastors who intellectually and spiritually are men of power , and who by their lives and labors exert a most salutary influence in their sphere , are passed in comparatively retired positions . Of many a pastor it may be said , in the words of Goldsmith , " Remote from towns he ran his godly race , And ne'er had changed , nor wished to change his place ; " and the number of such was much greater in the quiet days of old , than in the present generation , when the noise of the rattling car has penetrated even so many of the most sequestered regions . When such men die , though their influence of course flows on , it often happens that , in the course of a very few years , their personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century is past , there is little left in relation to them but loose and unreliable traditions . Even in the case of those who have occupied prominent posts , // 499 it is likely to become difficult to obtain accurate information , if the work of collecting it be delayed beyond a moderate period . Many interesting facts in relation to eminent ministers of the last century , for instance , are doubtless already lost ; and but for the generous labor of the excellent author of the work before us , these treasures of individual history , now saved for coming time , would likewise , in all probability , very many of them have perished , before the close of the present century . It was necessary to collect them now or never . We give from the " General Preface " a few paragraphs , which exhibit the main features of the plan adopted by Dr. Sprague in the preparation and arrangement of his work : " My conceptien of the work was , ( at first , ) very imperfect , and I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should include a few of the most brilliant lights , without regard either to denomination or chronological order . I was led , however , after surveying more carefully the field of my labors , to the conclusion , that the limits that I had prescribed to myself were too narrow for the contemplated work . And as the number of worthy subjects increased , my plan pruportionably enlarged , until it finally embraced all who have been in any considerable degree distinguished , from the earliest settlement of the country to the present time . " In the construction of the work , I have had an eye indirectly to the history of the Church , as well as directly to the biography of its ministers . I have , therefore , kept each denomination by itself and have arranged the names under each chronologically , so that the gradual changes in the ministry an easily be traced , and the progress of the denomination also , so far as it is identified with the character and d ings of its ministers . A chronological index is placed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index at the close . " The work is chiefly distinguished by two characteristics . One is , that the testimony concerning character , is , with very few exceptions , original-it is not only the sentiment but the very language , of the individual who could speak from actual knowledge . The rule , in every case practicable , has been to procure from some well known person or persons , a letter or letters containing their recollections and impressions illustrative of the character ; but where there has been no one living to testify-as was uniformily the case with all who died before 1*iO-I have availed myself of the best testimony of their contemporaries from funeral sermons , obituary notices , &amp;c. , that I could obtain . And where , as in a very few instances , I have not been able even to do this , I have endeavored to substitute that which seemed to me to come nearest to original testimony-that is , the opinion of those who , without having known the individuals , were best qualified , from peculiar circumstances , to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work is , that it at least claims an exemption from denominational partiality . Though I have , of course , my own theological views and ecclesiastical relations , which I sacredly and gratefully cherish , I have not attempted in this work to defend them even by implication : my own aim has been to present what 1 supposed to be a faithful outline of the life and character of each individual , without justifying or condemning the opinions they have respectively held . " We do not see that a better plan could well have been adopted for a work of this general type . It is a plan excellently // adapted to secure accuracy and thoroughness in regard to essential facts , and faithfulness and lifelikeness in the portraiture of character . In preparing the particular sketches , it was , of course , necessary in regard to the earlier clergy , to draw chiefly on materials already published ; and in the case of many of these , there remained but very little to be added to what was already known . But even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing materials well digested and put in proper shape and compass for convenient reference or reading , since they were only to be found by hunting through extensive libraries , or perhaps rare antiquarian collections . For the later biographies , the facts were to be gleaned , often at great pains undoubtedly , from a variety of original sources , such as church and family records , from private collections of letters and manuscripts , and above all , from the recollections of living persons . Nearly all the matter included in these notices will be entirely new to the great majority of readers  --  a positive and invaluable addition to the religious history of our country . It is hardly necessary to say , that Dr. Sprague has written these annals in the same clear , correct and polished style , for which his previous publications have been distinguished ; a style particularly suited , by its graceful simplicity and ease , to such a work as this . The letters of personal recollections , contributed by a great number of writers , themselves , not a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , constitute a deeply interesting portion of the work . Many of them are admirably written . They are of great value not only as supplying so many facts in relation to their subjects which were not to be obtained elsewhere , but still more as furnishing fresh and lifelike sketches of person , character and manners , which bring the men before us as they were , and which could only be drawn by those who had the advantage of personal acquaintance . It is often the case that the mention of some trifling incident , or some characteristic anecdote , in relation to a person , will give a better insight into his real character , than and formal description would convey . Some of these letters are rich in this sort of illustration . Some , on the other hand , are flue examples of nice analysis of character , and of careful discrimination , in their estimate of the genius and the merits of those whom they describe . The Preface states that five hundred and forty individuals have contributed to this work ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known to have since deceased , and that fifty-two have a place in it both as contributors and subjects ! // Besides what has been done in the text of these volumes to preserve the memory of the most distinguished ministers and their works , there is contained , in the notes which are scattered through them , a valuable supplement of clerical biography , which it must have cost the author no small labor to prepare . Wherever , in writing the principal articles , other clergymen have been mentioned , the main facts in their history , so far as it was possible to ascertain them , have been given at the bottom of the page . In this way , brief notices are furnished of a great number of persons who could not be included in the text , to the great assistance of the reader , as well as to the enhancement of the general value of the work . We get interesting glimpses of the lesser lights of the ecclesiastical firmament , while chiefly occupied with the greater luminaries . The discovery of errors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and history , if any such exist , must be a work of time . It will be singular if amidst so many details , there should not some be found . There is ample evidence , however , that there has been no want of care or labor in order to be accurate . As to denominational partiality , we should not of course expect to find any trace of it in these two volumes . What would have been very difficult , if not quite impossible , to many men , to write the lives of men of widely different theological opinions in the spirit of a fair and candid annalist , was , we think , comparatively easy to Dr. Sprague . None but an habitually candid and appreciative person would be able-though honestly endeavoring to make it his steady aim throughout  --  to exhibit each individual as he appeared to those who knew him best ; to delineate the character , and state the views of each as they actually were , instead of pronouncing judgment , even by implication , as to what they should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to have done this , when the succeeding volumes of his work appear , we have the fullest confidence ; and we regard it as a ground of special thankfulness that an undertaking of so much delicacy , as well as of so great interest to the churches , was , providentially , committed to such able and judicious hands . Indeed , we do not hesitate to express the opinion , that no other man in the whole country could have brought to a work of this particular character so many of the precise qualities required in order to do it well . If the labor has been great , it has nevertheless been in harmony with the author 's well known tastes ; and certainly in his generous and pious purpose to preserve for coming generations the memory of the venerable dead , he has performed a task which , both in conception and execution , is , so far as we // have been able to examine , altogether honorable to himself . The Annals of the American Pulpit will take a permanent place in our religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , that there is an increasing disposition in our time to withhold respect from the Christian ministry , the influence of such a work as this of Dr. Sprague 's will be , when all the volumes shall have been issued , must , it would seem , do something to correct it . It can not fail to make on the minds of all candid persons who examine it , a strong impression of the comparative intellectual and moral dignity of the clerical profession . With only these two volumes , which give us only the biographies of Congregational Clergymen , chiefly belonging to New England , what a company of noble men-noble in the highest and best sensepresent themselves before us What other profession can offer from its ranks so many really distinguished names ? In which can so large an array be found , of men , who , in genius , in discipline , in learning , in largeness of mind , in the power of swaying men , in firm , unflinching principle , in whatever enters into the conception of true greatness , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veneration of mankind ? We confess that we have turned over these pages with a feeling of reverence , hearty and profound . We have seemed to ourselves , while we have lingered among these sketches , as if standing in some grand old gallery of pictures , from every side of which the strong expressive faces of a vast number of persons , illustriously great and good , were looking calmly on us , and challenging our homage . We have trodden the solemn aisles of Westminster Abbey , where the monuments of celebrated poets , of eminent statesmen , of heroes world-renowned , and of sovereigns whose nod once shook the nations , were about us on every hand , with less of serious awe than we feel when standing as if in the presence of the grand assembly of venerated Christian pastors and instructors , who are gathered about us here by the biographic pen . It is our deliberate conviction , moreover , that this impression is legitimate . For among the various classes of men who bear a prominent part in the world 's affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second to none in power Ever since the institution of Christianity , the clergy have constituted a distinct class or order in society . We speak simply of a matter of fact . We assert no jure divino superiority as belonging to them personally , or as involved in their solemn office . Enongh that such an order of men has actually existed ; that it has been known and recognized of all as exerting a commanding // influence ; and that it fills , as one looks back along the track of history , a very prominent place . " Look at the history of Europe , " says M. Guizot , " from the fifth to the sixteenth century , and you will find throughout , that theology has possessed and directed the human mind ; every idea is impressed with theology ; every question that has been started , whether philosophical , political , or historical , has been considered in a religions point of view . So powerful , indeed , has been the authority of the Church the Clergy in matters of intellect , that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its doctrines . The spirit of theology has been as it were the blood which has circulated in the veins of the European world down to the time of Bacon and Descartes . " This is strong language , but not stronger than the facts of the case will warrant . IRegarded in the light of such statements , the Christian ministry presents itself to the thoughtful mind as one of the cardinal forces at work in the civilized world ; powerful for evil when it misdirects its energy ; powerful for good when it fulfills its proper functions . As such a force , its history and influence are worthy to be studied ; they must be studied , indeed , in order to a right understanding of modern civilization . It is our own conviction , that in no age and no country , since Apostolic days , has the Christian ministry more effectually done its work , more nearly realized the idea of the divine Author of Christianity in its institution , than within the last two centuries in our own country , and especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world has never been blessed with an equally numerous body of Christian pastors , who , taken altogether , were more learned , more godly , more faithful and generally successful in their work , than the Orthodox Congregational clergy of New England , of whom we have so many examples in the volumes now before us . In what we have further to say , we shall have in view only the Ministry of the Orthodox Congregational churches , those , in other words , who have adhered to the system of Christian doctrine embraced by the Pilgrim Fathers . While we thus limit the field of our remarks , we have no intention of ignoring the eminent men of the Arminian and Unitarian , or other kindred schools . We can appreciate the gifts , the eloquence and scholarly culture , and admire the various and shining excellences , which many of them exhibited , while we dissent wholly from their systems of theology . Nor would we be understood , in anything which we may say , as intending any invidious comparison between the Congregational , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // biography before us , relating to Ministers who have preached and loved the doctrines of our Puritan ancestors , we can not need to offer any apology for taking occasion to express our views in relation particularly to these . We feel that to these men we , who are now reaping rich fruits from their faithful and enlightened toils and counsels , owe a large debt of gratitude and veneration ; and we love to do them honor and to study their sturdy virtues . We are not blind , indeed , to the deficiences which the ministry of our evangelical churches have exhibited . The holiest and the best of them have themselves wept , as in dust and ashes , before God , over their numerous short-comings ; and there have been seasons in the course of the two centuries which are covered by their labors , in which , both in the ministry and in the churches , there were sad spiritual declensions . This , however , is only saying that the Christian Chnrch , here as elsewhere , has been hitherto in the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn in the school of Christ . After all reasonable qualifications and abatements of their merits , and with the long catalogue of the strong men of the English Restoration , and the great names that illuminate the history of the Church of Scotland , fresh in memory , we still can not hesitate to claim that the orthodox Congregational clergy of New England have been second to no other equal body of Ministers in the best gifts and graces of Christian pastors and teachers . In justification of this claim , we will briefly refer to what we take to be the true idea , and the normal functions of the Christian ministry , in the light of the New Testament ; and will then notice more partic*ifarly the leading characteristics of that ministry , which , from the days of Robinson and Eliot , Shepard and Hooker , down to the present generation , has so richly blessed the churches of the Pilgrims . It has blessed not them only , but the world . When our Lord Jesus Christ had finished his redeeming work , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful and well defined provision for the establishment and perpetuation of Christianity . There had been under the old economy , an order of men who were separated officially from their brethren , and wholly consecrated to the services connected with religion . The priesthood had been the prominent instrumentality in maintaining the national faith , and the rites of public worship . But Christ , when he appeared , took on kimee*f the functions of the priesthood ; and in his own person offered once for all , the one final and availing sacrifice . Thenceforward , the office of priest ceased to exist among men ; // 505 and when the Romish hierarchy , or any other , assume to be a literal priesthood , they profanely arrogate to themselves the high prerogatives which belong to Christ alone . Instead of a human priesthood , our Lord ordained that in the Christian economy there should be temporarily Apostles and prophets , and permanently , evangelists , pastors and teachers , for the work of the ministry , to the edifying of the body of Christ . He directed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with the oversight of the brotherhood of believers with reference to their spiritual growth , should be committed to careftully selected persons who should give themselves wholly to these duties . All this is evident not only from what he did and said himself before he left the world , but also from what the Apostles and the brethren of the churches , after his ascension , went on immediately to do . This ministry of instruction and of pastorship , originating in his own will , the divine IRedeemer undoubtedly clothed with power , not however by transmitting to them some bidden virtue by means of a mysterious continuity of ecclesiastical succession , but by giving them the pledge , " Ed , I am with you always , " together with the promise of the Spirit . Accordingly , wherever the Apostles founded Christian churches they set over them ministers , elders , bishops , by whatever name distinguished , and charged them first of all to preach the word and watch over the flock of Christ ; and then , in concurrence with the churches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had themselves received to faithful men , who should be able to teach others also . This , then , is the true conception of the Christian ministry . It is an order or class of men , demanded by the necessities of the Christian Church , constituted by the voice of the Church in obedience to the will of Christ , and set apart wholly to the work of directly applying the Gospel for the saving of the world . Its authority is derived immediately from the Church , ultimately from Christ himself . Its power is the power of knowledge , of skill , of energy in action , of living faith , of inward holiness and grace , and of Divine cooperation . Not only is it the grand function of this ministry to preach the Gospel of the kingdom ; but it is to preach , with such wisdom , thoroughness , and pungency that the Gospel may effectually do its work . This , of course , presupposes not only a personal experience of the power of the Gospel , but also the intellectual training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisite to a right understanding and just exposition of Christian truth and duty . The first preachers were supernaturally qualified for their official work . // Ministers of comparative little intellectual culture , and with but a partial comprehension of the theory of Christianity , may doubtless accomplish something in what is purely practical , especially when surrounded with others who are competent ; but let the ministry as a body be ignorant , and ( without a constant miracle , ) it must of necessity fail altogether to answer the ends of its institution . It is impossible to read the New Testament with care , without perceiving that it contemplates and demands for the application of the Gospel to the world , a well instructed and truly able ministry . The deep conviction of this , which took possession of the minds of the IReformers , was the natural result of their Gospel studies , as it was also one of the most important steps of the Reformation itself . Now , beside this view of the true nature and functions of the Christian ministry , which lies patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place the ministry of the Puritan churches of New England . Let the ministry which has labored in the New England churches be estimated by this standard . Let the records of it be carefully examined , and then let a judgment be deliberately formed as to the degree in which it has been according to the mind of Christ , and has done the work which he has committed to those who serve him in the Gospel . If we could summon up the entire number of those who from its ranks have rested from their labors , and place them before ns in one great assembly , we should certainly see in them , as we have said , a company of truly noble men , - men whose piety , learning , fidelity and wisdom entitled them to a large measure of the honor which is due , by the common consent of men , to eminent worth and usefulness . The fact that the first ministers of New England were men of eminent gifts and liberal culture , scholars well trained in the English Universities , served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations . What the ministry should be , was settled at the outset , in the minds of the men who founded the New England commonwealths . While , even in their poverty and hardships , they regarded a regular ministry as one of the absolute necessaries of existence , they had no idea of being satisfied with anything short of a really learned and well trained body of pastors . The truly heroic efforts which they made to provide such for those who should come after them , have commanded the admiration of the world . Those efforts were decisive in their results . While Harvard and Yale were soon beginning to afford the means of liberal education , the demands of the people were urging the pulpit to do its best in the way of earnest and vigorous discussion of // the essential Christian truths . It was , from the beginning , the popular conviction that the ministerial office required the best talent ; and parents were most happy to be able to devote to it their choicest sons . The colonies themselves had an infancy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stood up from the first , in the strength of a full development , and furnished with complete and ample panoply . It was a matter of course that such a ministry should be the zealous patron of popular education , and that under its auspices , institutions of learning should rapidly be multiplied , and liberally endowed ; that the work of collecting libraries should be begun ; and , in short , that every practicable provision should be made for the promotion of sound knowledge , and for the permanent supply of a fitting pastorship to intelligent and appreciating churches . The wishes of the early fathers have been realized . There have doubtless been divers gifts among these pastors , as there will necessarily be in all professions . But , undeniably , there has been among them a great number of strong men-men of clear understandings , of quick perceptive powers , original in thought , and logical and vigorous in argument . Not merely in the cities and more prominent positions have men of this stamp been found , but very many of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy of the Congregational churches of New England , have also , on the whole , been remarkable for breadth of culture . They have not often been men of one idea . They have not generally confined themselves to what seemed to lie immediately within the range of their own professional duty . They have recognized the commune vinculum not only between the different branches of merely human knowledge , but also between human knowledge and that which is IDivine . They have understood that the results of scientific study , and the conclusions of sound philosophy and reason , should at once harmonize with the doctrines of religion and help to illustrate and confirm them . If they have not literally received the saying of Cicero , that an orator should know everything , they have so far entered into the spirit of it that very many of them have been wide and earnest students all their lives . They have been conversant not only with the learned languages , with Biblical archæology , history and criticism , along with doctrinal theology , but also , to a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general history , literature , and physical science , with political economy , and sometimes with the main principles of civil law . We think it true beyond all question , that the educated clergy of New England have , as a whole , very far surp2ssed // the other learned professions in liberal studies . The best treatises in metaphysics , the best and largest contributions to the higher periodical literature , even the best text-books in the mathematics and in some of the natural sciences , have not seldom been written , if not by actual pastors of churches , by men of the clerical profession . Not only professors in theological institutions , but also the preceptors of academies and the presidents and professors of the colleges and universities , have been drawn , a large proportion of them , from the same class . And it has all along been true , as it is true to-day , that the influence of the ministry upon the popular mind , whatever it may be , is not attributable , as has sometimes tauntingly been said , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intellectual and moral power which they have collectively exhibited . Nor has this breadth of scholarship been attained at the expense of their own particular department . On the contrary , by their general culture , the Congregational ministers of New England have been fitted to cultivate more thoroughly their proper field . Facts testify that they have done it . Nowhere have greater thoroughness of investigation , a more masterly dialectic skill , or a keener metaphysical acumen , been applied to the great questions of theology , than here . They have not been content to accept theological science as so fixed and settled by other ages , that all ftirther inquiry is foreclosed . Not only the great champions whose fame has become ecumenical , such as Edwards , Hopkins , Emmons , Burton , Bellamy , Dwight , Woods , Stuart , but a large proportion of the humble pastors also , whose names are unknown to fame , have gone to the study of theology with a profound reverence for the Bible , indeed , as the infallible arbiter of truth , but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full persuasion that the rich mine of Christian doctrine might still be wrought with profit . No doubt this independent spirit of inquiry has been attended with some evils . There is an evil , solomon says , among all things that are done under the sun . But even the friction of high debate , and the rashness of daring speculation , are far less fatal to the interests of vital truth and of practical religion , than the uninquiring deadness of intellectual and theological stagnation . In a fair judgment of the matter , he must be a brave man who will venture to maintain that the intellectual giants in our ministry , who have labored with holy earnestness to unfold , defend and harmonize the grand doctrines of revealed religion , have not , on the whole , contributed greatly to the better understanding of these doctrines , and of the way to use them for the conversion of sinners and the edification of the Church . // 509 Without claiming , or believing , that any system , or any school which these men may have formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , we can not doubt that their vigorous grappling with the difficult problems involved in the Christian revelation has , at least , contributed greatly to keep the popular mind awake to religious themes ; and has served to bring out more completely the various aspects of many-sided truth . It is probably the fact that at some particular times , and in some limited circles , the exhibitions of the pulpit have been injuriously metaphystcal and polemic in their character ; but , certainly , nowhere has the preaching of the Gospel been more richly fruitful than among the hills and valleys and in the towns and cities of New England . Nowhere have revivals of religion been more frequent and powerful , and more permanent in their results . Nowhere has there been seen a more enlightened and liberal benevolence . Such practical effects attending the ministrations of the pulpit , speak well for the soundness and wisdoni of its utterances . That preaching may well be held to be neither greatly erroneous nor essentially unskillful , which for a long course of years , is blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity proposes . It is true that among the ministers and churches of Massachusetts , a somewhat wide defection from the faith of the Reformation-the faith of Primitive Christianity-has been witnessed . We do not think , however , that any candid person who understands the matter , will attribute this either to anything inherent in the polity of the Congregational churches , or to any peculiarity of their ministry . The causes of this defection lie deeper and farther back ; while , on the other hand , the manner in which the great body of the churches and the ministry have withstood and neutralized the movement , and exerted on it a corrective , and what , it may be hoped , will eventually prove a healing influence , evinces clearly the existence in that body of a vigorous spiritual vitality , and a high degree both of intellectual and moral power . Their singleness o fpurj*ose in the ministerial work is another marked characteristic of t e Puritan clergy of New England . They have very generally given their best powers , and their almost undivided attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have been made steadily tributary to this . What they have done for the cause of education , they have considered as , in fact , included in , or at least , intimately related to this work . What they have contributed to the periodical literature of their time , has been chiefly on subjects having obvious bearings on morals and religion ; while // the solid volumes , in large part posthumous , which they have left to instruct posterity , have been very generally filled with the treasures of the sanctuary  --  the substance of the wellwrought discussions , with which , from week to week , they had interested and instructed their hearers from the pulpit . Determined to know nothing , as the shepherds and ambassadors of Christ , but salvation by his Cross , they have drawn the chief matter of their sermons from the Bible ; and have found at Gethsemane and Calvary their highest inspiration . There has been a good deal said of late among us , about the introduction of politics into the Christian pulpit , and with no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is in reality but little difference of opinion on the subject among enlightened Christian people . There are some individual men who seem born to be exceptions to all ordinary rules-men whose orbits are so eccentric that , comet-like , they are always whisking acros the paths of staid and proper persons , aifrighting some perhaps with their fiery glare , and causing at times no little perturbation of adjusted forces . There always have been , and probably always will be some such men in the Christian ministry . If it were borne in mind that comets are not , after all , the most solid bodies in the system , and that they doubtless have their uses , however strange their freaks , it might incline the world to regard them with greater equanimity , and to leave them to fulfill their peculiar mission . That such men should literally preach politics occasionally , is nothing to be wondered at , though it may be regretted even by the most judicious . But as regards the general rule that ought to guide the minister of Christ , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his commission he is a teacher of religious and moral duty , as these are stated in the Gospel . Polit*cal questions-those that are purely so-are not within the province of morals or religion ; and with these , therefore , he can have no concern . Let the dead bury their dead ; at least let secular things be kept in secular places . Such questions are to be left to those to whom they naturally belong . But it often happens that political movements and measures , either of governments or people , involve questions which are not only strictly religious or moral in their nature , but which are vitally connected with the progress of Christianity , and the practical duty of all Christians . What then ? Shall the ministry keep silence on such questions because of their political relations ? Rulers and legislators , as well as men in private life , are to obey the law of God , and the principles of morality delivered in the Gospel . If they in their acts plainly do violence to these-if they frame // wickedness by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conscience , shall they escape rebuke under the plea that what they do belongs to the domain of politics ? Who 8ha11 maintain the claims of Christian morality , when outraged in the high places of the world ? - who shall assert the universal and eternal obligation of those principles of right which the Word of God reveals ? - who shall lift up the voice of stern rebuke against the invasion of the interests of religion and morality alike , by men in power , if not the ministers of Christ  --  the publicly known and recognized expounders of Christianity ? There certainly can be but one opinion here . The proper rule of ministerial action , therefore , plainly is that the clergy should be careful never to invade the proper domain of politicians , but that when politicians clearly invade the domain of Christian morals , the pulpit shall treat them as it does all other sinners . There is doubtless need of care and wisdom in the application of the rule ; but as to the fitness of the rule itself as stated , it hardly seems possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the practice of the great majority of the Con gregational clergy of New England , from the landing upon Plymouth IRock till the present time . A few , no doubt , have at some times sinned against the canon just laid down . The greater number have observed it in both parts . They have not gone out of the circle of religion ; nor have they feared to withstand those by whom that circle has been violated , whoever or whereever they might be . They have kept themselves habitually to their great work . It has been thought by some who have been ready to acknowledge the learning , acuteness , and piety of the ministry of the New England churches , and to do justice to the soundness and strength of their theology , that as preachers they have held a lower rank . Different persons will , of course , judge differently on this point , according to their own ideals of what good preaching is . The preaching in our pulpits has had marked peculiariti*s . It has been solid and instructive , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of great religious declension , it has seldom lacked earnestness and warmth . It has dealt largely in truths , in principles , and in practical applications ; comparatively little in learned allusions , rhetorical devices , and elaborate grace of style . The writing of sermons has , more especially of late years , been the rule , and preaching without writing , the exception ; and some even of the most eminent preachers , have almost literally read their discourses , cultivating scarcely at all the arts of oratory . On the other hand , there have been many who , though writing carefully for // the pulpit , and using their manuscripts habitually in speaking , have not been readers , in any ordinary sense of the term ; but have acquired the ability to speak from the written page with energy and grace , and have even reached , in this manner , the highest style of eloquence . The sermon addressed to both city and country congregations has ordinarily been clear and wellarranged , sensible , scriptural , adapted to popular apprehension , and fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ; and rarely have audiences been more effectually thrilled and swayed by the power and pathos of the sacred orator , than under the discourses of the best New England pastors , particularly since the days of the great awakening in 1740 . The most distinguished of these have exhibited neither the splendor-now terrible and now pathetic-of the great French preachers , on the one hand , nor the exquisite naiveteas if breathing into their discourses the fragrant exhalations of religious affection-for which the finest German preachers are distinguished ; nor have they rivaled the affluent quaintness and elaborate pedantry of Jeremy Taylor , nor the elegant copiousness and strength of Barrow , nor the inexhaustible fertility of Baxter , Howe , and Owen . But in a somewhat original and characteristic sort of eloquence , the master-spirits of the New England pulpit have delivered themselves with an impressiveness rarely surpassed , it ever , and in a style excellently adapted to the highest ends of preaching . Edwards-our Augustinewas not less prominent when probing the conscience as a preacher in the pulpit , than he was when drawing nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwight - our Chrysostom-bore along his delighted , and yet solemnly affected hearers , on a tide of strength and beauty . Emmons , the calmest of all reasoners , drew his auditors after him with the never-broken links of an iron logic . The impassioned Griffin alternately harrowed and melted those who listened to his voice . On the lips of the impressive Porter , the fervid Stuart , and the tranquil Woods , intensety interested listeners hung , and often felt to their inmost hearts the subduing power of the truths which they eloquently uttered . We repeat , that we speak , of course , in a general manner , in these references to the leading characteristics of the Congregational clergy of New England ; and that we have not designed to go beyond the body of Trinitarian pastors , with which all the subj ects included in the two volumes before us were connected . The particular qualifications of these general observations , which are necessary , will readily suggest themselves . There have been days which were dark and sad , in the history // of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little for the living waters of salvation , and the pastors preached with but little unction . Yet even in the gloomiest periods there has been a large number of truly faithful pastors , exhibiting very many of the characteristics we have noticed . Since the days of Edwards , and more particularly since the beginning of the present century , the great advances made in theological education , the general and powerful revivals with which the churches have been favored , the waking up of the spirit of home and foreign missions , and the general impulse which has been given to all movements for the moral improvement of the world , have had a powerful influence in elevating the intellectual character of the pulpit among us , and ( it is to be hoped ) in giving it , considered as a whole , a higher inspiration . We see clearly , and are ready to admit , that there are , at present , some influences at work which endanger the piety , the strength , and the pulpit power of the ministry ; and the mischievous effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No doubt there is needed a more primitive devotedness , a profounder spiritual knowledge and exp erience , and a larger unction from the Holy One . But we have a strong persuasion that He " who holdeth the stars in His right hand , and walketh in the midst of the golden candlesticks , " will perfect that which is lacking , and not suffer the glory of the One to be permanently eclipsed , nor the purity and beauty of the other to be tarnished . It is not enough that our ministry is likely to become more learned ; it must be deeply felt that learning in the clergy is a means and not an end ; and our theological students must be baptized into the spirit of the Master , and filled with the Holy Ghost and with faith , if they are to be truly fitted for their high vocation . It is a hopeful sign , that this seems of late to be more deeply felt . We trust that these notices of the fathers who have made full proof of their ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many a candidate for the sacred office . It is of course to be concluded that such a ministry as that of which we have been speaking , has powerfully affected not only the character and spirit of the people , but the entire condition and institutions of New England . That it has done so , is p lain . To what can the proverbial acuteness of the common New England mind , and the general intelligence , good principle , industry and enterprise , for which the people are distiii*uished , be so largely and confidently attributed , as to the teen , large-minded , manly , earnest ministry , which in succe&gt; ; ive generations has wrought on them from childhood upwards ? vo xix. 34 // Beyond a doubt , in this especially , we find the key to those peculiar traits of Yankee character which have been admired by all the world . Its impress everywhere appears in the complexion both of individual and social life . Go into a country town , and enter any plain farmer 's dweliir*g .

There on the table is a Bible , and with it , probably , one or two good commentaries . There too is a book case and a library .

Ask for the children of the household . The younger sons and daughters you will find assisting their parents in honorable labor through the summer , and in the winter attending the village school ; while the elder , you may learn , are at the academy and the college .

The face of the earth can ofier no equal extent of territory , in which there is to be found so much of general industry and social virtue , so much of everything , in a word , that enters into the idea of a Christian civilization . We would not arrogate to the ministry more than its proper share in the production of this enviable state of things ; but conceding to other professions and other agencies all that can reasonably be asked , we think we are still justified in saying , that to the peculiar influence of her able and godly ministry , more than to any other cause , is New England indebted for the eminent comparative happiness which is the birthright of her sons and daughters . Well may she cherish and revere the memory of the dead ! Well may she prize the faithful labors of the living , and pray with earnestness that God will keep the ranks of her pastors perpetually full , by sanctifying and bringing into them the best and noblest of her youth In every interest , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry decline . We shall look anxiously , as will our readers , we presume , for the succeeding volumes of the deeply interesting work of Dr. Sprague , to which we have referred . We anticipate great pleasure and profit in studying the ministerial records of other denominations .
