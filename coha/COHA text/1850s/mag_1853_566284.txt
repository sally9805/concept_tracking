txt ART . 111. - THE SEPARATISTS OF EASTERN CONNECTICUT . A History of the Revival of Religion in the time of Edwards and Whitfield . " By JOSEPH TRACY . Boston : 1842 . IN a retired corner of the town of Canterbury , overlooking a pleasant but narrow valley between rugged and barren hills , stands a ruinous house of worship . Its broken windows and prostrate doors give access to every storm ; the snow stores its treasures where once grave men and devout women worshiped God . The hand of the spoiler has also been there ; and those who might justly have been " famous according as they had lifted up axes upon the thick trees-break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers . " The pulpit , that high throne , from which the preacher 's voice sounded so authoritatively , has disappeared from its ancient place , and all things , without and within , give token of approaching dissolution . Perhaps another summer 's sun will not shine upon that once hallowed roof ; some rude blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final ruin . But why stands this sanctuary thus desolated ? Is it the memorial of a faith now perished from the earth ? We may ask of the townspeople , and hear their story of " The Old Red Meeting-house ; " but in order to comprehend its full import , we need to turn back to a portion of the history of Connecticut , which merits careful study and a full exhibition . The time has come for a fair and impartial judgment of the Separatists of one hundred years ago . We propose here only a sketch such as may call attention to the subject , hoping that it may find more ample illustration . Meanwhile we desire to acknowledge the good service done by Rev. Joseph Tracy , who in his " History of the Great Awakening , " placed at the head of this article , has given a succinct account of the Separatists , characterized by his usual exactness and fidelity . To this work of exceeding interest and value , we are indebted for many important suggestions , and to it we refer our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked this period , affecting various parts of our own country as well as Great Britain . It may be well , however , briefly to describe the aspect of the times among the churches of Connecticut . There can be no doubt that the period preceding the Awakening had been one // of great declension in religion . Formalism and lukewarmness had spread wide among the churches . There were many ministers , whose views of religious experience were vague and indefinite , and whose preaching , though founded on an evangelical scheme of doctrine , had the very heterodox effect of quieting the consciences of impenitent men , if they were only of good behavior externally . Perhaps there were no more immoral men in the ministry then than there are now . There was among the clergy a much greater show of dignity and gravity , a more reverend and sedate carriage of themselves in their intercourse with the people , a higher estimate of their official rights , and a more determined assertion of privilege and power . It can not be thought strange that such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Whitfield , when like a comet he suddenly blazed athwart their path . Some of the remarks and some of the acts of that godly man , and wonderfully eloquent preacher , would scarcely bear the test of sound discretion . Much more did the follies of his imitator , Davenport , grieve the best friends of the revival he aimed to promote . Among the indiscretions of these men , which were readily copied by their followers , was the practice of pronouncing summarily and confidently upon the spiritual state of individuals . It was a favorite tenet with them that the true saints could be certainly known , and they seem to have rested much on the presumption afforded by great zeal and lively emotions in religious matters . Nor did they hesitate to decide and declare concerning those who held themselves aloof from the revival that they were unconverted , hypocritical , and ( if ministers ) " shepherds that fed themselves " - " dumb dogs that can not bark , sleeping , lying down , loving to slumber . " These free censures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ill calculated to secure their good will . Two other practices then prevalent , and in a measure justified by the zealous revivalists , gave offense to the moderate clergy , and excited in them , or at least in their friends and allies , a spirit essentially tyrannical and persecuting . One of the practices alluded to was that of itinerant labors , on the part of the more earnest and devoted pastors , who did not choose to confine their endeavors for the promotion of religion to their own parish bounds , but " went everywhere , preaching the word . " The other practice referred to was the allowance of lay-exhorters , who used their unwonted " liberty of prophesying , " not always with the best discernment of proprieties , or // with due respect to those who had held a practical monopoly of the public religious instruction of the people . These abuses and disorders , ( as they were termed , ) were made the subject of a prohibitory statute , enacted in 1742 , by the General Assembly of the colony , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By this statute , ministers were fbrbidden to preach in any parish than their own , without invitation of the pastor or people , under penalty of forfeiting all title to the benefit of the laws for the support of the ministry , and it was provided that a regular information against any minister to this effect should , without trial of the fact , work such a forfeiture , and bar the collection of rates for his support . By another section of the act all exhorters were forbidden to exercise their gifts , unless permitted by the parish authorities ; and all strangers , of whatever ecclesiastical dignity out of the colony , presuming to " teach , preach or publicly exhort " without such permission of pastor or parish , were to be sent as vagrants from constable to constable , out of the bounds of Connecticut ! Nor was this law a dead letter . No less a man than Samuel Finley , afterwards President of the College of New Jersey , felt the force of the last section , and by the operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deprived of his regular salary , and thrown upon the kindness of his friends for support during a term of seven years . There was in short a vigorous effort made by ecclesiastical and political authority , to repress the mighty religious agitation that shook the commonwealth ,  --  to put out " the New Lights , " as the revivalists were termed , and enforce conformity to the Saybrook Platform . As a part of this arbitrary scheme , the Assembly , in 1743 , repealed an act which was contemporaneous with the adoption of the Saybrook Platform , entitled , " An Act for the relief of Sober Consciences , " which provided that all , who soberly dissented from the prevailing system , might , on taking certain oaths , be relieved from taxation for the support of the parish ministers . The repeal of this act left all dissenters , however sober , at the mercy of the Assembly , and of the dominant party therein , whose mercies then were cruel . Such was the state of the times in the colony of Connecticut ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn especial attention to the Eastern section thereof , comprised in the counties of New London and Windham , the boundaries of which were then somewhat larger than now . The settlements in many of these towns were comparatively new , and the churches therein had scarcely attained the vigor of mature age . Many of the // pastors had brought with them from " the Bay State , " the practice of the " half-way covenant ; " and some ( as Rev. Solomon Wilijams of Lebanon ) maintained the right of moral men , as such , to a participation in the Lord 's Supper , and the propriety of their coming to it as a means of grace . These and other things had spread apathy and stupidity over the face of this region . Yet in 1721 , a revival of considerable power took place at Windham , where Rev. Solomon Whiting was then pastor . Among those who were awakened at that time , was Elisha Paine , a young lawyer of Canterbury , whose father had come from Eastham on Cape Cod , about thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven pillars " on which , in 1711 , Canterbury Church was built . During the interval between this revival at Windham , and that more general one in 1735 , which beginning ( in Connecticut ) at Windsor reached as far to the Eastward as Coventry , and Mansfield , and Lebanon , and Preston , and Groton , Elisha Paine had grown to be a man of considerable estate , and of some distinction in his profession . At length , in 1741 , when the Awakening throughout the country was most pervading and most powerful , it reached the town of Canterbury , then without a pastor . Under whose labors it there began is uncertain ; but Wheelock and Pomroy had already commenced their itinerant labors , and their homes were not far remote . However this may have been , the awakening of religious interest in the town seems to have roused the slumbering zeal of Elisha Paine , who with his younger brother Solomon , soon became noted among the lay-exhorters of the region . Feeling , in 1742 , called to a more public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some of the neighboring ministers ; but they desiring that he should accept of their approbation , with assent to the Saybrook plan , he set about the work in his own way . Extending his labors into the bounds of Massachusetts , he was imprisoned in Worcester , and afterwards in his own county fell under the discipline of the act of 1742 , being confined in jail at Windham for some weeks . Nor was he opposed by the civil arm alone . In August , 1744 , the Association of Windham County wrote to him , " desiring him to appear before the Association and give opportunity to discourse with him to satisfy themselves what measures they ought to take in respect of his conduct . " This summons being neglected , the Association , three months afterward , sent a letter to the churches , in which they ascribed the distractions , that prevailed among the people , to the evil influences of the Paines and other men of like mould . La these proceedings of the Association there seems to have been a great degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of the revival , some actively promoting , while others stood aloof from it , but they probably held very similar views of ministerial authority , and of the obligations of private members of the church to obey those that have the rule over them . In the Spring of the same year ( 1744 ) in which these proceedings were had respecting Mr. Paine , the Association recommended the people of Canterbury to obtain the services of James Cogswell , a young candidate who had just passed his examination before them . But the church in Canterbury was already " a house divided against itself . " Those who had listened with pleasure to the fervid preaching of Bud the revivalist , were ready to despise the cautious and temperate discourses of the new candidate . So high did party spirit run , that when the Society proceeded to call Mr. Cogswell to a settlement , a large part of the church ( claiming to be a majority ) withdrew from the public worship in the meeting-house , and assembled themselves in a private dwelling , where the Paines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this position , when two nephews of Elisha Paine , John and Ebenezer Cleaveland , came home from Yale College to spend their Autumn vacation . Finding their father and other friends tf*us separated from Mr. Cogswell 's adherents , they likewise attended the Separate meeting , for which on their return to New Haven , . they were arraigned before the Faculty and expelled the College , in accordance ( as President Clap said ) with advice given by the General Asseinbly in 174 ' 2 . This high-handed transaction roused a strong feeling throughout the colony , and probably as much in Canterbury as anywhere . The schism now became irreconcilable , so that when in November a portion of the church invited the Consociation to meet for Mr. Cogswell 's ordination , it was strenuously objected that this was the act of a minority , a part having incurred censure at the hands of their more ardent brethren . In this state of things the Consociation assembled in full council , and spent three days in consultation . Among the pastors present were such warm friends of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one objection to the procedure of the Consociation in this business , the disaffected party produced a vote of the church during the previous year , declaring the Cambridge Platform " to be most agreeable to the former and designed practice of this church . " The object aimed at in this vote , evidently , was to cast off the control of Consociation , and those who passed it were met on their own ground , for the Consociation resolved to consider this a virtual secession on their part , and recognized the adhering // party as a church under Saybrook Platform , which they claimed to be agreeable to the ancient practices of the church . The Society having called Mr. Cogswell by a large majority , the Council being duly satisfied of his qualifications for the ministry , proceeded to ordain him , ( December 28 , 1744 , ) " as a minister unto the Society and the Christian people who have called Mr. Cogswell , and who shall willingly put themselves under his ministerial care . " In their result they disclaimed any disposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended Mr. Cogswell 's adherents to consent that the others be a society by themselves ,  --  they further declared their willingness to aid the dissepters in attaining from the Assembly a release from all obligation to aid in the support of the Society 's minister , and appointed the Moderator ( Rev. Ebenezer Williams ) and the Scribes ( Rev. Messrs . Eliot and Solomon Williams ) to act as their Committee in this business , when thereto invited . Thus originated the First Separate Church in the colony . Yet the Separatists of Canterbury claimed to represent the original church , retained the book of records , and divided the furniture of the Lord 's table with Mr. Cogswell 's friends . They declined to ask incorporation as a new Society , and therefore their petition to be released from ministerial rates was refused for fifteen years , during which time they were subjected to loss of goods , and even to imprisonment on account of their unlawful position . Notwithstanding , however , the pains and penalties which were thus incurred , and in spite of the remonstrances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches December 11 , 1744 , the spirit of Separation grew more and more powerful . In October , 1745 , a company of persons assembled at Mansfield , from the region about that town , and formed themselves into church estate , adopting a formal Confession of Faith . Early the next year these people met to ordain their officers , and listened to a sermon from Elisha Paine ; but Dea . Thomas Marsh , whom they had chosen as their pastor , had that very day been imprisoned for his unlicensed preaching , and they were encountered by a public protest from a number of the neighboring ministers . In spite of this opposition , the Mansfield Separatists succeeded , about a month later , in ordaining not only a pastor , but ruling elders and deacons . One of these ruling elders had been previously pastor of a small Baptist Church , and thus brought at an early period an infusion of Baptist views into the Separating body . Indeed the Separatists have traced through him the only ministerial succession to which they could lay claim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // asserting not only as a matter of theory , but as a part of their practice , the right and authority of each church to ordain its own officers . But in performing this rite they were accustomed to seek the aid of their brethren of like faith ; and thus in September , 1746 , by the aid of the Mansfield Church and its officers did the church at Canterbury ordain its chosen pastor , the younger of the two Paines . About the same time they erected the meeting-house above noticed , not however in its present retired location , but on the commanding eminence west of the Village Green . In this house Mr. Paine officiated until his death ,  --  a troubled period of about eight years . As an example of the troubles he encountered , it may be mentioned that in 1748 , he was brought before the County Court for celebrating marriage , and fined as not being a person authorized by the laws of the colony to perform this service . In like manner , about this time , the Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as administered by Mr. Paine and his fellows , was not to be regarded valid . But while his ministerial standing was thus controverted , no impeachment seems to have been brought against his moral character , nor any doubt expressed of his intellectual ability , lie was succeeded in his office by Mr. Joseph Marshall , who after serving from 1759 to 1768 , removed from the place , and died at an advanced age in Wardsboro , Vt. ,  --  a man respected for his shrewd wit and ardent piety , but marked by exceeding eccentricity of manner and mind . After the removal of Mr. Marshall , the Separate Church in Canterbu ryhad no other Pastor , and things tended toward a reunion . Leaving this particular church for a time , we give a hasty glance at similar movements in other places . particularly in the vicinity . Within a few years of the disruption in Canterbury , separations from the regular churches took place in the limits now included in the towns of Mansfield , Windham , Coventry , Killingly , Plainfield , Voluntown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ledyard , North Stonington , Stonington , Groton , New London , Montville , East Lyme , and Lyme ,  --  MI in the Eastern quarter of the colony , besides Suffield , Windsor , Wethersfield , Middletown , and perhaps other towns in other parts . In some of the towns named , the organization of the Separatists was probably temporary and imperfect , but in others two or more churches were fully established . These churches generally selected their pastors from among themselves , men of ordinary education , but possessed of some readiness in speaking , and exhibiting peculiar fervor in religion . But in order to furnish a supply of teachers for these churches , there was provided in New London a sort of Normal School , called " The von . xi . 26 // The Separatists of Eastern Connecticut . May , Shepherd 's Tent , " over which presided Rev. Timothy Allen , who had been suspended from his ministry at West Haven for some indiscreet expressions . This establishment was , however , soon broken up , partly perhaps through the odium excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed in New London on Sunday evening , March 6 , 1743 . This was the occasion on which , at the suggestion of Davenport , ( then quite beside himself under thecombined influence of physical and spiritual disorders , ) the enthusiasts there assembled made a bonfire in the public street of books which had fallen under his censure , as well as of those articles of dress which were most likely to gratify a vain-glorious disposition . Other circumstances might be mentioned to illustrate the wild excitement which at this time pervaded this region , under the especial influence and leadership of Davenport , and which filled with sorrow the hearts of wiser men , such as the venerable Eliphalet Adams of New London , the fervid Jonathan Parsons of Lyme , ( Whitfield 's peculiar friend , ) and others who had rejoiced in the revival , but found " caution needful in that critical day . " But the plan of this sketch forbids us to enter at greater length into particulars . We will , however , refer briefly to the peculiar views which characterized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty . The somewhat enthusiastic creed adopted at Mansfield , was not so generally accepted as to be a positive rule of judgment , as to the general faith . The Separatists in Canterbury retained the same forms of profession and covenant , which had been in use in the original church , and which were drawn in the sternest phrase of Calvinism , and this was likewise adopted by the Separate Church in Wind ham . From the best light that we have on the subject , we conclude , that though individuals among the Separatists fell into such errors as are most likely to be embraced by men of more zeal than discretion , the body kept as near the great fundamental truths of the Gospel as their adversaries . Those who would look at the point for themselves , may see the matter argued against the Separatists , in the letter of Windham Association , dated December , 1744 , and in the result of a council of Wiadham Consociation in January , 1747 , which last contains the Mansfield confession of faith in its superabundance of twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which treats of the church . And yet by the showing of these ministers , who judge the Separatists , we are led to feel that they themselves heljzl views subversive of true gospel discipline , as when they allowed to unconverted men a rightful place in the church . On the other hand , though we // would not deny all their charges against the Separatists , we seem to see clearly that those Separatists nmintained with a sort of blundering consistency correct views on this subject , which was the special subject in debate between them . They held for substance the same views which are now so firmly established through the labors of Edwards and Bellam in the minds of New England Christians . y The leaders of the Separation were not men who used the pen with readiness . Elisha Paine , who might have been their champion in this sort of warfare , withdrew from Connecticut in 175* , and became pastor of a church in Bridgehampton , L. I. , to which he ministered until just before his death , which took place in 1775 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon , once adventured himself as an author in a " Short View of the Constitution of the Church of Christ , and the difference between it and the church established in Connecticut , " a pamphlet of 70 pages , small quarto , in which he tries to show the church established by law to be no church of Christ , because of the power given to irreligious men . We can not hei*e attemj ) t an analysis of this work , but may observe that it is written with no little ingenuity , and with the ardor of full conviction , though not without a savor of enthusiasm in certain passages . The point at which he drives may be seen in the following quotations : " The cause of a just separation of the Saints from their fellow men in their worship , is not that there are hypocrites in the visible Church of Christ , nor that some fall into scandalous sins in the church , nor because the minister is flat , formal , or even saith he is a minister of Christ , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their being yoked together , or incorporated into a corrupt constitution , under the government of another supreme head than Christ , and governed by the precepts of men , put into the hands of unbelievers , which will not purge out any of the corrupt fruit , hut naturally bears it and nourishes it , and denies the power of godliness , both in the governing and gracious effects of it . " Further he says , to show why he felt constrained to write : " My conscience testified unto me that God had given me that light , that I knew as perfectly that this the Established worship is idolatry , as I do that Nebuchadnezzar 's or Jeroboarn 's was , and that it is no more of a question with mss , whether I ought td give what they demand to support it , than it is whether Israel ought to give to support Jeroboam 's Priests , which he made for his calves . And I could as freely go into the fiery furnace for not supporting it , as I could for not worshiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute 's sleep by all that they have taken from me , ( but it was the evil and destruction above said , and the cries of the oppressed that trouble me : ) not unto me but unto God be thy glory ! " While speaking of the writings of the Separate leaders , it may be well to remark that Rev. Isaac Backus , ( best known as the author of a Church History of New England , ) was originally a Separatist of Norwich , and therefore a willing advocate // of their cause , even after he himself had become a baptist . The most noticeable of his many smaller publications , is a reply to the " Nine Sermons , " published by Rev. Mr. Fish , of the North Church in Stonington , respecting the separations which had prevailed in that town . This reply seems to have borne a double title , of which this was a part- " A Fish taken in his own net . " It has never fallen under our eye , though we have met with the rejoinder by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other pamphlets were written for and against the Separatists , but in this kind of warfare their opponents had greatly the advantage . They were , indeed , somewhat ungenerously taunted with the fact , that they had few men of education among them . It had been strange , were it otherwise , in the day when pious young men like the Clevelands or David Brainerd , were cast out of Yale College for slight indiscretions of speech or action . The spirit which moved the mass of the Separatists , may be further illustrated by quoting the reasons by which some of them justified their separation , when called to answer before the churches from which they withdrew . Thus in the North Parish of New London , ( now Montville , ) one said , " God 's having left was a sufficient warrant for his leaving " - another , " that there was no more of God in the congregation than there was a black-dance " - another , " that his dissatisfaction was our selling the Gospel for ? 400 a year , and his darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have light upon his withdrawing , and so he found it , that now he had the Spirit of God , and did not want to read , " &amp;c. &amp;c . The North Church in Stonington heard such answers as these , " The Pastor 's discountenancing of public exhorting on the Sabbath at the meeting-house . " " The Pastor 's checking the public outcries of people in time of Divine Service . " " The Pastor 's admitting some persons into his pulpit , whom I look upon not experienced men . " " The Church refuse to examine the communicants over again , and to warn such as are unconverted of their danger . " " My God commanded me to go from you , and I knew it , and that is all my reason . A woman in Canterbury , who at a later period joined her friends among the original Separatists , gave the church among other reasons for her conduct , ( one of which was that Mr. Cogswell did not visit enough ! ) sixty-two &amp;ripture texts , among which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , 8 , and Acts x , 13-15 . We think this woman excels all other searches for proof-texts , whom it has been our lot to mark . A reference to the first of these texts will give the reader a hint as to the // origin of the name given to the seminary over which Mr. Allen presided at New London . But we must draw these sketches to a close , and shall be obliged to pass hastily over the later history of the Separate churches . Common necessities and distresses led them to cultivate mutual sympathy and alliance . In 1748 , three hundred and thirty men of this class , principally in the Eastern counties , petitioned the General Assembly to grant them redress of their peculiar grievances , alleging that they were deprived of that liberty of conscience , which was enjoyed by Episcopalians , Quakers , and Anabaptists . Failing in this as well as in a sumlar effort five years later , twenty Separate churches joined in a memorial to the King in Council , which was carried to England in 1756 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Norwich , and Mr. Moses Morse . But having laid it before the committee for the English Dissenting body , of which Dr. Avery was chairman , the agents were advised by them , that the representation to the king of such plain violations of charterrights would endanger the charter of the colony . They there fore returned without having presented their memorial , and Di ; Avery wrote a letter on the subject to the colonial government . Governor Law in reply , informed him of the follies and extravagances of this people , to which Avery answered that civil penalties were not the appropriate remedy for spiritual disorders . By degrees the people of Connecticut learned and put in practice this wise lesson . The times were such as led to consideration and reflection . Long wars , from 1744 to 1748 , and again from 1752 to 1763 , with the French and their Indian allies , and again from 1775 to 1783 , with the mother country in the war of the Revolution , wasted the strength and spirits of the English colonies . Nor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our forefathers , during Ihose tedious years of doubtful conflict , wonder that new churches did not flourish , and that old churches scarcely sustained themselves . Probably the latter part of the eighteenth century was the period of the deepest depression , in the religious and ecclesiastical affairs of Connecticut . The close of the Revolutionary struggle found many of the parish churches destitute of pastors , and in some of them the lack was not soon supplied . In such circumstances , the fires of that zeal which marked the Separatical movement burned low . Yet the Separate churches generally maintained their distinct organizations . In September , 1781 , they held a general meeting at Killingly , and adopted an " Historical Narrative and Declaration , " which they published to show the circumstances and grounds of their separa // tion , as well as their views of doctrine and discipline . For twenty years or more from this time forward they held such a general meeting yearly , for the most part on the third Wednesday of September . In the course of this period they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they had outlived the causes which brought them into being . The churches of the standing order ( so called ) gradually abandoned the practices which had grieved the Separatists , and to some extent adopted the very positions and courses , which their former pastors had condemned . But when they gave up the half-way covenant , and the ministerial rateswhen they examined candidates for admission as to their religious experience , and could listen to lay-exhorters and an occasional evangelist , there remained no substantial wall of partition between them and the Separatists . The result was almost inevitable . Indeed , the reunion of churches began in Canterbury , soon after the close of the Revolution , though not at first completely successful . The same thing was accomplished at different dates in several places  --  the last and one of the most successful instances being that of North Stonington , where for a number of years Rev. Joseph Ayer was the minister at once of the Old and the Separate Church , until their happy union in 1827 . Another part of the Separate Churches took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , in the time of their tribulation , they finally went over to that connection , as churches or as individuals . Such is believed to have been the case in East Lyme , and probably also in New London , Waterford , Groton , and Stonington . Some of the Separate Churches experienced a gradual wasting , and died by inches . So it was in Preston , where Elder Paul Parks ministered from 1747 to 1802 , when he died at the age of 82 , venerable not only for years but virtues . In 1797 , he preached a half-century sermon , which is preserved in manuscript . After his death the church enjoyed little pastoral care , and finally became extinct , the last record being in 1817 . Similar to this was the case of the church in Windham , ( Scotland parish , ) where Elder John Palmer officiated from 1750 till 1807 , when he died and had no successor . In 1813 , the church dissolved , the most of them joining the church in Canterbury . Some two or three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular churches , and even into Consociation . This was true of the church in Lyme , and of the church in the South part of Killingly , whose third pastor , Rev. Israel Day , ( loved and revered by all who loved his // Master , ) was admitted to Windham Association in 1799 , just as Drs . Cogswel I , Whitney , and Lee were about to form their Eastern Association , to escape from the Hopkinsianism of their younger brethren . So in 1806 , the Association at Windham County took under its care the remnant of the Separate Church in Canterbury , which however has declined until its few living members have sought other ecclesiastical connections , and its ancient place of worship exhibits the forlorn and desolate appearance described at the beginning of this article . If now after this review we should attempt to characterize the Separatical movement by a single phrase , we should call it simply ,  --  a sad mistake ! We can not judge the men who led in it to have been other than for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed themselves in their lives and their deaths . In many things they held more correct views than their extreme antagonists , but in this matter of separation they were not wise . Their error may be illustrated by reference to the more correct , though not always consistent course of Edwards and his allies among the clergy . They always dissuaded from separation , except ( as at New Haven ) in cases of extreme necessity , and then only in an orderly way . They discouraged the unwarranted intrusion of ignorant men into the ministerial office . They would reform the maladministration of discipline in the churches , and not pull down the whole fabric of their government . Just on this point they came to issue with the Separatists . President Edwards in some one of his writings had spoken of the Church as God 's House , and described the order and beauty which should characterize its arrangements . But said one of the Separate ministers to him , " How can we get into the excellent new house which you describe , unless we abandon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Edwards , in reply , admitted that the old house was ruinous and in need of repair , but maintained that its condition was not so desperate as to warrant the inhabitants in deserting it . Now the result has justified the judgment of Edwards ; for the old houses have been repaired , and promise to last for ages to come , standing as they do on Christ as a cornerstone . But the ecclesiastical structures which were reared by Separatical hands , have for the most part fallen asunder , showing that the builders in their unthrifty haste , mingled too much " wood , hay , stubble " with the more precious materials appointed for use . The communities that were swayed by the counsel of Edwards and Wheelock , and Bellamy , and Pomroy , were saved in a good measure from distracting and destructive divisions , while // the most lamentable disorders and desolations had their course in those towns where Separatism put forth its full work . Edwards and his peculiar friends were accused by the Separatists as renegades that had stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , but it is questionable whether there are any names in the religious history of New England worthy of so much honor as those of the men who forsook the formalism in which they had been brought up , without abandoning the foundations on which the Fathers of New England had planted themselves ,  --  who heard and followed the awakening voice of the Spirit without being lured into extravagance and enthusiasm , or into the remediless error of schism . For willing as we may be to palliate the wrong-doing of sincerely good men , we can not blind our eyes to the fact that even to the present day , there are families and even whole neighborhoods in the region of which we have been speaking , that have been by the operation of the Separatical movement left without any attachment to any administration of the gospel , or ( if any ) least of all to that which their forefathers loved . A particular family might be mentioned , which has from the first maintained a respectable standing in one of the towns above named , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place , out of which since the Separation , not an individual has united with that church , few have been worshipers with the church of their fathers , and few of late years have been attached firmly to any evangelical denomination whatever . Similar facts might be multiplied . We wish however to mention one of another character , for which we have the authority of Rev. Dr. MeEwen of New London . At the time of his settlement in 1806 , he found himself the only Congregational Pastor in an extent of country , forty miles by fifteen , including the present towns of Salem , East Lyme , Waterford , New London , Groton , Ledyard , Ston*ington , North Stonington , Voluntown , and Sterling . " 1 entertained no hopes , " says Dr. McEwen , " that any of these parishes would settle a pastor without extraneous aid , unless it were Stonington . That parish did settle Mr. Ira Hart about two years afterwards , and four years later , Mr. Tuttle took charge of Groton and Ledyard . Of all the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , one night at my old parsonage , talked on the subject and came to a resolve to have a County Missionary Society . After proposing our project to our District Association , and perceiving that other parts of Connecticut were looking at their Wastes , New London Association sent me with a memorial to the General Association at Farmington. // The proposition was eagerly received , and the result was the institution of the Domestic Missionary Society of Connecticut , the first in all this country . " We will not say that the wide waste , which Dr. McEwen here describes , was wholly the result of Separatical influence ; but it is remarkable that this was the very region where the fires of that excitement raged the highest . But although we characterize the movement of the Separatists as a mistake ,  --  a lamentable mistake on the part of those who led in it , we are not blind to the fact that God has overruled it for good . Lie makes no mistakes in his providential government of the world , and guards with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy results which God has brought out of the events we have been considering , ( working by men or against them , ) we reckon the more wholesome views , now prevalent , of the relation of the churches to the state ,  --  of the liberty of worship , and of instruction , and of the mutual rights and duties of instruction , and of the mutual rights and duties of pastors and people . These subjects have been practically illustrated before the eyes of men ; and , though slowly , the truth doth really advance in power and influence . We look back with wonder at some of the doubts and some of the decisions of past generations ; but we need to keep in mind their experience of good and evil , lest we fall into errors as great and evils as terrible . And withal we ought most devoutly to thank Him who bath blessed our beloved state , and the churches therein , with such a watchful guidance . Remembering not only our personal errors but our father 's faults , we should humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Thy kingdom come , thy will be done ! " // ART . IV. - TIIE EDITORIAL PROFESSION . Evening Post , Commercial Advertiser , Courier and Inquirer , Journal of Commerce , Tribune , and New York Daily Times . Autobiography of William Jerdan. 3 vols . London : Hall , Virtue &amp; Co . Buckingham 's Personal Memoirs . 2 vols . Boston : Ticknor &amp; Co. , 1852 . Buckingham 's Specimens of Newspaper Literature . 2 vols . Boston : Little &amp; Brown , 1850 . THE Literary circles of England have been not a little amused , within a few months past , by the publication of an autobiography of William Jerdan , long known from his connection with the Sun , the Literary Gazette , and other London Journals . Having passed nearly all of a long and active life in literaty pursuits , and having been intimately connected with periodicals of character and influence , he has been spending his declining days in collecting the incidents with which he has been familiar , in reviewing his editorial career , and in noting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the discouragements and warnings which he considers may be justly derived from his long and varied experience . Although his sphere was different , a similar service has been rendered to the American public , in a decidedly better spirit , by Mr. Buckingham , so widely known in this country from his management of the Boston Courier . He indeed has accomplished a double task , detailing not only the results of his own editorial life , but investigating with becoming professional zeal , and true antiquarian patience , corresponding particulars concerning his predecessors in New England , and the various periodicals which they have conducted from the time of the Boston News Letter , # the first paper established in North America , quite down to the days of contemporaneous literature . A comparison of some of the specimens of early editorials as quoted by Mr. Buckingham , with those of modern times , forms a curious comment upon the changing habits of the world . For * The first Number of the Boston News Letter was published April 24 , 1 ' 704 . Previous to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper " printed by Richard Pierce for Benjamin Harris . " One Number only is supposed to have been issued , and that was of so nondescript a character , as to be called " a Pamphlet , " by the legislative authorities , four days after its publication . // instance , in 1719 , the editor of the News Letter congratulates his readers that whereas former numbers of his paper had been thirteen months behind hand in the public news of Europe , the present number is only five months behind ! If public enterprise is greater , public morals are no better in these modern days , when the telegraph is not sufficient for the transmission of important items of news , but Sunday expresses must regularly forward from one city to another , more particular information in regard to such foreign or domestic intelligence as may become known in the course of the Sabbath day . Indeed , the modern newspaper , the result of so man modern Inventions , is a wonder of the age . Seven successive numbers , the weekly issue of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven wonders , " and we are still further inclined to think the editorial corps of almost any respectable journal , to use a newspaper phrase , would " by no means compare unfavorably " with the seven wise men of Greece ! It is somewhat curious to observe how by common consent at the present time , the Newspapers of New York City are acknowledged to have a metropolitan character . Although no one can yet hold a position corresponding to that of the London Times , the regulating clock of all the British Empire , yet collectively the daily papers of New York exert a similar influence , surpassing far that which is exerted by the papers of any other city in our land , not excepting those which are published from the very seat of government . While the hawking of other papers is for the most part confined to the neighborhoods where they are published , the dailies of New York are to be found at every railroad station , and in every petty news office , from Maine to Louisiana . In numerous cases they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own local journals , and indeed we are sometimes surprised that in various towns of New England , the increasing circulation of city papers , of course to the injury of country periodicals , is endured with so little opposition . The publication of the latter is too important for local purposes to be entirely cut off by better vehicles of general news . Yet the Papers of New York do lead the lists , and information of all kinds is so sure to reach them , and to be distributed by them to hundreds of other papers , that we are forcibly reminded of the fable of the Lion , to whose devouring den animals of all kinds were seen to flock , never again to come forth except in mangled and dismembered parts . Stimulated by these facts , by the rivalry of their contemporaries , and the successful results of past enterprise , the papers of New York , in common with those of the whole country , are // constantly taking higher and higher rank , and although they still fall short of the high standard not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain , yet they hold an honorable position , and exert a mighty power . It is not however our present purpose to discuss the newspaper , suggestive as that theme would be , so much as the Editor , and particularly the qualifications , both natural and acquired , which he needs in order to place the newspaper in the high position which it is justly entitled to hold . We are inclined to think that as soon as special preparation for editorial duties is manifest , as a common and not as an occasional thing , in those who conduct the periodical press , so soon will that profession take rank among the foremost in which a liberal education may be directed to the practical good of mankind . Let us then proceed to consider the importance of special training for the editorial profession . But three learned professions are now recognized in the world of letters . For their advantage , three separate departments have been organized in the universities , and three distinct courses of degrees have been provided , so that lawyers , ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recognized as professional men . But as the general diffusion of knowledge is making high scholarship in particular departments of science , more advantageous to the possessor , and more essential to the public , advanced professional instruction analogous to that which has long been given in medicine , law , and theology , is demanded in other studies . Teachers , chemists , engineers , agriculturists , statesmen , librarians , and editors , all need to greater or less extent some special training in addition to that which is received in a liberal , or collegiate education . As the demand for such instruction increases , in one and another of these practical professions , provision is made for its gratification , and when a more general desire exists for other advanced courses of study , the requisite facilities will unquestionably be supplied . By the operation of this principle , Normal Schools for the education of teachers are springing up in various portions of our land , which although ordinarily of too low a standard to meet the wants of college graduates , are accomplishing an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction in particular branches of science , by the establishment in our universities , of a fourth , or Philosophical Department , for the education of graduates . At Cambridge and New Haven , facilities are now offered for pursuing eclectic courses of study , in continuation of the four years ' Academic course , and yet distinct from those of theology , medicine , and law . Two schools of this department , the Chemical and Engineering , are // already in efficient operation , while the increasing number of students who engage in the study of languages , metaphysics , and history , is an indication that ere long still other special schools will be formed , with definite arrangements for instruction . Among others by whom such instruction will be demanded , may be mentioned the editorial profession , and particularly that portion of it who have charge of daily periodicals . One of the most prominent editors of New York , remarked not long ago in addressing an audience of students , that he constantly regretted the want of better preparation for the multiform duties of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern languages and the natural sciences . But his case is by no means a solitary one . There are many in the profession , exerting through the press vast influence , whose powers might have been greatly enhanced , and whose ease in their exercise would have been proportionally increased , had they been properly trained . Few examples can be found even in our largest cities , of men who have been educated for the editorial chair . In the smaller towns , many of which now boast their daily paper , the editors are often graduates only of the common school and printing office , where in the mechanical arrangement of type , they have received their only training in the art of composition . Let us not be understood to speak disparagingly of the elevation of such men . So long as Benjamin Franklin , the printer 's boy who became an Editor , a Statesman , and a Scholar , is remembered with affection throughout this land , it will be considered no disgrace to have worked one 's way through the monotonous drudgery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editorial chair . It is a matter of congratulation that with so few advantages , and beset with so many difficulties , the editors of the daily press have accomplished so much for the instruction , improvement , and entertainment of the public mind . But notwithstanding this , the important influence now exerted by the daily papers of this land demands that to a much wider extent , they should be controlled by educated men , not dry , impractical theorists and speculators , but men , who have added to their natural gifts , an education suited to their peculiar spheres . Before inquiring what peculiar talents are needed in an editor , and what education is required , let us consider for a moment the opportunities for usefulness now possessed by the conductors of our daily press . They can not of course be stated precisely in figures , but an approximation thereunto is sufficiently aceurate to be exceedingly impressive . According to the recent // census , it appears that there are now in this country three hundred and fifty daily papers , which circulate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) two hundred and thirty-five million copies annually . If now we suppose that four men on the average , are editorially connected with each one of these journals , and if we suppose that each printed copy of their paper is read by no more than three different persons , a small estimate when the number of readers at the various public Reading Rooms is borne in mind , we shall have a corps of fourteen hundred editors , having in the course of the year seven hundred and five million opportunities of affecting the minds of other men ; that is to say , each one of the editorial profession of this country has yearly more than half a million opportunities , for imparting knowledge , exhibiting principles , and addressing appeals , to the reading and intelligent , and therefore to the influential portions of the communityThis , it is to be remembered , is independent of the influence exerted by weekly and other extra editions of their various periodicals . It is moreover the average of the whole country , while , of course , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six editions of immense circulation , have still wider opportunities for influencing the public . Indeed , their power is fearfully great . Confined to the discussion of no particular topics , addressed to all classes of society , circulated in every portion of the land , and repeating day by day whatever doctrines they may choose to advocate , these papers have incalculable might . It is true that like streams of water moving in their natural channels , they may excite but little notice . They refresh the lands through which they pass ; they wear for themselves straight courses through the hardest rocks ; sand by sand they are moving mountains ; yet so noiseless is their work that it is often unheeded , until the powers which have been thus quietly employed , are directed by the laws of nature , or the will of man , to overcome some obstacle , or advance some special enterprise . Then only is their actual force displayed . We need not dwell , however , upon the influence the daily press exerts . Its effect as an element in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , but we have another end in view . Acknowledging the powers which are committed to those who control our principal newspapers , it is our object to inquire how a young man may best train himself to direct those powers most honorably to himself , and most usefully to mankind . It is not enough for him to climb to the throne of Jove , trusting that some Vulcan will furnish him with thunderbolts ; he must be able to direct the shafts , or // they will waste themselves in empty noise . But how is this skill to be acquired ? In the first place , we remark that there are natural qualifications , peculiarities of mental constitution , which especially tend to fit their possessor for the duties of an editor . These idiosyncracies , indeed , may to some extent be cultivated , but their gift by nature forms an important ground-work for after education . Foremost among them we should place versatility of interest and talent . Some men are born to be musicians , some to be artists , some to be poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of languages , or mathematics . Others show in early life the strongest inclinations and adaptations for still different pursuits . But an editor should have no single hobby . There is no branch of learning to which he need have a special inclination , or to which he should allow himself to cherish a particular aversion . But we may say more than this . He should have a positive liking for a great variety of pursuits , and should have decided abilities of very various character . He must take an interest in questions of every kind , and be competent to investigate their bearing , for nothing will fall without his province . Selkirk on his lonely island had not more undisputed right to be " monarch of all he surveyed , " than has the conductor of a daily paper to be master of most various branches of learning . He must be a full man and a ready man , heavy armed and light armed , fond of activity , yet devoted to quiet pursuits . He must turn with equal facility to a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on whatever subject he discusses . We are not forgetful as we dwell upon this point , that human nature can never be omniscient , but we are equally well aware , that versatility of interest and of talent differs greatly in different men , while those who possess the most have none too much for the multifarious demands which are made upon a first class editor . iNext to versatility , we should name alertness as an important peculiarity of mind . We mean by this , in homely English , that an editor should be wide awake . He must have the sagacity to foretell what subjects will be discussed , and what information will be required at different periods of the future . While others sleep , he must be actively making preparations . He must keep up with the times , not only in reporting news , but in furnishing comments upon passing events . Such enterprise is always noticed , and never fails of reward . The London Times is said to have on hand , filed away in the pigeon holes of its office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England . Thus , recently , the death of the Duke of Wellington was followed next morning by an original memoir of his life , which would fill more than ninety-five of our pages . Similar enterprise has been shown on one occasion , at least , which we now call to mind , in one of our American papers . Its constant exercise would not fail to be repaid . Once more , a natural energy of character will be of important service to an editor . A suggestive mind , quick to perceive what the future will demand , and skillful to plan the method of success , will have but little value unaided by an arm , which is patient to endure , and strong to accomplish . Energy and promptness are necessary in deciding what to do , as well as in executing these decisions . Competition is so great , and facilities for the accomplishment of every project are so freely open to all , that without persevering enterprise and untiring labor , but little good can be attained . But , lastly , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though hard to describe , important in every calling of life , but indispensable to an editor , which may possibly be considered as a combination of those peculiarities we have already named , but which we choose to consider as superior to them all . We refer to tact . The possession of this natural gift will influence every word and every action . If not a motive power itself , it is an admirable regulator , the balance when in a watch , of which energy is the spring , the governor in an engine which force of character propels . Talent , says the proverb , knows what to do ; tact knows how to do it . Tact enables an editor to adapt himself " to the subject , the audience , and the occasion . " It assists him , in as honorable a sense as that intended by St. Paul , " to become all things to all men . " By its aid he appeases his enemies ; he sugars his disagreeable pills , and presents invariably the bright side of a picture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say just what is wanted , at just the moment , and more than all , it makes him stop when he has done . We turn next to consider the education of an editor , for in addition to the good sense , and fair abilities which are everywhere essential to success , and moreover in addition to the diversity of talents , the alert sagacity , the persevering energy , and the invariable tact which are peculiarly serviceable in an editorial life , there are certain qualifications for the duties of this important profession , which can be strengthened , developed , and even acquired , by a regular course of education . Among these acquirements , we name , in the first place , thorough scholarship , both for the mental discipline by which // it is attended , and for the accurate information which it furnishes at command . It is a trouble in our hurrying age , and especially in our driving country , that in all the learned professions , so few are justly entitled to be ranked as scholars . Young men are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest efficiency , and when once they have put their hands to active labor , they seldom pause for study . Indeed , the value of abstract studies is often underrated as quite unnecessary in this practical age . Their influence in developing the man , in training all the powers of his intellect , is frequently overlooked , and perhaps by no one of the educated classes , so frequently as by the editorial corps . To none , however , is high scholarship more valuable . A well-balanced mind , fitted to take broad views of every subject it considers , and habits of accuracy , even in trivial matters , are indispensable safeguards to that versatility of talents and interests , which important as it is , so often tends to superficial knowledge . Not only is thoroughness needed in all the learning of an editor , but he must equip himself with ample stores of information . Addison is said to have remarked that no one should en gage as a business in editorial writing , who had not spent years in accumulating his material . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spectator , how much more so now , when all kinds of topics are examined by the editor , either as a writer himself , or as the critic of what is submitted to him , either as suggested to him by his own versatile taste , or as crowded upon his attention by the pressure of public opinion . The wisdom of Solomon even would be serviceably employed , by a man in his position . There is one use to which these stores of general information can be most usefully directed , but which is often overlooked . The range of illustration and allusion exhibited by most of our newspaper writers is of t6o narrow a range . Their discourse , instead of being adorned , enlivened and enforced with examples drawn from the wide domain of general knowledge , especially from the innumerable lessons of history , and the beautiful analogies of nature , is too dry and barren . A book will be read and studied , if its matter is valuable , however tedious its style ; but a newspaper article intended for immediate examination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all hope of its usefulness is gone . It is the flower of a day which to-morrow is cast away . But , thirdly , an editor should possess business habits before he enters on the duties of his position . As a natural versatility is favorable to the acquisition of general knowledge , so an in YOL . XL 28 // born energy of character is most valuable in the formation of business habits . Still it needs to be developed . The literary labor is but a small part of the work of a large newspaper establishment . The same elements which constitute a successlul merchant , are necessary for the full development of the editor ; for the financial affairs of one are scarcely more complex than are those of the other . They certainly require as constant attention . Again , an editor should cultivate a high tone of moral principle . Not only is he called upon to influence the minds of many different men , but he is himself at all times subject to constant temptations , to deviate from paths of rectitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence he is known to possess , subject him , if not to inward suggestions of evil , at least to extraneous solicitations from those who see his power . He has , therefore , the greatest need of strong moral principle . But we may be more minute in specifying what acquisitions an editor has need of . He must hold the pen of a ready writer . Off hand , at a moment 's notice , he must describe the passing event , detail the current talk , advocate such views as are immediately important , and criticise the words and actions of men in various spheres . A first-rate editor , at the head of a large establishment , supported though he be by the ablest assistants , must be able to fill such gaps as may occur in any department of his paper . He must not only be able to approve or reject the writings of his under-editors , he must not only be able to furnish a leader of striking character , or especial force , but he must be ready , if emergencies require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange correctly the financial and commercial tables , and even to use the scissors with adroitness and effect . All kinds of writing he will need to employ , as much as to exhibit all kinds of information , lie will need to make use of the descriptive , the explanatory , the argumentative style , and in all of them he should aim to be striking and attractive . Logic of the strongest kind , as well as the most brilliant wit and fancy , or the most cutting sarcasm , will all be brought in play . To the art of writing then , in its broadest and its highest sense , his studies should be directed . American editors , again , should be especially informed in historical and political philosophy . The nature of our government , the significance of our various independent constitutions , the expediency of particular phases of legislative policy , are in different forms continually discussed . To us as a country , everything is still new , constant changes in our foreign and domestic affairs // are suggested , and constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our laws . The expediency of these measures can only be decided by a reference to the philosophy of government , founded upon the facts which history teaches as the lessons of the past . Again , we should say that an acquaintance with natural science would be most valuable to an editor , not only in enabling him to decide upon such questions in these departments as may be suggested to him , nor merely as furnishing him with an ample range of striking illustrations , but as giving him at this day , when in our land , at least , those branches of learning are receiving more and more strict attention , most favorable opportunities of influencing the minds of reading men in scientific matters , as he now is influential in moral and political questions . The people generally need to be informed of the value of scientific research , of its direct and indirect bearing upon every useful art , of the importance of its being encouraged in every appropriate way . Farmers need to learn the value of scientific agriculture , mechanics to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds to be instructed in the relations of chemical analyses to their various operations , and merchants to be assured of the great commercial value of astronomical and meteorological research . The influential press may do a lasting service to mankind , by thus urging upon the masses of the people the advantages of abstract science , and by thus hastening to remove the barriers , already to some extent disappearing , which have always existed between the learned and unlearned . As another department of study with which an editor can afford to become familiar , we mention the Modern languages . No matter how many are included in this general phrase , but German and French at least are indispensable . The annexation of Cuba has not yet added Spanish to the list . Not only are there among us a large number of foreigners , with whose views , as expressed in the journals of their own language , published in America , it is desirable to become acquainted , but our intercourse with different countries of Europe is now so constant and extended , that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature is already widely perused , and their instructions in various branches of science are very generally followed . An editor , therefore , to fulfill aright the duties of his post , will have abundant opportunities to employ with service , whatever knowledge of the modern languages he may be able to command . Such we think are some of the natural qualifications , which // are needed in one who desires to become an influential editor of a daily periodical , and some of the points to which his education should be directed . We are aware that even with all these peculiarities and acquisitions , there is a possibility that he may not succeed . He will need to have well trained associates , on whom he can rely for frequent advice , for constant assistance , and for occasional relief , it will be enough for the responsible editor to guide the general course of his assistants ; details he must commit to their own skill and accuracy . Large capital will be necessary to support the expenses of employing such associates , and to meet other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified to direct in full a modern newspaper , without having gained a practical familiarity with the duties of his post . Here as elsewhere he must work up , to the higher position by faithful attention to the duties of lower spheres . Experience will be a most excellent teacher . Having thus sketched the various circumstances which make a first class editor , we can not forbear to enumerate some of the inducements to the choice of this profession , and to special training for its duties , in the hope that a calling already so honorable , may be yet further elevated by the acquisition to its ranks of those who are especially qualified to perform its labors . Rightly employed , it is a profession of great usefulness . The freedom with which it can speak , the attention which its opinions receive , the extent to which they are noticed , are elements of great power . There is no subject , as we have already remarked , which is foreign to the newspaper . To many minds it conveys the first impression , often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its decided and repeated advocacy of some important measure many receive their only information as to the principles and the facts which bear upon the subject . Where other preachers appeal to select audiences , upon particular occasions , the daily editor in a thousand different tones is incessantly addressing an assembly which scarcely knows a limit . Let his preaching be sound and manly , let him fearlessly advocate the RIGHT , under whatever circumstances , and his usefulness will only be estimated , when the influence of daily sunshine is computed , or the value of the air we breathe . But we need not expatiate upon this point . Whatever eloquent language has been used in regard to the general power of the press , may be applied with special force to the daily papers of the present time . They have influence and power , which rightly directed , are instruments of the highest good . // Fame is another reward which follows , in our country , the successful editor . Whether it be or not an evil , the conductors of the press in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are identified with their periodicals , and are used almost synonymously with them , and whatever character either one is supposed to have , is immediately attributed to the other . Their notoriety is coincident . Like a man and his shadow they are always united . If we are not mistaken , the editorial profession are , in ordinary cases , by no means without their pecuniary rewards . The nature of their position is far more allied to that of commercial men , anJ is of course more open to the risk of profit and of loss , than are ordinary literary professions . But little prospect of pecuniary returns , has the ordinary critic , professor* scholar , and preacher . Still an editorial life is not without its drawbacks . There is no cessation to its duties . Day and *iight , summer and winter , news or no news , the paper must go forth . Moreover according to existing circumstances , each periodical must almost , as a matter of course , become identified with party claims , and often ,  --  who can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sacrificed to the incessant demands of political supporters . Often , aside from such claims , is an editor called upon to advocate , or at least is prevented from opposing , such projects as his own judgment would condemn . To meet the wants of all readers , and to make his paper a receptacle of news , in the widest sense of the word , he often feels bound to publish such particulars of crime and of depravity as offend the majority of his readers , and produce upon the public mind , an injurious familiarity with the particulars of vice . Even let an editor do his best , and pursue the most upright and independent course , he will have to be more or less associated with men with whom he can not sympathize , and more than that , he can hardly hope to escape from making many enemies among both bad and good . But we must bring these remarks to a close . The subject is one however which is worthy of far more extended consideration among young men who are choosing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate the importance of more papers , but we hope to see from time to time , more men especially trained for their positions in charge of such papers as already exist . We have seen many princes ; who shall first become king ? Who will first stand out a giant among editors as Jeffrey towered up among reviewers ? We hope , ere long , to see the editorial profession considered in fact , if not in name , // as one of the learned professions , for which appropriate education is provided , as is already done for other departments of labor . We are aware , while it would be invidious to particularize , that there are men already in the field admirably qualified for the editorial duties in which they are engaged . We desire to see their number increased , so that there shall be a corps of scholars , not only in charge of daily newspapers , but directing the various weekly literary and religious papers , each of whom shall be fitted by his natural talents *nd his special education for the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere to write with accuracy and justice for the papers of today , what will soon be consulted as the history of the past . An editor 's office in our day is like the ear of the Dyonisian palace , which caught the slightest whisperings from most distant places , and brought them to one spot ; it needs to be supplied with the eyes of an Argus , to investigate the sources from which these rumors come , and the hands of a Briareus to make use of the facts , which it finds to be really true .
