txt ART . IV . - Life and Times of Alexander Hamilton . By SAMUEL M. SMUCKER , A. M. Boston and Chicago : L. P. Crown &amp; Co. 1857 . THE absence of dramatic material in our history has often been remarked . Eloquent writers have had recourse chiefly to its moral aspects to render their narratives spirited and attractive ; and when Napoleon sneered at the limited and homely means whereby our independence was gained , Lafayette defended the claims of the land in whose behalf his youth was devoted , by reference to the greatness of the cause which had thus triumphed and the prospective and incalculable national growth which had thence resulted . The intensely practical character of the struggle , its prudential and unpicturesque method , the utilitarian habits of the people , the poverty of the * F. A.

By his will he left to the American Philosophical Society the sum of fourteen thousand dollars , and to the Society of Agriculture and Arts in Boston eight thousand , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the propagation of useful forest-trees. " // government , the absence of pomp , of discipline , of historical associations , of time-hallowed precedents , of opportunities for display , taste , organization , and insignia , - in short , of the outwardly poetic and impressive , - left no scope for romance in the military and civic transactions which gave birth to the republic . When we compare the record of those memorable events with that which transmits the great crises of any other nation , ancient or modern , - for instance , with any brilliant episode in Grecian annals , even as coldly described by Grote , or Roman , as illuminated by Niebuhr , - with the struggle for liberty in the Low Countries , the conquest of Mexico , or the wars of Ferdinand of Spain , as pictured by Prescott , - or with the French Revolution as dramatized by Carlyle , - it becomes evident that reflection more than observation , the latent virtues and subsequent fruits rather than the immediate process , lend dignity and significance to the initial chapters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration among us most successfully in the eras antecedent to the Revolution . The details of border life and of primitive settlements adapt themselves more readily to the imagination than even the heroism and the victory that laid the foundation of our existing prosperity . Cooper ranges with most freshness and freedom on the trail of the Indian and the pioneer ; Hawthorne expatiates with the greatest subtlety and power in the sphere of colonial snpe*stition ; and Longfellow finds in the cruel exodus of the early French 6migr6s from Nova Scotia a theme on which a picturesque fancy can best luxuriate . Doubtless a prevalent motive which lures imaginative and artistic writers from the more recent and historically important to the distant and traditional , is that instinct which demands perspective , and seeks it in the mellow tints of antiquity . While those yet live who can speak from memory of remarkable events and characters , they are too near to assume just proportions , or to wear to the vision of Art the peculiar interest they are destined ultimately to possess . In regard to individuals especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust of faction must be laid , the false shadow of prejudice dissipated , and the // winds of passion stilled , ere the heroes and statesmen , the patriots and philosophers , whose valor , wisdom , forbearance , and loyalty won and transmitted constitutional freedom , can be appreciated . Time alone annihilates the paltry jealousies , the partisan injustice , the gross misconstruction , which dim the traits of eminent characters . Their deeds and thoughts , if original and disinterested , gradually work themselves clear , become identified with the progress of society , appear as lttndmarks along the path of civilization , and beneficently assert , as well as permanently maintain , the individuality of their authors . And thus , as party after party becomes merged or modified by our political exigencies , as the history of civil liberty , with its spasmodic upheavings , its casual triumphs , lapses , and struggles , is written in events , analyzed by science , or celebrated in song , the men whose names are for ever associated with the grandest , and thus far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inevitably reappear as oracles , witnesses , and champions , and are more and more invested with the light of fame , as the needs and the recognition of humanity expand and become definite with time . And when the light and shade , the distance and foreground , the chiaro-'scuro and the aerial perspective , become harmonized , we . know not a character connected thus with our revolutionary , constitutional , and political history that will afford larger scope for dramatic interest and treatment than Alexander Hamilton . Let us withdraw ourselves , in imagination , from the picture now so near us , and endeavor to call up its features as they will one day appear to the contemplative artist . In his island birthplace between the tropics , giving the first indication of future greatness by his eloquent description of a hurricane , - uttering the promptings of a vague but ardent desire for illnstrious action in the confidence of youthful friendship , - visiting the United States for the education which his recognized talents peremptorily demanded , - in his novitiate , by his argumentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from professors , - in early youth kindling patriotic aspirations in the hearts of a popular assembly , and confuting the reasonings of veteran // pamphieteers by anonymous responses , - the volunteer captain * and self-taught engineer , the confidential aid and secretary of Washington , the favorite companion of the French officers , the confidant of the unfortunate Andr6 , the gallant young soldier at White Plains f and Monmouth , Brandywine and Yorktown ,  --  the restorer of a nation 's credit , - one of the chief architects of an original and prosperous form of government , - the expositor of new and great political principles to the popular mind , - the irresistible advocate , the urbane and elegant man of society , the idol of domestic retirement , - soldier , jurist , philosopher , statesman , gentleman ,  --  in all characters eminent , - the intrepid leader of a phalanx , and the persuasive guide to conviction , - his life crowded with vast interests , and environed by memorable characters and events , to be , at last , suddenly cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaped , and not a faculty or a feeling impaired , what scenes , associations , attractions , and influences does such a career involve and suggest ! Two peculiar charms belong to the life of Hamilton as compared with his contemporary soldiers and statesmen , - his youth and his gifts of expression . The variety of his services , his exalted patriotism , and his untarnished honor endeared his genius to the higher order of minds ; while his errors , however they may diminish his glory to the eye of the moralist and the Christian , add yet another effective element to his nature as a subject for delineation . His were errors of passion , not of calculation , and prove him weak , not inhuman . This weakness contrasted with the moral consistency of Washington , this yielding to the wiles of love and the sophistry of a false code of * " As General Greene , one day , on his way to Washington 's head-quarters , was passing through a field , - then on the outskirts of the city , now in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e Park , ' - he paused to notice a Provincial company of artillery , and was struck with its able performances , and with the tact and talent of its commander .

" - Irving 's Life of Washington , Vol . II . p. 250. t " I noticed , " says a veteran , " a youth , a mere stripling , small , slender , almost delicate in frame , marching beside a piece of artillery , with a cocked hat pulled down over his eyes , apparently lost in thought , with his hand restin , , on the cannon and every now and then patting it as he mused , as if it were a favorite horse or a pet plaything .

Circumstances here blend with character , tears with triumph , admiration with sorrow , to produce the highest tragedy of human existence . Those who delight to trace the hand of a wise and benign Providence in the succession and relation of historical events , who recognize in Franklin 's first mission to England and appeal to Pitt the first divinely forged link in the chain of events by which our independence was acquired and our nationality established , will behold also in the opportune advent and continuous agency of Alexander Hamilton the same high and propitious guidance , his pen having been as obviously a providential instrument as the sword of his august leader . And thus regarded , the " little VV " est Indian clerk , " faithful in his vocation , but chafing in its ignoble sphere , and longing for a war as the means of giving scope to his aspirations , is a form not less prophetic in its degree of the vast national problem to be solved for the good of humanity on this continent , than that of the Virginia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide armies and sustain a people 's cause . The most superficial observer of human character , if at all given to analysis , soon finds himself impressed with the reciprocal influence of blood and of circumstances , - the former accounting for special instincts , the latter giving occasion for their development . The chief inherited traits of Hamilton were Scotch and French ,  --  on the one hand , acute intelligence and invincible pertinacity , on the other , vivacity and urbanity . These traits were again modified by the peculiar type of his ancestry . The Gallic blood in his veins was Huguenot , the Scotch noble ; and herein were involved both penerous and intrepid elements above the level of merely national characteristics . A more desirable combination can scarcely be imagined ; for , if any historical inference may be drawn in regard to individual endowments , from such a stock we should expect both the insight and the chivalry , the mental enterprise and the social glow , which , united , form the most efficient men in field and cabinet , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the power of expression , ardor and reflection , the love of glory and the love of kindred , intellect and enthusiasm , loyalty and independence , are to be traced in their noblest manifestations through branches of the races whence sprang Hamilton 's immediate progenitors . Next in the order of time , if not in that of influence , in moulding character , we must rank the place of nativity and the surroundings of childhood . As a speculative question it would be curious to estimate how different might have been the result had Hamilton 's childhood been passed in the North American Colonies , instead of the British West Indies ; and it is not unreasonable to conjecture that somewhat of his warmth of temperament , refinement of manners , and sensibility to the beautiful , may have been caught from intimacy with nature and life , in the fair island familiar to him from infancy . The alternate wet and dry seasons of that American archipelago , the radiant summer , the gorgeous flowers and birds , the magnificent nights , the deluge of autumnal rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inviting to exercise and observation in the open air , the luscious fruits and grand umbrageous trees , so graphically classed by Humboldt and so attractively described by St. Pierre , could not have appealed in vain to the dawning intelligence and vivid emotions of Hamilton . Nevis , where he was born , is little else than a mountain of evidently volcanic origin , with a broad basilar circumference of twenty-three miles . Its staple product is sugar , and it contains one fortified town . Thence the boy was sent , while very young , to school at St. Croix , and , after a brief period of elementary instruction , entered as a clerk in the countinghouse of Nicholas Cruger . Inadequate as this primary education may seem , its deficiencies were in no small degree atoned for by the keen mental appetites and the indefatigable energy of the young West Indian . His cravings were judiciously gratified by a kind Presbyterian clergyman , Mr. Knox , whose paternal interest in his culture Hamilton never forgot , as appears from his subsequent correspondence . This also proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mind , with X*OL . LxXXvI. - NO. 179. 32 // intuitive foresight , anticipated a more brilliant destiny , and prepared for it . " I would willingly risk my life , " he then wrote , " to exalt my station . " Yet , with the practical good sense and honorable faith that ever distinguished him , he would not suffer these promptings of a noble ambition to lure him from the path of actual duty . So capable and faithful was the clerk that , in times of his superior 's absence , all the affairs of the house were intrnsted to his supervision ; and his letters are full , precise , and suggestive , in regard to the mercantile interests at stake . Meantime , however , his reading was assiduous and thorough . Such works as he could command in science , history , and belles-lettres occupied his leisure hours , disciplined his powers of reasoning , excited his speculative tendency , and enlarged that capacity of verbal expression which he instinctively cultivated . It is a pleasant coincidence , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youth destined to find the widest imaginable scope for his gifts , and endeared to a nation by their efficient and patriotic exercise , should also have occupied the pen of another man of genius , whose memory is cherished for what he was , rather than for what he accomplished , - whose life-long problem it was to find an adequate sphere and satisfactory use for powers not less remarkable , but far less effective , than Hamilton 's . In the morning of life , health , and intelligent activity , the boy Hamilton described a West Indian tornado so graphically , that the picture insured him an education and an arena . In the waning days of an invalid prime , the man Sterling wrote his impressions of a like event , and left them to be gathered up by the hand of friendship , with other fragmentary products of an erratic mental activity , as a memorial of baffled aspirations . " A West India tornado , " says Carlyle , " as John Sterling witnesses it , and with vivid authenticity describes it , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the month of August , - one in 1772 , the other in 1831 . " I found , " writes Sterling , " in pushing at the leaf of the shutter , that the wind resisted more as if it had been a stone-wall or a mass of iron than a mere current of air . A man was blown down the hill in // front of the house ; the rain on my hands and face felt like so much small shot from a gun ; the panes of glass were smashed by the mere force of the gale ; before long the roof went . " He then goes on to speak of the ravaged fields , the lofty surf , the uprooted trees , and the imminent personal danger . The American newspapers of the autumn succeeding the first tornado contain numerous extracts from letters dated at the Leeward Islands , which give details of the catastrophe . It is difficult to identify that of Hamilton , but there is one which mingles reflection with fact , and has a rhetorical flow that , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , " says the writer , " though ever so happily circumstanced , can promise itself duration of felicity . We may flatter ourselves , indeed , but vain is that flattery if the hand of Providence interferes to blast our hopes Words are too faint to paint the horrors of that day . The hurricane began about nine o'clock in the morning , and continued , with unremitted fury , almost north , until eleven , in which time about forty houses were levelled with the ground , and the helpless inhabitants beyond expression wretched . Horror and dismay seized on all ranks and conditions , and destruction seemed suspended by a thread over the heads of all . " * A minute statement of incidents and an estimate of losses follow . Whether this letter was that which drew attention to the youth , and his claims to higher intellectual advantages than an insular mercantile life yields , is comparatively unimportant ; the circumstance itself is , however , full of significance . It shows how instinctively Hamilton seized the refinements of language , and how early and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his remarkable career , and embodied the final results of his mature thought and practical influence ; and the merchant 's clerk of St. Croix , who knew how to describe justly a convulsion of nature in an obscure island gazette , as the Publius , the Pacificus , and the Phocion of New York journals , appeased the storms of partisan malevolence , reconciled the discordant elements of political controversy , and calmed by the // eloquence of truth and wisdom the tumult of contending interests . The academic education of Hamilton began upon his arrival in New York , where the most desirable introductions at once brought him in contact with the learned and the distinguished . He commenced his studies in preparation for college under a teacher vhose school , at Elizabethtown , N. J. , was an object of peculiar interest to Elias Boudinot and Governor Livingston . Its master 's name afterwards was enrolled with honor among the military patriots of the Revolution . Under the auspices of Francis Barber his progress was rapid , chiefly owing to habits of constant application . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton College . Having now realized his own capacity for acquisition , he endeavored to persuade Dr. Witherspoon , the President , to admit him , on condition that his advancement in rank should keep pace with his proficiency ; as if , aware of the exigencies about to occur , he was anxious to be equipped as soon as practicable for the duties of actual life . But this course was unprecedented ; and although in the demand itself the President beheld the indication of a superior and energetic mind , he reluctantly declined the proposal , and Hamilton entered King 's , now Columbia College , in the city of New York . Around the memory of no alumnus of that comparatively ancient seat of learning lingers a greater traditional fame . The vivid sympathies , intense diligence , and aspiring genius of the young West Indian gained him love and distinction . in the debating club he was the most effective speaker ; in the recitation-room , the most thorough scholar ; on the green , the most charming friend ; in the trial of wit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , partially cultivated , led him to contemplate the profession of medicine , and , during the regular college course , he paid considerable attention to anatomy . Now also he experienced the most fervent religious emotions , examined the evidences of Christianity , and gave utterance to devotional feeling in prayers and hymns whose eloquence was long traditional . There was nothing morbid *r fanatical in this phase of his college career ; but , as with all natures rich alike in sensibility and in // intclligence , as life and consciousness awakened , and their problems demanded solution , he meekly and ardently , and from a spiritual necessity , sought communion with Eternal Truth ; and amid the excitements , the ambition , the daring speculations , the brave and absorbing enterprise , the glory and the errors of after years , the convictions thus borne in upon his youthful heart were never effaced . But the spirit of the times had already penetrated the retirement of study , and , at the appeal of outraged human and civil rights , the heart of the earnest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature but most congenial activity . The violent controversy incident to the Boston Port Bill agitated the whole fabric of society , awakened new inquiries into the foundations of colonial authority , excited the deepest concern among the reflecting , and aroused the wildest opposition in those whose sense of justice and prescient sagacity could anticipate from our political wrong the possible future consequences . The seeds of American liberty were planted in these early furrows of social dissension . On the one side were the clergy of the Episcopal Church and their adherents , absolutely devoted , with few exceptions , to the British government , and content to obey its most tyrannical behests ; on the other , the independent thinkers , the worthy lovers of the soil , and the aspirants for a free and progressive national life . Among the latter were both veterans and youths , and , as in all reforms , the college sympathized with the forum ; so that when , at the voluntary gathering of citizens , a student mounted the rostrum , no observer of human nature could be surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringent reasoning , and the captivating style of that collegiate orator , excited not only surprise , but admiration . Thus , while a mere boy , on a summer evening , under the open sky , did hamilton set forth the justice of * constitutional freedom as a right of humanity ; opposed by no less an antagonist than the President of the College of which he was a member , and by the banded conservatives of the whole metropolis . Having thus thrown down the gauntlet , he instantly entered upon the contest , with pen and voice , in a manner so able , so winning , and so courageous , as to 32* // rally around the cause hundreds of his fellow-citizens , place in an absurd light the best concocted arguments of Toryism , refute the subtleties of experienced casuists , and kindle the patriotic enthusiasm destined to achieve a country 's freedom . The pledge thus given at the age of seventeen was redeemed by life-long devotion , first to the establishment and then to the elucidation of the principles so emphatically avowed and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms alone remained , the orator prepared to gird on his armor . He joined a militia corps , and studied tactics , while still a collegian ; and from the commencement to the final scene of the Revolutionary war , we find him incessantly and variously active , - one of the youngest , yet one of the most important figures of the central group . There is scarcely a stratagem or an embassy , a council or a proclamation , a plan or an achievement , in which , directly or indirectly , his agency is not apparent . In the sad but masterly retreat from Long Island , he brings off the rear in safety ; at White Plains , his battery wins the favorable regard of Washington ; he shares that consummate leader 's disasters and triumphs in the Jerseys , goes for reinforcements to Gates , conveys the first intelligence of Arnold 's treason , * soothes the last hours of Andr6 , narrowly escapes the bullets of the enemy on the banks of the Schuylkill , commands an artillery corps , confers with Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forge , defends him against the slanders of rivals , leads the victorious charge at Yorktown , t negotiates the exchange of prisoners when hostilities cease . And while thus enacting the part of a gallant soldier in the camp , he anticipates his future and more renowned * " He met Washington , as he and his companions were coming up from the river , spoke to him a few words in a low voice , and they retired together into the house , when these documents of deep-laid treachery were put before him . - Irving 's Life of Washington , Vol . IV . p. a3. t " Hamilton to his great joy led the advance of the Americans ; and was the first to mount the parapet , placing one foot on the shoulder of a soldier , who knelt on one knee for the purpose . The loss of the enemy was eight killed and seventeen taken prisoners . Among the latter was Major Campbell , who had commanded the redoubt . A New Hampshire captain of artillery would have taken his life in revenge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton prevented him . Not a man was killed after he ceased to resist . " - Ibid. , p. 376. // triumphs as a statesman , by indicating in a letter to Robert Morris his financial scheme , whereby the credit of the nation was finally upheld and its imminent necessities provided for ; and in a letter to James Duane , during the same year , he foreshadows the grand principles of constitutional government , which now form the pillars of the republic , in a project for reorganizing the State and central authority , through the medium of a popular convention . It is difficult even for the student of our annals , though an adept in the knowledge of human nature , theldiosyncrasies of race , and the philosophy of history , to conceive the actual exigencies to be met , the resources to be provided , and the obstacles to be surmounted by wise and conscientious patriots when the British forces were recalled , the war of the Revolution ended , and peace formally declared . There remained an unpaid army , inadequate civil authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices , vast conflicting interests , a wayward and self-sufficient popular will , an exhausted treasury , palsied industry , and , to balance these elements of anarchy , only , to use the moderate language of Washington , " the opportunity of becoming a respectable nation . " That a war of opinion should follow the war of independence was a natural result ; and the correspondence of the most enlightened and the most self-devoted of the men who had gained this splendid vantage ground , shows how early distrust of the forbearance and the harmony of freemen succeeded to the elation of victory . The weakness of the Confederation had been revealed , the jealousy of States exhibited , the fanaticism of political animosity made apparent ; " chaos had come again . " The fruit of eight years of sacrifice , toil , patience , and valor had at length ripened , almost by a miracle ; but whether it was to be garnered to nourish a great national life for ages , or to perish through neglect and violence , was the momentous question , not only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , to arbitrate this destiny , a convention assembled ; its history is one of the brightest pages in the chronicle of nations ; its spirit breathed a magnanimity and a wisdom unparalleled in assemblies of men ; its results are visible to-day // in the spectacle of an intensely active , an unprecedentedly prosperous , and a constantly developing self-governed people . In the last analysis , this is owing to individual character , to the force of example , *o the influence of mind , nobleness , good faith , and moral energy ; and no one contributed more to these redeeming and creative forces than Alexander Hamilton . He was one of those best prepared for the crisis . Political philosophy had been his favorite subject of thought , reading , and experience . The artist about to realize a conception over which his imagination had brooded until it had attained shape and expression , to the minutest details , in his consciousness , never seized clay or crayon to design the model with a more distinct confidence , than that with which Hamilton elaborated in conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theory of constitutional government . For every provision he had a cogent reason , for each plausible objection a logical reply . How and why the nice balance of authority emanating from popular will should be adjusted ; by what means the machinery of state could work efficiently , yet ever be controlled by the deliberate views of the majority ; in what manner the legislative , the judicial , and the executive power should sustain one another without mutual interference ; through what resources of counsel and of official right the lives , property , and freedom of the citizens should be at once protected and fostered , - were all clearly solved problems to his conviction . And what he believed and knew , he had the ability to prove and illustrate . His comprehensive eye took in the wide horizon of national life . His prolific memory commanded the facts of the past , ancient and modern , European and American . His insight was keen , his foresight prophetic . Ardent in his desire for the recognition of his ideas , he was calm and persuasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy , he trusted to practical rather than rhetorical arguments . What he sketched in outline at the age of twentythree , he filled up , rounded , and made vitally complete during the four months of earnest discussion which resulted in the adoption , by the delegates , of the Federal Constitution ; and what he so effectually helped to construct in council , he // subsequently confirmed to the popular mind in a series of essays which has since become a classic manual in political science . " Sole lords and proprietors , " wrote Washington at this juncture , " of a vast tract of country , comprehending all the various soils and climates of the world , and abounding with all the necessaries and conveniences of life ; and acknowledged possessors of absolute freedom and independency , - this is the time of their political probation ; this is the moment when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them ; this is the time to establish or ruin the national character for ever . " In addition to the intrinsic perplexities of the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for N moulding public sentiment . Patriotism itself was confounded with local perversity ; communities were scattered ; the means of communication were slow and difficult ; a proposition or vote could not be telegraphed ; steamboats and railways were unknown ; the press was comparatively isolated ; the genius of intercourse - since one of the mightiest agents of union and conformity - was yet in embryo ; education was a rare and not a universal blessing ; - and from these physical and moral causes , the views , even of the upright and intrepid , were often narrow , unenlightened , and illiberal . The fusion of opinion , the homogeneous enterprise which the journal , the steam caravan and telegraph , in our day , render so practicable , was then to be essayed only by tardy correspondence , rare conferences , sparsely circulated gazettes , and prolonged oral discussion . Well might Washington write to Lafayette , in view of all those tendencies to diversity of opinion and feeling : " It appears to me little short of a miracle , that the delegates from so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , in their manners , circumstances , and prejudices , should unite in forming a system of national government so little liable to well-founded objections . " And no individual contributed more to this miracle than Hamilton , as his acknowledged prominence in the conception and his logical zeal in the advocacy of the Constitution , and his written testimony , both prior and subsequent to its being submitted to the decision of the people , emphatically prove . // That he appreciated the emergency , and with no rash impulse thus confidently exercised his genius for political action , may be inferred from the earnest appeal which followed the adjournment of the Convention - " It may be , " he writes , " in me a defect of political fortitude , but I acknowledge that I can not feel an equal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer continuance in our present situation as imaginary . A nation without a government is an awful spectacle . The establishment of a Constitution in a time of profound peace , by the voluntary consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I look forward with trembling anxiety . " As a delegate to Congress , and a member of the State Assembly and Convention , Hamilton was assiduous and successful in his efforts to avert the impending evils which threatened the nascent republic , his labors in debate and on committees alternating with the more general advocacy of vital measures through the press . Two of his eminent services are conspicuous in the record of that transition era of our civil history , - his adjustment of the serious difficulties consequent upon the independent position of Vermont , and the gradual preparation of the community for federal institutions . When these were established and organized , the next great national want was money and credit . Political economy was not then a recognized science ; few had studied Adam Smith , and the " Wealth of Nations " had scarcely been analyzed . A distrust of government securities , incident to the depreciation of the currency and the apparent evasion by Congress of the most sacred obligations ; the confusion into which a long war had thrown the resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , especially , the prevalent inexperience and contracted ideas on these and kindred subjects , were inauspicious to the public appreciation or the official adoption of any extensive and original system of finance . The sword had been sheathed , but the purse was empty ; while that other grand resource of nations as well as men , the pen , - as an instrument of thought , a divining-rod or electric telegraph of the brain , indicating and disseminating the creative principles of financial development , - was free and inspired in the hand of Hamilton , who , by his corre // spondence with RoL ert Morris , his economical studies , and his insight into the latent means and the urgent wants of the country , stood forth again the specially endowed and accredited champion of America . Thus he appeared , once more , to the sagacious eye of his chief , now President of the United States ; and , reluctant as he was again to plunge into a sea of troubles and to assume new and vast responsibilities , the consciousness that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land for which he had fought and pleaded , and towards whose incipient course the gaze of Europe and the hopes of ages now turned with alternate triumph and solicitude , - led him to enter upon the bold experiment , and , with a clear perception of the momentous task involved in the office , to become first Secretary of the Treasury . What he thus accomplished is best shown by the immediate and subsequent national prosperity . The means and processes are revealed in his consummate official reports and his political essays . MTebster 's description of this achievement has passed into household words - " How he fulfilled the ' duties of such a place , at such a time , the whole country perceived with delight , and the whole world saw with admiration . He smote i*e rock of the national resources , and abundant streams of revenue gushed forth . He touched the dead corpse of the public credit , and it sprang upon its feet . The fabled birth of Minerva , from the brain of Jove , was hardly mere sudden or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it burst forth from the conceptions of Alexander Hamilton . " * " To ripen inquiry into action , it remains for us to justify the Revolution by its fruits . " Such , in his own words , was the wise and patriotic object of Hamilton ; and his views as to the method of so doing coincided with those of Washington , who , in a letter to Jay , writes - " Experience has taught us , that men will not adopt and carry into execution measures the best calculated for their own good , without the intervention of coercive power . I do not conceive that we can exist long as a nation , without lodging somewhere a power which will pervade the whole Union in as energetic a manner as the authority of the State governments extends over the several States . " // It was , however , with no extravagant partiality that Hamilton regarded the Constitution . If he argued cogently for its redeeming principles , he no less acutely discerned its probable errors . " If the Constitution did not succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegate , " Mr. Hamilton was less responsible for that result than any other member , for he fully and frankly pointed out to the Convention what he apprehended were the infirmities to which it was liable " ; and he added , tWat , " if it answered the fond expectations of the public , the community would be more indebted to Mr. Hamilton than to any other member ; for after its essential outlines were agreed to , he labored most indefatigably to heal those infirmities , and to guard against the evils to which they might expose it . " How easy is it , from our vantage-ground , to recognize the sincerity and patriotism of all the higher minds whence proceeded our system of government ! Who does not now concede the equally conscientious motives of the leaders of the . two great original parties ? It was inevitable that a man of practical sense and observation , like Hamilton , should feel the moral necessity of stringent executive powers . He had experienced for eight years almost insuperable obstacles in prosecuting a war of self-defence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting of responsibility between State assemblies and tL ' * Continental Congress . He had witnessed the vainly reiterated appeals for troops , provisions , money , clothing , ammunition , counsel , encouragement , - all the physical and moral sinews of war , - from the commander-in-chief to the govcrnors , and thence to their legislatures , - the vain pleadings , the irresolute tone , the vague pledges , the almost fatal delays , the imminent and sometimes actual rebellions , - all consequent upon inadequate and ill-defined authority . To confirm the stern lessons of experience , he had the evidence of the prosperous workings of the British Constitution , which , with all its defects , had preserved greater personal liberty and induced with inferior material advantages a richer national development than any other form of government in existence . He had studied and learned to appreciate this charter of law and liberty ; and had therefore arrived , in common with // 385 Washington , at the conviction that influence is not government , and that the popular delegation of official power , restrained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the exigencies of the country and the duties of administration , was the only safeguard and guaranty for future order and progress . " The centrifugal is much stronger than the centripetal force in these States . " On the other hand , how natural was it for a man like Jefferson-who had not personally suffered from the imbecility of the Confederation , and who had witnessed abroad the demoralization incident to kingly and ecclesiastical sway , and the awful reactionary consequences - to be morbidly jealous of centralized political rule , and to advocate a limitless faith in the instincts and capacity of the masses ! The mental character of these two leaders was as diverse as their experience . Jefferson was a man of detail ; he noted facts , but they were special and material ; he corrected Buffon in regard to points in natural history , sympathized with the alert and scientific French mind , and was a disciple of its self-confident but irreverent philosophy . Hamilton 's intellect delighted in generalities ; he sought for the law , rather than for the minutire of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a naturalist , and was more aspiring than shrewd . When to these diversities were added the repellent motives of party animosities , it is not remarkable that even Washington 's magnanimous intervention failed to secure more than an outward reconciliation between these men . Yet , when we read the mutual recriminations of that day , recall the personalities then rife , and compare them with the verdict of time and posterity , we perceive the fallacy of sectarian reasoning . Where is the " awful squinting towards monarchy " ascribed to the Federal leaders , and the eagerness to " uproot the foundations of order , and let loose the havoc of French infidelity , " charged upon the Democratic oracle ? Forgotten , even as gossip , in the memory of the practical truth and auspicious influence which survive in the institutions of the country . The very names of her opposite factions are lost in a succession of inferior and accidental questions , - Free-trade , Masonry , Romanism , Temperance , // Slavery , having formed the nucleus around which the positive and negative elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to disperse once more on new issues . If the elements of our embryo life as a nation were thus discordant and complex , even to the perception of those actually engaged in their organization , it is scarcely to be wondered at that they have been , and are still , so little understood by distant spectators , accustomed to such widely different political associations . On the continent of Europe , the idea still prevails that Washington was a successful gen&amp;al and a gifted protector , instead of a pure and devoted representative of the highest existing public spirit ; and the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution is lost sight of in favor of popular leaders of subsequent political parties . Thus a leading French journal says - " Washington a conquis l'independance nationale et fond6 le gouvernernent de l'Union Americaine ; Jefferson a 6tablis au soin de cc gouvernement le culte des libertds locales . Washington a vainen 1'An-* gleterre et tird les Etats ilnis de l'iinpnissance et de l'anarchie ; Jefferson a etouffd dans son pays toute germe de centralization et de monarchie. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ideas of which Hamilton was the skilful expositor , has been amply confirmed by experience . The greatest cause of patriotic anxiety we have known since his death has been the lack , rather than the abuse , of executive and administrative power . It has been demonstrated that unusual decision of character is indispensable to insure efficiency in the head of the national government . Want of vigor , and not personal ambition , has chiefly jeopardized our national interests . Sacrifices to party , and not usurpations of prerogative , have been the alarming errors of those vested with leadership . Incompetency , peculation , and compromise of authority have proved the most dangerous of political sins . Again and again have exigencies arisen in which executive power has been stretched to the utmost limits of the most liberal interpretation of the // Constitution ; existing circumstances have justified the assumption to the people 's ultimate judgment ; and it is remarkable that some of the most famous of these instances of what is called " takino ' the responsibility " have occurred on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jefferson himself acquired Louisiana ; Jackson conquered Nullification in South Carolina , and removed the deposits from the national bank , while Polk annexed Te . as . Municipal and State disturbances threatening aiiarchy , gross official neglect and dishonesty , foreign interference , and numerous other evils , have demanded , in the judgment of the most democratic , the very power to act with promptitude and energy which the Federal leaders so earnestly claimed for those vested with authority . There was something offensive to the popular self-confidence in thIs reliance on law , and something that ministered to complacency in the apparent deference to the will of the majority by the opposite party , which tended to exclude Hamilton from the sympathy of the masses ; but the greatest patriot of this or any other country , and the best judicial mind of that day , perhaps of the last century , Washington and Marshall , held strenuously , and from pure conviction , the same opinions . Washington called the passing epoch " an era of probation " ; and they all felt the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton has been accused of despising the popular judgment , and of disoxvning reliance on patriotism as a motive ; but let it be remembered that no man strove more wisely and patiently to educate the common mind in the rights , duties , and dangers of citizenship ; and that his constitutional theory derived all civil power from the people , modified it by the most judicious gradations , and made its temporary possessors responsible to the country and the laxv. " ileal liberty , " he declared ,  --  and with what truth let history attest , - " is neither found in despotism nor in the extremes of democracy , but in moderate governments . " Equally prophetic was his conviction , and equally unjust the treatment he received , in regard to the French alliance . " Though I felt , " he writes , " in common with those who had participated // in the Revolution , a lively sentiment of good-will towards a power whose co-operation , however it was , and ought to have been , dictated by its own interest , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liberal and handsome manner ; yet , tenacious of the real independence of our country , and dreading the preponderance of foreign injluence as the national disease of a popular government , I was struck with disgust at the appearance , in the very cradle of our republic , of a party actuated by an undue complaisance to a foreign power , and I resolved , at once , to resist this bias in our affairs : a resolution which has been the chief cause of the persecution I have endured in the subsequent stages of my political life . " Persecution * is a mild term to designate the opprobrium and vindictiveness he incurred as a political and public man . His first-born son fell in a duel in his father 's defence . If there be a meanness in party warfare thoroughly infamous , it is the use of personalities as if they were licit weapons ; and if there be a cruelty in civilized society essentially parallel with savage disregard of all humane instincts , it is the deliberate endeavor to identify the uncompromising antagonism of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor conventional between the parties , obliges a man to risk his own or take another 's life . Hamilton was the victim of both these malicious arts . An amorous intrigue was made the basis of a charge of peculation , and a general course of frank and determined opposition was wrenched into the significance of a personal insult , iii order to destroy the antagonist with whom it proved useless to compete . In both instances advantage was taken of the delicate sense of honor , acknowledged to be at once Hamilton 's noble and his vulnerable point . From the camp , the representative assembly , and the cabinet , Hamilton retired first to the study and subsequently to the practice of law . Talleyrand , upon being asked what chiefly struck him in America , replied : " The most remarkable sight I beheld was Alexander Hamilton going to the courthouse , in New York , with his law-papers and books in his hand . A man who had rendered such public service to be thus drudging with the herd for subsistence was to me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // tomed to the gifts of royalty and destined to reap an imperial harvest , at the moment when he was impoverished and in exile because of the misfortunes of his regal patron , should be moved on beholding the leading spirit of a new and prosperous government obliged to toil for bread . But Talleyrand , although he might thus conceive an unfavorable notion of republican gratitude , failed , at the same time , to appreciate the difference between devotion to a king and to a people , - between patriotism and diplomacy ; nor did he know how sweet are the well-earned trophies of professional skill and industry , - what gratification to an honorable ambition awaits the respected and successful advocate . Through this congenial career Hamilton was rapidly advancing in a new sphere of renown , usefulness , and fortune , - his labors with his briefs and clients alternating , as he humorously writes to Lafayette , with " rocking the cradle , " - when both the eloquent tongue and the conjugal and parental heart were abruptly stilled on earth for ever . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the perspective of time to afford the most efficient dramatic material ; and the last occurrences of his life , moulded into artistic sequence and heightened by incidental circumstances , afford a tragic d6nouement worthy the hand of a master . The long political rivalry between him and his enemy ; the singular coincidence in some points of their intellectual , and the intense antagonism in their moral natures ; their prominence as the respective leaders of two great parties in the state , and as competitors in the same profession ; the personal attractiveness of both in society ; the strong passions enlisted in the war of opinion and the race of ambition in which they were opponents ; the brilliant antecedents of one , and the equivocal reputation of the other ; the universal interest felt and manifested throughout the country in the men and the causes they represented ; - what contrasts and associations are these to weave around the fatal rencontre , and to subserve for the elaboration and vivid display of character ! Both possessed military talents , were gentlemen in manners , and cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid mastery of legal 33* // knowledge , the bar was to them what the arena of old was to gladiator and charioteer , - a scene where skill , power , and grace were tested before entranced spectators ; and public life yielded another and more extensive theatre whereon they and their coadjutors strenuously contended for the mastery . It was the same in society ; polished address , knowledge of character , the ability to please , and the desire of convincing one sex and charming the other , were characteristic of both . With these general resemblances there were the most extreme diversities . Hamilton 's political genius was constructive and conservative ; Burr 's schemes were those of conspiracy and invasion . Hamilton " disdained duplicity " ; his candor was a normal attribute ; by direct , open , earnest appeal , either to reason or feeling , he sought to accomplish his ends ; while Burr 's chief mental quality was acuteness ; he w as , by nature , subtle ; intrigue was his habit ; as a lawyer he trusted to shrewdness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was flowing ; of the other , keen and pointed . The one was plausible , the other persuasive ; the one cunning , the other comprehensive ; the one secretive , the other ingenuous ; the one insinuating , the other eloquent ; the one selfish , and the other generous . Similar contrasts marked their social character . Hamilton won the admiration of men and the favor of women by a frank ardor and graceful intellectuality ; Burr , by adroitness and a kind of arbitrary fascination . The former attracted , the latter cast a glamour . Hamilton yielded to passion , Burr cultivated it . Hamilton was impulsive , Burr calculating . The one trusted to valor , the other to stratagem . Their experience corresponded with their natures . Washington , who instinctively confided in Hamilton at the first meeting , looked with immediate distrust on Burr . The former lives in history as one of the chief framers of a great political system and one of the most self-devoted of patriots ; the name of the latter is for ever identified with treason in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his prime , amid the tears and laudations of a whole people ; the other lived an outcast , - indigent , reckless , despised . The memory of the one is consecrated , that of the other anathematized . The circumstances attending the duel are too familiar for // repetition . The documentary evidence is complete . A general inquisition as to the remarks of a public man in regard to a political antagonist , was wrested into an accusation of specific insult ; the reply of Hamilton , " I stand ready to avow or disavow promptly and explicitly any precise or definite opinion of mine which I may be charged with having declared against any gentleman , " was made the basis of a demand for a positive denial of any and every observation personally derogatory , - a demand utterly impossible to comply with , and wholly unjustifiable to proffer ; and the refusal was the subterfuge whereby a claim for redress by single combat was enforced on one of well-known scrupulousness on points of honor , to betray him into fatal collision with an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how vindictively the deadly purpose was followed up , and how magnanimously it was encountered , are not speculative inferences , but facts testified by the hands of the principals , and confirmed by the evidence of the seconds . " General Hamilton is just dead , " said one to Burr . " Ah ! " was the reply , " did he suffer much pain ? " " Yes . " " I regret it ; it was my purpose to have spared him needless pain. ** " This is a mortal wound , doctor , " said Hamilton , as he lay in the boat while crossing the river ; " my sight is indistinct . My poor wife and children ! Let the event be gradually broken to her . Pendleton knows that I did not intend to fire at him .. " These expressions , winged by a thousand voices over the land , - the one a remorseless and cool acceptance of the deed of blood , the other the last faltering utterance of a noble and generous heart , - stamped this so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination ; * and the apology of Hamilton for thus disposing of an invaluable and honored life , while it is vain in an ethical and religious , was deeply affecting in a patriotic view - " The ability to be in future useful , whether in resisting mischief or effecting good , in those crises of our public affairs which seem likely to happen , would probably be inseparable from a conformity with public prejudice in this particular . " * " He Burr gave me an account of his duel with Hamilton ; he was sure of being able to kill him ; so I thought it little better than a murder . " - Bentham 's Works , Vol . X. p. 443. // The relation of Hamilton to Washington was one of the most interesting , honorable , and delicate which can be irnagmcd ; so much so , indeed , that only those endowed equally with a chivalric spirit and a genuine moral sensibility can adequately comprehend it . The difference of age , talents , and disposition , the natural reserve and self-respect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindred nobleness and self-devotion in the same great cause , and the implicit mutual confidence implied in the peculiar associations of life and labor that so long existed between them , - all tend to give often a high moral charm , and always a delicate significance , to their intimacy . The promptitude with which Washington recognized young Hamilton 's ability and worth is remarkable . His perception of character was , indeed , a rare and valuable instinct , almost infallible , and events continually proved the correctness of his original impressions and judgment . His confidence in the man who thus won his esteem at the first interview , never wavered . He divined , at once , the sphere wherein he could most advantageously work ; and , on the earliest occasion , enlisted his eminent literary and colloquial talents . His counsel became equally precious as its rational and sagacious inspiration commended it more and more to the appreciative mind of the commander-in-chief ; and friendship soon hallowed the bond which duty and experience thus wove . As the ardent Max impressed the heart of Wallenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolutionary drama appear to Washington . " He stood before him like his youth . " Occasionally there break through the formal demeanor and the grave responsibleness of the man , the times , and the office , expressions indicative of this peculiar sympathy . Hamilton is one of the few to whom Washington is known to have used the language of an unrestrained and even playful familiarity ; and in his letters to him is observable a strain of confidential communication rare in his official correspondence . Affection no less tempered respect in the bearing of the young aide-de-camp towards his chief . When the latter , for a moment , lost his self-command in the mortifying crisis at Monmouth , Hamilton impetuously rode through the m*Me to his side , and exclaimed , " I will stay // with you , my dearest General , and die with you ; let us all die rather than retreat . " * When the perverse Gates was to be propitiated to obedience , the French admiral to be received , the traitor Arnold to be pursued , any office requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage to be filled , Hamilton was the man whom Washington preferred . His deliberate opinion was often expressed in unequivocal terms . Thus in a letter to General Sullivan he writes - " I can venture to advance , from a tkorough knowledge of kim , that there are few men to be found of his age , who have a more general knowledge than he possesses ; and none whose soul is more firmly engaged in the cause , or who exceeds him in probity or in sterling virtue . " In a letter from Mount Vernon to John Adams , while he admits that Hamilton is ambitious , he defines the trait as " an ambition of that laudable kind which prompts a man to excel in whatever he takes in hand " ; and he adds , " He is enterprising , quick in his perceptions , and his judgment is intuitively great . " These few well-considered phrases of Washington , if pondered in their full meaning , will be found to confirm all that Hamilton 's more glowing eulogists have claimed as tke essential qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his actions invariably sanctioned ; and accordingly , when , for the last time , in anticipation of a war with Fj*ance , he was appQinted to lead the armies of his country , he made it a condition of acceptance that Hamilton should hold the second rank , as his coadjutor and successor . Washington th ought , said Morris , in his oration at Hamilton 's funeraJ , " The sword of America might safely be confided to the hand that now lies cold in that coffin . " In his last public act , the " Farewell Address , " he summoned his former aide-de-camp and secretary for assistance and sympathy ; the first who wore the insignia of the Cincinnati , as president , after Washington , was Hamilton , and the tears of the latter , when his illustrious friend was no more , washed out all memories but those of love and reverence . Their names are indissolubly blended in history , and in a nation 's honor and gratitude. // In view of these facts , so honorable and affecting , the narrowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beautiful relation , are offensive and reprehensible . Who , with a spark of natural honor , an emotion of noble sympathy , can find any satisfaction in analyzing the written memorials of these celebrated men , in order to discover which conceived or wrote this or that argument , project , or appeal ? Hamilton excelled in language , he held the pen of a ready writer , and that pen was ever devoted to the service of his country and his chief ; but , of all men , he would have been the last to claim merit , and the first to protest against a division of the public labor , so confidential and mutual , which he was too proud and happy to share with the man in whom centred a nation 's confidence . What signifies it whether this phrase in the Farewell Address , or that reasoning in the administrative correspondence of Washington , emanated from Hamilton ? It is enough to know that the former acknowledged a sentiment , ratified a proposition , or placed his signature to a document . The object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both too magnanimous , to admit the petty cavillings of mere vanity , and , while absorbed in a people 's welfare , to weigh in the microscopic balance of insatiate self.love the grains and scruples of their respective originality in thought or utterance . Yet again and again this process has been applied to the Farewell Address , and others of Washington 's ostensible writings . There is no inextricable complicity in this instance , such as might render the views and style of two illustrious men difficult to separate . Washington was educated as a country gentleman , Hamilton as a scholar and advocate . The one valned language as the simplest and most direct medium of thought , - he never studied its possible graces , and was far more a man of action , of affairs , of practical duties , than of words ; while the other had a rare gift of speech , had cultivated the arts of composition , and knew the power of rhetoric . Thus considered , as a literary question , there is no resemblance between the styles of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror or medium of character , the diversity is still more emphatic . Hamilton always writes like a scholar ; // Washington , like a man of the highest common sense . Not that the two are not perfectly compatible , and often coincident ; but the form of expression is naturally and unconsciously modified according as either predominates in the writer . Washington , to speak phrenologically , was deficient in language ; Hamilton had the organ large . In Washington writing was irksome ; he complained , after his retirement , of the weary task imposed on him by a multifarious correspondence , and preferred a ride over his estate , or a consultation about internal improvements , to being confined to a desk Vith heaps of letters . Whoever has compared the early Tith the later epistles of Washington , especially in the original drafts , must have remarked how gradually the copiousness , and even the orthography , improves with practice . He often hesitates for a word , substitutes one for another , and the manuscript suggests to an experienced eye a writer who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling than terms to utter it conscientiously . With time and greater exercise of the pen , the flow of expression becomes more and more free . It is and ever was singularly appropriate . In his style of writing , as in his dress , manners , and entire conduct , his moral qualities are distinctly revealed. * Thus there is no extravagant word . His adjectives modify rather than intensify his statements . Perspicuity is obviously the chief aim ; and so straightforward , exact , and authentic are his letters , whether as evidences of his opinions , descriptions of his life , arguments on public questions , or expressions of private sentiment , that his last biographer , renowned as he is for aptness and grace of diction , frankly acknowledges that he can find no language to portray the career or the character of his hero so satisfactory as that indited by his own candid and unadorned pen . Such is the individuality of Washington 's epistolary style . " There was a straightforward simplicity in Washington 's addresses to his army ; they were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ givdn in them were so sound and practicable ; the feelings expressed in them so kind and benevolent , and so perfectly in accordance with his character and conduct , that they always had an irresistible effect on the rudest and roubbest hearts . " - Irving 's Life of Washington , Vol IV . p. 437. // The more elaborate and finished composition of his faithful secretary and friend , Washington most thoroughly appreciated and wisely used . Indeed , it was owing to his conviction that Hamilton could best serve the cause with his pen and counsel , that the only breach between them occurred . It seems plain from Hamilton 's correspondence , before and after the temporary coldness , that he was heartily weary of what appeared to him a secondary part in the great drama then in action . He announced to his father-in-law , General Schuyler , his intention of availing himself of any misunderstanding to withdraw from the confidential relation of private secretary involved in that of aide-de-camp to Washington , and thus to secure the opportunity of a separate military command . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , in keeping the General waiting , occurred , instead of explaining that he had been detained by Lafayette , which would have settled the question instantly in his favor , Hamilton made no excuse , accepted the charge as ground for retirement , and declined the speedy overtures of Washington with the view of his resuming his place . It was because of his great efficiency in that situation , and of the difficulty , if not impossibility , of supplying the vacancy , that Washington desired to keep Hamilton at his side . Throughout the war and the administration of the government , Washington was remarkable for looking to the public good , rather than to the desire of personal distinction , as motives for his appointments . He seldom failed to put the right man in the right place . Brave and able soldiers were more easily found than eloquent and facile writers , or men of acute political sagacity and learned in the philosophy of government , among the American patriots . It was natural for one so young and heroic as Hamilton to thirst for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , and to chafe at his most useful , but comparatively obscure labors . The lapse of intimacy , however , did not in the least diminish the confidence or the sympathy of these illustrious men . That we have not misjudged Hamilton 's feelings on this occasion is clear from his letters . He writes to Morris , " My military situation has become so negative , that I have no motive to continue in it " ; and to Schuyler he says - // " I always disliked the office of an aide-de-camp , as having in it a kind of personal dependence . I refused to serve in this capacity with two Major-generals , at an early period of the war . Infected , however , with the enthusiasm of the times , an idea of the General 's character overcame my scruples , and induced me to accept his invitation to enter into his family It has been often with great difficulty that I have prevailed upon myself not to renounce it ; but while , from motives of public utility , I was doing violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should ever happen a breach between us , never to consent to an accommodation . " Subsequently he does justice to Washington 's candor in the inevitable delays in appointing him to a command , and exhibits the greatest solicitude to vindicate his own motives , to the purity of which Washington bears cordial testimony. * His gallantry at Yorktown must have soothed his military pride , and subsequently his pen became enlisted in still more confidential services for his revered commander . To a discriminating reader , Washington 's own letters vindicate his highest renown , by affording the clearest revelations of character . The tone of each measures exactly his degree of confidence in the person he addresses . The sentences are not rounded with art , but they are emphatic with truth . Wisdom , sincerity , modesty , conscientiousness , selfrespect , patriotism , affection , and fidelity , - the resplendent virtues of the man , - are unconsciously but vitally incorporated in his writings , which , if not exemplars of the refinements of literary style , are unrivalled in the literature of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you willimpute my refusal of your request to other motives than those I have mentioned . " - Washington to Hamilton . " I assure your Excellency that I am too well persuaded of your ' candor to attribute your refusal to any other cause than an apprehension of inconveniences that may attend the appointment . " This desire for military distinction was , indeed , a strong and prevalent feeling with Hamilton . Fisher Ames remarked that it was the only ambition of a common kind which belonged to him . He writes thus to Washington in 1783 : " I explained to you candidly my feelings with respect to military reputation ; and how much it was my object to act a conspicuous part in some enterprise that might , perhaps , raise my character as a soldier above mediocrity . " And " I build a hope that I may be permitted to preserve my rank , on the peace establishment , without emolument and unattached to any corps , as an honorary reward for the time I have devoted to the public . I may hereafter travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the character which I have supported in the Revolution . " // faith and public duty . An anecdote illustrates Washington 's considerate use of language , even when under excitement . He did not , even in the heat of indignation , call Lee a coward for ordering a retreat at Monmouth ; but , arresting his flight , he asked , " What means this ill-timed prudence ? " And what can excel the profound sarcasm , under a courteous guise , such as the occasion demanded , of the expressions in a letter to Gates in reference to the underhand insinuations of Conway ? " It is , however , greatly to be lamented that this adept in military science did not employ his abilities during the progress of the campaign in pointing out those wise measures which were calculated to give us that degree of success we could reasonably expect . The United States have lost much from that unseasonable diffidence which prevented him from embracing the numerous opportunities he had of displaying those rich treasures of counsel and experience he has since so freely laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice to impute the penurious reserve which ever appeared in him on such occasions , to any other cause than excess of modesty . " * The method whereby Washington availed himself of what he considered powers of expression superior to his own , in public communications , is not left to conjecture . Among the Madison manuscripts is a letter in which our peerless chief gives the substance and the ideas , the sentiment and the argument , of the Farewell Address , and requests Madison 's advice and assistance in its preparation . We quote it entire , as the best illustration at once of his earnest reflective powers , his emphatic style , and his characteristic modesty , agreeing heartily with the editors of the journal which first published it ( from the original in the possession of Madison 's nephew ) in their remark , that " The letter aids us in the formation of one important and interesting conclusion , that although Hamilton , as is generally supposed , may have drafted the Farewell Address , and given to it its clear , elegant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy ever made to a free people by its ruler , upon withdrawing from the cares of state , had been previously expressed by Washington himself , as they were conceived in his own noble and sagacious mind . " // 399 1858 . " Mount Vernon , May 20 , 1792 . " My DEAR SIR - As there is a possibility , if not a probability , that I shall not see you on your return home , or , if I should see you , that it may be on the road , and under circumstances which will prevent my speaking to you on the subject we last conversed upon , I take the liberty of committing to paper the following thoughts and requests . " I have not been unmindful of the sentiments expressed by you in the conversation just alluded to ; on the contrary , I have again and again revolved them with a thoughtful anxiety , but without being able to dispose my mind to longer continuation in the office I have now the honor to hold . I therefore still look forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend the remainder of my days ( which I do not expect to be many ) in ease and tranquillity . " Nothing short of conviction that my dereliction of the cbair of government ( if it should be the desire of the people to keep me in it ) would involve the country in serious disputes respecting the chief inagistrate , and the disagreeable consequences that migbt result therefrom in the floating and divided opinions which seem to prevail at present ; could in any wise induce me to relinquish the determination I have formed ; and of this I do not see how any evidence can be obtained previous to the election . My vanity , I am sure , is not of that cast as to allow me to view the subject in this light . " Under these impressions , then , permit me to reiterate the request I made to you at our last meeting , namely , to think of the proper time and the best mode of announcing the intention , and that you will prepare the latter . In revolving this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , a previous declaration to return not only carries with it the appearance of vanity and self-importance , but it may be construed into a manomvre to be invited to remain . And , on the other hand , to say nothing implies consent , or , at any rate , would leave the matter in doubt ; and to decline afterwards might be deemed as bad , and uncandid . " I would fain carry my request to you farther than is asked above , although I am sensible that your compliance with it must add to your trouble ; but as the recess may afford you leisure , and I flatter myself you have dispositions to oblige me , I will , without apology , desire ( if the measure in itself should strike you as proper , and likely to produce public good , or private honor ) that you would turn your thoughts to a valedictory address from me to the public , expressing in plain and modest terms , that , having been honored with the Presidential chair , and to the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , - that having arrived at a period of life when the private walks of it , in the shade of retirement , become necessary and will be most pleasing to me , - and the spirit of the government may render a rotation in the elective officers of it more congenial with their ideas of liberty and safety , that I may take my leave of them as a public man ; and in bidding them adieu , ( retaining *no other concern than such as will arise from fervent wishes for the prosperity of my country , ) I take the liberty at my departure from civil , as I formerly did at my military exit , to invoke a continuation of the blessings of Providence upon it , and upon all those who are the supporters of its interests , and the promoters of harmony , order , and good government . " That to impress these things it might , among other things , be observed , that we are all the children of the same country , - a country great and rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous and happy as any which the annals of history have ever brought to our view . That our interest , however diversified in local and smaller matters , is the same in all the great and essential concerns of the nation . That the extent of our country , the diversity of our climate and soil , and the various productions of the States consequent on both , are such as to make one part not only convenient , but perhaps indispensably necessary , to the other part , - and may render the whole ( at no distant period ) one of the most independent in the world . That the established government being the work of our own hands , with the seeds of amendment engrafted in the Constitution , may by wisdom , good dispositions , and mutual alliances , aided by experience , bring it as near to perfection as any human institution ever approximated ; and therefore the only strife among us ought to be , who should be foremost in facilitating and finally accomplishing such great and desirable objects , by giving every possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be to keep a watchful eye over our public servants , and public measures , yet there ought to be limits to it ; for suspicions unfounded , and jealousies too lively , are irritating to honest feelings , and oftentimes are productive of more evil than good . " To enumerate the various subjects which might be introduced in such an address would require thought ; and to mention them to you would be unnecessary , as your own judgment will comprehend all that will be proper . Whether to touch , specifically , any of the exceptional parts of the Constitution may be doubted . All I shall add therefore at present is , to beg the favor of you to consider , first , the propriety of such an address ; secondly , if approved , the several matters which ought to be contained in it ; and , thirdly , the time it should appear ; that is , // whether at the declaration of my intention to withdraw from the service of the public , which will end with the next session of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting until March , ) when the House of Representatives will also dissolve . " Though I do not wish to hurry you ( the cases not pressing ) in the execution of either of the publications before mentioned , yet I should be glad to hear from you generally on both ; and to receive them in time , if you should not come to Philadelphia until the session commences , in the form they are finally to take . I beg leave to draw your attention also to such things as you shall conceive fit subjects for communication on that occasion , and , noting them as they occur , that you would be so good as to furnish me with them in time to be prepared and engrafted with others for the opening of the session . " With very sincere and affectionate regard , " I am ever yours , " G. WASHINGTON . " JAMES MADISON , JR. , EsQ . " In one respect Hamilton has been fortunate beyond all his illustrious comrades . His published writings are an adequate monument , not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-eminent services . Their clear , vigorous , and often elegant style , rescues them from the oblivion to which the mass of official documents and political arguments are destined . Whoever carefully examines the correspondence , essays , and reports of Alexander Hamilton , will discover not only an intrepid and powerful intellect , a solid and compre* hensive judgment , a positive genius for administration , and a profound insight into the principles of constitutional government and of national finance ; but , at the same time , he will trace the career of a noble , wise , and patriotic character . Its features xviii become distinct to his recognition . Respect for the thinker will be equalled only by grateful admiration for the patriot . The chief of these remarkable writings , because the most complete , is the series of essays afterwards collected under the title of " The Federalist , " the greatest favorite in general literature among all political disquisitions , if we except the letters of Junius . In these papers , the dangers which threaten the republic from foreign interference and internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-preservation , and of 34* // advancing commerce , naval power , and public economy , the defects of existing legislation , the systems of militia and of taxation , the relation of the States to the general government , and other subjects of immediate yet permanent concern , are treated with a clearness and strength of reasoning , a knowledge of history , a foresight , and a perspicuity , which rendered them intelligible to all and eminently suggestive to the few ; the different branches of the proposed government are described , and their relative and mutual action defined ; and the work , appearing as it did , in the form of newspaper articles , did more than any other expedient to prepare the different States to ratify the Constitution . Although the joint production of Hamilton , Jay , and Madison , the greater part and the most significant of these essays were written by Hamilton , under the signature of Publius . Another series of articles from the same pen , signed " Pacificus , " similar in style and in argumentative perspicacity , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of xvritings purely official , the Report on Public Credit is enough to establish the fame of Hamilton as a statesman and financier . He begins by an earnest recognition of integrity as a moral requisite in communities not less than in the individual ; enlarges on the sacred nature of the national debt ,  --  " it was the price of liberty " ; and then advocates its liquidation , that the American name may be respected , the calls of justice met , and the friends of good government satisfied . He shows how a restoration of public credit will restore landed property to its due value , furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce , cement more closely the union of the States , add to their security against foreign attack , and establish public order " on the basis of an upright and liberal policy . " Then follow his plan for a national bank , and his views of manufactures , duties , loans , a mint , etc. , - the programme which elicited Talleyrand 's admiration and Webster 's emphatic tribute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of the motives , opinions , and temper of the memorable era when the whole intellect and heart of America were absorbed in the vital questions involved in the political future of the nation , can // scarcely exceed in justice and intelligence the prophetic view sketched by Hamilton while in the midst of the conflict . " We have already , " he writes in The Federalist , " sufficient indications of what will happen in this as in former cases of great national discussion . A torrent of angry and indignant passions will be let loose . To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties , we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justice of their opinions , and to increase the number of their converts , by the loudness of their declamations and by the bitterness of their invectives . An enlightened zeal for the efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of power and hostile to the principles of liberty . An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the heart , will be represented as mere pretence and artifice , - the stale bait for popularity at the expense of public good . It will be forgotten , on the one hand , that jealousy is the usual concomitant of violent love , and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is too apt to be inflated with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust . On the other hand , it will he equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty ; that , in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment , their interests can never be separated ; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people , than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government . " When a New York printer waited upon Hamilton to obtain his consent and co-operation for the issue of a new edition of the work of which this extract is part of the Introduction , the author demurred , and expressed his belief that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not called for by the public . Convinced , by the assurance of a demand for the book , that it ought to be reprinted , he made some corrections , and said , in handing the copy to the printer , " Mr. hopkins , we have given the people heretofore milk ; we will now give them strong meat , " - an expression which indicates his confidence in the ultimate triumph of his ideas , and in the progressive intelligence of the public mind to be secured by political discussion and the habit of self-government . His defence of himself against the vile charges of official dishonesty , shamelessly made and utterly refuted , is a model of manly self-exculpation . His official correspondence , while // aide-de-camp and secretary to Washington and one of his cabinet , forms a valuable compendium of practical and political wisdom . To arouse a sense of the danger from France , he wrote several articles under the pseudonyme of " Titus Manlius . " It has been stated by a careful investigator , that " of ' the celebrated Camillus papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribed to Hamilton , all , excepting the ten first , were from the pen of Rufus King . " * But in the shape of anonymous pamphlets , his first medium of communication with the public , of occasional articles in the journals , of outlines of Reports , and even o* actual speeches and arguments furnished to his friends , the fecundity of his pen was astonishing . It was within the vivid remembrance of a lady but recently deceased , and connected by marriage with Hamilton , that one morning he detained the family from the breakfasttable while he was busy at his desk . To his repeated and urgent request that they would take their places without him , one of the guests replied , " We will do as you wish , on condition you read us what you are writing . " A few minutes after , he read the announcement of Washington 's death made to Congress that very day in Philadelphia by General Lee , and usually attributed to him , and which has become proverbial from the phrase , " First in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts of his countrymen . " His pen was , indeed , in constant requisition , and was most generously exercised throughout the war and the subsequent administration , in behalf of individuals , assemblies , and principles identified with the nation 's welfare . These writings , extending over his entire life , are singularly consistent in the nobleness of their general aim , efficient in their argumentative force , and luminous through their impressive style . They were adapted to the moment ; but from their breadth and logic , as well as their finish , they have a permanent value . His private letters are a chart of his life and a delightful reflection of his character . The few of a commercial nature , dated at St. Croix , are business-like , terse , and statistical . His correspondence with Washington , Jay , Lafayette , Steuben , // Robert and Gouverneur Morris , De Ternay , Colonel Laurens , Duane , and other fellow-laborers in war and government , is of singular historical interest , and distinguished for good sense , perspicuity , candor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the successive campaigns , of the characters of those engaged in the struggle , of the salient incidents of the war , of camp life , its difficulties and dangers , and of the courage , patience , mutual confidence , and elevated motives then and there at work . As illustrations of his character , the letters he xvrites and those he receives are equally instructive . Thus his old friend , the St. Croix clergyman , in acknowledging one of his letters , after the commencement of hostilities , says : " I always told my friends , that , if you survived the campaign and had an hour of leisure to write to me , I expected a more true , circumstantial , and satisfactory account of matters in your letter , than by all the public and private intelligence we have received here . " With the French officers he corresponded in their own language , and their letters overflow with the gallant spirit of their national amity . " The pen of Junius is in your hand , " writes Colonel Laurens . " Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my friendships , I wish it were in my power to convince you that I love you . " The tendency in Hamilton 's mind towards philosophy , history , and politics , is clearly manifest in the earliest taste he exhibited in reading . While he was a clerk at St. Croix , among his favorite authors were Plutarch and Pope ; and among the incidental notes in his pay-book , when he was a young captain of artillery , are allusions to Rousseau 's Emile , Robertson 's Charles V. , Baretti 's Travels , Hobbes , the Essays of Montaigne and Bacon , and the Orations of Demosthenes and Cicero , - works rarely the intimate solace of a young soldier of that era , and in our comparatively unlettered camp . Hamilton could , at will , concentrate his mind ; and usually labored for several consecutive hours with intensity . His conceptions were quick , and he rarely corrected what he had once deliberately put in writing . Like most men of genuine power , he cast off mental toil with great apparent ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was absorbed in busy hours . // In specific qualities , the character of Hamilton resembles that of several prominent men who have acted illustrious parts in war , jurisprudence , society , literature , and government . In the maturity of his political insight at an early age , and in his blended courage and candor in the discussion of opinions and measures , he reminds us of Francis Homer ; in the graceful and energetic flow of his rhetoric and reasoning , and in the facility with which he acquired and digested knowledge , he often brings vividly to our thought the splendid elaborations of Burke ; and in his captivating address , chivalrous spirit , genial sympathies , as well as in his impassioned temperament , we are not less struck with an occasional likeness to Fox . As a financier , his patriotism finds a reflection in Lafitte . The rapidity of his military training and the enthusiasm of his soldiership evince the heroic zeal which ins red K*5mner . Those familiar with the recent history of Sardinia will find a spirit kindred to his in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too fondly the administrative genius of Pitt not sometimes to catch its intrepid and bold spirit . The thinker , in his mental constitution , predorninated over the scholar ; he could reason better than he could construe , and valued facts in their relations , rather than as isolated elements of knowledge . Causality was a prevailing faculty in his brain . His estimate of that abstruse work , Edwards on the Will , illustrates this . " Nothing ever came from the human mind , " he writes , " more in proof that man is a reasoning animal . It is an unrelaxed , logical statement throughout , a consecutive series of arguments , the only digressions from the main proposition being qualifications of the sense , expressed in the same brief rigid style . " Foresight and comprehensiveness were intimately blended in his intellect , and these qualities primarily adapted him to the analysis of questions involving great prospective interests . But his reflective power was , to a remarkable degree , made efficient by natural felicity and readiness of language . For clear , emphatic statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished , and when the occasion justified , from this solid vantage- round he could expatiate with the most persuasive eloquence ; while at the same time pre // cisibn , vigor , and point were never sacrificed to orato ica*display . He had both the courage and the forbearance of the true hero . The first to mount the rampart of the enemy at Yorktown , he was equally prompt to check the onslaught when its object was gained . In accordance with his character , lofty as were the tributes paid to his memory by contemporary love and sorrow , they are remarkable for their discrimination . They prove that he was no shadowy idol of the hour , but a substantial and distinct individuality , clearly discerned through the magnetic influences with which intellectual power , winning yet dignified manners , and brilliant public services , surrounded him ; clearly discerned , also , through the glow of political fraternity and the fever of political hatred , and , what is more remarkable , through the pitiful and indignant tears called forth all over the land by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Gouverneur Morris , to the weeping crowd at his funeral , " contending against you and saving your dearest interests in spite of yourselves . " " No man , " declared Fisher Ames , " more promptly discerned truth , no man more clearly displayed it " ; and he claims for him the great test of books and men , - " the extent and durableness of their impression . " Pulpit eloquence was exhausted in condemnation of the method , and in praise of the patriotic antecedents of his death . The senate and the forum recalled in him the glory of Aristides and of Germanicus . The popular heart trembled at the blow , with a sense of bereavement unsurpassed except when Washington expired . " Party distinctions , " it was truly declared , " were confounded at the event , " and Hamilton was compared to Hercules , " treacherously slain in the midst of his unfinished labors . " His " regard for justice , " in the grateful retrospect of a career of national usefulness now finished , was * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading New York journal opposed to him . A short time before the duel , it contained the following bitter paragraph : " General Hamilton , having defended his position as Secretary of the Treasury , had better now give us a history of his amorous adventures . " Yet the same journal announced his death as a national loss , and apologized for postponing a tribute to his memory , on account of the bewilderment and oppression of great personal sorrow . // pronounced " solemn , " and his " public life " declared to be " without a stain . " " While patriotism glowed in his heart , " said one , " wisdom blended in his speech her authority with her charms ; he ever extorted confidence , even when he most provoked opposition . " His ambition was defined as a thirst " for that fame which virtue would not blush to confer , nor time to convey to the end of his course . " * And distant as w 11 as long subsequent verdicts confirm the estimate of his contemporaries . " Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who best knew the vital principles and fundamental conditions of government . " He was brave to a fault ; great crises made him self-possessed ; and yet his nervous susceptibility , almost invariably the accompaniment of rare intellectual gifts and keen passions , rendered him both painfully and pleasurably alive to casual impressions . Thus he would feel timid on a ferryboat ; while he exhibited a manly cheerfulness under an attack of yellow-fever , and betrayed no agitation when mortally wounded . Love and ambition were passions he well knew , from organization and consciousness ; they existed in him , as in so many other instances , united to the readiest perceptions and the widest mental scope and activity . Returning from a tryst in the early days of his courtship , he forgot the countersign , and could not pass the sentinel to enter his quarters . His was not the self-centred order of greatness , - his very disposition and ability to persuade and to please presuppose a certain degree of approbativeness but this was tempered by taste , judgment , and great natural kindliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his brave attack , whether with pen , tongue , or sword , were restrained by genuilie magnanimity . Some , vivid glimpses of Hamilton , as he appeared at different periods of his career , have been transmitted by the limner , the allusions of graphic writers , and the reminiscences of surviving friends . We are told of his attractive mien and courteous manners , when , as Washington 's aide-de-camp , he assisted in the hospitalities of the camp ; of the intentness of // determined purpose contrasting with the exuberance of youthful spirits as he marched with his corps ; and of the dignity and polished ease which characterized him in maturity as a host , a companion , a political associate , and a professional advocate . His shortness of stature was compensated by an erect person . The hair drawn back , according to the fashion of the times , exposed his large and prominent brow . A sanguine temperament was revealed in the freshness of his complexion , which , by the delicacy of its tint , also suggested a refined organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated . In the discussion of important subjects , there was a dignified earnestness in his mien ; but this readily softened into the most playful manner when conversation was merely social . Deliberate in argument , he was lively in the freedom of amicable and domestic intercourse ; his voice was rich and flexible in its tones ; his frame was well-knit , and his movements were graceful . It may be doubted if the civic life of any people , outside of the pale of barbarism , ever boasted so few landmarks and trophies as ours . In moral results and general effects , not in local or artistic memorials , must be sought the evidence of what is illustrious in our annals . The least informed and most unenthusiastic traveller in Europe is not only reminded of , but impressed with , the agency of genius and patriotism , by the durable monument , the prominent effigy , or the active institution , wherein yet lives the public benefactor , the great poet , or the self-sacrificing patriot . The conservative spirit of national gratitude and pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and visibly associates Michel Angelo with Florence , Montaigne with Bourdeaux , Goethe with Weimar , and Wellington with London ; and it requires little philosophy or imagination to infer , from the respective influence of these celebrated men , facts of history and character , or to find in their local appreciation the evidence of a representative significance . Thus the progress of civilization is traced to the popular mind by the career of individuals ; the memory of the one is linked with the development of the many ; and the art of Italy , the amiable philoso-* phy of the French mind , the poetic zest of German life , and // what Emerson calls English " pluck , " are embodied , illustrated , and confirmed by the perpetual association of memories like these with the daily scenes of human existence . A foreigner imbued with the essential facts of our history , conversant with the lives and labors of the men whose valor and wisdom founded the republic , and ardent in the love of free institutions , would find the task of identifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and baffling endeavor . It is true , such inevitably recognized localities as those where Washington is buried , where Patrick Henry spoke , and where Warren fell , are conspicuously attested ; but the fame of later patriots , and especially of those whose services were elaborate and varied , rather than signalized by one great achievement , whose thought permeated the life of the times and enlightened the impulses of the popular heart , thus insuring a genuine and a progressive national development , - the fame of these is almost exclusively confined to the written memorial , the historic record . A few octogenarians may indicate the place where such a one strove , suffered , or triumphed ; a street or a steamboat may bear his name ; a vivid anecdote related by the evening fireside , or an eloquent allusion introduced by an anniversary orator , may for a moment recall the man as he lived ; but , in general , this abstract and incidental reminiscence is all that connects him with the passing hour , freighted , it may be , with the prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that name is still a " household word , " yet literally the place that once " knew him knows him no more. ** Incorporated as is the agency of Hamilton into the series of events which resulted in our national institutions , and comparatively few as are the years which have elapsed since his death , the perpetual vicissitude which seems as essential to the life of republics as to that of Nature herself , has already modified or destroyed the scenes and the objects associated with his career . No eminent character of the Revolution and its immediately succeeding era is , however , more completely identified with New York . The cannon which he and his comrades seized on the Battery , so long planted upright at the entrance of the College Green , have disappeared with the // leafy walks of old Columbia , whence he so effectually aided the escape of the Tory President Cooper from the hands of the excited students . The elm before Trinity Church , beneath whose broad canopy his coffin rested while Morris pronounced his eulogy , was long ago cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he planted as emblematic of the original States , yet flourish around the " Grange , " his country-seat , near Fort Washington . The Bayard estate , under whose hospitable roof-tree he was borne to die after the fatal meeting , is now a fashionable street ; but the Park , where first his juvenile eloquence broke upon wondering and sympathetic ears , and where the sagacious eye of General Greene detected the efficient soldier in the youth drilling his volunteer corps , - King 's Bridge , near which his vigilant commander recognized the supervision of an able officer in a skilful breastwork , and was led to know and appreciate his destined aide-de-camp in the long and perilous struggle , - and the bank of the Hudson , where he fell , - are still memorable landmarks , although a few years will quite change their aspect , and perhaps merge their identity in the local transformation inevitable to so rapidly growing a metropolis . Within a short time his venerable mother was laid beside him in the tomb now standing in the very centre of traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipsed almost simultaneously with his life , expired murmuring the song he loved . His bust by Ceracehi is the most significant token of the man , - the expressive brow , fiexile lips , and the entire facial outline being emphatic tokens at once of his intelligence and his genial sympathies ; and by the preservation as a public trust of the humble stone house that served as Washington 's head-quarters at Newburgh , we may still appreciate the patriotic selfdenial of those days in the low ceiling , diminutive casement , and narrow bounds of what was once Hamilton 's bridal chamber .
