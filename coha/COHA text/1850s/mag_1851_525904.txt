AMERICAN REVIEW . No . LXXVI . FOR APRIL , 1851 . IMAGINARY PRESIDENTS : THE IDEAL OF A NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION . WE have yielded our opinions too easily to the arguments of faction , and the dishonest insinuations of interest ; we allow men to lead and represent us , and to exercise public authority , whom in private we would scorn to trust or meet with res*pect . We put Notoriety in office and not Reputation ; for the real man we substitute imaginary creatures , mere men of straw , incapable either to guide or govern . In the great ship of State we lodge a feeble or a worn-out engine , which makes a merit of a backward motion , test the great seas may break its rotten gear or crush in pieces its rusty shafts . We set up Imaginary Presidents , ticketed with the dogmas of party , in lieu of character . Dishonesty thrives under such a system . As the leaders are , so are the volunteers they beckon after them , the picked men of Asmodeus , the cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern ; while we fools , quite ignorant of state navigation , fondly imagine they are working the good ship in some my*terious manner from below .

We are passed into an almost aristocratical corruption , and are some of us content with logs , scotchers and stumbling-blocks , instead of Senators . A session of three months , and nothing done by either side for either side ; the appropriation bills adroitly delayed and then rushed through , to shun examination ; the time of all others most sacred to honor and duty , wasted in contemptible talk , or parliamentary stratagem . The air of the metropolis during this wicked three months is sick with scandal . Every whisper is of an intrigue or of a bribe ; social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manhood and of patriotism . Here we are told in one ear that good English gold is ready for so many , who have sold their constituencies , to kill a tariff ; here in the other ear comes another rumor , that so many are bought on the other side , t counteract the bribes of Free Trade . Here a vast job is divided under the rose , ( a stinking rose , ) among six accessories in legislative mischief . Here another and another , a dozen  --  a hundred-all seeking ripe and eager to be devoured . Here a caucus plotting civil war ; hero another 19 // and another , and another , a score , estimating the price of a President , and ready to put in sealed proposals , baser and baser , down to the lowest . Were there a powerful onward movement amid all this , it might be passed over in silence ; debauchery , gambling , bribery , vote auctions , caucuses of civil war , presidencies offered for sale , jobs without limit , all might be endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure a camp without discipliiie , full of sutlers , thieves , idle envoys and a debauched following that outnumbers the battalions , and no action , the generals bargaining for places , and the fortresses governed by the spies of the enemy ? Legislators will drink , , fight , gamble away fortunes , sell jobs , and waste the time of their public agency ,  --  it is perhaps their natural proclivityto do so ,  --  but those of them who do nothing else , appear in a light wholly intolerable ; the thought of it ends in a contempt for all government and a scorn of all authority ; somewhere it must lead at last , and the end is perhaps not far off ; when the Central Government puts on the face of a Humbug , the Union will assume the same respectable features . How can there be a Union without a head ? From the moment a true man and a hero takes his place at the head of the nation , from that moment the nation is one and indivisible . Assemble at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a tumultuary and dangerous mob ; the army of popular representatives is but a more organized and reputable mischief , until a *owefful leader holds supreme office , on the groundwork of the popular will . President , Prime Minister , call him by what name you will , the head must be seen , and the strong hand felt , the party led , the measures sustained . Let genius and eloquence manage the debate , let wisdom and caution temper the arguments , there must be , says Nature , a head somewhere , a recognized , or if you please , a " divinely " appointed power , lodged in a human will , or my laws dictate confusion and corruption ; I can not endure and will not suffer a tempori*er in a seat of supreme power . The union of your Republic is not in stocks and stones , nor in economy or laws of the greatest good to the greatest number ; - it is in the spirit of man that I find it ; not here and there in books , or mystical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of your nation . Find him out , in God 's name , and if you can , elect him in God 's name and the nation 's , and if he refuses the office , as it is not unlikely he may , beg of him , pray him to accept it , that you and yours may be saved from shame and poverty , and perhaps from death by the cannon shot or bayonet - the tools I use to punish those and the children of those who elect charlatans and fools to offices of supreme authority . For a monarchy it is not always an evil omen , when a fool ascends the throne . Legitimacy provides against the catastrophe that would follow , by intrusting the government to a minister . Republics have no such remedy . The President is the people 's choice , and that choice leads him with the office ; he can not shift responsibility to his ministers , unless , as at present , the power has fallen to him by succession . Legitimacy and irresponsibility are one ; the being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being equal to its exercise . Legitimacy of itself exonerates the sovereign ; his supremacy is not of his own , or of the people 's making ; he is the slave of a system , and is required only to wear the garment and assume the exterior of sovereignty . Far different is it with the temporary sovereign of the Republic : invested with all the authority that a legitimate king could ever justly wield , he adds to it the responsibility of aPrime Minister ; more than that , a minister of the people 's choice , a premier of the Nation , not of the Court . Millions of men have registered their names in his favor , declaring by a solemn act that they have chosen him to represent and exercise the supreme will , the sovereign authority ; not as a puppet , or an idol , but as a man bearing in his heart and mind the true image of justice and goodness , and the true idea of national honor . He is set in his high place as the real representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous , and admirable , in the character of the Republic . If the people , free to vote , have elected a fool , it is ominous of ruin ; they have chosen a fool , and who but a fool will vote for a fool to represent his sovereignty as a man ? Is a cunning knave , a plausible , sly , many-sided confidant of hell , made President , let the people take to themselves the // credit of the choice , and with it the deep contempt of all knowing and thinking humanity . When the people set up knaves and charlatans , let Aristocracy toss up its chin , and crow a loud and lusty laugh over the folly of the unwashed multitude , who mistake the vulgar cunning of a barbarian for talent , and the ashes of vice burnt out , for the snows of virtue . The Republic looks for its political saviour . What manuer of man he must be , all men know . There is an ideal prophetic faculty in men ; humanity knows what it needs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized and hailed as Heaven-sent , even when it stands before us in human shape . We know well that the political saviour of the Republic will not be an intriguer , a deceiver , or a " crisis " politician ; but on the contrary , a man of great views , of simple purposes , and of an enthusiasm that can sustain a youthful empire , rising into vigorous manhood . We are the Greeks of the modern world , worshippers of genius and of glory . We have in us the blood of many choice races poured along in one burning tide . We appropriate the good of the past , and esteem ourselves the masters of the future . The best of Norman , Celtic , Saxon and Teutonic blood , of that kind which time out of mind has stained the British scaffold , and extintinguished the brands of Smithfield ; which tinged the Seine on the memorable day of St. Bartholomew , and has since then flowed freely in many revolutions  --  the virtue , the industry , and &amp;e freedom of Northern Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power at once young , hopeful , and irresistible : the avenger of the past , the patron of liberty , the enemy of oppression , the executor of justice . The men whom we permit to lead us , must feel the passion of the age and of the nation ,  --  must be sensible of , and sensitive for , the glory and the honor of the Republic ; not as a selfish isolated power , but standing foremost among the nations . The leaders of the American People , and of the National Party , will be they who have the courage , prescience , and power to represent the whole doctrine and practice of Republican and American nationality . When such public men appear , we shall no longer hear it said that the party is extinct : a party of nationality and of glory , of independence and of progress , will be found to exist , and will draw after it three fourths of the people . A long and glorious career awaits it , and from the beginning of its rule a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The national candidate may be a man who has endured the worst that calumny and factious hatred can inflict : the road to power and greatness is oftenest through victories over opinion ; great reputations are often founded on great calumnies . He will possess invincible moral courage , Republican but dignified manners , a great , but not a haughty nature . He will not despise popularity , but he will not seek it . He will be a philosopher in intellect ; a sage in conduct ; neither penurious nor profuse ; neither vicious nor a precisian . The spirit of the age is reformatory and economical ; the leader of the National Party must be a guide of reforms , he must temper their enthusiasm , and measure them by their utility . It is not necessary that he should be a military chief ; it is enough for him that he be able to appreciate and use the military genius of others . Very petty and penurious persons , of small intelligence and enormous vanity , have sometimes , even in our day , attained to great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , therefore , always a manly one . Great men make great soldiers , as they also make great lawyers , scholars , or merchants ; and it can not be denied that the Leader of the People ought to combine in himself all the talents that may be necessary to make the great soldier , merchant , lawyer , politician ; that he should possess in full their several attributes of courage , shrewdness , keen intelligence , and knowledge of the people . The discipline of the camp is a grand school for manly qualities , command , resolution , simplicity of will ; and the Republic has never been more happily administered than by its great soldiers ; nor can the favorite of our warlike people be a president of peace societies ,  --  a kind of associations for which the majority of sensible men , we believe , entertain a profound contempt . The fame , honor , prowess , aggrandizement , unity , and progress of the great Republic will be the passion of his life , by which his most secret thoughts will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it ; his own soul will be the grand Republican soul of America ; he will be inspired with a jealousy of the Republican honor , and a reliance upon the power which he represents , the irresistible power of the People . Not an insult to our flag will go unpunished ; not a letter of the law of nations will be broken , upon that side of the earth which it is given us to protect , without a full reparation or a summary vengeance . That grand " anomaly , " the union of many sovereignties in one nation , will be no anomaly to him . With good counsel and a constitutional spirit , he will execute to the letter the laws of the nation , without breaching the defenses of State liberties . Insurrection may spring up under him , but it will be assuaged , or crushed with a wise violence . The honor of the great Republic in foreign lands will be his especial care . To represent living and organic Republicanism in the old world , he will select men who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who can hold themselves aloof from foreign flatteries and foreign intrigues who can by that means cause the Republic to react upon Europe , and reproduce there ideas of humanity , of liberty , and of toleration ; and who by manly and wise conduct will constitute a lawful , open , and unimpeachable propaganda of Republicanism ; who can make America revered by the friends , and dreaded by the oppressors of the people . Jealous of the dignity of his nation , the true *epresentative of the people will receive the Ambassadors of monarchy , who come to promote the interests of kings , with a formal and distant respect ; he will identify the man and his business . The agents of hostile governments will find no convenient traitors , or lying news writers , able to operate upon and mislead a government of which the true representative of Republicanism is the head . For Republics , but especially for those who look to us to be their l ) atrols and protectors , the representative of the people will not disguise his affection , nor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protect them . He will be their warmest and most generous advocate ; he will hearken to their complaints , encourage them in their efforts to organize and establish their governments , and send out to them able and re spectable advisers , who will have the knowledge andthe courage to unite , harmonize , and organize them ; who will exercise at once the offices of peacemaker and defender . Above all , the representative head of the American people will not suffer these dependent and feeble States to fall into foreign and uncongenial hands , whose desire is only to use and spoil them . In a word , the true representative of this Republic will dare to be the chief Republican of all the world , and to think and act as such . By no ordinary services can he have been tested whom the nation will elect to be their head . His election must be , not by the mechanism of a connection and the drill of office seekers ; he must go into power with the people at his back , electing him upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized as the man of all others , bound to the nation , and seeking rather to deepen than to cancel the glorious obligation . The want of such a head in the highest seat of power can not be compensated by the combined or isolated skill of great orators or sagacious party leaders . Nationality in the government can be given only by a master hand , concentrating and directing the scattered forces of party , and giving an object and a motive to the popular sentiment . In the absence of a head , parties become furious and narrow , and degenerate into factions . The discussion of any great measure of utility or honor , in which the entire nation is interested , and which is necessarily argued upon constitutional grounds , ranks men by their principles ; - principles require a representative who can dignify them in action ; great parties are distinguished from factions by the dignity and nationality of their leaders . The contest in the Senate on the measures of Internal Improvements for the benefit of Western agriculture , threw out the old parties into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sufficient distinctness the true political movement of the future . The attempted coalition had failed , it had no solid ground to rest upon ; - men have too much confidence in Union and Nationality to form an active party for their conservation . Had that movement succeeded and an opposition to it as a party taken shape , we should have // a Union party , opposed to one of disunion ,  - -  a disastrous movement ! But it was found impossible to excite two such parties , and on the appearance of the old issues , partisans fell into their ranks and resumed the old weapons of controversy . A national party against slavery is a party of civil war ; a Union Party professedly opposed to it would have recognized its existence , and put a demoniacal life into it . The project failed , as good men hoped it would . The objects of a faction founded upon a pure fanaticism , and which aims to make itself master of the central power for purely fanatical purposes , would only have been dignified by an organized and professedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense against that faction , to be intrusted with the supreme power . The majority were naturally suspicious of such a movement ; they 5u51 ) ected its motive , they did not believe in its assumptions . Since the death of General Taylor , the Government has stood in the attitude not of one using power as it should be used , and gaining favor by the display of courage and vigor , the key to popular approbation in this Republic , where the merit of existence is estimated by its force and creative power ; but in an attitude , rarely reputable , and never advantageous in an intelligent age , of soliciting favor , and founding its claim thereto upon a certain very general and cheap virtue , respect for the Union and the Constitution . And what then should we say of a government which did not entertain a respect for the laws , the Union , and the Constitution ? The prof*sion of such a sentiment is no merit at all ; the most absurd and tyrannical power would reiterate the same ; the weakest continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is elected to the Presidency , assumes power as a Unionist , actively and thoroughly a Unionist ; - respect for the Union and the Constitution is therefore a wretchedly weak and shallow pretext for the presidential candidacy , in itself considered . The question , among ninetynine hundredths of all the people , is not whether the Republic shall exist , but only , what are the surest guarantees of its existence , and of its prosperity . A British system of public economy may destroy the Union , and has already jeopardized it . A meddling British agitation in the North may break up the Union , and has already endangered it . A foreign policy truckling to the ambitious schemes of Britain has degraded the Union , and impaired much of the public respect for it , and thereby so far put its life in peril . A refusal to appropriate the public moneys for the most necessary public improvements has weakened the affection of the States for the Union , and must eventually shake it to the centre . An untimely neglect to defend the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hurrying on a war with Great Britain , which can only be averted by the adoption of a foreign policy congenial with the republican spirit . England must he warned of the consequences of her present policy , or the people of the West will force those of the South and East into a declaration of war against her . Here are a few of the foundation stones of a Presidential platform , broad enough and solid enough to support a brilliant and powerful Executive and Senatorial policy . A Government with such a policy need not manifest weak or hypocritical solicitude for the safety of the Union : it would be a true representative and confirmer of Union . Expressions in favor of the Union have become at length quite stale and idle , like declamations on the side of virtue in general ; they betray emptiness and want of purpose ; the men who make them so often , and on all occasions , have nothing else to say . Where we hear one of these eloquent generalizers declaiming in favor of the existence of the Nation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few questions of home and foreign policy , and thereby , with single slight punctures of the critical knife , let the wind out of the bladder ; we shall , in nine cases out of ten , be witness of a very ridiculous collapse . Here are a pretty contemptible race of hungry politicians , who make their pretended anxiety for the Union a pretext for abominable idleness and intrigue at Washington , throwing away three months ' time of the National Council , and leaving one generous old man to perform the duty of a whole party . What kind of a government is that of which an active , vicious minority can block the wheels l It is a government without vigor , without friends , without merit . Let us imagine the possibility of a state of things like the following : That , on a suC // den , the government forgets that the " Union is in danger , " and that its " frightfully dangerous condition " is any longer at all necessary to any body . Having nothing now to occupy their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were constitutionally elected , they would bend their whole attention to these , excluding all other matters . They have a majority of the people with them ; they have the official patronage ; th*y have immense social influence ; they can , by insisting upon popular and useful measures , awaken the gratitude and enthusiastic support of their constituents , and of the public press ; they can , by direct influence and a display of sincerity , create for themselves a majority in both Houses of Congress . Corruption itself , now their enemy , did they seem powerful , would become their friend , and the bribes and promises distributed in secret , would be distributed for their benefit . Let the truth come out , the very diseases of government , the itch and sore of avarice and ambition , become the voluntary servants of a well organized and vigorous power . In the machinery of our government , the subordinate offices are places of influence and authority . The most important laws are hindered in their passage by the holders of subordinate places , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation . Let the Power that regulates all this , use every atom of its power ; let it adopt a rule for the conduct and principles of all officials , and expel without hesitation or remorse every man who impedes the execution of its design* Such an Executive would have the respect of its enemies and the devotion of its friends . And now , having spoken of the internal policy and organization of such a government , let us inquire , what would be its policy in regard to the masses of men-the people in general ? Recognizing the love of glory , of power , and of independence , as the primary ground of popularity , it would seek to identify itself with those passions in the heart of the people , by showing a bold and warlike front lowards other nations , and a readiness on all occasioas to compel the respect and considerazion of a foreign power , were it otherwise not to be obtained . The message of a President recommending measures in defense of international rights , or of the liberties of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be the most popular document ever written by an American President . The Hulsemann letter was indeed a good thing in its way , but a harmless document at bottom . It carried no consequences , and with all its merit , it does no harm : it calls for no forces ; it demands no ships ; it requires no extra session to meet , for the practical maintenance of its principles by sea and by land ; it brightetied no rifles ; it tempered no swords ; the trade in paper was more benefited by it than the trade in powder : it was a noble sentiment , and the Republic drank its health with a smile ; the band played Hail Columbia , and there was a general cheerfulness . How shall the heads of a party make themselves popular and powerful , unless by showing an excess of the highest passion of the Republic ? If they do not feel it , they must at least adopt the policy it demands , or their term is short . The ludicrously affected enthusiasm of the skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fine illustration of what a skilful insincere politician ought to be , who means to hold power ; but thanks be to God , the statesmen of America need not affect sincerity : the atmosphere they breathe is sincere , the people are sincere ; liberty is sincere ; between God and ourselves we have only the laws , and we can indulge in a real and an honest enthusiasm . The popularity and power of an administration depend much more upon the enthusiasm of the people than upon their shrewdness or their abstract opinions ; and it seems right that it should be so , since the honor of the State is its vital principle , its heart ; an organ much nobler and of more immediate and constant importance than a stomach . But the prudential and economical judgment of the people requires also to be appealed to , and measures supported which secure for labor the protection it demands against foreign monopoly and domestic oppression . An administration sincerely engaged in measures of popular reform , can afford to be , in the right direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggardly , pinched , and prejudiced administration can not . Retrenchasent is only apparently popular , never effectively so . If popularity is the aim of a government , with a view to its reelection , it must retrench as little as may be // convenient , and make as little stir and sound about it as possible : it is an unpopular step , and all the popularity that may be won by it among the disciples of Dr. Franklin , will be soon forgotten , and weigh like dust in the balance against a storm of popular enthusiasm . The popularity of an administration can not be established by crushing a few sinecure offices ; but should it engage in the general movement of Republican reform , against every species of monopoly , it will secure for itself the unlimited confidence and affection of the multitude . Land Reform , so ably advocated at the close of the last session , by a Northern Senator , is not only a just measure , but contains elements of great party value and popularity . The improvement of Internal Navigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity for those who aim to convert its motives into laws . The opening of reciprocal commercial intercourse with Republics , to the exclusion of monarchies , mast become a popular policy . The augmentation of the Steam Navy is a measure not only of imperative necessity , but of unbounded popularity . THE PURCHASE FROM THE STATES OF NIcARAGUA AND HER NEIGHBORS OF THE ENTIRE CANAL AND RAILROAD ROUTES FROM SAN JUAN TO THE PACIFIC , THROUGH THE LAIu* OF NICARAGUA , would be a measure to hold the affection of the Pacific States , and confirm the Union . It would doubtless be a popular measure , and would compel Great Britain to resign her pretensions to the Mosquito territory . As things are moving now , we shall very soon be at war with Great Britain , for the disarming of our citiEens , the occupation of territory not her own , and the exclusion of our commerce from ports where it ought to enter . Either a purchase or a war , we have our choice . Perhaps it is now too late , and the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tollgate between ourselves and California , unless we are the most contemptible and pusillanimous power in the world . England must leave Central America or fight , there * no alternative ; and leave she never will , for she is not used to resign her conquests . Treaties are mere chaff and straw to England ; and in the present instance , had a treaty been made by our Government guaranteeing the British in the occupancy of Central America , it would be chaff and straw to the Americans . It would be broken by necessity , on the least pretext ; the right of way through Central America being almost an absolute necessity to us . We are told that it is apoint of honor with Lord Palmerston to keep a toll-gate between us and California . Lord Palmerston 's point of honor endangers the existence of the British Empire : in the event of a war with England , that power will have a war with Ireland in addition , and her commerce , the second year of the war , swept clean off the seas . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon England , and if a war approaches will seek our alliance . A little cloud no bigger than a man 's hand , of an iron-gray color , like the smoke of artillery , is gathering in the direction of the Isthmus . A war managed by British agents , on the part of the old Aristocratic party , called Serviles , who oppose the Federal Union of the States-involving the ruin of the States , and their final subjugation by England-is now in progress ; these States hold the gate of the world 's commerce , which England has resolved to have , at the cost even of a general war . Our relations with England , commercial and moral , are the key to all our politics . If these are clear to us all is clear , and the grand issues unmistakable . Since the war of 1812 , it has been the ineffectual policy of a large and powerful party to overwhelm us with British principles , and British legislation . It was important for England on her side to cultivate amicable relations ; she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was necessary for her to keep the artisan industry of America in check ; our industrial success must be her ruin ; she must have our markets duty free , and she must have our cotton duty free ; she must make our clothes for us , and we must buy them of her or she would fall into the rank of a second-rate power , and lose the commerce of the world . All went well ; the Americans were being rapidly indoctrinated with British principles , when by an unfortunate concurrence , Texas was annexed , and California gold mines discovered ; it became evident that the possessors of the Isthmus would be the keepers of the commercial gateway between the eastern and western hemi // spheres . The Americans were asleep , drugged with free trade and British opinions , or were madly brandishing the torches of civil war , made and set on fire , and distributed among them by the 3rators of Exeter Hall , the grand propaganda of modern British opinion . The Union would soon be dissolved ; the work of ruin went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-slavery wars of America , would be dated the new epoch of England 's commercial prosperity . " Vast would be my wealth , enormous my power , " thought the Lion of England ; " I will break in fragments , and subjugate in detail the monstrous and fatal Union of Republics , as I have already done every other union of free States on the New Continent . The six hundred thousand bales of cotton now manufactured in America , and consumed there , would , in the event of a division of the Union , be wrought up in England , and sent to America to sell . Glorious prospect ! But I must first have the Isthmus , to command the California and the Pacific trade ; it will give the key to the West Indies , and command the Mississippi . I must hold fast to San Juan-that is the point d'appui-that is the Gibraltar of the Gulf and of the Pacific ! " Accordingly , while the paw of the Lion is set firmly and angrily upon Snn Juan , the jackals of faction agitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disunion-British Principles . In Boston , England is a rank Abolitionist . In South Carolina she is a great Aristocrat , talking about her coohes , her Irish tenantry , and her agricultural and colonial sympathies . In both she is a free-trader , and her morality in regard to slaves a mere changeable cockade . Free trade is the secret . Upon the Central American question turns all the future , both of America and of England . An Imaginary President , or man of straw in office , can not , of course , do any thing with it ; lie will not even see it ; the avalanche may thunder above  --  the deaf ass will plod on his way and eat his thistle . Little factious men have only little and factious aims . A dozen slaves escape*1 from their masters bring great joy to some men 's souls ;  --  the prospect of a war of extermination carried on against three millions of negroes , a catastrophe toward which the same kind , discreet , and tender-hearted agitators , under British guidance , are hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass , again , whose bray shakes down the avalanche . The election of General Taylor , a Southern military man , and a slaveholder , was regarded by the South as a perfect security to themselves against Northern encroachments . To make his electi *n sure , it was , however , thought necessary to give the Vice Presidency to the North , and the least dangerous and least exceptionable person for that purpose was no doubt the one selected . He was known to be temperate in politics , and had not discovered any strong aptitude for usurpation . He was a safe man , and therefore he was chosen ; he was an able business man , and competent for the regular duties of any office in the gift of the nation . The death of General Taylor changed every thing . It was thought necessary by the Administration to adopt a policy conciliatory to the South , on the one hand , and for one set of reasons , and antagonistic to Mr. Clayton 's , and conciliatory to England on the other , and for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the South would have no confidence in a Northern President , and would do all in their power to crush him and his friends ; and the second , on the supposition that the genius of England exerted a benign and harmonizing influence over America . England , it must have been known , had laid her plans , since 1 *74O , to possess and occupy the southern third of the North American Continent ; to erect another system of colonies on the Asiatic plan , and reestablish the balance of European power in America . Powerful arguments supported the new policy so antagonistic to that of General Taylor . Were the southern third of the Continent once fairly in English hands , no more slave States could be erected south of Texas . The magnificent cotton lands of Mexico , Yucatan , Balize , and the Mosquito shore , where ten bales can be raised to the single hand , would be cultivated by free labor , at less than twelve cents the day , and the negro for ever excluded . All other slave products would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence of England upon the South for ever terminated . An " Anglo-Saxon " power would have possession of that part of the continent , and the Spanish colonists gradually supplanted and exterminated . In English hands , deeper // canals and more substantial railroads would intersect the interoceanic territories ; and every American who passed over would receive a tincture of Anglo-Saxonism , and have impressed upon his heart a deep sense of British humanity and hospitality . England herself ; once our enemy , now by necessity our friend , looked to us for aid in this matter . Exhausted by a series of wars against the Republicanism of Europe , burdened with an insupportable taxation , drawing two thirds of all the food she eats from other soils , she came to us no longer in the character of a rival , but in that of a dependent friend and cousin . It was indispensable for her to have the privilege of blockading the ports of the Spanish Republics , or she could find no sale for her surplus cloths and cutlery . We were rich and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gold and quicksilver , coal and cotton ; she had none of these , and it was not for us to play the dog in the manger , and refuse her the privilege of a poor cousin ; we who had so much could surely spare her a morsel . And so it was deemed expedient to allow her the privilege she asked , and the policy of Henry Clay , of John Q. Adams , of Thomas Jefferson , of Monroe , and of General Taylor , was abandoned , and the Spanish Republics , the gateway between Europe and Asia , are now subject to the blockades and other tender violences of the " Anglo-Saxon " Queen ; American citizens passing that way are disarmed by Jamaica negroes , and treated with considerable tenderness afterwards . Again , *ther arguments were conceived . South Carolina was on intimate terms with England , and might at any moment , nay , had already , through her citizens , opened an amatory correspondence with her . South Carolina , or rather the few persons who rule and agitate in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to lean upon England for protection against the supposed aggressions of the North . Members of the Nashville Convention were assured that South Carolina had only to throw herself into the cotton-clad lap of the British Queen , and she would be tenderly embr*ed and strongly defended . It was expedient , therefore , to conciliate England , because of her influence in South Carolina . Again , England was the great agitator of Abolitionism in the North ! Singular contradiction ! - inexplicable to country statesmen ! The manufacturing and commercial power of England deemed it necessary to bring about a separation of the Northern and Southern States . Her politicians had formally announced it as a part of their foreign policy to effect that separation . Her humanitarians had declared that the Union of the North American States was the grand cause of the continuance of slavery in America . It was therefore an act of humanity to procure a dissolution of that Union . Her free traders had declared that the American Union maintaining a free and harmonious commercial intercourse between the Northern and Southern States was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southern and Northern States , and that if it continued , British industry could no longer clothe the world , but must share the market of the world with the Americans , and finally give it up to them . It consequently became an essential part of the Free Trade movement to agitate Abolition in the North , and at the same time , and for the same purpose , to tempt the South from her allegiance with promises of free trade and protection if she would secede . Such considerations as these seem to make it important for men in power in America to desert the policy of Henry Clay , Monroe , Adams , and Taylor , and to conciliate England by the most flattering and friendly attentions , to permit her to run riot over the Spanish Republics , and act her pleasure on the two coasts of the continent . What other and more powerful considerations may have driven our Government off from the American and Republican platform , we need not now stoop to inquire . Enough we do know , to satisfy us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corrupt the public sources of information , to suppress inquiry , to divert the attention both of Government and people from the designs of our rival . But it is with the general arguments , such as all men may discuss , that we are at present interested : let us keep to the open question , and use the common facts ; the good sense of our fellow-citizens asks for nothing more than that . England is a conservative country ; it is anti-revolutionary , anti-slavery , and antidemocratic . The two powerful interests who govern it , the old and new an aristocracy , the // aristocracy of land and the aristocracy of money and trade , unite in a cordial hatred of popular reforms . They kill democracy by bribing all electors , and keep revolutions out of England by a system of game laws , by which the people are disarmed . They have an army in India , and create revolutions there ; they create revolutions in every country in the world except their own , and for wise reasons , which every free trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands . But the world has suddenly discovered , and the Tories of England , as the reader will find in an article in our succeeding number , have let out the grand secret , that the existence of the British Empire through another half century is a problem of uncertain solution . France has two millions of armed citizens ; the United States can in two weeks concentrate an army of one hundred thousand trained rifles and muskets simultaneously upon three or four points of her Atlantic coast . California has not less than sixty thousand fighting men always ready , more than all the fighting men in England and Scotland . Russia can assemble and move a million . Prussia can summon every male adult citizen to arms , and find him ready with the musket . Germany is warlike from the Baltic to Trieste . Even Greece is at present a more defensible and warlike country than England . And with all that she depends upon Ireland , France , America , and Russia for more than one half of all the food that is eaten by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her population must be swept away *y famine . By far the greater part of all food of her artisans comes from Ireland , and in Ireland she keeps a spy with a telescope to watch every cross road , an immense police army , and twenty thousand regular troops under arms . That is to say , the British Empire depends for its existence upon the contingency of an Irish rebellion , an American tariff , and the evil disposition of the Russian Autocrat . Highly necessary is it then for England to conciliate America , and if possible to keep us in a good humor with her and with ourselves . And yet ske knows us too well to be at much pains to do that , even . Such is the inactivity and weakness of our Government , paralyze&amp; by certain ingenious mesmerizers whose purpose it is to ride into power upon the wrecks of the great parties , nothing can be done with spirit or decision . Our tariff is left ruinously inad* equate ; the public lands are absorbed and wasted by politicaL speculators , creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress expends its energies in a detestable factious agitation ; our steam navy must struggle unaided against British competition ; and above all , we have no foreign policy except such as may be prepared for us by Lord Palmerston , and submitted to our Senators by an ingenious English gentleman in Washington . Our Republican allies , who desire our commerce and our protection , are hemmed in by British cruisers , the gateway between ourselves and the Pacific is closed and tolled by England , and our citizens passing a free territory regularly searched and disarmed ; and all this because a dozen or more industrious intriguers wish to have their names entered on the books of the Presidential Scrub Race of 1852 . Upon whom , then , should we fix our choice to rescue the nation from shame ? Upon a stuffed man of straw , an imaginary person , or upon some high-minded and ardent American , who has the magnanimity , the spirit , and the will , to put an end to this shameful and disgusting farce ? Let it be he , whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the councils of the nation ; who can raise anew the fallen standard of Repubcanism ; who can engage all the people in a true Union movement , a movement of industry and enterprise ; who can reyive the latent enthusiasm of the friends of home industry , of nationality , and of national independence , and show them that they are the powerful majority of all the people ; whose boldness and firmness will , with or without war , give us all that war can give , a greater name , increased wealth , a firmer nationality , and the respect of the world . Is there a man in America honored by the voice of the people ? who has represented truly the interests and the honor of the Republic ? who adorns the councils of the nation by an eloquence founded upon wisdom , sincerity , and prescience ? who in diplomacy represents at once the sagacious , the brilliant , and the bold ? Must we go into the field and seek him at the furrow , or are his form and voice known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must find him ; the Republic needs a head , the Union an incarnation . The events of the last few months have // 299 shown that the Presidency of the United States can not be powerfully wielded by one to whom it falls by accident , or by mere succession . It is even doubtful whether an election by Congress , failing that by the nation , can confer a prestige and a power upon the successful candidate equal to the necessity of the situation . Without an able and truly representative man at the helm , there is no movement , no progress . THE NATION IS NEVER RIGHT UNTIL ITS FIRST CITIZEN 15 AT ITS HEAD . Is there not a man in the nation , whose election to the Presidency will give joy and satisfaction ,  --  a sense of security and hope ? God and man , nature and necessity are against us until we put our best man in command . It is not to him , whoever he may be , that we owe any thing ; as individual citizens we owe him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may have seemed to injure and overshadow some of us ; - that is nothing here nor there ; we must elect a real and not an Imaginary President , or resign our power , and so it will be by a natural necessity . Every business must have an active agent to control it , every ship must have a master to guide it in the storm . Until the right agent is chosen the business languishes ; until the right master is appointed , the ship is badly navigated and the crew are mutinous ; until the natural leader of the Republic is in the first office in its gift , the Republic languishes . Not once in a thousand years does it happen , that two men can be found in the same day in a great nation , fit to be intrusted with the highest office . A hundred may perhaps be found equal to the business of the office , and fifty of the hundred perhaps who can guide and govern men ; but that is not all that is needed for the Presidency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal virtue , and the power too of enforcing respect and acquiescence , and commanding the favor of the million , should go into office with the President of the Great Republic . " Principles , not men , " is the spur*us maxim of some cunning politicians . For then it should be , " Oftices , not men . " Of principles ' those men are quite innocent , God wot , who can not distinguish a great man from a great booby , a tall fool from an Agamemnon , who care not if the Devil be President , so he furnish them a rich employment . " We owe the Presidency to Jones , " say some , as a reward for his services to the nation , and to the Republican cause . An obvious error . The Presidency of the United States is not a Christmas box nor a pension . If the nation owes any service to Mr. Jones , my good democratic friend , and he will so far humiliate himself as to show value receired , let him have a pension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor his friends are fit to exercise power if they look for any thing of the kind , nor can any such plea be offered by them upon any occasion where the Republic is mentioned with the respect due to it . If any man has identified himself with the glory and genius of the American people , and can wield the highest power as an enthusiastic and high-minded Republican , and not as a mercenary agent or the stipendiary of a faction or a class he would laugh to scorn your bas&amp; offer of the Presidency to him as a reward , or a pensien . What right have we , a dozen or twenty private citizens , to offer the Chief Magistracy of the Republic as a payment ? Away then with the ridiculous plea , that Jones or Smith must have the Presidency because they have worked for it ! It is not in us to give it , nor in him to earn or receive it . The natural head of the Republican and National Party must stand foremost as the Representative , not of union in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign , that will make union as necessary as life . He must be the suggestor and the guide of great measures , to be carried through Congress , if necessary , by the severest struggles ; the Congress , loaded with corruption and old prejudice , will , ten to one , fight against the people and their man . Whatever the violence of opposition , and the fury of calumny , he must with a firm will , relying upon the sole foundation of power , the respect of the people , carry his measures right on to their performance . Not a question must remain in any man 's mind of his intention or his sincerity . There must be no secresy , no diplomacy with the nation . He will draw about him the ablest and most trustworthy citizens of the Republic ; the fittest to stand by and work the dangerous machinery of power . No thought of elections must enter his mind ; Isis re-election is secured by his conduct . // The Presidency of the United States is 1 perhaps the most difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest moral and intellectual power to hold it successfully ; - and it will not have been successfully held unless it is held for a successor . A successful , well-managed political party , led by first class statesmen , should be able to hold office for an entire generation , and carry their system of policy into its full effects . If the Whigs go out of office at the next election , confusion and weakness may follow them for twenty years longer ; possibly they may become extinct as a party , and politics fall upon new issues , more exciting and po ular than those which create party lines at present . If they can find a suitable candidate , and can join a powerful and popular name with his in the Vice Presidency , to meet the danger of his death , power will perhaps remain in Whig hands for a full age of man . Many distinguished names might be mentioned of men fully equal to the business of high office , and who would do creditably what the place requires ; but we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find not him who on the whole is the most available , but him who is the candidate without comparison . Were the true man found , the sons of mischief and confusion would unite , and concentrate all their powers for the sake of defeating so dreadful an antagonist . But their union against him and his friends would be of itself a benefit conferred upon the nation . The d4straction of parties corrupts and weakens the political morality of the people ; a dozen abominable little factions , fanatical , selfish , narrow and ignorant , do nothing for the nation but mischief . Let them be united in opposition , the meaner motives disappear . A legion of devils are cast out , who before delighted to animate the members of a disjointed carcass . An able succession of twenty years , with a great policy , continued through a line of national and truly Democratic Presidents , would in all probability annihilate the British Free Trade faction , crush the BriLish-born disunionist factions of the North and of the South , re-establish republican industry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nation the love of all nations struggling for liberty , and strike salutary terror into the reactionists and despots of the old world ; establish the freedom and confirm the prosperity of the southern third of the continent , where our cifizens are received with open arms , and offered every advantage by the Spanish Republics ; give a new and powerful impulse to the manufacturing industry of the South ; open to the use of all the world the exhaustless mineral wealth of Pennsylvania , of Virginia , and of Central America , ( the new and better California ; ) give a new impulse to the commerce of the world by furnishing to all markets a vast and profitable surplus of manufactures ; and above all , re-establish the honor and glory of the Republican name , now fallen into disgrace and weakness , and by its fall in America , retarding the great movements of human progress abroad . Nothing of all this can be done , unless the first citizens of the Republic are put at the head of its affairs , and the first man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A popular simpleton , an industrious fanatic , an able rascal , a vain rhetorician , a cunning diplomatist , a stipendiary , an honest ignoramus-these are not the characters to lead the new age , or give a majestic forward movement to the great Republic . Good friends , good men , honest and intelligent citizens , consider what a folly you commit when you cast the fatal , irrecoverable vote that puts a weak , a silly , a false , or a knavish man at the head of this nation . The power of the place is great ; the greatest capacity can not satisfy it , and it has this peculiarity , that it must be used . If not used , it works a proportionate mischief . An imaginary , do-nothing President , or a stuffed show President , is not merely a clog and a disgrace ; the mischief he unconsciously accomplishes is just equal to the unused power and legitimate responsibility of the office .

If we allow our manufacturing industry to be oppressed and outdone , another nation more enterpris // qwq THE genius of John Keats , like his own Saturn , majestic and solitary , ruled with a broken sceptre a kingdom of desire . Its breathings are all sighs . Instead of love , it has yearnings . Its voice is the melodious *y of unrequited , insatiate longing . " Deep in the shady sadness of a vale , Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn And eve 's one star , " he buries himself in the cavern of memory . His glory is the glory of the past ; he broods over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him ; mountains rest upon their breasts , and still he scornfully yet sadly refuses the modern allegiance Reason is his Jove , whose power he confesses , but to whom his proud spirit refuses to bow . Death closed in upon him while he yet wavered . He was never taken into the circle of the gods ; his statue stands without the vestibule . In his poem of Hyperion , there is indeed a majesty of movement rivalling the Miltonic . The silence is sublime , and the sound of the verse rolls off constantly into a silence . - " No stir of air was there ; Not so much life as on a summer 's day Robs not one light seed from the feathered grass , But where the dead leaf fell , there did it rest . A stream went voiceless by , still deadened more By reason of his fallen divinity spreading a shade ; The Naiad mid her reeds pressed her cold finger Closer to her lip . " It is the recession of a storm ; the departure of a multitude ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn and imaginative is the imagery of what is seen : life , palpitating but not moving ; the outward stillness convincing of the inward grief ; and the little motion that has been , only a return and not a relief to the immovable . " Along the margin sand large foot-marks went No farther than to where his feet bad strayed , And slept there since . Upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless , listless , dead , Unsceptred , and his realinless eyes were closed ; While his bowed head seemed listening to the Earth , His ancient mother , for some comfort yet . " From first to last , a more absolute picturing of stillness , grief , and silence , of fallen divinity , and the coming on of eternal despair , is not in written language . It has a quality , this description of Saturn , which belongs to no other poetry ,  --  a ponderous weight , a magnitude of passion . There is no sentiment here ; Saturn is too great for it ; he is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality indtspensable to grandeur-venerableness . The figure of the ancient king , friendless , comfortless , driven from his empire , his sceptre broken , yet awakens no pity : it is the weakness of a god : we venerate , perhaps we sympathize , but we can not pity . Great emotions are short-lived . The first line after this magnificent passage is pure prose , a flat falling into commonplace : " It seemed no force could wake him from his place ; " which , after the swelling of the lungs and // thrill of the preceding verses , is a mere asthmatic puff . What follows is but little better : " But there came one who with a kindred hand Touched his wide shoulders after bending low With reverence , though to one who knew it not . " By the epithet " kindred , " we perceive that the genius does not wholly desert the poet ; but the action is roughly and coldly inverted . First we picture to ourselves the " kindred hand " touching the " wide shoulders , " and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas , in fact , the one who came first bent low with reverence and then touched the wide shoulders . It is an absolute demand of poetry that description shall go along with action ; inversion of the action takes all dignity from the imagery . The figure touching the shoulder first , and bowing afterwards , is like that of a messenger jogging your elbow , and bowing when you turn to see who touched you . And finally , the intimation that Saturn did not know who it was that touched him is commonplace , verging to vulgar . This peculiar defect of interruptedness , a proof either of intellectual or constitutional feebleness , distresses the render less in this poem of ilyperion , and in " St. Agnes ' Eve , " than in any other of Keats 's works . The genius of the poet flares up , dies out , and flares again , as if there were a dearth of fuel to feed it ; and by this fault , more than any other , he is removed out of the class of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of a hundred excellent critics , both ancient and modern , sustains the opinion that the place of honor in art must be given to the creative or sustaining power-that which carries one feeling , one passion , one sentiment , through as many revolving periods of verse and shifting scenes as may serve for the exhaustion of the idea or subject . It may have been through physical weakness , mental defect , or the very excess of an inferior faculty , fancy ; , by violent action , drawing away the vital pith from imagination ; * or perhaps an ambition , of which Keats was certainly the victim , of transcending the powers granted by his years , as the tree , striving too early to produce a perfect fruit , exhausts itself and dies ; - through one or all of these causes , this poet produced nothing entire . The " Eve of St. Agnes " will be quoted against the opinion ; but this poem is an interlude , and has neither beginning nor end ; it seems to have been thrown off as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continuing our reading of ilyperion , we are presented with a portrait of the goddess Thea : " She was a goddess of the infant world : By her in stature the tall Amazon Had stood a pigmy 's height ; she would have ta'en Achilles by the hair , and bent his neck , Or with a finger staid Ixion 's wheel . " Follows upon this : " Her face was large as that of Memphian Sphinx . " And now we see only her face : the body has disappeared ; the image is broken ; the head here , the body further off . This face , so large , has no expression ; it is like a great round moon , or like that of a colossal statue lying in the sand . The poet endeavors to restore life to it with a gasp , but fails : " But oh , how unlike marble was that face . " The expression that follows is again exquisite ; and we return to the passion , the genius of the poem : " How beautiful , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self ! There was a listening fear in her regard , As if calamity had but begun ; As if the vanward clouds of evil days Had spent their malice , and the sullen rear Was with its stored thunder laboring up . " The majesty of these lines brings back a conviction that in the mind of the poet there was a unity of design and feeling , which he had not the power to express in its totality . The fragments of the architecture , capitals of columns , the frieze , entablature even , finished with a master hand , lie all along in gigantic disprder . R is as though the builder of the temple had not yet invoked the deity . The invocation wanting , the foundation not laid , the genius would not descend . Nothing could have been imagined more suitable for epic genius than the argument of this poem . Modern philosophy , penetrating the mythological veil , has discovered in the gods of antiquity an impersonation of the powers and passions of the human soul . Whether primeval philosophy , seizing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its service , and made hermes stand for Wit , Horns for Imagination , Juno // for Pride , Ammon and Osiris for the diviner principles in man ; or whether the greater gods , the powers of nature and the soul , were clothed by the sages with the forms and attributes of humanity ,  --  as in Thoth , understanding , in Osiris beneficence , in Phtha will and justice , in Ammon innate dignity , - let the learned dispute . Certain it is , no true epic of mythology and cosmogony could be constructed without a philosophical knowledge of the gods . Under the character of the Titans , in this poem of Keats , the primeval empire of passion is represented . Cronos , the dethroned Saturn , is that power of necessity and circumstance , the sole deity of the unenlightened mind ; venerable indeed , beloved of the senses and of the passions , but succumbing always to that divine reason in man to which the accidents of life or death are indifferent . How majestic the subject of this poem ! ilyperion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural world , leads the war against the new dynastry of Reason , and of Jove . Assembled in their caverns , at the roots of the volcanoes , the Giants of Nature hold a gloomy council . The spirit of Milton presided over the conception of this council . Bat who can say whether a mythological epic must not of necessity resemble all others of its name ? The elements of all are simple and the same . If the poem is mythologic , to have a human interest the right must conquer pride , as among men . The honor of the superior powers must be vindicated ; the right of reason over the wild and furious democrats of nature must be established by aristocraty of Character. * Herein would lie all the dignity of the poem , that Jove and his compeers conquer by right of Character , and vindicate that right in themselves . And if mythology is merely an impersonation of the inferior and superior powers , the mythologic epic is but one subject , and must be ever treated from the same point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquer by divine authority ; and the weakness of the poem is the introduction of the Deity in *person . Had the divine Source itself been left in darkness , and Heaven set against Hell , equal in attributes , but conquering or * Character- " mark ; " as we say , " a man of mark . " conquered by impa ted Divinity , the epic would be pure . As it now moves , the angels , with their beauty and their strength , are unreal phantoms , and the Deity in person is the Conqueror ; while Satan and his peers have the attributes and consequently the dramatic value of persons . In Milton 's angels there is no Will . All the freedom is with Hell . These angels seem passive ; almost soulless . Abdiel alone has real characteristics . By this arrangement , the poem loses one half the interest of true epic . If we believe that the genius of Keats would at length have proved equal to what he undertook , his poem would then have been more perfect in its frame-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more philosophical in its design . His gods , who were to conquer , would have shown in action the perfections of the higher reason . By wisdom , by strength of will , and by reliance on the Eternal , after many reverses , they would have subdued , and again buried the rebellious powers . Both literature and philosophy suffered an irretrievable loss in a mind capable of conceiving and executing so majestic a design . But it is idle to waste conjecture ; let us endeavor to appreciate the merits of the fragment . At the conclusion of the second book is a description of Hyperion entering the council of the Titans " Suddenly a splendor like the morn Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps , All the sad spaces of oblivion , And every gulph and every chasm old , And every height and every sullen depth , Voiceless , or hoarse with loud tormented streams ; And all the everlasting cataracts , And all the headlong torrents far and near , Mantled before in darkness and huge shade , Now saw the light and made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feettouched , and there he staid to view The misery his brilliance had betrayed To the most hateful seeing of itself . Golden his hair , of short Numidian curl ; Regal his shape majestic ; a vast shade In midst of his own brightness , like the bulk Of Memnon 's image at the set of sun To one who travels from the dusking East : Sighs , too , as mournful as that Memnon 's harp , He uttered , while his hands contemplative He pressed together , and in *ilence stood . Despondence seized again the fallen Gods At sight of the dejected King of Day . " It strikes some readers , whether justly we know not , on the reading of this fragment , that there is in it no promise of ACTION . // There is a deficiency of the thews and sinews . There is nothing war-like in Hyperion ; his hands are pressed together in contemplative silence ; and such hands , on such an occasion , pressed together , would not have grasped the sword of empire . How energetic , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first appearance of the fallen Archangel in the poem of Mil-ton " He with his horrid crew Lay vanquished , rolling in the fiery guiph , Confounded though immortal . * * * * * Round he throws his baleful eyes , That witnessed huge affliction and dismay , Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate . At once , as far as angel 's ken , he views The dismal situation waste and wild . * * * * * Thus Satan , talking to his nearest mate , With head uplift above the wave , and eyes That sparkling blazed ; his other parts besides , Prone on the flood extended long and large , Lay floating many a rood . " Milton is easier to read than Keats . The description is rapid and concise . There is no description without motion ; a quality necessary to the epic , since by dwelling too long upon a part , the interest is lost , and imagination flags . The description must move forward , or it falls ; it must soar and soar , and continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mighty wings . Indeed , it may be ventured , that Keats would have failed in the ilyperion for want of action . His figures arc contemplative . The Muse pauses , as she creates them , and steps backward to meditate their fair proportions . The poems of Milton , on the contrary , even his earliest , have a vivacity , a lively spring and movement , which give promise of the epic . " Come , but keep thy wonted state With even step , and musing gait . " He will not suffer even Melancholy herself to sit contemplative ; she must pace forward . Hardly a line is deficient in the activity either of thought or of motion ; the mark of a genius essentially and powerfully epical . In Keats , on the other hand , there is every where flaccidity and weakness ; his heat is not the heat of motion but of emotion ; he has the melancholy of Hamlet , dreaming of a purpose , but never moving toward it . The appearance of the Miltonic feeling in " Hyperion " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But is not the earliest evidence of artistic ability in imitation ? Great artists have indeed distinguished themselv* by an original nature of their own , but have they not equally proved their merits by the skill and taste wih which they have reproduced the originality of others ? Unaided by the faculty of imitation , and even of appropriation , originality decliness into lameness and obscurity . We know that the education of a great artist is begun by a close acquaintance with the works of his predecessors , as well as of Nature . The most intimate friendship with Nature avails nothing without the power of imitation ; and though this representative faculty be given to the artist in never so great perfection , yet , as it is of all the most artificial , and the most intelligent in its mode of action , so it requires the greatest accumulation , and experience , and aids to shorten and improve its processes . The advancement , that is to say , the dignity of a school of artists appears chiefly in their choice of subjects ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only certain scenes , times , phases : phases of beauty , sublimity ; tinies or seasons of richest development ; scenes illustrating what is moral or immortal in humanity . Representative art will not allow its powers to be wasted with impunity upon the tame , the sensual , or the vulgar of common life . The selection of its subjects is therefore a moral occupation , and of a high order , suitable to the leisure of cultivated and heroic ages , and unsuitable , because of baseness and incapacity , to those that are barbarous and mechanical . The lessons of the artist , in overeomino ' his greatest difficulty , the choice of subject , come to him at first throughlis predecessors . He imitates nature , it is true , but he looks at nature through the eyes of those who have preceded and aroused him . Every artistic age refines upon former ages , holding to a certain taste , and improving the " school . " The degeneracy of art appears in a mean or novel choice of subject ; in eccentricity of manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two-fold imitation of previous art and of nature goes on ripening to a certain point , the height or perfection of the school ; and then follows a gradual decline , when imitation predominates over // design , when genius fades into sentimentalisin , and the artist becomes either an eccentric or a tame and laborious imitator . Poesy as well as painting has grown by accretion as well as by invention . As it required a Giotto and a Cimabue to prepare the ground for a Da Vinci , so it required an Ennius to do the same for a Virgil . Imitation reaches out from school to school , over entire epochs and centuries . Homer precedes Ennius and Virgil ; and Virgil 's ? neid gives form and beauty to the poems of Dante . The influence of Phidias is seen again in Angelo and Raphael , and something of the Hebrew grandeur and simplicity reappears in the liturgy of the Church of England . In a word , the greatest imitators are the greatest artists ; for by the same power that is given them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seize and reproduce the sublimity and beauty of their predecessors ; so that the greatest works of art , in painting , poetry , and sculpture , are those which carry in their lines the entire history of art itself . The Christ of Raphael and the Moses of Michael Angelo , the Satan of Milton and the Hamlet of Shakspeare , are the best traditions of the progress of genius from the beginning . The greatest imitator absorbs and surpasses all that have gone before him , as did Shakspeare , even to the reproduction of the morality and sentiment of races who flourished centuries before him , under other religions and other systems of society . Shakspeare 's appropriation of his predecessors amounts even to the swallowing and digest*on of entire works . Great artists are eclectic , and build upon . many masters . Like Goethe , in whom the eclectic , imitative genius predominated to that degree , his works are a prodigious mass of imitations of every master in letters . Virgil , Sophocles , Shakspeare . Ovid , Boccaccio , Petrareb , by turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took away their proper excellences , by surpassing each in his field . Nor was it a blind instinct that prompted him ; his imitations , like those of Virgil and Milton , are deliberate and conscious and profound . The pride of originality can have no place in the spirit of a first-rate artist he appropriates and assimilates and reproduces in new shapes every beauty which he finds , and every melody which he hears ; indifferent whether it come first through himself or through another . Wherever the greatest beauty is to be found , he makes his study . As in the circle of twenty-four hours there are but two times , the evening and the morning , which give the highest beauty to seencry ; as in the circle of the year , the season of vegetation alone , and in human life , the point of transition from youth to adult age ; as these alone give the highest instances of beauty , and they too at long and rare intervals ,  --  one among a thousand meeting the ideal of the artistic mind ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature 's beauties , and complete it , in the life of one artist . Each presents his discovery , his segment . The discovery of a single perfect beauty immortalizes the original imitator . Out of the succession of many artists and many schools , the gre at designer finds and appropriates almost the entire sphere of moral , intellectual and physical perfection . The more he appropriates from others , the more alive is he to the beautifnl in Nature herself . His studies alternate between her works and those of men . As the original observer turns variously toward fields agreeable to his feelings , he will naturally addict himself to congenial models . The pastoral , the epic , the dramatic , and the lyric will draw by turns , or constantly , the attention of the young and unformed poet . And when conscious judgment has discovered and marked the proper and congenial field , the favorite models are still read and re-read . The sculptor , blind and superannuated , solaced his genius by passing his hands over the antique marble ; the poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hebrew lyrists and the dramatists of Greece . The fashion of this age is greatly for originality , that is to say , for the production of styles ,  --  new styles in writing , new styles in thinking , novelty in all things . So much of novelty has appeared within the last century , men have ceased to be astonished at things new , and even to be disgusted with novelty itself . It is perhaps safe to affirm that originality can not be attained by seeking for it , but only eccentricity-oddity and eccentricity , which the great artist avoids as he values his immortality . In art we are apt to mistake novelty for ingenuity , and what is only old , for what is ancient and // 816 enduring . The ocean and the stars of today are the same with those of yesterday ; the generations of living creatures renew themselves . Man only is progressive and original ; by virtue of his creative reason . His plasticity adapts itself to new conditions of the universe ; his life is the life of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth not merely from infancy to middle age , and old age , but from barbarism to the highest degrees of social harmony , and then downward again toward luxury and decay . Literature , like the creature of which it is the record of progress , is original only by representing the age to which it belongs , and not by discovering in its texture the diseases and the vanities of an author 's mind . When we speak then in future of originality , we intend only representative , artistic originality ; true to the time , the persons , and the place which it represents ; giving the very spirit and impress of the age and the race , even to the minutest traces of manners and of speech . To be origir*nl , therefore , it is necessary to live the life , not of a recluse , given up to meditation , nor of a scholar buried in books , but to unite with a certaia degree of scholarship and speculative thought a large experience of men , and a knowledge of things and their uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to be scientific ; to be otherwise is to fall behind the time . It is necessary also to be political , to understand both democracy and monarchy . The strongest characteristic of the poet whose works are before us seems to have been his power of imitation . His admirers will not be offended by the assertion , after what has been said in regard to the importance of the talent of imitation , the left hand of genius , of which originality is the right . Keats is perhaps the most delicate and successful imitator of modern times . His appropriative talent has impressed his critics ; but they describe him also as a sensuous painter because of his rich and soft coloring . But is not this quality one of those which distinguish the artist from the scenepainter ? Keats writes for the eye and for the ear : he satisfies the senses indeed ; his metres are full , solid , and harmonious ; but lie was not a sensualist . " Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness , Close bosom-friend of the all-cheering sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it be ShnI*-speare 's " teeming autumn , big with rich increase , Bearing the wanton burden of the prime . " The sensuosity of Keats is the sensuosity of Shakspeare and of Milton , and of all great and pure-minded poets who are not rhyming metaphysicians , but colorists , and masters of light and shadow , the great painters of nature . What they describe the eye sees , the ear hears , the senses feel , the imagination embodies . And yet we can not rank this admirable child of fancy among poets of the first order . The subordinate excellences of a first-rate artist , those proper to the early days of highest expectation , he seems to have ; his deficiencies are pi-ofound . The most approved writers are those who have given the power of a transcendent representative genius to the embodiment of moral themes . The glory and the punishment of pride ; Satan and his fall ; the pride of Coriolanus ; the rise and ruin of a rebellion in Macbeth ; fastidious jealousy in Othello ; the fond and foolish tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral themes . " In Kea , a young writer , fancy and imagination took the lead , and Character , the great object of art , ftiils of its due representation . Had he lived longer , his full-fed and powerful fancy might perhaps have become the servant and instrument of a more elevated purpose . The victim of a too sensitive and fanciful passion , of which at last he died , he was equally the slave of an exacting muse-a muse not " married to , " but only mistress of " immortal verse . " In Shakspeare 's day , when as yet classical criticism was unknown , or at least unused , as we use it , an exuberant and humorous fancy might indulg* to excess , as in the " Venus and Adonis . " The rough and tender , the hitter and the sweet , might be poured out together , and let go . The stylus was seldom reversed . There was not then that " lascivious grace in which all ill well shows ; " there were no Byrons nor Moores ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety ; but there was a freedom , a rude liberty , and an cager appreciation of all excellence . By the fanciful exuberance of Shakspeare 's earlier style , Keats was attracted and overcome . // " One of the three books I have with me is Shakspeare 's poems , " he writes . " I never found so many beauties in the sonnets ; theyseem to be full of fine things said unintentionally-in the intensity *of working out conceits . Is this to be borne ? Hark ye : When lofty trees I see barren of leaves , Which erst from heat did canopy the head , And summer 's green all girded up in sheaves , Borne on the bier with white and bristly bead . ' He has left nothing to say about nothing or any thing . And as the snail , whose tender horns being hit , Shrinks back into his shelly cave with pain , And there all smothered up in shade doth sit , Long after , fearing to put forth again ; So at his bloody view her eyes are fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It is easy to discover that which attracted Keats in the early style of Shakspeare . Of beauty it has not a trace ; the picturing is even uncouth and repulsive . It is the enormous force , the rude strength and power of the imagery , the depth of light and shadow , that charm the critical as well as the ingenuous reader . Keats 's observations on the above lines , written in his twenty-second year , in a letter to a friend , are followed by some lines of his own composition , which imitate the manner he so much admires , and show plainly enough under what master he studied . The early poems of Shakspeare are often alluded to and quoted by the critics ; but it has not yet been distinctly noticed that they have exerted a more powerful influence than any others upon the lyrical poets of the last century . Coleridge , Keats , Charles Lamb , Tennyson , Hood , and many others , are deeply in their debt . The sonnets of Shakspeare , imperfect as they are , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from the Italian . The sonnet of Shakspeare is our own ; the model of a peculiar style , congenial to a proud and melancholy race . More than all other verse it expresses that profound love passion , which has no gallantry in its nature , but is as serious as life itself . That it is as essential to the beauty of a work of art , more especially a poetical one , to move the passion of love , as it is to its sublimity to excite that of terror , might be shown by a vast array of instances . Let any VOL . VIII . 1W . IV . 1*EW SERIES . passage of peculiar beauty be read over with an appreciative care , from any poet celebrated for the beauty of his sentiments . The expression of love will be found the great cause of the pleasure it confers . It may be the love of country , of home , of kindred , or of friends ; or it may be the passion which can exist only between the sexes : whatever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who insist that forms and sounds have a beauty of their own , independent of expression . These argue that the features of the Grecian sculpture owe their excellence to a sensuous beauty devoid of passion . We , on the other hand , affirm with Lord Byron , that passion is the soul of poetry , and add that there is nothing beautiful in art or nature , except as it is a language or a natural symbol of love . Of human beauty , the peculiar attribute is to move love in the beholder ; and if , in nature , there is any other species of beauty , it charms by resembling or at least by calling to mind those human traits of sweetness , grace , and harmony , which are proper to the gentle passion , and given to it by the Creator as its language and expression . How then is it , argue the sensuous critics , that a face in marble , to be beautiful , must be calm l A face , we answer , may indeed be calm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not then the essence of beauty . Madonnas and Christs are always calm , but they are full of passionate love . Nature has certain forms which represent , or they would not move , the tender passions . The artist discovers and depicts these forms . But there is more in this speculation than we shall succeed in expressing . The passions lie under the governance of certain moral powers : honor , pride , the love of praise , modesty , and oth*rs ; powers either pure or mixed fri their character . These wield the sceptre of the heart . The honorable man , it is said , regulates his passions , and keeps them in check , letting them out freely upon the right occasion , and observing all the rights and equalities of the heart , But honor is not the only power which regulates the conduct of the passions . Modesty and pride have also their full exercise . If the artist has attained a knowledge of those forms of face or language which express the passions ,  --  as love controlled and dignified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reached the summit of his art , and is a master of the BeautifuL As it is the peculiar function of the moral powers ( of which high art , whet her in poetry or in design , is the representer and delineator ) to subdue and calm the passions , without lessening them , or diverting them from their objects , the calmness of a marble , or the classic repose of a poem , is to be attributed to the presence of those powers , and not to a want of passion , nor to that feeble intellectualism which is unacquainted with any thing but manner and sentiment . As there is no grandeur nor dignity but that which reposes on subdued but obedient and ready passions , so there is no artistic beauty which does not owe its power to a concealed or latent power of love . It is necessary , in speaking of artistic pleasure , to exclude that kind which addresses only the sensual temperament , and which is gross and general , as good in one as another , and distinct from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of a Reason , an Individual , admirable in particular , and distinguished from all others . In these , as in perfect living men , the sensuous , the passionate , and the moral are so blent as to be undistinguishable . When we speak of the sublimity and beauty of a heroic character , we intend its superiority in possessing and subduing of terror and love ; inspiring at once awe and affection . The filial passion of a child is perhaps the most perfect instance in nature of love at once excited and subdued . The child at once loves and fears the parent , and these passions are controlled by the moral sentiment , and refined into veneration and sublime confidence . The just and kind parent is a sublime and at the same time an honored and beloved object to the child . Toward the idea of the Supreme Being , personified as a Parent , love ascends mingled with an awful fear . In the secret recesses of the soul , the subdued spirits of all the passions mingle in prayer . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble and almost hopeless effort ) of what is meant by the Sublime and the Beautiful in art , as the representer and expresser of the moods of the soul , it seems proper to speak briefly of the Fanciful , the Humorous , and the Satiric , in order not to seem forgetful of their existence , or their value . That what passes under the name of " fanciful , " in art , either in grotesques , or in the fictions of fairy land , should have any value in a moral point of view , may to some hasty critics seem even ridiculous to say ; and yet it is impossible to seize and enjoy the spirit of fairy , or of grotesque , without first being capable of what is serious . It is the sport of the superior nature , letting loose the passions , and observing their play . An Undine , a Gnome ,  --  what are these but intellect and passion , freed from the conscious governing spirit ? But is it possible for any but the conscious spirit itself to image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love fairy of the ancients , is the unreasoning , uncontrolled passion of love ; but what a force of genius is required to delineate the freaks and gambols of this immortal elf ! Boccaccio and Ovid stand unabashed in the presence of Shakspeare and of Milton . Byron and Burns , who have most faithfully delineated the passions which early tormented and sported with them , won for themselves a popularity which grave and philosophic versifiers sigh for in vain . That character , in other words , that the moral power , is directly the cause of Humor , and gives its entire value to the humorous , will be readily admitted , as it has been constantly asserted . It is frequently observed that native humor indicates a good heart . The frue humorist sports with the vanity or conceit of another , without wounding his feelings or exciting his anger . While it makes the folly apparent , it spares the man . It has no malignity . Humor , though not as rare an endowment as poetic genius , attracts almost equal admiration and respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities ,  --  moral insight and sympathy , pride of character , and self-possession . In Satire and the satiric , the moral is unquestionably the ruling power . It is only by tearing off the ve4l of hypocrisy , fashion , and false greatness , aud showing wickedness in form of weakness , that satire attains its end . It was the purpose of our remarks to show , not that passioa is the object of art , but passioa under control ; or rather , the presence of their controlling powers , under the several names of Pride , honor , Modesty , seen in the immediate kingdom of the heart . The passions will be expressed , and with their full intensity ; but this expression will be valued as it shows their mastering principles . // It seems strange , and almost ridiculous , to a critic of the present day , to ask at all , whether the moral enters into a work of art , in any shape ; so grossly have fiction and design degenerated from their ancient dignity . Time was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing nothing but a dream , related in a musical jingle of words , would have been passed over with neglect , as unworthy a second perusal . Although the fashion of condemning Pope *nd slighting Addison has been lately a prevailing one , it has insured the immortality of those authors , as it has of the Greek and Roman classics , that they wrote for moral end3 , and regarded their art as the handmaid of morals . But though high art demands a moral theme and purpose , to attain its immortality , the mere poetic passion makes no such demand , and even resents a purpose . The instruction of art is given to the heart , not to the head ; hut as the heart is of greater dignity than the head , the artist is superior in dignity to the artisan . Art is not understood , it is only felt ; and consequently , to those who have no feeling , the artist is an empty impostor . One can not reply to the question so often asked , " What is poetry 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea must be in us , or the image , when presented , will not remind us of any thing real . The critic must therefore suppose that readers already know " what poetry is , " at least as well , or better , than he does himself . He must suppose that a beautiful poem will produce effects of beauty in their imaginations , attended with a certain glow and enthusiasm which are proper to it , and belong to it alone . He takes it for granted that sublimity appears sublime ; that pathos moves their feelings ; that sentiment touches what is sentimental ; that grace meets a graceful appreciation ; that the laughable moves laughter , and the keen and witty are their own recommendations . Readers are before critics . In answering the question , " What is poetry ? , we attempt rather to please than to instruct ; for it is the purpose of poetry to charm , and not to instruct . It is impossible to show why we are pleased . I am pleased with the form of a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am instructed by being told that the diameters are equal , or that the vibrations divide each other without fractions . It may indeed satisfy my understanding to know this , but that is anotlPt kind of " pleasure . " The understanding is " pleased " when it is instructed ; the imagination when images of the beautiful and sublime are created in it . All that can be said , therefore , in answer to the question , " What is poetry 1 " is perhaps to separate the various causes of pleasure , the rhythm , the harmony , the imagery , the contrasts , the sublimity , the beauty . By dwelling sepaintely upon each of these , we attain at length to a more full and satisfactory appreciation of the whole . When a beautiful statue is first presented to the eye , it produces a faint sensation of delight ; but when , after many views , every minute elegance of feature and form has made its due impression , the separate beauties enter together into the mind , until they produce one feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are at first delighted with the melody of the verse , and then with the picturesqueness and passion of the language ; last of all , with the moral passion , to coin a new phrase , of the entire work . When these have been separately appreciated , the pleasure which we afterwards receive from the whole is of a kind incomparably superior in worth and duration to a first , hasty delight . Nature seems to have made some persons without poetic sympathy , or in whom it is exercised at such remote intervals , or so faintly , as to add nothing to their pleasures . Others , on the contrary , find poetry in every thing ; they can not listen to a fall of water , or the rustling of leaves , or the distant hum of cities , or any sound that has softness , monotony or sweetness , without a rise of the poetic sensation . When we speak of the poetic sensation , we do not mean that poetry is itself a sensation , nor the faculty of it merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sensation , so has poetry . It creates a pleasure in the sense which is distinguishable from every other pleasure . We distinguish the pleasure of music from the pleasure of poetry , although they are similar and closely allied ; but we find readers , and even composers of verse , in whom the delight in music is faint . An excellent poet may be hardly able to distinguish &amp; tune . That characteristic of poetry which hai , been set foremost by the critics , as the most admirable , and conveying the highest degree of pleasure , we commonly call granckur* // sublimity . It seems to be a rousing up of the soul , attended with intense emotions akin to fear . It carries a mixture of fear and of pride . It gives a momentary dignity to the interior nature , and brings it into fellowship with the vast and mysterious . It seems to be of nearer kin to , and in closer alliance with , the immortal and rational emotions of the soul , than any other movement of intelligence . Much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is akin to that of heroism . In passages of the most ancient poetry , quoted for their sublimity , there is an expression of the divinity and dignity of the interior nature , an elevation of the soul toward the creative Source , conferring a sublime pleasure . The most terrible subjects and images are chosen and touched with freedom by the poets of the Sublime . Nature is set at defiance ; destiny alone is awful . The creative Power is appealed to in a vein of companionship . The spirit of man acknowledges nothing that can daunt or suppress it . It descends into hell , unappalled among eternal fires ; it ascends into heaven , gazing with clear eyes upon the glory of God . It pervades the abysses of the universe , and carries passion and pride into the movements of the spheres . It personifies the sun and the stars . The sun speaks , and there is a music for his motion . The powers of earth and nature converse with it as with their master . It images to itself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks forward and onward toward the end , fancying to itself the intonations of the Creator on the seat of judgment . Into all things this soaring ardor carries tremulous emotions of fear ; not the crouching terror of the flesh , but a fear acknowledged only while it is conquered . The poet need not therefore explain his choice of such images . It is the glory of 1*ds art , that over extreme and depressing fear he is able to induce a something which quells it ; and the pleasure of this is like the pleasure of controlling a powerful and dangerous steed . The superior nature grasps the reins of its own terror , and moves resolute and charmed through the terrors of death and hell . So much then for the pleasure of the Sublime ; it is the pleasure of superior natures , and akin to pride . As a proof , let us observe that poets of the Sublime have been remarkable for pride . Mere pomp and vastness of expression is distinguished from sublimity , by observing that in one the element of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotony and expansion . Poetry which describes what is merely large and extended , may have nothing of the sublime , because it moves no terror . Fine-sounding verses , without passion , are not sublime , though they convey pictures of the universe . Lord Byron was wont to insist that poetry was passion : he meant , perhaps , that there was no poetry without passion ; and we are sure of being right when we say that there is no poetic sublimity without the passion of terror , as there is no poetic beauty without that of love . But how does it happen that two persons equally susceptible to poetry will be differently affected by the same verse ; one having the passion of sublimity , the other no passion at all ? Before attempting to answer , we may observe , first , that we never hear of a discovery of sublimity without beauty by one person , and of beauty without sublimity , in the same verse , by another . If the imagery is sublime , its effect , if felt , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uo sensation of terror , it will never awaken a sublime emotion . But as the faculty of sublime is not always active in the reader , it will not always , produce its effect ; and if his heart be unsusceptible and dry , he will perceive nothing of beauty , even though beauty be expressed . Among all the controversies of critics , we have never yet seen one which made a question whether sublimity alone , or beauty alone , should be attributed to the same poem or verse . The two qualities may exist together , and the same verse be sublime and beautiful at once , having in it the power both of love and of fear ; but the passions and their languages are distinct , and ought not to be confounded together . Those phenomena hf nature which discover immense and uncontrolled powers awaken the simple passion terror in minds not gifted with sublimity ; but to the sublime imagination , whatever has an incalculable weight and stability ,  --  the interminable , that which moves with an irresistible force ,  --  whatever* in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powers compared with which the physical force of man himself is trifling and ineffectual , raises images of sublimity .. There is sublimity in the echo of a cannon , reverberating among mountains ; in the motion of a steam car , or of a great ship mov* // 1851 . The " Hyperion " of John Keate. ing before a strong wind ; there is sublimity in the movements of vast bodies of men , when they seem to be informed with a common purpose . The sublime carries with it a feeling of the mysterious . The majesty of oratory awakens a sublime emotion in which the uncertain and mysterious largely prevail . We feel in the speaker himself a power , a consciousness and a confidence , which overwhelms while it elevates . For the production of great and continuous sublimity and beauty , there is needed a quality of intellect akin to obstinacy we should perhaps have said , rather , a quality of intelligence , of the active and impulsive , and not of the gubernatorial faculties . If not a quality , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , ( psychology being a science uncultivated in our language , ) to which we are obliged to give the name " concentrativeness , " invented by the phrenologists . The brokenness and want of continuity of Keats may perhaps be attributed to a want or weakness of this faculty ; a deficiency which no cultivation could fully compensate , whose want excludes the artist from the epic and dramatic circles , restricting the efforts of his genius within the sphere of lyric and essay . While the fit is on him , he is able to give unity to his work ; but he can not recover the mood . The faculty of *oaring is denied him ; his flights , though powerful , are brief and swooping ;  --  a quality excellent only for a wit , a song-writer , a story-teller , or a humorist . It is said by those who have read the epic of Petrarob , that it is deficient in every quality of an epic . It may have been a deficiency of the kind which we have described , which limited this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may have been the same deficiency , or rather the consciousness of it , which restrained Boccaccio from any fiction of magnitude . In a fiction of three pages , Boccaccio has no rival ; in a fiction of twenty , he fatigues the reader : the shorter the story , the better it is told . The fire is intense , but it burns only for a moment . Was there not a similar deficiency , natural and inherent , in the greatest of the German poets , Goethe ? In a chapter of cool advice to the young poets of Germany , he forbids the undertaking of long works ; for xvise reasons , perhaps , he restricted himself ; and his reputation rests rather upon lyrical passages , brief essays , full of pith and observation , and satisfying to the intellect . In his larger works , want of unity detracts from their dignity and value as works of art . It has been said of him , that though a " lawgiver of art , he was not an artist ; 77* and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mignon , or composed the drama of Iphigenia ? " Was it that he knew too much , that his sight was microscopic and interfered with the just perspective , the seeing of the whole l " * Clearly not ; but that he lacked concentration ; for if the possession of the microscopic eye were inconsistent with that of the higher artistic faculties , what shall we say of Shakspeare , Aristophanes , Swift , Homer , in whom unity of design and singleness of purpose are traits as conspicuous as any other proper to the artistic mind ? " He is fragmentary - a writer of occasional poems . " Yes ; and these poems , at least the best of them , have an undeniable unity . " When he sits down to write a drama or a tale , he collects and sorts his observations , and combines them into a body , as fitly as he can . " But , with an utter deficiency of the artistic power , he could not have collected his observations ; lie could see their fitness , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could build the sacrificial pile , but he could not set fire to it . His nature was cold , and the quality of concentrativeness is a quality of heat , and lies on the side of passion . The man who is devoid of it will not only produce no long works of art , but he will have no life friendships nor enmities . Warm for the moment , his fire is soon out ; he is sentimental and fickle ; he is versatile , not so much from the plasticity and variety of his intellect , as from a natural coldness and shallowness of feeling ; he is skeptical , not so much from a want of insight , as from observing in himself The incessant change and fluctuation of his own feelings ; and learning to despise this weakness in himself , he mistakes it for a weakness of all humanity . To return to the subject of our article . It is not easy to determine whether in Keats the interruptedness and want of unity arose more from a physical or an intellectual weakness . Feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passions devoured the strength of his body ; and as we observe in his later * Emerson , Representative Men , p*ge 282. * Id . // works a unity which the earlier do not show , it may have been in him a defect more of the flesh than of the spirit ; and as a token of this , we observe in all his works a most absolute unity of feeling at least : the quality is even , the texture only broken ; the pursuit is steady , but the limbs are weak . He needed , it may be , only the ripening and solidifying influence of health and experience . After every minor difficulty has been surmounted by the artist , the taste cultivated , expression abounding , imagery at command , knowledge full and serviceable , the field and the limit of genius ascertained , the greatest of all remains yet to be overcome ; and that is , the choice of subject . If his genius is epical , but one theme will occur to him in the entire course of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fitness attending it , it may be undertaken too early , or at an unseasonable time , and its weight may kill the author ; or it may never rise before him until he has become so far engaged in the business of life , there is no leisure left . The conjunction of four planets is hardly more rare than the fortunate conjunction of time , subject , circumstance , preparation , and ability for the work . That it should kill its author does not seem at all surprising ; for of all passions that afflict humanity , that of poetic renown is the most consuming and invincible . A great genius , failing in youth under the burden of an immortal design , is an object most pathetic , most touching , and we dare say , most venerable . The passion that actuates and consumes him is a desire for the love , not of one person , but of all mankind , of all futurity . There is in him no scorn of humanity , but the most exalted regard ; he falls a victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eternal passion . It is no shallow vanity that spurs him ; he is content with a present obscurity in exchange for a lasting renown . His desire is to please all mankind , and while ho pleases , while he fascinates , to elevate and to calm . He is , in a strict sense , the prophet , or rather the illustrator and the expounder of the beauty and the harmony of the universe ; and not only of the beauty and the harmony , but of the eternal sweetness , of which individual lovo is but a spark . Is he not , then , in a peculiar and sublime sense , a favorite with the creative Power ? And as such , ought we not seriously , and apart from all sentiment , to respect and honor him in his vocation ?
