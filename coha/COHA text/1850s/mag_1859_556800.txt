txt ART . II . - Report of the Trustees of the Massachusetts General Hospital for the Year 1858 . Boston . 1859 . THIS valuable report on the history and condition of the McLean Asylum for the Insane for the year 1858 derives a peculiar importance from the few pages which the Superintendent devotes to the causes of insanity , so far as they were developed and affected by the peculiar circumstances of the year , and were connected with the recent financial crisis and the religious excitements of that period . Dr. Tyler discourses wisely upon these matters , and gives admonitions which , were they heeded , would save many from mental disturbance and more from mental death . To all things created and grown there are fixed laws and conditions of being and action . To every living organism , whether animal or vegetable , as equally to dead machinery and structures , there is assigned a definite purpose or function , which it is appointed to fulfil or discharge . If it be properly constructed , its parts or elements suitably arranged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each performs its own work , or bears its own burden . But neither their structure , nor their organization , nor their strength , will permit them to be applied to any other purpose , or to perform any other work , or to bear any other or greater burden , than those which are appointed for them , without suffering or injury . No // machine is strong enough to escape this law ; no vehicle or utensil is rude or coarse enough to be exempt from these conditions . The carriage intended for passengers is impaired , if it be used for freight ; the merchandise wagon is injured , if it be loaded with coals . All kinds of vehicles , the lightest pleasure-gig as well as the heaviest dray or stone-cart , are weakened and loosened in their joints , and perhaps broken , if they are made to carry weights , even of their proper kinds , greater than they are intended to bear . The cotton-carding machine does its appropriate work well and without injury . But if wool , or flax , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon out of order , and perhaps broken . This law as td the appropriate use of all material things , machinery , vehicles , vessels , and utensils , is universally recognized and respected , and no discreet workman or cautious manager ever presumes to disregard it . The same law is immovably imposed upon everything endowed with life ; upon all animal organs , all that perform the living operations ,  --  the stomach , the muscles , the brain , the nervous system , and even the moral and mental powers , the passions and the affections . Each having its distinct functions to perform and purposes to fulfil , its structure , organization , and endowments are adapted to them . It is supplied with means and stii*ngth sufficient for these , and no other . Therefore , in the use of the machinery of life , as well as of that created by human hands , all violations of its conditions of being , all transgressions of the limit of power or the restricted sphere of action , are necessarily followed by injury and disorder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among every people , this has been shown , by the large proportion of functional disorders , organic diseases , and even general physical derangements , which come upon humanity from the misapplication of the power of some of the organs , or from the excessive expenditure of their strength by over-exertion . Dyspepsia , with its many phases , is produced in great part by the misuses and abuses of the stomach and digestive system , by errors in the selection of food or mistakes in the quantity that is consumed , or by the neglect of other essential conditions of nutrition . Some of the diseases of the locomotive apparatus arise from violations of the conditions of their being , 27 * // and of the law appointed for their action . If the muscles are applied to purposes not assigned to them , or exercised beyond their strength , they inevitably suffer , and may be weakened or disordered . The brain is subject to similar conditions of life and laws of action . It is endowed with certain limited powers , which can be applied only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond its appointed bounds without danger , nor bear burdens exceeding its strength without suffering , nor labor beyond its accustomed energy without weariness . The mind , while on earth , is necessarily connected with the animal body , by means of the brain ; for that is the essential and only agent of all its operations . So long as the immaterial spirit is inseparably associated with the material substance , all its powers of action and endurance are in exact correspondence with those of the physical organ ; its strength to labor , its energy , and its range of application , are those which the brain admits , and no more . It is affected by the infirmities and the liabilities of that part of our frame . Considering , then , this intimate connection of the mind with the brain , in its strength and weakness , in its health and sickness , it is reasonable to assume and to speak of cerebral health and cerebral disease as indications of corresponding conditions of the mind . The brain has several functions to perform . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mental operations ; it is also the . organ of feeling and emotion , of passion , anxiety , and suffering . It superintends the operations of the body . It supplies the several parts with the stimulus of life and action . It seems to be a storehouse of nervous energy , a part of which is used to fulfil and sustain mental and emotional purposes , and a part is distributed to the several organs of the material frame , and enables them to perform their respective functions . There is sufficient nervous energy in this storehouse to sustain all the other organs in the performance of their several duties , and the mind in doing its own work , and also to quicken all the moral affections , the healthy emotions and passions , the natural appetites and propensities . There is enough for the life and action of all . Each can draw its due proportion from the brain ; but none can safely have more , for the supply is // limited . If any one takes more than its due share , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less life and less active force ; they perform their functions feebly , and perhaps some may be suspended . This is a common occurrence , and probably familiar to all . When one eats food that is hard of digestion , or takes a fuller meal than the stomach can master at once , with its usual force , it makes a demand upon the brain for more than its own share of nervous energy to sustain it in its extraordinary work , and consequently less than the due proportion can be given to the other organs or functions . They then act languidly ; muscular labor is difficult , the brain refuses to think , or thinks feebly , the whole system craves rest , and perhaps sleep , while the stomach is getting through its excessive and difficult task . On the other hand , the action of the mind may be very powerful , and absorb the nervous energies to such a degree as to interfere with the physical operations . From this cause , deep grief , violent anger , intense anxiety , and other powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular exertions also diminish the freedom and fulness of the other functions . While one is running a race , or swinging a sledge-hammer , or working at a fire-engine , he can neither think , nor reason , nor talk upon grave subjects ; and the stomach also slackens in its ordinary work , because the muscles demand and use so large a proportion of the nervous energy that enough is not left to sustain the other organs in their usual labor . Nature has endowed all of the organs with their several powers , and given each its connection with the brain , for the purpose of action . It was not intended that any should pass its life in idleness , but that each should have its opportunity of exercise , both for its own strengthening and for the health of the others . When they are used in obedience to the law of their being , applied to their appropriate purposes , and exerted within their appointed limits , each does its own work easily and successfully , without interfering with the others , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the actions of life necessarily imply expenditure of force , and that must be in proportion to its intensity or its duration . Of course , in every case , some weakness or depression of strength // follows the exercise of every organ or power . In a healthy person , sufficient means are provided to sustain all appropriate actions , and to restore the force that has been expended . If we work moderately and appropriately with the limbs , they after a while become weary with action , and crave an opportunity to recruit their force . If rest be allowed them , they soon regain their power , and are then as strong as before , and ready for the renewal Gf labor . But if we work with more than our usual energy , if , for instance , the muscles are compelled to act long or violently , in lifting or straining , beyond their accustomed strength , they are exhausted , become weakened , and require a much longer period of rest to restore them . If these great and unfitting exertions are long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , that no amount of rest completely restores the strength . The muscular force is then permanently reduced , and the limbs are unable to do their previously accustomed work . The same results of over-action , weariness , exhaustion , and permanent weakness or disease , are manifested in the digestive organs . The stomach and the other parts of the nutritive apparatus are ordained to convert enough food into chyle to replenish the blood , and to supply it with the means of repairing the waste of the textures . When this organ is in good health , when the food is of a proper kind , and taken in due quantities and at suitable seasons , and all the other circumstances and conditions are properly attended to , the work of digestion goes on easily and satisfactorily , and the wants of the blood are supplied . But if the food be not of a suitable kind , if it be of improper material , if it be badly prepared , if the bread be heavy , if the meat be burned , if the mixture be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way , the food , after eating , be digested with difficulty , - the stomach labors , sometimes in pain , often in weariness , and is consequently fatigued , and perhaps all its strength is exhausted when its work is done . But unless there has been too great an expenditure of strength , it is regained by rest , and then the organ is ready , as before , to do its work . But when this labor is violent and excessive , the vigor is not all restored by rest , and the average or constant digestive power is reduced ; and if this exhaustive process is // 821 perseveringly repeated , the stomach is weakened more and more , until it performs its work only with difficulty and in pain , and sometimes fails entirely . Indigestion may be produced by manifold causes . Improper food , of any kind , bad cookery , eating rapidly , at unseasonable hours , or in excessive quantities , imperfect mastication , exhaustion of the nervous energies before eating , or occupation of these energies by great physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too intense study , care or anxiety , - anyone of these causes will diminish the gastric force , and , if long continued , will waste the powers of the stomach , and establish disease . It is not usual for any single cause to act alone and produce indigestion . More commonly two or more causes co-operate to effect the result . It is rare that a man is wise and faithful in all the duties of self-management but one , and in that alone indiscreet and careless . The student may combine excess of mental action with want of physical exercise and hasty eating . The man of business may allow too little time for his meals . He may carry to his table the burden of his commercial transactions upon his mind . He may be careless as to the food he takes . Regarding the convenience of his countinghouse rather than the necessities of nutrition , he may be irregular in the hours of eating . He may add to these errors night-suppers of food that disturbs , but does not strengthen him . In the affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband or child , the oppressive anxiety , the disregard of her own physical wants , carelessness or even forgetfulness of the hours of eating , absorbing thought at table , want of exercise , fresh air , and sleep , all may be brought to bear at the same time . Out of any one , or any number , or all of these , and other coexisting errors , dyspepsia may grow . It is therefore frequently difficult to refer a disordered or impaired stomach to any single cause , or to determine how much influence each of the several co-operating causes had in producing the disease or disturbance ; nor would it be philosophical to assume any one of these as the source whence any present gastric difficulty sprang . Yet it would be safe to say , that each of these coexisting facts or violations of the law of // self-management had its due weight in producing the disorder . The universal law of philosophy , that like causes produce like effects , applies with unvarying force to the management of life , and the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that any single cause , or combination of causes , will produce like consequences in all circumstances ; for these , differing among themselves , and having various kinds and degrees of influence , of course modify , sometimes by increasing and sometimes by diminishing , the effects which the causes tend to produce . Yet it is certain that like causes produce like effects in like constitutions , states of health , and circumstances . All the animal organs , and all the mental and moral powers that belong to humanity , come under this law . In all the living operations , cause and effect are inseparably connected . There can be no action of life , without its retribution of good or of evil . With every part of our frames , and every faculty and endowment , obedience to the conditions of being is necessarily followed by invigoration , growth , or comfort , and disobedience by disturbance , pain , or weakness ; and these consequences are in strict proportion to the faithfulness to , or the violation of , the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoyment , nor in the events of sickness and suffering . None of these arise or happen without adequate causes . A large proportion of these causes may be ascertained in the present state of science , and many of them are within the control of man , and may be prevented . Mental derangement and weakness , of every grade and every variety , are produced by errors in the use of the cerebral forces . Much learning is not necessarily a cause of madness ; for the strong and disciplined acquire it without suffering . They carry it gracefully , use it skilfully , and gather strength from it , while others fall in the endeavor to acquire it . Nor is a little learning , usually , a dangerous thing ; yet there are some to whom even this would be a burden not safely to be borne , for they can not assume it without sinking , or carry it without staggering . In the anterior history of some of the patients who are admitted // into the asylums for the insane , excessive study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Spiritualism , and the Scriptures , or great mental excitement from intense attention to business , care and anxiety , - all the varieties of undue mental application or inappropriate use of the cerebral forces , - are given as the causes of their disorder . In the Reports of eighteen American hospitals for the insane , which state the causes of the disorder of their patients as far as they were supposed to be known , one hundred and seventyfour kinds of events , habits , or circumstances connected with the misuses of the mind in the manifold varieties of mental action , application , and excitement , with the stimulating and the depressing emotions , hope , fear , grief , disappointment , and trouble , and with the malignant passions , are given as the causes of their malady . Among twelve thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight patients , the causes of whose insanity are stated , 22 . T per cent were connected with grief , disappointment , and other depressing emotions , 8.2 with excitements , anxieties , and depressions from religion , 6.9 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxieties , excitements , and losses , and 5.5 per cent from excess of mental action . These disturbances of mind are not due so much to the amount of the burdens which are assumed , for it is manifest that the large majority of those who gain both the greater and smaller degrees of learning , and sustain responsibilities of every kind , are sound in mind , and free from every mental obliquity . But they are due rather to the disproportion between the load imposed and the strength to bear it , between the natural and original vigor of mind , or the power developed and established by habitual labor , and the purpose which they attempt to accomplish . There is every grade of difference in men 's powers of mental labor and endurance , from him whose understanding comprehends only the simplest ideas and propositions , to the philosopher to whom the most abstruse propositions and their complications are but as child 's play , - from the servant or under-worker , who performs only the plainest processes , without thought , under the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of a nation , almost those of the world , with undisturbed energy , or the financier who passes through commercial revulsions and sustains his part with unruffled calmness . All of these , both the extremes and those between , are sound in mind ; but they have widely different powers of acquirement , of reason , of accomplishment , and of endurance , and it is plain that they must have equally various powers of sustaining themselves under any definite burdeii which may be thrown upon them . The same an*ount of study , responsibility , or care , which would be an unfelt trifle on one , would be a load on the mind of a second , would weary a third , exhaust a fourth , and break down a fifth . It is the want of correlation between the load and the strength of the bearer , between the acting force and the purpose to be effected , that is dangerous , and sometimes destructive . As in commerce , the extreme desire to make great and sudden gains by bold but injudicious means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , out of proportion to the capital invested or at command , frequently causes embarrassment , and ends in shipwreck of fortune ; so , in education and learning , the undue thirst for knowledge , or the prosecution of study with energy and earnestness disproportioned to the power of the brain and the mental capital , defeats its own purpose , and often ends in a wreck of the understanding , or a confused or weakened mind , instead of available acquirement and mental discipline . There is a common notion that the mind - the spiritual essence - has no law of limitation , no necessary relation to the corporeal structure , and a merely accidental , yet unwilling connection with the brain ; but that , on the contrary , it is endowed with infinite expansibility , so that there is no end to its power for labor , or its capacity of acquiring knowledge . The prevalent plans of education have this boundless object in view . Limitless development and acquirement are held out as possible , and no question is raised as to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the variety of subjects to which its powers may be applied . Whosoever believes that food may be taken merely to gratify appetite , without regard to his nutritive wants or digestive // powers , and that the sensual desire may be followed as a guide in respect to diet , - or that his stomach has an indefinite capacity , so that he may eat at any and all times , whenever his appetite may invite him to do so , and whatever it may crave , - is in great danger of being led into error in the selection of his food , and in the quantity he may consume ; and if his selfindulgence corresponds to his faith , he will not escape digestive derangement . It is equally certain , that the common belief that the mind will bear indefinite labor shuts men 's eyes to the impassable limit of cerebral force , and makes them forget that the mind can work only in connection with the brain . Nevertheless , in the education of early years , in the studies of maturer age , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private life , that involve the necessity of thought , calculation , and care , there is a frequent and even a general pressure upon the mental powers to the full extent of their endurance . From these causes , and from the frequent readiness of persons to endeavor to acquire a degree of knowledge which is great for them , to undertake responsibilities which are large for their mental strength , and to labor with their minds as vigorously as possible , and of course sometimes excessively , it necessarily follows that some must overwork their brains and exhaust their cerebral forces , and that some must become mentally disordered . Childhood commences its literary and educational life with the notion held out to it , that the mind will bear as much , and can accomplish as much , as it can be induced to attempt , and no thought is given to the brain , nor caution in regard to the use of its powers . Through the school years the same idea prevails ; the same boon of unbounded acquirement is offered to boys and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost efforts to go on in the path or join in the race of learning . The opinion that they may run in the pursuit of knowledge without danger , is almost universal ; and although only a few actually enter the heat of the contest , and strive to be among the foremost on the course , yet nearly all believe the doctrine , and few , perhaps none , are prevented from effort by any fear of injury to their cerebral health . The moderate but respectable scholar looks with envy or congratulation , rather // than pity , upon those who are overworking their brains in severe but successful study ; and these are held up by teachers and parents , by school-superintendents and the friends of education and human progress , as examples for the less active to follow . In this dangerous race of learning , to which all are invited and from which none are warned away , a comparatively small proportion of the children and youth of the schools , as we have said , enter and continue . The vis inertie of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for knowledge , the absence of motive for such vigorous and persevering mental exertion , the activity of other desires , not the fear of danger nor the wish to preserve the cerebral health , not due cautiousness but supposed idleness , not wisdom but imputed folly , prevents others from making the efforts of study that would be injurious to their brains . But the ambitious and the faithful , those who resolve to fulfil the hope of fond parents , and those who are susceptible of influence from teachers and associates , enter this course , and assume burdens which many of them can not safely bear ; and the plans of education , proposed by many zealous instructors , and adopted by many who are of authority in these matters , correspond , in a greater or less degree , with this willingness of parents and children to carry them out . In a High School now in our view , the teacher proposed to some of his pupils to study the Greek , Latin , French , and German languages , mathematics , grammar , rhetoric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan was accepted by scholars , approved by parents , and considered as an indication of lofty aim and praiseworthy energy on the part of an accomplished instructor . The pupils have in school seven or eight lessons a day . They are unwilling that the lessons should be short or imperfectly acquired . The brightest and most vigorous minds lead the way , and the others dislike to lag behind . They study earnestly at school in the dat , and their evenings at home are given to the same work of acquisition . They are successful in their endeavors to learn much , and are rewarded by the approbation of theif* own consciences , and by being recognized as an honor to the school , a joy to their friends , and the hope of the coming age . But it is plain that this high // mental action is already made at the cost of physical force ; for a more than usual pallor rests upon the faces , and a languor seems to pervade the physical frames , of these youths whose minds appear to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only such as are considered the best schools , such as include a larger proportion of the most ambitious scholars , who accomplish much in youth , and promise to do much more in mature life . But in most schools , there are some who study thus injuriously , and lay the foundation of mental habits which , in the business and competitions of the world , will tend very strongly to break them down . It must be admitted that there are not many who are made insane , or who even suffer any manifest impairment of mental health , during the ordinary period of pupilage in childhood and youth , by excessive study ; but as all are taught and imbued with the faith , that the mind , being spirit and not matter , is bound by no law of finite beings ,  --  that the highest and worthiest aims are to be accomplished by the greatest study , - that those who learn the most are certain to enjoy the warmest approbation of the wise and good , and the best success in life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the surest step toward the most desirable stations , and no voice of warning is lifted up to point out their danger , - it is natural and inevitable that many go away from school ready to apply their minds with the utmost intensity , and to work their brains with unsparing energy and inflexible perseverance , whenever an object sufficiently inviting or a motive strong enough shall present itself to them . These youths go forth to the world , and engage in its interests and affairs , with the same liability to overwork their cerebral powers as they would incur to overtax the powers of their stomach , if they had been taught that the more they ate the more strength would be given them , and the more ability to effect the objects of their being . They then enter upon and labor for their several pursuits with devotion and vigor , proportioned to the motives which their sense of duty , taste , ambition , or prospect of advantage may present to them , and their brains , like the digestive organs of the free liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by over-exertion . The consequences are alike in both // cases , because the causes are similar ; strength is wasted , and the regularity of action is disturbed . The strength of all the animal organs is partly original and inherent ; but , to a still greater degree , it is a matter of cultivation and development . The strength of the new-born infant is barely enough to enable it to breathe , to cry , and to move its limbs . By slow and gradual training , in progress of time , it grows to be sufficient to perform the labors of manhood . In all the successive stages of growth and maturity , the child , the youth , and the man can bear a burden precisely in proportion to the power that is developed , and no more . The child can roll about , the boy can play , the youth can do light work , and the man can perform hard labor without faltering , provided each has passed through the preceding and proper stages of training . In all these various stages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exertion , and all attempts to go beyond this not only fail of effecting their purposes , but exhaust the animal forces . Thus , the child can not do a man 's work , the student or the clerk or the tailor can not perform the labors of the farmer , nor can the inactive lady do the heavy drudgery of the robust servant-girl ; and yet , probably , by judicious and persevering training , by commencing with a degree of exertion suited to their present strength , and increasing it from time to time as their power increases , most persons belonging to the weaker classes might develop an amount of force sufficient to enable them to perform the heavier labors of the stronger and more active . By this means the student and the clerk may become farmers , and even stone-layers . But this is not the change of a moment . It is the result of slow growth , a gradual progress from weakness to power , produced by careful cultivation and cautious application of the forces as they are created . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each is larger than that which went before it , and opens the way for a still larger one to follow after . There is not only this general law of gradual development , by which the usual progress is made from the weakness of infancy to the strength of manhood , but there are special developments produced by special training , by the application // of the muscular system to particular purposes , whereby peculiarities of muscular force are established . Thus , the sailor has strong arms and comparatively weak legs ; the rope-dancer and the pedestrian have strong legs and comparatively weak arms . Each of these can do his own usual work without fatigue or exhaustion ; but they can not interchange ; the sailor can not walk with the pedestrian , nor can the walker or the dancer perform the labors of the seaman or the stone-cutter without suffering . The farm-laborer , who works in every variety of posture , uses all his limbs and muscles , in every kind of action , and is therefore endowed with strength in all parts of his locomotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth and habit . The food of the child and that of the man are very different , and neither would be sustained and made comfortable by that which is suitable for the other . Adults also differ in this respect , according to their different training . One enjoys and is sustained by one kind of diet , and another digests and is strengthened by another kind . The seaman 's fare would oppress the delicate scholar , whose diet in turn would be but a meagre support to the sailor . The digestive organs can be trained to new habits , and even to bear that which , in the beginning , is painful . The consumer of tobacco at first is nauseated by its use , while the old and practised chewer and smoker seems to suffer from the want of it . All the powers of life come under this law . They can not be exerted and applied , with their best success and greatest safety , except in ways in which they have been previously trained ; and all attempts to use them otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes by organic or functional derangement . This law of gradual growth and development is manifested in the bxaiu and the mind . The child learns his alphabet and reads his picture-book ; the man reads of the affairs of the world ; the philosopher studies the mysteries of nature ; and all comprehend their several subjects with the same ease , because each has that measure of cerebral power which enables him to work safely and successfully in his own way . The ordinary plans of education begin with the lowest and 28* // simplest elements , which demand only the slightest exertion of the perceptive faculties and the memory , and the least cerebral force , and proceed gradually from one step to another , requiring more and more action of the brain , and developing more and more of its power , so that , if judiciously arranged and pursued until maturity , they create sufficient mental energy to transact the usual business and discharge the common responsibilities of life . There is no employment which does not require some thought , some degree of self-direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . Most kinds of business which men manage on their own responsibility , and by which they obtain their support , necessitate some thought for their administration and execution . Every responsibility which any one assumes , every undertaking to accomplish any object , whether by his own exertions or by the instrumentality of others , is , to its extent , a burden upon the brain , the energies and power of which must be given to the work , as surely as the energy and power of the muscles must be given to any physical labor . Therefore , the management of any business or concerns , whether large or small , of general or of private nature , the administration of any affairs , whether simple or complicated , the discharge of the duties of public office , the responsibilities of high and important station , the control and the direction of other men 's actions for the execution of any purpose , the superintendence of the common labors of a farm , a manufacturing establishment , or even of a workshop , - all these necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , with sufficient original mental capacity , and appropriate education and training for the purpose , should assume any of these responsibilities , and give to it only the ordinary attention , at no time expending more mental force than has grown out of the power previously developed , he will discharge his duties easily and successfully , and go on in the even tenor of his way through life , without mental disturbance or exhaustion . But if the original or developed force be insufficient to meet the demands for mental action , difficulties must be encountered , and disturbance of mind will probably follow . Consequently , some men sink under their loads of care and anxiety , some are confused with the multiplicity and pressure of their responsibilities , and some become deranged. // Men sometimes leave their accustomed occupations , which required comparatively little mental exertion , or to which capacity , education , and long habit had adapted them , and engage in others which require much more thought and study . Although most persons may do this safely , yet the change is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders , when country traders on a small scale become city merchants on a large scale , when regular merchants become speculators , when any one goes out of an old and tried sphere of business and enters a new and untried one , which involves greater responsibility , he increases the pressure upon his brain ; and unless he has a well-disciplined mind , and is accustomed to severe labors , he incurs some risk of over-working and impairing his cerebral structure . This is especially the case with those who suddenly change their life from one of quiet ease and irresponsibleness to one of great excitement , labor , and duty . Some , unused to mental toil , float carelessly along the smooth stream of time , until , by a sudden turn of fortune or circumstance , they are placed in laborious positions or elevated to important offices , where the weight and care of business , and the necessity of producing results beyond their former experience and endeavors , press too heavily upon their powers of endurance . Sooner or later , they are found inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain themselves in their new relation without suffering . They expend more cerebral force than the brain can spare without wearing upon its strength , they overdraw upon their vital capital ; some break down in health , and some sink in death . Charles Fox , for many years , aimed at the Premiership of Great Britain . He was an active man in Parliament , but was not accustomed to assume great responsibilities , or to bear heavy burdens on his brain long and continuously . He had not exact and laborious habits of mind , and when he attained the object of his ambition , and was placed in the highest office , he found that it required a degree of mental discipline and a continuity of intense mental labor to which he had not been used , and which he could not sustain . In a short time he sank beneath the load , which overtasked his cerebral forces and overstrained his powers . // A much greater and more dangerous change of habit occurs , when one goes out of the track which he has trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which requires , not only a much greater degree , but an entirely different kind of cerebral action . When farmers , or mechanics , or laborers , who have been accustomed to work with their hands , and to exert their mental powers only sufficiently to direct their physical processes , suddenly and without proper training undertake to become scholars ; when they endeavor to dive into the mysteries of metaphysics , fathom the depths of philosophy , or solve intricate problems of mathematics ; when they give their minds intensely to these or to other kinds of study , whether of literature , science , morals , or theology , or when they enter the field of politics , or tread the mazy paths of law ,  --  when in any way they set the brain , which had been previously inactive , into vigorous action , or impose upon it new and large burdens out of proportion to its power , - there is danger of exhausting its forces , and of having the mind bewildered , and even disordered . New subjects of interest are occasionally presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention from individuals or the community . Religious doctrines , moral questions , political moVements , measures of reform , scientific matters , at certain seasons assume an unusual importance to the world , and to some they are of absorbing moment . This last class take hold of them with earnestness , and pursue them even with vehement zeal . They give their minds and their hearts to them , and endeavor with intense application , to understand them . The more enthusiastic converts , desirous that their new doctrines should be believed by all , labor for their diffusion . They become propagandists , and embrace every opportunity to impress their views and their feelings upon others ; they talk , they lecture , they preach and they write , as long as their strength lasts . There is a degree of contagious influence connected with some of these matters , which encourages their diffusion and enlists many to engage in them , and even some to become devotees in their behalf . But while this community of interest increases the zeal of the votaries and their willingness even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does not increase their power of // cerebral action , or of enduring the weight which they taJ*e upon their miiids . Absorbed in their purpose , they are carried away by the sympathy of associates , and seem to think , that , as there is no apparent limit to the value of the subjects that engross them , there is also no measure to their power to study and to teach them . Any of the vital actions may be made so intensely powerful as to concentrate , within a short period , the energy that should have been expended through a long time , and to produce at once the mischief that is usually the slower growth , through months or years of continued over-exertion . One great excess in eating , a single surfeit , especially if the food be indigestible , as well as excessive , may oppress and disturb the stomach , and at once create and leave behind functional disorder , perhaps organic disease , that may be long protracted and difficult to be removed . A violent exertion of the muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the evil work of months of hard labor ; as when a porter takes upon his shoulders and attempts to carry double or treble his usual burden , or when one works with great violence on an engine at a fire , or in an amateur boat-race , or in a struggle for life . In these cases , a strain or weakness of the muscles and inipairment of the locomotive apparatus are sometimes produced , which are not easily removed and may remain permanently . So the brain , by intense excitement , or concentrated labor , becomes unbalanced , and its actions disturbed . In a state of overwhelming anxiety , in very deep study , in some overpowering effort of public speaking , in the almost agonizing excitement of some religious meeting , in the endeavor to fathom the infinite , to search into the mysteries of unseen worlds , to hold communion with spirits , in the absorbing interest of some kind or some stage of business , in a financial crisis or commercial panic , in a scene of gambling , in any great struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - in these conditions , and such as these , the mind is violently agitated , there is great exaltation of the feelings and powerful cerebral action , the brain is given up to the absorbing interest of the present subject , and , for the moment , its attention can not be diverted nor its energies directed at will , for the maddening power of the ruling idea or emotion controls all its // forces . This violently energetic action of the brain is never without danger . In some , the organ may be left merely in a state of fatigue , from which a period of rest will recover it ; in others it may be exhausted and indisposed to labor , for a considerable time ; and in others of a more delicate or weaker organization , or less mental discipline , this great agitation may leave the head disordered , and the mind deranged . The instances of insanity from this class of causes are manifold . They come from many a field whence other issues are expected . The religious revivals , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the exciting eloquence of some earnest and powerful preachers , have had their victims of disordered mind . In other and less hopeful circumstances , the brain loses its balance . In scenes of disaster , as shipwrecks , fires , railroad-crashes , steamboat-explosions , where distress and destruction are spread abroad , in dangers and threatened evils , when men are crusbed down with overwhelming apprehension , many lose their self-control , and become bewildered . Their reason is , for the time , overthrown ; and although most regain their self-possession when the trouble and the peril are over , yet in others the confusion remains , and in some mental derangement is established . Among those who think that they can avail themselves of animal magnetism to search into things not revealed , who believe themselves endowed with power to perceive what human eyes can not see , who profess to be mediums between the spirits of the departed and the minds of the living , or who endeavor to hold communication with dead men 's souls , especially among those who associate together for any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual sympathy and encouragement , there is necessarily much unnatural and unhealthy excitement , the brains of many are agitated beyond their power of healthy endurance , and of these some become insane . In like manner , the brain is overworked in the zealous pursuit of public objects . Some give themselves up to the interests and labor of a political campaign . They rush to the contest with all their heart and their intellect ; they think of little beside , and care for nothing else ; they come to believe and act as if the great interests of the world hung upon the issue of the . // struggle then going on ; their nights and their days are devoted to effecting this great object , their brains are overwrought , their minds know no rest , they are agitated beyond due measure , and their mental health is in danger of suffering from these destructive influences . In national revolutions , the same absorbing excitement lays hold upon people , and grapples them with more power than in political struggles ; for here is more to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears and exhilarating hopes , and the brain is oppressed with the doubt of the issue and the endeavor to make it successful . Many are disturbed by this state , some sink under it . In some severe commercial crises , when great prosperity is followed by great adversity , in the transition from supposed and apparent wealth to real bankruptcy , when men struggle to save themselves from sinking , and all their cerebral forces are bent upon their own safety , in doubts , fears , and despair , the mind may wander , the brain lose its balance and become disordered . In public manias , when the world runs mad after great phantoms , as in the South Sea Bubble and Law 's magnificent scheme , in lottery-dealing , in land speculations , in these and such as these , the brain is unnaturally excited and agitated . For the time , men lose their ordinary principles of reasoning , they believe too much where their feelings prompt , and too little where their feelings oppose , and their mental balance is suspended , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or strong , will be broken down by a weight , if thrown upon it with precipitate violence , which it would have borne and carried , if carefully placed upon it . Any sudden interruption of action always gives a shock to , and often injures , a body in motion , and the injury is in proportion to the velocity of the arrested movement . Thus , when a stone falls among the rapidly moving wheels of a fixed machine , or when a railway train runs swiftly upon an obstacle , the wheels and the engine , the frame and the cars , are injured , and may be destroyed , by the violence of the shock . Likewise , when any one running at his utmost speed strikes against a wall , he is sure to receive a severe blow upon the part which meets the obstacle , a shock to his whole frame , and perhaps serious injury . In the same manner , in any sud // den interruption to the mental actions or the emotions in a high state of excitement , as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , or when one is disappointed in love , in ambition , or in the confident anticipation of fortune or success , there is depression and disturbance . Likewise , when any unexpected burden is thrown at once upon the brain , as when terrible danger , whether real or imagined , suddenly presents itself and causes fright , or when distressing tidings are communicated , as of the death of friends who were supposed to be in good health , or of some other great calamity which had not been anticipated , the violent sorrow sometimes leaves the mental actions in a state of protracted or permanent disorder . In these cases , the mental disturbance comes not from the weight of the distress , but from the suddenness of the impression . Its swift impulse gives it power more than its due . Whereas if the brain had been prepared by anticipation for the painful event , if the mourners had watched over their friend through days and weeks of sickness , and the catastrophe had been foreseen and expected , if death had visibly approached , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ready to meet the affliction , if not with less sorrow , at least with greater power to bear it , and the mind would not have been overthrown . From errors in the use of both the physical and the intellectual powers there proceed all grades of disorder , from the slightest languor or irregularity to positive and severe exhaustion and disease . All the organs and their functions are subject to these gradations of disturbance , and none more than the digestive and the nervous systems . The Prota*an forms of dyspepsia , almost infinitely varied , and their numberless degrees of intensity , are equalled by the manifold phases and degrees of mental unsoundness and perversity . Between the well-balanced and healthy mind and recognized insanity , there is a broad middle ground which neither occupies exclusively , but in every part of which the elements of both , in various proportions and complications , may be found . Here is every grade of mental obliquity and defect , resulting from perversion , or excessive labor , or neglect . Between the mind of average power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of weakness , - the dull , the simple , and the imbecile . Between intellectual soundness and mania , there are all the varieties and degrees of vagary , perversity , and disproportioned and inharmonious qualities and powers . In some , one faculty or element is too active or too sluggish , and in others a different one is exuberant , or comparatively or positively dormant . Some are unbalanced , some are easily excited or disturbed , others are passionate ; some , without ordinary motive or reason , adopt new opinions , or engage in new projects ; others are odd , eccentric , whimsical , or capricious . In the formation of their principles , and in the conduct of their lives , some are governed by their impulses or by their first impressions rather than by reflection or reason . Some are volatile in their habits , fickle in their affections , untrustworthy in their judgment , wild in forming their schemes , or unstable in the execution of their plans . Others are victims of indecision of character , and come to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reach them at all . Some lack firmness of purpose , and are irresolute in action . Others , on the contrary , are wilful and obstinate , and adhere to opinions and purposes once adopted , whatever new reasons or circumstances may be presented for a different course . In some , self-esteem is so large and powerful as to make them disregard the usual common sense of mankind , and to prevent their harmonizing with their fellows and profiting by the wisdom of the world . Through all these and many others there runs a vein of unsoundness , of greater or less extent , due to the measure of the misappropriation of their cerebral forces , the mistakes in the use of their mental and moral powers , and their indulgence in , and cultivation of , unhealthy and perverse habits of mind or of action . As in the administration of financial affairs every wrong appropriation of funds or credit , every wrong purchase or sale , is attended with loss , and every excess of expenditure , however small , over the income , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the management of life and its powers , every waste through misappropriation of vital force , however slight , every over-draft and excess of expenditure , is charged to vital capital . // In both business and life the consequences of repeated errors , of the waste or loss of money and of living power , are cumulative . The effect of each , be it ever so small , is added to that of the preceding , and the loss , injury , or impairment gathers weight with each successive transgression . This accumulation of weakness , or disorder , is often very slow and imperceptible in its progress , and it may be long before the evil is recognized . A man may indulge his appetite with food of such kinds , or in such quantities , as require but a little more than his usual and average digestive power to convert it into chyle . He may repeat this through months , perhaps through years , before the over-draft upon his gastric force produces a sensible weakness or pain , and even then the cause of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated disorder are overlooked ; for it is not easy to understand or believe , that an article of diet or gastronomic indulgence , which had been so long not only harmless , but , on the contrary , comfortable , should at length become injurious . A man may labor daily somewhat beyond his average muscular strength , and yet make so small an inroad upon his constitutional vigor , and so small an excess in the expenditure of force , that it may be years before he becomes conscious of the depreciation of power ; but the effect of persevering waste ultimately manifests itself , and if not then arrested by change of habit and more moderate exertion , the waste goes on , and the weakness increases , until decrepitude is prematurely established . The same law holds in regard to the brain . It is seen in the growing effect of repeated waste and perversion of the cerebral forces , in the increasing consequences of continued neglect or misuse of the moral and intellectual powers . The evil result of each individual error may be extremely small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged to , and deducted from , the mental capital , and all of the same kind that come after are added to those that have gone before , until their accumulated weight becomes manifest in some weakness , or fixed peculiarity or perversity , or even grave disease of the mind . Any error or mistake in self-management once committed , opens the way for another of the same character to follow , more easily ; and the consequent loss of power lessens the means of // resistance . The temptation and the facility of commission increase , while the protective and recuperative force diminishes with the repetition . Whoever allows in himself any excessive expenditure or misappropriation of mental force , or any indulgence in passion , caprice , oddity , impulse , or perversity , and takes but a single step from the path of discipline , propriety , or reason , finds the second step easier than the first , the third easier than the second , and each succeeding one less difficult than that which went before . Whatever of wrong or loss is established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and the third , and this , if not resisted , may go on , slowly but surely , until it becomes strong enough to influence , perhaps to control , the mental actions of the emotions . Whatever any one may sow within himself , whether it be good or whether it be evil , will grow almost insensibly , by repeated indnlgence and persevering cultivation , and sooner or later become , in greater or less degree , an element of his character . Ever-watchful Nature , although generous in her provisions for and bountiful in her gifts to her children , is yet inflexibly just and rigorous in her dealings with them . She requires of every one the complete fulfilment of the conditions of life . She gives to each his due and sure reward for every instance of faithfulness , and exacts from each the penalty corresponding to every disobedience , in the use of all the organs , and all the powers , whether of body or of mind , that are bestowed upon man . There is no forgiveness in these matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gathered , in every instance , and charged to the vital capital ; and their sum , in every succeeding period , may be found , according to its extent , in mental or physical disorder , in reduction of strength , in the vitiated constitution .
