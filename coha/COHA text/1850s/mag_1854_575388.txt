POETS . FROM AN ARTIST 'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY . By Charles Akers . SOMETIME in 7865 I was asked to visit at Cambridge by Mr. Lowell . I was somewhat younger than my years and scarcely realized the value of association . " If youth but knew " ; but it never knows till it is too late . However , I made my visit , and went back to Portland with a more cheerful view of men and things , applying myself to the work of modeling portrait busts and medallions . Then , in i866 , came the great fire , which , in one wild night , destroyed all the business part of the city and changed the fate of many individuals and families . All my possessions were burned , most of my " commissions repudiated or forgotten , and I found myself in rather forlorn condition , - nobody caring to dally with the fine arts in the fierce activity which sprang up to rebuild and restore . Directly I received a most kind invitation from Mr. Lowell to revisit Cambridge . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , off and on , for some months : I should say I was allowed and hospitably entreated to make Elmwood my base of attack , in my desire to portray some notabilities and earn a living . Mr. Lowell even drew up the plan of operations , and sent me hither and thither . with introduction to whomsoever he thought would aid me . So I set to work with new hope , and modeled and cast in bronze , life-size relievi of a number of distinguished personages ,  --  Mr. Lowell , Professor Norton , Longfellow , Emerson , Holmes , S. W. Rowse and others . A sketch of the reception given by these men to a bothersome stranger , whom they could aid but who was little likely to repay , can not 4p add to the knowledge of what they did , but may help to realize what they were . I should scarcely have ventured to ask a sitting from any one of these celebrities without Mr. Lowell 's backing . He did nothing by halves . He chose to admit me to ' intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fixed and wonted member of the household . The destruction of my goods and hopes in Portland had not been the greatest of my misfortunes ; and in my youthful cynicism I had come to look upon life itself as rather a calamity . I took myself very seriously indeed . But Mr. Lowell made no such mistake . He dubbed me the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance , and so chaffed and baited me that I became cheerful in self-defence . As I was to attempt a likeness of my host , I began at once to study externals , and was surprised to find him so young in appearance and manner . His fair complexion and long , curling brown hair , parted in the middle , gave an impression of youth , which the rather heavy red moustache and beard could scarcely abate . Yet sometimes , when intent in thought , youthvanished , and he had the look of the bust of Homer ; - a difficult subject , I soon found , for an immature artist . He had as many moods as a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell ? He was quite ready to reveal himself , - but there were so many of him ! He was as full of change asakaleidoscope . The evening of my arrival , with Mrs. Lowell we took a stroll about the town in the twilight . He was in high spirits , and , as we were // 447 passing through an unfrequented lane , he jumped up on the wall and began to crow lustily in furtherance of some ridiculous narrative , when unluckily a group of students came around the corner , seeing whom he instantly stiffened into the solemn professor of belles lettres , returning the salute of the astonished youth with immense gravity . His fooling was irresistible . At table he was as good as a company of players , and was wont to declaim and narrate , sometimes in broadest Yankee dialect , till laughter became a fatigue . Tie produced startling effects of an operatic character , with grotesque accompaniment on an imaginary keyboard . One of his favorite themes , I remember , was Moses in the Buirushes , with lofty recitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had periods of depression , but he did not bestow his sadness upon those about him . He liked to be silent and alone at intervals , as one must who creates ; but I never knew him to ( leny himself to a visitor . In the study he had the air of laziness - he read and smoked ; and after dinner ( the Cambridge half-past two o'clock dinner ) he played " California Jack " with his daughter . His habit of writing was very irregular . I have seen him finish an important paper at galloping speed , with the printefs devil waiting in the hall . I suppose the putting of pen to paper was an insignificant part of his day 's work . His brain was so thoroughly furnished that his problem was what to avoid setting down . He was very conservative regarding his surroundings . After several years ' absence , I called on him and , noticing in the study that the furniture , the books , the big owl on the desk , the knick-knacks , were all placed just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much here . " " No , " he said , " and they wo n't while I am here . " He was quite fastidious in person and dress , always clothed in the simplest and best manner . With the conceit of provincial youth , I chose to disregard something of the prevailing fashion in dress and substitute some of my own notions . This kind of individuality he ridiculed , and said it was modest and proper to dress just as other people did . His taste in these matters was unexceptionable . To be sure , he wore his hair longer than the mode , but that was less noticeable then than now . He also defended the common social conventions , and demanded their nice observance upon occasion . I remember that a student called one morning , wearing his slippers ; he never repeated the offence . Another novice ventured to pare his nails in class , - when the professor reminded him that a gentleman 's chamber was the proper place for his toilet . Such admonition was beneficent , and so conceived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was entirely unfettered* in his intercourse with his friends . The gulf between the familiar , playful Lowell and the Lowell of the general was wide and deep , but he could cross it in an instant . He well knew where confidence might be misplaced ; and , I think , even with his great generosity , he makes few mistakes in choice of association . In such choice he was not restricted by prejudice of class . Patrician in outward habit as he seemed , he was in thought and belief the most robust of democrats . Mr. Lowell had little time for the making of money . He often called himself a spendthrift ; but it seemed to me that he had few luxuries and gave more freely than he spent . He was very shy of any kind of debt or obligation , loving independence in small things as well as great . Even when absorbed in work , he would not allow anyone to go upstairs for a needed book of reference , and called Mrs. Lowell to testify that he sent nobody on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befriended setit him a fine aquarelle as a gift . Mr. Lowell admired the picture very much , but said he really could not accept it , and prepared to return it with a kind note . T remonstrated , giving my // view that it was , in fact , an opportunity of doing a kindness , - that the artist was probably sensitive , and might be much hurt by the refusal of his present . We had a lively wrangle , and at last he looked at me with a queer twinkle in his gray eyes and said : " Wo n't you leave me a shred of self-respect ? " He kept the picture , but , I have little doubt , got rid in some way of his sense of obligation . Although the poet was in those days something of a recluse , he had as keen a love of outdoors as any backwoodsman . We took long walks in every direction except cityward , and , whether hewas grave orgay , Jwas sure of much entertainment . In his serious moods he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it may be praise of the man to note that he was no monologist , - that he gave me a fair opportunity to display my crude enthusiasms , applying some severity of speech when he apprehended weakness of logic or character . Always a charming companion , he was very free and candid in revealing himself . If his teaching sometimes was a little humiliating , he was so generous as to be equally unsparing in speaking of himself . His talk was bristling with witty allusions ; and I remember that he used very little verbal quotation , excepting sometimes from Scripture , with which , the older writings , he was always ready . He remarked that his memory for words and phrases was bad ; and this is perhaps not surprising in a mind so crowded with store of literature . I have never known any other so rich and facile in imagination as he : he was young , he was old , he was Greek , or Roman or Spaniard , he dwelt in any land and consorted with his friend of any century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . His exuberant fancy was even more apparent in his talk than in his books ; and I think few printed pages contain more wealth of allusion than his . When a new volume of prose appeared , Mr. Emerson told me that he was " always amazed at Lowell 's art . " This struck me as not particularly graphic ; though , to be sure , he had art , which an Emerson might admire . So wide a traveler in the realm of fancy might well love home and be there content . Lowell 's attachment to Elmwood was so strong as to be almost a non**American trait . The house , a large and simple specimen of colonial building , half hidden from the road by foliage , had been used as a hospital sometime during our first dispcite with the mother country . What a ground of vantage for the poet ! There were great elms and a grove of pines . He knew the habits of every bird that haunted the trees . The domestic beasts and fowls gave him as much pleasure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he was constantly promoting himself . . I remember how proud he was of an immense home-raised turkey which loomed on the board when Dickens came to supper , - a genuine triumph over the Britisher . I have a picture of the " farmer " seated in great landed state at the base of an elm ; it is signed , " 0 . W. Holmes , phot. , 1864 . " Home to Lowell meant more than to the many . He watched its interests carefully , and was so fond of every stick and stone of it that I often wonder how hf forced himself to leave it for the alien surroundings of Madrid . But I can not say his attachment to the soil made him a good practical overseer . He used to laugh at his lack of thrift , and his occasional parade of an extreme economy was the more funny . I have seen him ply the bellows for a quarter of an hour to get a " raw " on an elm log , rather than strike a match , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing could be more absurd . Once , when Mrs. Lowell had entrusted him with the morning 's marketing and he had forgotten it , he entered into a long and elaborate defence of himself as a " family man , " asserting that such distinction was his chief aim in life and that he confidently expected the inNEW // ENGLAND POETS . scription on his headstone should be : " He was a good Provider . " A day or two after my arrival , Mr. Lowell took me to call upon Longfellow , and it so chanced that we met the neighbor poet at his gate , and I was straightway introduced as a " young fellow with a cast in his eye . " This was sufficiently embarrassing ; but nobody could remain uneasy with Longfellow , - he was kindness itself , and made me directly much at home by showing me some of his art treasures , a doge or senator by Tintoretto and other fine things . He immediately granted my request ( to sit for the " cast " ) , invited me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the broad landing at the head of the stairs , where there was a tolerable light . He was a model sitter , patient and unconscious , having become a little indifferent , I fancy , by frequent service of this sort to aspiring artists . As a host he had become a proverb ; his hospitality was both native and cultivated , and withal well disciplined by the army of lion-hunters who bore down upon him from all parts of the globe , in season and out , of whom his good-nature made him an easy prey . With my plan of two-hour sittings he showed no impatience , only stipulating that he should be allowed to write while he sat . He little minded interruption . One morning when we were both absorbed in our labor , the door of an upper chamber where the children were at play was thrown open , and little Allegra rushed down and beset her father for a riddle wherewith to puzzle her companions . The poet put his arm around her , threw his head back , and improvised as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My second a home for a night , My third is the worst of all weathers , My whole is a poet in feathers . " Allegra vanished , and the father was immediately far away with Dante in heaven or elsewhere . Mr. Longfellow was at this time translating the Divina Commedia , and every Wednesday evening received at his house several friends to whom he read his work of the week . Though I knew little of Dante 's Italian , Mr. Lowell always took me along with him , and , being an insignificant stranger , I was treated with great consideration . To me these were nights of enchantment . The usual guests were Mr. Lowell , Professor Norton , Mr. Greene , and sometimes Mr. Howells ( then a slim , dark , handsome youth , recently returned from Venice ) , and occasionally James T. Fields . Mr. Longfellow read very simply , in a style befitting the lofty character of the lines , often pausing and inviting criticism . Norton , Lowell and Howells were Italian scholars , and the discussions were very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We the.n migrated to the dining-room , where a supper was spread , the servants were excluded , and the fun began . Though the thinking was high , it was not particularly plain living at Longfellow 's ; he was something of an epicure , gave his guests choice wines and cigars ,  - -  he , oddly enough , often smoking one-cent Salem cheroots . I do not remember that he told any funny stories at these feasts , - his mirth was of the gentlest expression ; but his gracious presence was sufficient to put all about him in the happiest humor . He would admit no rival in the composition of a potato salad . Fields officiated as chief story-teller , when . present , and I think he was the greatest artist in that line whom I have ever heard . He was inexhaustible , and kept the table in a roar incessant . Mr. Lowell and Professor Norton both were charming raconteurs . Thus , succeeding the sonorous echoes of the fourteenth century , came two or three hours of quite different reverberations . Ah , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly again ! I have a grotesque memory of Mr. Longfellow dragging his Scotch terrier Trap , by the hind legs , back and forth on the carpet , to scratch his back , - 449 // the dog with his eyes shut in the seventh heaven of bliss . Trap was an awful thief ; and one night after we had returned to the study , we heard a loud clatter in the dining-room . We found Trap in a corner , eating a partridge which he had dragged from the table with a great smashing of glass and china . On one of these evenings Mr. Lowell was made the butt of some lively raillery . There had been an epidemic of garroting at that time , and several cases had occurred in or near Cambridge , so that there was much talk about it and some general alarm . Mrs. Lowell , knowing that we came home from the Dante evenings in the small hours , expressed anxiety for the safety of her lord , and Lowell , with great glee , took down his old-fashioned rifle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched forth to the rendezvous in high feather . Vast were the warrior s raids into realms of fancy he was the Cid , Don Quixote , Chevalier Bayard , Yankee Doodle , all in one , with suitable step and song , and greatly tickled with the humor of the situation . Here was chance of swift glory , high distinction in a minute . Away with the humdrum quill and midnight oil ! Exit Muse ; enter Mars ! I think he would have been pleased to use his impracticable weapon , though I forget whether or not it was loaded . How delightfully the event would figure in the next book of English travels through a barbarous republic ! The con fr ? res rhocked our accoutrement ; but when we came to part in th' lonely street , it may be each one wished he had thought of his gun . For his native city Mr. Longfellow always retained the affection so musically expressed in the poem , " My Lost Youth . " Before leaving Portland , I had become interested in the new public library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave to my charge for this purpose about one hundred and fifty volumes , to which Mr. Lowell added a large number , and Professor Norton still more . I have no doubt that some of the poet 's homeless townsmen received other proof of his warm sympathy . Great as was my admiration of the author , I was more fascinated by the man , - his manner was so winning , he was so simply good and generous . The sweetness of his disposition was shown in little attentions as well as larger benefits . When my work was done , he gave me as a souvenir an albatross quill which he had been using . I found it a very good pen , - and in later times half suspected it of a desire to fly back to Cambridge . There was an irresistible charm in his steady cheerfulness ; but one could not fail soon to see some slight evidence of the deep sadness which underlay his outward habit and clouded all his later life . It is good to recall the loving esteem in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest simplicity of character , wholly untouched by so much adulation . His birthday ( the sixty-second , I think ) occurring while I was there , Mrs. Fields gave a dinner in his honor at her house in BostQn . Emerson , Lowell , Nortdn , holmes , Judge Hoar and other notable men were present , and it was pleasantly evident that , while they praised him Inuch , they loved him more . Towards morning we drove home over the long bridge , in a hack full of poets , flowers and tobacco smoke . Mr. Longfellow was at this period in fair health , his face clear-cut and florid , his hair and beard fast whitening . He was much handsomer than the common portraits , which bear a superficial , saturnine look of professional photography . My acquaintance with Dr. Holmes was comparatively slight , though he was prompt to honor Lowell 's letter of credit in my behalf . I usually saw him but an hour or two each day during my work . He was a very busy man , full of diverse interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement I could not guess . He had a great fancy for mechanical and other invention , and at the time of my // arrival was deep in the problem of a new method of silvering glass . Even his writing-desk had a bank of drawers full of fine tools , which he displayed with pride ; and he had turned the attic of his house into a carpenter 's shop . He showed me his invention of the stereoscope , with an immense collection of sun-prints . He was a fiddler ; I saw the ancient instrument , but had no opportunity to hear a performance . No doubt he played like an essayist . He was still the occupant of a chair at the medical school , and I had the pleasure of listening to one of his entertaining lectures , illustrated by an assistant and a much mutilated cadaver . Even here he found occasion for a joke or two , which the youthful audience welcomed with some uproar . When I began my work , I found the Professor rather a restless sitter , being at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous temperament , sharply conscious of everything going on about him . His son , Colonel Holmes , was sitting beside me one morning smoking , when the Autocrat came in very briskly , suddenly stopped , sniffed , and said : " Something burning , Wendell ! " Wendell apologized and retired with his pipe ; but the window must be opened before we could go on . I have heard that asthma is favorable to longevity , but , doubting this , I think Holmes 's long life is an instance of the wholesomeness of activity of brain and body , involving a variety of pursuits . His face and figure were the reverse of the classic type ; he was much under the average size ; but I suppose there was never elsewhere so much wit and ability so compactly housed . The common portraits are very inadequate . In most of them an attempt has been made to substitute a smooth vacancy for a face which was almost rugged , andglowing with sensibility . If Dr. Holmes was the busiest man of my notable acquaintance , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moveInent , and in appearance most leisurely . As I could not see how Dr. 45 ' Holmes could find time to write poetry , essays and novels - he was so busy - so I could not understand how Mr. Emerson could do anything , being so deliberate . If , as he said , hurry is vulgar , he was the most uncommon of men . Upon **T arrival at Concord , I found him engaged in some outdoor affairs - he was a practical farmer - and apparently thinking of anything but books or philosophy . A great ugly straw hat made the only change I noticed in his apparel ; but that was startling . I had always seen him in the same black , formal garments , rather antiquated in style , very neat and precise , and with that wonted air which made one feel that he never had worn or could wear anything else . His tall , spare figure , narrow , sloping shoulders and this peculiar mode of dress made him conspicuous in any association . His face was equally strik-* ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal his great intellectuality , but rather seemed stamped with an air of extreme refinement and fastidiousness , with something of the expression we notice in the more youthful bust of Cicero . The forehead was neither high nor broad , the whole face narrow and aquiline , the head rising very much toward the back . To me , the chalk drawing by Rowse ( in the possession of Professor Norton ) is the most satisfactory portrait . It is certainly a beautiful picture of Emerson , the optimist . I was eager to begin my modeling , but there were obstacles . I had brought a slate for the clay , but no easel , thinking I might find one in the house . There was none available , and a search of the premises revealed no tools sufficient for construction . The search was slow and thorough . Then Mr. Emerson said : " We will drive to the joiner and see what may be done " - this with the manner of , one preparing to build a ship . Then , though I protested that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyance must be had . But the mare , " Dolly , " was loose in the meadow , and greatly pre // ferred freedom to the sop of oats which the philosopher patiently rattled in a pan . After half an hour 's coaxing , she allowed herself to be caught and harnessed into an old wagon , and then jogged away with us , as deliberate as her master , to the home of the joiner . He was absent , but his wife , who well knew Mr. Emerson , brought the key of the workshop , and urged us to make use of anything we could find , saying that " Thomas " would be glad that we should do so . This did n't satisfy the conscience of my patron , and , after some remonstrance on the lady 's part , he insisted upon driving off to a more distant shop , where we found a carpenter , who heartily gave us the freedom of the place . It was interesting to note the eager friendliness shown the driver in the ugly straw hat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my purpose to the carpenter , Mr. Emerson said he would take a short path across the fields , and leave " Dolly " to bring me and my work , when it should be done . I soon built a rude support for the clay , - something resembling an easel , - and drove home , arriving before my leisurely friend , who had doubtless loitered and dallied with nature by the way . I well remember his look of surprise when he saw the easel , and his remark : " What ! so much in so little time ! " Evidently he lived not by measure of hours and minutes , but in eternity , and always had time to spare . He had the same slow and gentle manner in the little offices of hospitality . In these he was almost graceful . He took me to my chamber himself , looked about solicitously , asked me what kind of a pen I used , brought me some of his own - then , inquiring if I smoked , brought some cigars , and said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated . He received chance visitors , of whom there were a number during my stay , - some of them from beyond the sea , bringing no manner of introduction excepting curiosity , - with the same gentle courtesy , and revealed not the least impatience , however unimportant the guest or trivial the matter occupying his time . Towards the close of my visit , I ventured to tell him that I had received several letters from friends begging for his autograph . He went directly to the study , and soon brought me five or six sheets of paper , each with a verse and his name . I can remember but one , and that the shortest . It was : " Would'st thou seal up the avenues of ill ? Pay every debt as if God wrote the bill . R. W. Emerson . " Apparently Mr. Emerson was the most modest of men . Though he talked freely and seemed , like Thoreau 's woodchopper , to enjoy talking , I never once heard him speak of himself . To be sure , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance ; but my impression was strengthened by the apparent attitude which his speech gave him toward others . From his characterization of Alcott , one might almost have fancied Emerson a humble student at the feet of a Socrates . To this great man he led me on the evening of my arrival . We found the mansion illuminated in honor of the return from Europe of Miss Louisa Alcott ; but there were few callers , and we had the pleasure of listening to a dissertation upon Greek art , from the elder oracle , which Mr. Emerson seemed to enjoy very much ; but it was far too abstract and misty to be of any use to me . As he lauded Alcott , so others . If he mentioned an artist or writer , it was to praise . He seemed incapable of animadversion . I thought he pleased himself in making heroes for his own worship - sometimes of poor material . He talked admiringly of Thoreau , and here I could sympathize warmly , and so expressing myself he guided me to the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent wood cut a young hickory , and presented me a walking stick as a memento . I am sure he would not have reft it , but it was on his own land . Alas ! I can not // reau ; hut , as we were returning home , I recall oddly enough , he spoke of nature 's apparent wastefulness in the matter of seeds , and stooping , pulled up a common weed , tasted the root , and reniarked that she was occasionally stingy and used the same flavor for two or three different plants . An illustrative anecdote is given me by a friend who visited him . At dinner one day there was mention of a woman 453 well known as a lion-hunter ; and in speaking of her Mrs. Emerson used the word " snob . " Mr. Emerson objected : the word was too harsh , - he did n't like that ugly class of words beginning with " sn " . His wife inquired how hc would characterize the lady . " I should say " very slowly - " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-lie was reading the life of Wedgewood at this time , and was pleased to NEW ENGLAND POETS . JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL. // talk of pottery and the use of terracotta in architecture , of which I had made some study in Italy ; hut he had apparently about the same view of fine art that an eagle in the clouds might have , providing the eagle with an Emersonian brain . I suppose he placed Art in its true relation to everything else ; but of its relative merit in detail he was , I think , quite umnformed , - and , as I said , spoke of artists , as of others , only to praise . With all the friendliness and cheerfulness in his talk of men and affairs went a certain remoteness of vision and abstraction , as if he were at the same time listening to the conversation of Plato or Goethe , or the whisperings of his own particular &amp;emon . One admired , but felt himself remotely placed in a throng . Being with him , one must admire , and might grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say that he was apparently less human or humane than other notable men of whom I am thinking ; but he seemed to dwell apart , dispassionate . His association with the gods was so constant and absorbing that close contact with men became impossible . Men were merely man . He was obliged to reckon with them in the mass , His concern was with the whole - and he must generalize . An individual was but a type . His immutability of deportment added to the HENRY WAD5WORTH LONGFELLOW. // impression of remoteness which I entertained . if , wandering in those ghostly realms beyond the Styx , I am so fortunate as to meet familiar shades , I expect least change in his apparition . Even here , with him , one might fancy himself already translated . No one so endowed as he could have been wanting in a sense of humor ; but I observed little of it in his daily life and conversation . With all his nnvarying cheerfnlness , the most anstere Pnritan could not be more serious . He had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hnmor in his deliberate utterance stnck fiery off indeed . A pun was almost shocking . Once when , on a lectnring tour , he came to my studio in a Western city , he surprised me with : " What are you doing out here , Mr. ? Looking for the Maine chance ? " I might have said Tn quo que , but I was overcome . His memory , even of small details , was at this time perfect . A year or more after my visit at Concord , I met him at a dinner in Boston , and he directly resumed a former conversation about terra-cotta , ref e.rring to precise details . The strange failure of memory in later years is the more remarkable . I have heard that , attending the funeral of a dear friend , he could not recall the name of him he mourned . I like to fancy that he in some sort possessed the secret of life , - that in his abstraction he hovered RALPH WALDO EMERSON . // nearer the inner court of the universe than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered and partly closed the gate behind him . But t is considering too curiously . His sojourn here gave courage to mankind , and especially to Anierican youth . His lonely indwelling was perhaps the means of his influence for the greatest good to the greatest number . It is scarcely fitting to regard these men of whom I have written as a coterie , - though I have often heard them , with two or three others whom I may not mention , spoken of as a clique . They were sharply differentiated as individuals , but certainly much modified by circumstances com mon to them all . They lived , not far separated , in permanent homes . They were constant friends . All attained fame while living , - were , so to speak , successful in life , and no poet of them bad to dodge the bailiff . All were of good moral character , all highly esteemed socially , all collegiates , all good husbands , good fathers , good citizens and good Americans . Their genial hospitality and altruism I have wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they formed a clique , their conspiracy was a wholesome one for the community and the world at large , and a wide search will fail to reveal another band of men exhibiting so much combined genius and respectability . OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES . // ARTIST . By W. Henry Winslow . THE man who probably has had the widest influence upon modern wood engraving is the late Ludwig Richter ; and as an original designer he is only to be compared among Germans with Diirer , Hans Holbein and Meuzel . A summary of his life and work would seem to have an interest for a public which knows too little of either , and especially now when vulgar and tawdry sensationalism so often usurps the place of the idealism and the healthy sentiment which are his shining characteristics . Richter was born September 28 , 1803 , in a suburb of Dresden , his father being a copper-plate engra*er and cLrau g h t s m a n and his paternal grandfather a copper-plate printer . The latter in his earlier days was a believer in alchemy and wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t h e r had a little shop , whose odd customers and quaint interior greatly interested the lad , as his drawings in after years abundantly testify . Protestantism influenced him through his Lutheran mother and grandmother , and Romanism through his father and grandfather , he himself becoming in the end a Roman Catholic , though of a singularly liberal type . At a very early age , the drama , in the form of a Marionette theatre , seized upon the child 's imagination . Three pennies intended for buying cherries procured him entrance , the play being the story of Dr. Faustus and his compact with the devil . A certain spirit named Vitzli-Putzli being summoned by the doctor and asked if he desired eternal happiness replied that if heaven could only be reached by a ladder of knives he would try to climb though he were cut in pieces . This , says Richter in his interesting " Re c 011 e c - tions , " affected him strangely . But what touched him more deeply was the stern tragedy of war enacted in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a sight of Napoleon , 457 LUDWIG RICHTER .
