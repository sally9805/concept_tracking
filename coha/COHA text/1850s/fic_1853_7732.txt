Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : THE DYING SPEECH OF AN OLD BUTTON-WOOD. from Songs of field and flood ( 1853 ) Editorial note : 1Kb As I sauntered alone one afternoon , In the bright and bloomy month of June , Over that beautiful farming land , Sloping away on either hand , Above the valley that opens to meet Blue Ocean 's glance from its inland retreat , Where Pettaquamscutt placidly leads His noiseless wavelets along the meads ; Now crossing with sinuous current the plain , To visit the corn-fields and waving grain ; Lingering now in a sheltered nook To meet some little tinkling brook , And bear it on to the waiting sea ; Then stealing along melodiously To kiss the foot of a lofty hill , That wears its olden majesty still , With craggy throne-couch upheaved on high , Where , under heaven 's blue canopy , With something in his look , perchance , Of the stately Indian 's noble glance , The Genius of the place might seem , In wakeful Fancy 's noonday dream , To sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape of beauty , far and wide : Not Tempe 's vale more fair might be Than seemed at that hour that vale to me . Each bird was singing his joyous tune , And the waters gushed as they gush in June ; And the lawns were sparkling in emerald green , And a sapphire-sky hung over the scene , And all to the eye was summer there ; But a chill yet lingered in the air , And the cricket 's monotone seemed to say , " The glory of Summer must vanish away ,  --  Vanish away ! " and the hollow moan Of the fitful breeze had a plaintive tone ; And it seemed , though in the heart of June , Like the year 's autumnal afternoon . In musing mood , as I paced along , Drinking each cadence of Nature 's song , A sudden gust of the rising wind Disturbed the dream that entranced my mind ; And there came on my ear a startling cry , That rose to a shriek as the wind grew high ; Such a cry I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . Might such be the sound that the legend tells , Across the deep , at evening swells ,  --  The dying wail of a proud and brave Old Indian tribe , that found a grave Beneath its waters , o'erwhelmed by foes ? Methinks the sound on my ear that rose Was a cry like that which the ghosts of the slain Might utter at night on some battle-plain , Where Liberty 's mangled and bleeding form , Crushed down by the tyrant , lay throbbing and warm . Oh ! what and whence was that startling groan ? It was not old Ocean 's ghostly moan ,  --  That moan of a giant in hopeless pain , Still dragging shore-ward his endless chain . ' T was the groan of the aged Sycamore-trees That lifted , shuddering in the breeze , Their skinless arms , all suppliantly , Like beggars , to the gazing sky . As , in India , the traveller sees , Ranged in the streets , the devotees ; There , as if rooted to the ground , Their tattered garments hanging round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And bony hand and palsied limb , Stereotypes of agony , Petrifactions of misery , For mercy , mercy , they seem to cry ; So , these old gnarled and twisted forms , Long writhing and wrestling with wintry storms , Had yielded at last ; and , half in despair , Half in defiance , stood rigid there ,  --  Their hundred arms flung up on high , In scorn to the winds , and in prayer to the sky . For a century now , the Button-wood Around the orchard , a guard , had stood , To shield the young and tender trees From the rough , raw breath of the ocean-breeze ; And a faithful guard it still stood there ; But it lifted on high , in the upper air , To brave the onset of Winter grim , In empty defiance , each withered limb . Faithful and firm , the champion Still stood at his post ; but his life was gone . So when , ' mid terrible Russian snows , And still more terrible Cossack foes , The proud but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , With the noble guard of Napoleon For the outer line ,  --  as the foe came on , They suddenly checked their steeds , and gazed In the Frenchmen 's faces , as men amazed ; For they saw no stir there of muscle or breath , All was as rigid and still as death . And death was there : the mighty foe , That lays both conquered and conqueror low , Had sent in an instant his icy dart To the fountain of life in each soldier 's heart . Each gun was levelled with deadly aim , But there burst from its muzzle no sulphurous flame ; The soldier flinched not ,  --  but life had fled ; The finger swerved not ,  --  ' t was frozen dead ! And so the faithful old Button-wood , Even in death , still faithful stood ; Stretching abroad its mighty arm , As if to shelter its charge from harm . ( Alas ! not one of them could repay The support it had lent to their youthful day ! ) For miles that skeleton form was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as I entered that lonely lane , There came on my ear a dirge-like strain ; As the rising wind grew loud and high , It swept through the branches a mournful sigh . ' T was a wild , a deep , and a soul-like thrill , As if the old tree were haunted still By the spirit that dwelt in its youthful frame , And the memories green of its early fame . And thus ( in that pensive afternoon , So autumn-like in the heart of June ) , Blending with ocean 's solemn roar , That rose and fell on the neighboring shore , I heard the death-groan of the Sycamore : " They are gone ,  --  all gone , " it seemed to say ; " They are all in their graves , and why should I stay ? The stout old hands that planted me here Have been mouldering now for many a year . Their children and children 's children I 've seen Laid down in the shade of my branches green ; That stalwart race is gone from the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal equals , too , of the wood , Who in other days around me stood ,  --  The motherly elm and the fatherly oak ,  --  Have bowed to decay , or the woodman 's stroke ; The poplar , the beech , and the dark-green ash , Have startled the fields with their farewell crash ; They have left me here in my solitude , O'er the memories of the past to brood , And over my present misery , A poor , old , naked , and useless tree ! I cumber the ground on which I stand ,  --  I cast a gloom o'er the lovely land ; The birds , as they sing the charms of June , But mock me with their merry tune ; The meadow-rills , as they gaily pass , Singing and dancing through the grass ,  --  The river , the valley , the sky and the hill , That wear their ancient freshness still ,  --  The very look of the ocean-rock , Worn as it is by the billow 's shock , Still sound in its true old granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They speak of many a by-gone day , When I was as fresh and as fair as they ; When the breeze in my branches made pleasant tunes With the quivering leaves in golden Junes , And wearied Toil took his noonday rest , O'er-canopied here , on earth 's green breast ; While the twinkling leaves and the sunny blue Of the laughing sky , that came peeping through , With their lights and shadows in mazy play , Dancing around him as he lay , Wove pleasant dreams for his weary brain , And sent him refreshed to his work again . Here , too , at evening , in happy chat , Parents and brothers and sisters sat , And thoughts of peace and contentment stole O'er the grateful heart and the reverent soul , As they saw the last gleamings of golden day , Through my leaves , o'er the hill-tops fade away And the moon , across the sparkling expanse Of ocean , through my foliage glance ; And the fire-fly 's fitful and trailing light Hinted the treasures the Summer night Stored away in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why do I dwell on this painful theme , And taunt my grief with memory 's dream ? Like a Titan chained to his desolate rock , For vultures to gnaw and winds to mock , Disgraced and dismantled I linger here , The ghost of myself from year to year ; And the only music that comforts me , In the day of this dismal calamity , Is the wail of the wind , and the sighing surge That breaks on the coast in an endless dirge , Like the sea of destiny rolling on , When hearts are broke and hopes are gone ,  --  Like the mournful surge of memory Still bringing the wrecks of that sullen sea Up from the depths of the watery tomb , That the wretched may never forget his doom ! Again that cruel wind ! I shiver Like the shades of the dead on that gloomy river , Howling , unquiet , in endless pain , That their bodies unburied on earth remain , That none the funeral rites will pay  --  Oh , men that have hearts of flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor old tree can feel , Come to my help with the merciful steel ! Come with your axes , and lay me low ! They are gone , and ' t is time I too should go . Build in the chimney my funeral pyre , And let me mount on wings of fire , To crown with deathless green the shore Where the fathers are gathered for evermore . " Boston Neck , R.I. , June , 1851 . Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : LINES SUGGESTED ON COMING OUT OF MOUNT HOPE BAY . from Songs of field and flood ( 1853 ) Mount Hope ! another name belongs to thee : Thou shouldst be called , methinks , Mount Memory . For , sailing by , this Indian Summer day , Where thou reclinest on thine own blue bay , Before my eyes King Philip 's famed retreat , The crag-roof shelving o'er his royal seat , And , crowning all , the canopy of blue , Spanning the same wide-spread , enchanting view Of shore and slope , that , winding far away , Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon thee thus with tranquil eye , Calm hill ! untouched , as years and change sweep by ! In fancy-dreams thy rocky slope I climb , And pierce the dusky veil of long-gone time . The white men 's homes , still few and far between , Melt in blue haze , and vanish from the scene . Slow curls the wigwam-smoke above the trees , And floats , a mimic cloud , upon the breeze . How beautiful is all around ,  --  how still ! Save when the echoes , slumbering on the hill , Stir to the paddle 's plash , where cuts the blue , Pushing from shore , the red man 's swift canoe , Or start to hear the sudden shout and screech Of red men 's children playing on the beach , Or fling back the light laugh of dusky girls Laving in some green nook their jet-black curls , Or multiply some friendly tribe 's " What cheer ? " Or foeman 's war-whoop frightful to the ear . Fair Mount ! how slight a change , and all again The self-same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sole lord of hill and plain , The son of Nature held his fair domain ! Gone are the eyes that drank with raptured gaze The light of this fair scene in other days ; The wigwam fire is out on shore and hill ; The council-talk  --  the whoop of war  --  are still . The paddle 's frequent plash is heard no more ; All now is hushed , save when the booming oar Flings the bright spray , or sounds afar the scream Of wheeling sea-gull or imprisoned steam . Yet when , in such mild days as these , I stand , And look far out o'er all the lovely land , Through the soft haze , like Memory 's veil , that lies , By Autumn 's sunlight flung on earth and skies , Fair Indian maidens , gentle and serene , Look forth with spirit-eyes upon the scene ; And from the far horizon of the West , Where lie the sunny islands of the blest , Hunter and fighter , sage and sachem , come To look once more upon their earthly home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stand , In stately talk , apart , a deep-eyed band ; While , to the music of the running rill , Low voices murmur music sweeter still . ..... But soft ! the scene is fading from my view , And with it fades my fancy 's vision too . In the dim distance , now , thy lovely slope , Transfigured , seems a skyey land , Mount Hope ! Rudely disturbed , my short day-dream is o'er ; And the fair shapes I saw just now , once more Have all withdrawn to upper air with thee , To dwell for ever , Mount of Memory . Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : A SABBATH MORNING AT PETTAQUAMSCUTT. from Songs of field and flood ( 1853 ) The Sabbath breaks  --  how heavenly clear ! Is it not always Sabbath here ? Such deep contentment seems to brood O'er hill and meadow , field and flood . No floating sound of Sabbath-bell Comes mingling here with Ocean 's swell ; No rattling wheels , no trampling feet , Wend through the paved and narrow street To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , side by side . And surely here no temple-bell Man needs , his quiet thoughts to tell When he must rest from strife and care , And own his God in praise and prayer . For doth not Nature 's hymn arise , Morn , noon , and evening , to the skies ? Is not broad Ocean 's face  --  the calm Of inland woods  --  a silent psalm ? Ay , come there not from earth and sea Voices of choral harmony , That tell the peopled solitude How great is God ,  --  how wise ,  --  how good ? In Ocean 's murmuring music swells A chime as of celestial bells ; The birds , at rest or on the wing , With notes of angel-sweetness sing , And insect-hum and breeze prolong The bass of Nature 's grateful song . Is not each day a Sabbath then , A day of rest for thoughtful men ? No idle Sabbath Nature keeps , The God of Nature never sleeps ; And in this noontide of the year , This pensive pause , I seem to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blest , Contented work is Sabbath rest . " Boston Neck , Sunday , Aug. 20 , 1848 . Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : SUNRISE ON THE SEA-COAST. from Songs of field and flood ( 1853 ) It was the holy hour of dawn : By hands invisible withdrawn , The curtain of the summer night Had vanished ; and the morning light , Fresh from its hidden day-springs , threw Increasing glory up the blue . Oh sacred balm of summer dawn , When odors from the new-mown lawn Blend with the breath of sky and sea ; And , like the prayers of sanctity , Go up to Him who reigns above , An incense-offering of love ! Alone upon a rock I stood , Far out above the ocean-flood , Whose vast expanse before me lay , Now silver-white , now leaden-grey , As o'er its face , alternate , threw The rays and clouds their varying hue . I felt a deep , expectant hush Through nature , as the growing flush Of the red Orient seemed to tell The approach of some great spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , Hung , as entranced , in mute delight .

Now all creation seemed to wake ; Each little leaf with joy did shake ; The trumpet-signal of the breeze Stirred all the ripples of the seas ; Each in its gambols and its glee A living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowy mane , The white waves skimmed the liquid plain ; Glad Ocean , with ten thousand eyes , Proclaimed its joy to earth and skies ; From earth and skies a countless throng Of happy creatures swelled the song : Praise to the Conqueror of night !

I know thee now ,  --  Such grace and glory on thy brow ; Such lustre in thy glowing eye , Born of the broad blue sea and sky ; Such health and beauty on thy cheek , And grace of form no tongue can speak !

' T is now the season when the wild Yet tender heart of Nature 's child In yon far Western halo saw , With yearning love and holy awe , The light of that unfading shore , Where dwell the dead who die no more . Ah ! Heaven is nearer now , meseems , Than ' t was to them in autumn dreams ! Does not a Father 's loving eye Look down on me from yon blue sky ?

Ay , well I hear in that harsh roar , That crashes through the forest-space , The bolt of doom for evermore Fall , crushing , on the red man 's race . Farewell , ye noble hunting grounds , Farewell , ye haunts and homes of ours ! The white man , with his iron hounds , A howling pack , our purlieu scours .
