REMINISCENCES OF TilE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND TIMES IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING . " Ab Deo Optimo Maxlmo , cujus ope et auxilio multo magis h*c respublica qu*m ratlone hominum et conslijo gubernatur. " - CIORRO PRO C. EA* IT is a received axiom in political science that an elevated national character is the surest element of national power and prosperity . Nothing contributes more to the formation of such a character , than a lively admiration of the virtues and achievements of a glorious ancestry . Every nation of any distinction , in ancient or modern times , has been founded by signal exertions of genius and valor , and noble exhibitions of patriotic virtue . Hence every nation has its " heroic age ; " and its glory , power , and permanency have depended , in a good degree , on the admiration and gratitude in which the actors in it are held by their descendants . No nation can claim a primitive age more justly styled " heroic , " than the people of the United States of North America . It abounds in examples of illustrious virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions and written history may be constantly drawn inspiring draughts of integrity , pa. triotism , and honorable emulation . It is not , however , from elaborate histories that the true and most interesting , or even the most instructive lessons and examples of individual self-sacrifice and devotion to our country in times of peril and oppression may be gathered . Genuine anecdotes , private yet authentic incidents , afford the truest exhibitions and most soul-stirring proofs of the real and pervading spirit and character of the age of a nation justly styled its " HEROIC AGE . " We may , perhaps , amuse and instruct our readers for a while , and freshen our admiration of the men of the American Revolution , by reviving the memory of domestic anecdotes and events of that period , and of the times immediately succeeding it . The anecdotes which follow were heard from the lips of the actors , or can otherwise be proved to be authentic . The first subject which is most calculated to attract and fix the mind of an American of our day and any after-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our ancestors were formerly // accustomed to call that body of great and remarkable men . To this body every American should bow in admiration and unceasing gratitude . It is not so much the talents which distinguished its members that attracts our respect , as it is the integrity and incorruptibility of the individuals ; their calm fortitude , the courage in council , which Cicero declares to be greater than that of the battle-field ; the disinterested and selfsacrificing devotion to their country in the darkest and most perilous hours , that gains our affections . These men had been elected by the people of the several colonies , or by their legislatures , not because they had been previously politicians , seeking office and self-influence ; but because they were well known for their private virtues , their talents , and public services , and already distinguished for their bold devotion to the cause of their country . In their public capacity , and by their celebrated addresses at the two first sessions , they had acquired the respect of foreign nations , and had compelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as many will remember when these celebrated documents were laid before Parliament : " For myself ; II must declare itnd avow that in all my reading and observation  --  and it has been my favorite study-I have read Thucydides , and have studied and admired the master states of the world ; that for solidity of reasoning , force of sagacity , and wisdom of conclusion , under such a complication of difficult circumstances , no nation or body of men can stand in preference to the general Congress at Philadelphia . " At a later day , the profound jurist and accomplished scholar , Sir James Macintosh , declared those addresses to be " the master-pieces of state papers . " The three addresses passed at the first session , ( Sept. , 1774 , ) were , an address to the King ; one to the people of Great Britain ; and the third to the " People of British America ; " in other words , to the people of the colonies . Richard Henry Lee , of the Virginia delegation , was chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania , prepared the first ; John Jay , of New-York , the second ; and Richard Henry Lee the third , which was considered as the most important . The ability with which these papers were drawn up , had a profound effect both at home and abroad . They should be more read by the youth and men of our day . They are to be met with , as far as we know , only in the journals of the Continental Congress . The wisdom , the elevated sentiments , the ardent love of liberty , the bold and determined resistance to the infringements on their rights , which these // addresses evince , can not be too often or deeply pondered by the descendants of their authors , and of those noble patriots who adopted them . The three addresses were adopted at the first session of Congress , in 1774 . In the second session ( May , 1775 , ) a committee was appointed to prepare a farewell address to the " people of Great Britain , " resistance now being determined upon . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prepared the parting address , which obtained so much admiration for the spirit which breathed through it , and for its eloquent and elegant composition . We can not forbear from quoting its concluding passages : " Yet conclude not from this that we propose to surrender our property into the hands of your ministry , or vest your Parliament with a power which may terminate in our destruction . The great bulwarks of our Constitution we have desired to maintain by every temperate , by every peaceable means ; but your ministers , equal foes to British and American freedom , have added to their former oppressions an attempt to reduce us by the sword to a base and abject submission . On the sword , therefore , we are compelled to rely for protection . We know the force1 of your arms , and was it called forth in the cause of justice and your country , we might dread the exertion . Should victory declare in your favor , yet , men trained to arms from their infancy , and animated by the love of liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , at least , we are assured , that our struggle will be glorious , our success certain , since even in death we shall find that freedom which in life you forbid us to enjoy . " Let us now ask what advantages are to attend our reduction ? The trade of a ruined and desolate country is always inconsiderable , its revenue trifling ; the expense of subjecting and retaining it in subjection , certain and inevitable . What then remains but the gratification of an ill-judged pride . or the hope of rendering us subservient to designs on your liberty ? " Soldiers who have sheathed their swords in the bowels of their American brethren , will not draw them with more reluctance against you . When too late , you may lament the loss of that freedom which we exhort you , while still in your power , to preserve . " On the other hand , should you prove unsuccessful ; should that connection , which we most ardently wish to maintain , be dissolved ; should your ministers exhaust your treasures , and waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty ; do they not deliver you , weak and defenseless , to your natural enemies ? " Since then your liberty must be the price of your victories , your ruin of your defeat , what blind fatality can urge you to a pursuit destructive of all that Britons hold dear ! " If you have no regard to the connection that has for ages subsisted between us ; if you have forgotten the wounds we have received fighting by your side for the extension of the empire ; if our commerce is not an object below your consideration ; ifjustice and humanity have lost their influence on your hearts ; still motives are not wanting to excite your indignation at the measures now pursued ; your wealth , your honor , your liberty are at stake . // " Notwithstanding the distress to which we are reduced , we sometimes forget our own afflictions to anticipate and sympathize in yours . We grieve that rash and inconsiderate counsels should precipitate the destruction of an empire , which has been the envy and admiration of ages , and call God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endanger our lives , and sacrifice every thing but liberty to redeem you from ruin ! " A cloud hangs over your heads and ours ; ere this reaches you , it may probably burst upon us . Let us then , before the remembrance of former kindness is obliterated , once more repeat those appellations which are ever grateful in our ears ; let us entreat Heaven to avert our i*uin , and the destruction that threatens our friends , brethren , and countrymen on the other side of the Atlantic ! " After perusing this passage , our readers will thank us for citing another brief specimen of the same traits , in regard to which there is an anecdote of no little interest . It is a letter in reply to the " Livery of London , " thanking them for an address they had presented to the King in behalf of the colonies . This inimitable letter was written by Richard Henry Lee ; and after the Revolution , he and his brother , Arthur Lee , ascertained that the address of the " Livery of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two brothers . Arthur Lee had studied law in London , and was a friend *nd fellow.practitioner of Dunning , Adair , and William Jones , afterwards the celebrated Sir William . Arthur wrote the address for the Livery , and in the course of events , his brother , Richard Henry , without any knowledge of the fact , wrote the reply ! On one occasion after the war , while the brothers were talking over the origin and incidents of the eventful contest , they made known to each other the authorship of the address and reply , and showed the original manuscripts . " Thus were the two brothers serving their common country , with all their souls , on different sides of the Atlantic . " " Mr LORD : Permit the Delegates of the people of twelve ancient colonies to pay your lordship , and the very respectable body of which you are head , a just tribute of gratitude and thanks for the virtuous and unsolicited resentment you have shown to the violation of the rights of a free people . The city of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patron of liberty , and the support of just government against lawless tyranny and oppression , can not fail to make us sensible of the powerful aid our cause must receive from such advocates ; a cause , my Lord , worthy the support - of the first city in the world , as it involves the fate of a great continent , and bids fair to shake the foundation of a flourishing , and , until lately , a happy empire . " North-America , my Lord , wishes ardently for a lasting connection with Great Britain upon terms of just and equal liberty ; less than which generous minds will not offer , nor brave and free ones be willing to receive . " A cruel war has at length been opened against us ; and whilst we pre-22 // pare to defend ourselves like the descendants of Britons , we still hope that the mediation of wise and good citizens will prevail over despotism , and re* store harmony and peace on permanent principles to an oppressed and divided empire . " We have the honor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lordship ' . * faithful friends and fellow-citizens* " There is another anecdote which is interesting . We repeat that comparatively smail things show more certainly and cha* racteristically the true spirit of an epoch than those that are called historic events . Dr. Shippen , then a celebrated physician in Philadelphia , and who was at the head of the medical de ' partment of the army , had married the eldest sister of Richard Henry Lee . In Dr. Shippen 's family , Mr. Lee and his cob leao*ues of the Virginia delegation boarded . These gentlemen1 like their great countryman Washington , received no compen* sation but their necessary expenses . In the early part of the winter of 77 , after a protracted autumn , the annual migration of the wild pigeon from the North to the South took place in great numbers . The fatigue of the passage had rendered them poor and tough . A large supply could be purchased in the markets for a mere trifle . On these poor and tough pigeons the members of Congress in Dr. Shippen 's family lived for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper , that they might cost as little as possible to the treasury of their native State , every cent of which was needed for the common resistance to the oppression of their common country . Are we not reminded of the quails of the desert ? A similar food and supply sustained these patriots in the wilderness of the Revolution . A circumstance occurred during the gloomy winter of VT1 which has not found its way into histories . It was one among many during the Revolution , which appeared to be providential allotments ' in our favor . The writer received the account of it from a son of Richard Henry Lee , and Francis Lightfoot Lee , . who were members of Congress and were in Philadelphia at the time . These gentlemen were accustomed to mention it as a providential interference in behalf of their country . When General Washington was retreating through the Jer .. seys , in the winter of 177G-7 , and had crossed the Delaware7 his lead and bullets had nearly failed , and he would have been unable , without a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered New.Jersey , and reinspired the whole country with new hope , and confidence in their commander-in*chief . In this darkest hour of the war , Congress had made every effort to supply the so-much-needed // 309 articles . All the lead that could be found in private and public places had been obtained . Lead-pipes had been melted , and the leaden plates torn from the roofs of houses ; but still a small quantity only could be obtained . Just then , in the darkest moment of despondency , iRobert Morris , who has been called the " financier " of the evolution , and whose extensive credit and mercantile transactions in Europe , and whose uncalculating devotion to his country have laid that country under neverceasing obligations , received a letter from one of his ships , which had escaped British cruisers , informing him that the vessel was within the Capes , and would reach Philadelphia at such a time and was ballasted with lead , amounting to a very large quantity . This letter the patriotic Morris-for such we delight to call him - received late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyously informed the members he could see before morn-moEarly the next morning , Morris and many members repaired to the wharf anxiously looking out for the expected vessel . For some time it did not appear . The members repaired to the Hall with saddened countenances , and on the assembling of the House , the letter to Morris was read , and the looked-for supply was eagerly expected . Morris was too anxious to remain in his seat in the House . He returned to the wharf straining his eyes down the river . At length the goodly vessel heaves in sight , and her owner recognizes the stars and , stripes . The news spreads rapidly through the city , and reaches Congress . A scene of joyful emotion instantly succeeds , and the hearts of these glorious and beloved men send up to Heaven their grateful thankso-ivincrs for the relief about to be received *n the hour of des*tir . The ship arrives ballasted with lead* which the captain of his own apparent will , ( but as our fathers rationally and piously ' believed , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first tgwte resolved to use for that purpose . By God 's overruling providence , the ' vessel escapes the perils of storms and capture ; arrives at the exigent moment ; a large supply of lead is immediately obtained ; our great commander re-crosses the Delaware , and saves our country ! Laus Deo ! The women of the IRevolution have been justly celebrated for their devotion to the cause of their country during the IRevolutionary War . Many instances are recorded of their patient endurance , fortitude , and even adventurous daring during those dark and stormy times . The instance of the noble-spirited Mrs. Motto , of South-Carolina , which occurred with General Lee , the commander of the celebrated " Partisan Legion , " and which he has so graphically related in his " Memoirs of the Southern // Campaigns , " has often been published ; but it can never be read without interest , and without admiration of the lady . In one of the movements of Lee 's legion , he came to a plantation owned by a widow lady , Mrs. Motte . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out-buildings . This house had been taken possession of by a British officer , and converted into a fort . It became necessary to Lee 's purposes to dislodge this party . The officer was summoned to surrender . He refused , and declared his intention to defend the house to the last . Lee saw he would be compelled to burn the house . Mrs. Motte was residing in a farm-house some distance off . Lee was exceedingly loth to destroy this noble mansion . He repaired to Mrs. Motte 's present residence , whither she had been driven by the British , and in hesitating terms made known to her the absolute necessity of destroying the family mansion . The iRoman matron at once signified , in animated terms , her willingness that the destruction should take place , without a thought of future compensation from her now suffering country . And she herself furnished Lee with a bow and some Indian arrows which were tipped with a combustible composition which would take fire by the friction in penetrating any substance . Mrs. Motte beheld with triumph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender of the enemy . In the Memoirs* of General Lee there is the following anecdote , which exhibits the noble spirit and cool daring which prevailed during the " times that tried men 's souls . " A Colonel White , of the Georgia militia , determined to make an attempt to capture a post on the Ogeechee Rwer , about twenty miles from Savannah , held by a British Colonel named French , with five vessels , four of which were armed with crews amounting to forty men . Colonel White approaching the fort , he and his comrades with torches in their hands , passed from point to point , simulating officers and aids giving and carrying orders to several corps . He then summoned the British Colonel to surrender . That officer supposing a large force to be upon him , surrendered with his ships , their crews , and one hundred and twenty stand of arms . White then told the captured Colonel and prisoners , he must hasteu back to his camp to prevent his men from inflicting vengeance on them for their cruelties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his four men to be marched to an American post , while he rode through the * This work has long been out of print ; but a new edition , revised and with a sketch of the life of General Henry Lee , is now in press , and will be issued soon by Mr. A. Morris , of Richmond , Virginia . // neighborhood ; and collecting a militia force sufficient , and overtaking them , they were safely ( with their arms ) delivered in to the American camp . The spirit which characterized the glorious " Old Congress , " and the army , prevailed throughout the mass of the yeomanry of the country more or less in every colony . As illustrative of this , there is an incident related in the life of Richard Henry Lee , which , as that work is out of print , may be cited for the benefit of our younger readers . The British tenders from their ships in the Chesapeake Bay were often sent up the Potomac to harass the inhabitants , and plunder their plantations and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard ilenry Lee was at home , on leave of absence from Congress , a French ship arrived , in the bay with dispatches from our commissioners in France with the exhilarating information of the signing of the TREATY OF ALLIANCE . Mr. Lee immediately sent a person with fresh provisions as a present to the admiral who , learning that Mr. Lee was a member of Congress , confided to him the dispatches with which he was charged . As the moment was urgent and joyous , Mr. Lee fixed upon a young man of the neighborhood whom he knew to be intelligent , bold , adventurons , and devoted to his country . Mr. Lee informed him of the importance of the purpose he wished to accomplish through him . He told him he wished him to undertake to carry immediately to Philadelphia , and deliver to the President of Congress , papers of the highest importance , the nature of which he made known to him . Mr. Lee planned with him the route and manner of his journey , and sewed the papers in different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had any thing about him . The road the youth had to travel was infested with English ships and troops . The young man having al*ways lived on the water-courses , was very skillful in the management of small vessels . He accordingly provided himself with a small boat , and in the dimness of twilight , without returning to his home , proceeded to the river , accompanied by Mr. Lee ; and after receiving much encouragement and many warm commendations from him , he pushed off alone . In this boat he passed a schooner and two tenders of the enemy , during the night , and as soon as the day dawned , he came ashore , and travelled on foot , avoiding as much as possible the public roads . He frequently lay in the woods during the day , suffering severely from hunger and thirst , and travelled during the night . Having been a long time without any thing to eat , and finding himself near // a small town at the head of the Chesapeake , he determined about sunset to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found one into which he thought he might safely stop for a short time , he went in . While he was sitting in a room adjoining a garden , four or live British seamen and marines came into the porch of the tavern , and putting down their guns , called for rum . After drinking , two of them came into the room in which he was sitting , and began to question him , " whether he belonged to King George or to the rebels ? " He answered them in a collected and careless manner , and they at length returned to their comrades . As soon as they had left the room , he leaped from the window , and crossing the garden without being observed , regained the road leading into the country , and travelled as fast as he could during the night . He at last arrived safely in Philadelphia , just after Congress had assembled . Having been directed to the house in which it met , he found it sitting with closed doors . He assured the door-keeper , with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the President , to whom alone he was instructed to communicate what it was . The door-keeper being struck with his manner , went in , and after some minutes the President came out . The young man informed him of the circumstances under which he had been sent by Mr. Lee , and of his instruction to deliver the papers to the President of Congress . The President , after reading Mr. Lee 's let . ter , and receiving all the papers mentioned in it , had the young man provided with comfortable lodgings . After the house adjourned , the President waited on him and presented him with the thanks of Congress , and expressed a desire that he would accept of a reward . Ife declined all offers of the kind , re uestin* only money enough to enable hi ? n to return to Virq nia . IDuring the terrible winter of 78 , when Philadelphia had been taken by the enemy , and Washington driven into the country , he had established his head-quarters at Valley 13'orge . The condition of the American army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance was , that as soon as the time of enlistment of the militia had expired , they would return to their homes , in spite of every consideration which could be addressed to them . This had happened until Washington 's army had been reduced to a mere handful . Had the British general in Philadelphia been fully aware of Washington 's actual condition , he could have dispersed the last remnant of the army of the Revolution ! At this time , Thomas Johnson , one of the ablest men of his day , who had been distin // guished in the three first sessions of Congress , was Governor of Maryland . He had been born and brought up in the western part of Maryland , and well knew the hardy habits and bold spirit of the inhabitants of the counties of Frederick and Allenheny . He repaired in the depth of winter from Annapolis to that region , and taking the sheriff of the cQunty-a popular man - traversed the mountainous regions of these counties , and raised by his influence , a considerable body of active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *nd SUS nance , proceeded with them to Valley Forge . On arriving , he approached the sentinel and desired to speak to the officer of the day , who being sent for , came to meet the Governor . He being clothed in a full suit of " home-spun , " without any insignia of office or command , the officer seemed inclined to treat the Governor 's desire to speak with Washington with indifference . However , at last the officer was persuaded to carry the Governor 's name to the commander-inchieg who immediately appeared , and to the evident astonishment of the officer of the day , the two patriots warmly emraced each other , Washington expressing his thanks at the unexpected assistance . Every reminiscence of our Revolutionary times and of those immediately succeeding them , evince , with irresistible force , the high value , indeed the essential necessity of the Union of the people of the several States under a Federal government based on a national constitution . Such reminiscences tend to impress this lesson upon the minds of their descendants as it did on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patriotic ancestors . The necessity of this union was seen and avowed long before our Revolutionary struggle . We may be pardoued for a brief deviation from the period we meant mainly to illustrate , to prove this fact and revive the memory of some events in the minds of our courttrymen . A union of the people of the colonies rather than of them as corpora bodies or governments , was evidently the leading idea of our ancestors before the Revolution , and during that strug:gle This idea was acted on during the war of the Revolution to a degree that is seldom observed by hundreds who write and discourse on our* history and government . It is , indeed , surprising , that so few writers or speakers on the subjects of the Confederatiou and the present Constitution of the United States , have observed and clearly stated this truth , that it was union of the eo le of the colonies as a nation not as a league of // States , that was the great principle and act that prepared us to resist the ' power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that epoch through the IRevolution , and has raised our nation to its present power and prosperity . The idea and policy of union and combined strength , for purposes of resistance and defense , were familiar to the minds and actidn of our ancestors . The following are the occasions and modes in which they endeavored to carry them out . As far back as 1643 , a Congress or Confederation by the Eastern Colonies had been formed , who united under the name of the " United Colonies of New-England , " for their mutual defense against the Indian tribes around them . This confederation lasted forty years . Again in 1722 , there was a convention of Governors and Commissionere from several of the colonies held at Albany . Again in 1751 , the plan of 1722 received the sanction of the British government , and delegates were sent to Albany , and this Congress of 1754 met . But they carried their views farther than was intended by the government of the mother country . They proposed a plan for a confederacy of all the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a president to be appointed by the Crown . This Congress passed the golden resolution above mentioned , " That the union of these colonies is essential to their safety and welfare . " The British government did not approve this plan with this resolution appended , for a very obvious reason . The plan was not approved of ; either , by the colonial governments ; even then were State or sectional jealousies 6eginning to arise . With reference to this refusal of the plan of 1754 , by the colonies , it has been remarked , " that some of the most intelligent men in the several provinces were of opinion that it would be impossible to reconcile the differences between them , so as to unite them in a common confederacy . " The importance of some union or political concert was never , however , lost sight of by our ancestors ; and hence , as soon as the oppressions or at least dangerous principles rendered resistance and safety subjects of solicitude , they recurred to the same idea of union of heart and action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York . They drew up a Bill of Rights , in which , among other declarations , they declared " that the right and power of taxation resided solely in their own colonial legislatures . " Then in 1774 ( September ) first assembled the venerable and glorious " Old Congress , " or Continental Congress , which carried their country through the long , and to themselves individually perilous struggle for independence ! // Perilous to them personally , " for they would have been the traitors of whom examples would have been made . " They well knew this , for when signing the Declaration of Independence , Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts , remarked as he passed Mr. Randolph , who was large and fat : " I shall*be dangling in the air , when all will be over with you ! " The most remarkable and interesting circumstance attending the Congress of 54 , was the resolution they passed at the end of the session . It was this : * That the union of these colonies is essential to their safety and welfare . " The mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , accompanied as it was by the foregoing invaluable resolution . The reason is plain . Such a union the British statesmen had sagacity to foresee might be used in future times against Great Britain if occasion should require ; and it was used in the Revolution , and made us independent , and since has made us powerful and prosperous beyond all example . Let it be remembered , that the resolution of the Congress of 54 does not say a confeder acy is essential , but a unifErn . Let us study the language of the " Old Congress , " when proclaiming their authority . " We , the Delegates of the people of the colonies , " etc . The language of the Articles of Confederation was , " Articles of Confederation between the States , " etc . The difference is striking and irreconcilable . The articles were not finally adopted until 1781 , when the war was at an end . It was a union of the people of the United States as one people , which carried our fathers through the Revolution ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political anarchy and despotism ! One of the most interesting political reminiscences of the Revolution , is the difficulty attending the adoption of the Articles of Confederation . The most difficult question to settle was the ratio of representation among the several States . In the discussion of this , the Northern statesmen resisted the ratio before considered essentially republican , and which in truth formed one of the grounds of our resistance to Great Britain ; * which was " that representation and taxation should go together . " Had this ratio been adopted , the Northern States having a larger white population , would bear a greater portion of taxation than the Southern States in all direct taxation upon which alone the government could depend . They , therefore , contended that the South should permit a portion of her slaves to be counted in proportioning her representation as a mode of inc*reasing her taxation . This the South resisted from the first moving of the Articles of Confederation until // the year 1780 . In consequence then of the North out-voting the South , the South was thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her direct taxation was greatly increased beyond what it would have been had the ratio of representation included only the free white inhabitants of the slaveholding States . In consequence of this including of the three-fifth principle , Virginia from the end of the war until the adoption of the present Constitution , paid nearly a million of dollars towards the Revolutionary debt , more than P*nnsylvania , NewYork , or Massachusetts. * In the Convention of 87 , the South moved to reject the representation of her slaves , for direct taxation was as yet the only mode of raising the revenue of the government ; and from the state of our commerce was likely long to remain so . But after protracted debates , a majority of the slaveholding States , in a spirit of compromise , yielded the point , being content at last with the increase of their political power in the new government . Although the origin and design of the three-fifth arrangement were as they are here stated , and were transferred by the same power into the present Constitution , it has frequently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an arrangement originating with the South , and forced by it on the North . The illustrious Webster understood this matter , and always honestly confessed the truth , declaring that in consequence of the unforeseen and rapid increase of our commerce and resort to indirect taxation on the importation of foreign goods , the arrangement had worked to the advantage of the South against the North ; still it " was a bargain , " a " constitutional compact , " and should be borne and carried out in honor and good faith . Another interesting subject of reminiscence in the history of the debates and action of Congress under the confederation , is the history of the famous ordinance of 1787 , prohibiting slavery in the North-western Territory and in the States to be formed out of it . It is well known , of course , that Virginia  --  a slaveholding State-gave up to the general government , or in other words , to the nation , the vast territory North-west of the Ohio* The States formed out of this territory can never under the Constitution-for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also well known that Virginia herself proposed this restriction , although many of her citizens owned lands in this territory , and intended to settle on them with their slaves . There are very plausible rea // Sons to argue from the history and debates of the times , that as this territory was all that the national government owned out of which States could be formed , was thus interdicted from slavery , our fathers did not intend nor anticipate that any siaveholding States would be admitted into the Union . The moral which can and ought to be drawn from these two facts , slave representation , and restriction of slavery from the North-western territory , as proposed by Virginia , and accepted by the other States , is , that it was not then imagined that slave States would be added ; that though the Northern States made a bad bargain in forcing slave representation on the South , since the revenue has been raised by duties on foreign goods , they ought to comply in good faith with the compact ; and considering that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress without additional taxation ; and considering , moreover , that the South has obtained several slaveholding States since the adoption of ' the Constitution , they ought in a generous and magnanimous spirit abstain from pressing more into the Union , inasmuch as the coming in of every slaveholding State increases their political power without any corresponding equivalent to the North . If the people of both sections were more generally informed on these subjects , as to their real history , the spirit in which they were treated , and the views with which they were adopted , a better temper would exist in both . It would be impossible for ultra demagogues and wicked agitators , North or South , to endanger the continuance and peace of our Union , as it exists under the Constitution of the United States , the glorious and wonderful work of our glorious and beloved ancestors . The subject , however , which affords reminiscences of most value in lessons of wisdom and patriotism , is the condition of the country under the Articles of Confederation , and the signal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of our country from the peace of 83 until the adoption of the present Constitution , taught our forefathers more forcibly even than the history of all preceding leagues of separate and independent States , the essential inefficacy and insuperable evils of such forms of government . The necessary want pf efficiency in the national arm in such governments insures their weakness and ruin . Wherever a government has no power to enforce its laws by its own officers , and is obliged to rely only on a voluntary obedience to its requisitions by the several sovereignties , local jealousies , and supposed local interests , lead to tardy and reluctant acquiescence , // then to disregard , and thence to downright refusal to comply . The weakness of the federal government soon becomes apparent , and disobedience grows heedless of punishment and compulsion . Anarchy and confusion follow ; citizens of the separate States become inimical to those of another ; restrictions and counter-restrictions of each other 's commerce and inter* course are resorted to ; and the next step is civil war , and its end is military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that such was the literal history under the Articles of Confederation . Every step had been taken , every degree of proclivity towards national ruin had been experienced , until we had arrived at the very verge of war between States which , under the pressure of a common danger , had endured the sufferings of a seven years ' war . Congress was unable to collect its requisitions on the States for the means of paying even a portion of the interest on the war-debt of the Revolution , due to foreign governments and to individuals who had aided us in our hours of need . It had been compelled to disband our Revolutionary soldiers without the means to pay them even enough to enable them to make their way home to their wives and children . The commercial States were endeavoring to bring all foreign trade to their own sea-ports by lowering duties on importation , which was carried so far by the larger States as to draw away nearly all commerce from the smaller ones . This produced retaliation by the latter on the trade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial powers . Foreign governments finding out its inability to execute its treaties with them , treated our advances with coldness and ill-disguised indifference . Civil war in one of the States at length actually broke out , and its citizens were arrayed in arms against each other . The existing government of the State called on Congress for aid to repress the rebellion , as one of the articles of confederation made it the duty of the Federal Government to do . Congress , in this emergency , did what it could to fulfill its duty . It passed an act to raise a regiment for the purpose , but had not the means to enlist twenty men . Courts of justice in some States were closed to the suits of citizens of sister States , as well as against the claims of foreigners . All business , agricultural , commercial , and manufacturing , became embarrassed and ruined . Anarchy was at hand , and some good men and honest patriots began to declare the necessity of a return to monarchy ! We would desire to impress more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these days of political excitement and sectional strife , the lessons which this sad // portion of our independent existence is so well calculated to impart . Let every citizen of the Union , not yet dead to all sense of national prosperity and glory , and to every patriotic emotion , ponder these impressive lessons . The writer , with this view , insists upon dwelling yet longer on this aspect of that part of our history . We will quote a concise , true , and impressive summary of the condition of the States , from the closing of the war to the adoption of the present Constitution , from the pen of Chancellor Kent . " Almost as soon as the Articles of Confederation were ratified , ( 1781 , ) the States begun to fail in a prompt and faithful obedience to its laws . As danger receded , instances of neglect became more frequent , and by the time of the peace of 1783 , the disease of the government had displayed itself with alarming rapidity . The delinquencies of one State became a pretext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying the pecuniary exigencies of the nation from requisitions on the States , was soon found to be altogether delusive . The national engagements seem to have been altogether abandoned . Even contributions for the ordinary expenses of the government fell almost entirely upon the two States which had the most domestic resources . Attempts werevery early made by Congress , and in remonstrances the most manly and persuasive , to obtain from the several States the right of levying , for a limited time , a general impost , for the exclusive purpose of providing for the discharge of the national debt . It was found impracticable to unite the States in any provision for the national safety and honor . Interfering regulations of trade , and interfering claims of territory , were dissolving the friendly attachments and the sense of common interest which had cemented and sustained the Union during the arduous struggles of the Revolution . Symptoms of distress and marks of humiliation were rapidly accumulating . It was with difficulty that the attention of the States could be sufficiently excited , to induce them to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . The finances of the nation were annihilated ; the whole army of the United States was reduced , in 1784 , to eighty persons ; and the States were urged to provide some of the militia , to garrison the western posts . In short , to use the language of the authors of the Federalist , each State , yielding to the voice of immediate interest or convenience , successively withdrew its support from the confederation , till the frail and tottering edifice was ready to fall upon our heads , and crush us beneath its ruins . ' " To make these truths still more impressive , we cite the following extracts from deeply interesting letters from General Washington on this subject , written in the years 1785-6-7. fib James Warren . Moun*e VERNON , Oct. , 1785 . " The war has terminated most advantageously for America , and a fair field is presented to our view . But I confess to you freely , my dear sir , that I do not think we possess wisdom or justice enough to cultivate it properly . Illiberality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our public coun // cils for the good government of the Union . In a word , the confederation appears to me to be little more than a shadow without substance , and Congress a nugatory body , their ordinances being little attended to . By such policy the wheels of government are clogged , and our brightest prospects , and that high expectation which were entertained of us by the wondering world , are turned into astonishment , and from the ground on which we stood we are descending into the vale of confusion and darkness , " etc. , etc . To James Warren . MOUNT VERNON , - , 178*J . " How melancholy is the reflection that in so short a time we should have made such large strides towards the fulfillment of the predictions of our trans-atlantic foes , Leave them to themselves , and their government will soon dissolve ! ' Will not the wise and good strive hard to avert this evil ? The consequences of a lax and inefficient government are too obvious to be dwelt on . Thirteen sovereignties pulling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will soon bring ruin on the whole , " etc. , etc . To John Jay . MOTJNT VERNON , - , 1Th6 " What astonishing changes a few years are capable of producing ! I am told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government without horror . From thinking proceeds speaking ; thence to action is but a single step . ' But how- tremendous and irrevocable ! What a triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions ! What a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves , and that systems , founded on the basis of equal liberty , are merely ideal and fallacious . Would to God that wise measures may be taken in time to arrest the consequences we have too much reason to apprehend . ' * In a letter , dated May , 87 , to Thomas Jefferson , he says : " That something is necessary to be done , none will deny , for the general government , if it can be called a government , is shaken to its foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unless a remedy is soon applied , anarchy and confusion will inevita*ily ensue . " It had been the experience of ancient and modern times , that leagues of independent States would be weak and transient . Such had been the history precisely with the Grecian States of Asia Minor  --  the iEoli*an , Dorian , and Tonic Confederacies . It had been equally the case with the Amphyctionic Council , and the Ach*ean League of mother Greece . Equally so with the ilelvetic Confederacy ; with that of the United Provinces of Holland , and of the Germanic Confederation . Another view of this subject should make us in this day of sectional ill will , look upon the present government as an incalculable blessing , founded , as it is , on a national constitution , adopted by the PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ; a government independent of the States , as 8tates , for its existence , its // powers and means of executing its own laws . It is lamentable to perceive the ignorance daily evinced of the nature and prim . ciples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between it and the Articles of Confederation , by men who aspire to be politicians and statesmen . To understand the former it is necessary to understand the latter . With the desire to attract the attention of our young students of law and poli. tics , as sciences , we will here state briefly , but distinctly , the demonstrable nature of our Constitution an Confederation . , d the Articles of 1st . The Articles of Confederation constituted a league of independent States . The present government is formed and exists by the authority of the whole people of the United States . 2d . The language of the Articles of Confederation and of the Constitution evinces the essential difference of their nature . The language of the first , is " Articles of Confederation between the States of " etc. , etc . The language of the second is , " TJTe , the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , " etc. , ete , " do ordain and establish this Constitution , " etc. , etc. 3d . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its own officers . The present government can do this . 4th . The Congress under the Confederation acted only on States . The present government acts directly on individuals . There is yet another topic which ought to be pondered with deep consideration ; that is , the difficulties in the way of such union and government as could alone cure the existing evils , and secure efficiency in a general government adequate to the domestic condition and foreign relations of the people , to whatever state or section they belonged . Sectional rivalries and jealousies , alienation and distrust which had sprung up during the times of the Confederation , and the personal ambition of leading men in the several States , who were sure of State offices , but despaired of the more important and honorable offices under a national government , interposed difficulties in the way even of assembling any body of men in drawing closer the bonds of union . Let us state briefly the history of these difficulties as they operated against even a proposition to dele. gate a few additional powers to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eve* proposition of the kind had failed . Look how slow were the steps which pre . ceded and at last brought about the Convention of 8 ' 7 . Let it he borne in mind that the members of that body were empow. // ered only to amend the Articles of Confederation . As we said , every proposition to attempt to improve the sad condition of the United States , up to the year 86 , had failed . The first step was this : Maryland and Virginia had long been disputing about the extent of their jurisdiction over the Chesapeake Bay , and their inhabitants were annoying each other and endangering the friendly relations of the two States . In 1785 , commissioners on the part of these States were appointed to adopt some common principles of navigating that Bay , and to form a tariff of duties to which they would mutually conform . These commissioners met at Alexandria , and adjourned to Mount Vernon , when , with the advice of Washington , they extended their views to the other States . They agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States for the purpose of devising some general plan for the regulation of commerce and raising a national revenue . Accordingly , in January , 1786 , the Legislature of Virginia appointed commissioners to meet any who might be appointed by the other States , to consult upon some plan of uniform commercial regulations , which might be reported to the States for ratification . The recommendation was acted on by some of the States , and at the time and . place mentioned in the Virginia resolutions , ( September 1786 , Annapolis , Maryland . ) Delegates from five States only met . They did not feel authorized to proceed to the proposed business with so small a representation . They , however , agreed upon a report and an address which alleged the necessity of a complete revision of the Articles of Confederation ; and recommended to Congress to invite all the States to send deputies to a convention to meet in Philadelphia the following spring . The admirable address from Annapolis accompanying the report , was written by that truly great man and sterling patriot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general convention met accordingly at Philadelphia . This body soon agreed as to the total inapitude of the Articles of Confederation , and resolved , contrary to , or above their powers , to draw up a NATIONAL CoNsTITUTION , and refer it to the reoRle of the United States for their adoption . After a laborious and anxious sitting of several months , the Convention agreed upon a constitution on the basis of a national union of the people , and not on that of the consent of the State governments . It is well known and often to be reflected upon by every eonsiderate citizen that , for a considerable time , the differences arising from the claims of the larger and more powerfal States , and // the fears of the smaller and weaker ones , appeared to be insuperable , until at length the guidance and blessing of God being every morning invoked by one of his ministers , in the name and by the authority of the Convention , to use the words of Washington , its President , " a spirit of amity and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our political situation rendered indispensable , " was inspired into the minds of its members . Who believes that if this Unions the result of so much anxious and almost despairing labor , should be broken up by the spirit of our times , it could be reconstructed by any human agency ! Who can foresee how we could escape the invariable fate of insane and degenerate re-publics ! Immediately on the adoption of the present Constitution and the construction of the government under it , new hopes of auspicious times sprung up as if by enchantment in the heart of the country , from one end of it to the other . Its effects were instantaneous and almost magical . They resembled those of the halcyon bird of the ocean when he lights on its stormy bosom . The tempest ceases to rave , the heaving billows subside , the sun reiippears , and naught but a genial and life-giving zephyr plays over its surface . Immediately on its adoption , factions were struck dumb , confusion " stood ruled , " sectional jealousies were allayed . The blessed word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patriotism resumed its sway . " It was not a victory over the Lion of Nemea or the Boar of Erymanthus , but a peaceful triumph over every difficnlty . A brilliant dawn suffused the horizon of the State . A splendid aurora arose to gild the prospect of the future . Even dullness itself ? , throwing off for a passing moment , its lethargy , seemed to catch a glow of enthusiasm , " and to anticipate the time when the American Eagle would , one while , winnow the breezes of the Atlantic and at another hover over the quiet waters of the Pacific . Washington was recalled from his retirement , where he had been obscured from the view of mankind by the gloom and distractions of his country , and himself and his counti*y were remitted to their title to Revolutionary fame . Commerce at once spread its sails to the winds . " The ploughshare glistened in the furrow . " Public credit was revived . The erection of a national government by the people of America , with ample powers to raise revenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navies , to declare war and make peace , to negotiate treaties of amity and commerce , with lEash-23 // ington at its kead arrested the attention and wonder of European nations . Our diplomatic representatives were immediately received with marked honor at every court in Europe , and our flag was hailed by the people in every part of the globe . In the spirit of our glorious sires , let each citizen of the Union carry in his bosom and as a frontlet on his forehead " to be seen and read of all men , " a pledge that should it ever be necessary to strike in its defense against domestic foes or foreign enemies , he will rush to fight or fall if it may be , in the victory that shall establish it for ever !
