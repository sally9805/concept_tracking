NEW ENGIANDER . No . XL . NOVEMBER , 1852 . ART . 1. - QUESTION AND ANSWER ; OR , THE INQUISITIVE DISPOSITION OF THE YOUNG CONSIDERED AS SUGGESTING THE FIRST NATURAL STEPS IN EARLY EDUCATION . Familiar Science , or the Scientific Explanation of Common Things . Edited by R. E. PETERSON . Philadelphia , 1852 . THE Bushmen of Southern Africa have often been described as constituting the very lowest degree in the scale of human degradation . Some fanciful philosophers , adopting the theory that all higher orders of animals have been developed from the lower , ( and of course bound to look upon themselves as only a more intelligent kind of baboon , ) have set down the poor Hottentot in their zo6logical system , as still holding the intermediate state between the man and the monkey . Thus according to the theory of the speculative naturalist , as well as the legendary reports of early travelers , the wild wanderer of the Karroo , in his present transitionary state , must exhibit some such physiological paradox as may be everywhere seen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail of a tadpole still adhering to the legs of a frog . An English traveler in Southern Africa , attempting to describe in the strongest terms this mental and moral degradation of the Bushmen , declares that to his inexpressible astonishment , he found them destitute of all rational curiosity . They could be excited to anger or fear as brutes can , but the desire for knowi // edge simply for the pleasure of knowing , he could not discover that they possessed at all . And he gives some striking instances showing their extreme stolid and brutish indifference . On one occasion , when the oxen which drew the heavy wagons of the travelers were turned loose at evening , they wandered off so far in search of water or pasturnge , that in the morning they could not be found . The company were detained from pursuing their journey until the evening of the second day , while Hottentots were sent off in different directions in search of the fugitives . At last the oxen were found and brought back , reaching the camp at evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had returned previously from their ineffectual search , sitting and lying upon the ground around the fire . Those who had suicceeded , came in and took their place with the rest . But they said not a word of their success or of the toils and perils they had encountered in two days of exposure without provisions or protection , in a country infested with lions and parching with drought . Those who were already sitting upon the ground within the circle , did not ask a question of the last returned , whether they had been successful or not . When or where or how the oxen had been found , or whether found at all , seemed to be as indifferent a matter to them as to the brutes themselves . On another occasion , when the company had made their encampment for the evening , and the shadows of the night had closed thickly around them , suddenly the distant horizon began to redden with a strange and terrific light . Higher and higher it ascended , till the clouds all the way up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then half of the dome of the sky " like one vast furnace glowed , " and the other half , by the contrast , was veiled in a deeper and more awful gloom . The parched herbage of the Karroo , the South African prairie , had been kindled by some accidental spark , and the conflagration , fanned by the breeze which itself had created , with its waVes and spires and columns of pointed and rolling and convoluted flame , was sweeping across the plain , like a battalion of cavalry in full charge . It was a spectacle of such wild and terrible magnificence as the eye of man is seldom permitted to behold . But the poor IJottentots did not so much as turn their heads to look at a scene which a civilized man would travel a hundred miles to witness , and count himself paid for the toil . The Ilottentots showed as little curiosity as the lean dog that crouched beside them and shared their evening meal . Such utter indifference to a spectacle of such surpassing interest to a cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justness of the classification which places the Hottentot at the very lowest degree in the scale of human degradation . And we thus judge , from an instinctive feeling , that the descending scale of brutishness in man can be carried no farther , than to deprive him of all rational curiosity-all desire to know simply for the pleasure that knowledge confers-all desire to see simply for the satisfaction that a sight of beauty or magnificence must un part . And if we are correct in thus incidentally deriving a standard by which to fix the lowest grade in the scale of human debasement , it will enable us with ease to determine the highest reach of human culture . And upon this principle , we should pronounce that to be the most highly endowed and cultivated mind , which is most keenly and intelligently sensitive to all the influences exerted upon it by the surrounding world . He must have attained to the highest degree of mental culture , whose soul is most enraptured by the beauties , inspired by the harmonies , and both awed and elevated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion may be true , the word nature must be understood in no restricted sense . It must include in its widest signification the inward susceptibility to receive impressions from both moral and physical forces from without , and the external world in all its countless adaptations to the internal constitution of mind and heart . It must embrace the offspring of these correspondent relations , as well as the relations themselves . The golden and glorious world to which a justly disciplined and creative imagination gives a " local habitation and a name , " is as much a part of nature as the mountains and the streams , the wilderness and the ocean , the cataract and the storm , the fragrance-breathing flower , the gay plumaged-bird , and the " human face divine . " And the most delicate and decisive test of the degree of mental culture , is furnished by the degree of just and discriminating sensibility which any one possesses to the voices of music , and the incentives to lofty aspiration , and the lessons of sacred knowledge which all these address to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed so low in the scale of degi-adation , is , that the sweet influences of beauty , and the thrilling interest of perilous adventure , and the awe-inspiring power of grandeur and magnificence , can not stir his dull and brutish mind with a single emotion . His neighbor of the Caifre race , under the stimulus of a much less exciting scene than that to which we have referred , will extemporize the loftiest and most figurative eloquence and poetry . And his eloquence and poetry are only the rude utterance of the teachings of nature , in the midst of which // he , like the Hottentot , has lived , hut to which , he , unlike the Hottentot , possesses a keen sensibility . The Caifre is consequently vastly superior to the Ilottentot in all the qualities which constitute the natural strength and excellence of hutinanity . The illustration will serve to introduce the subject which has been suggested in part by the title of the hook standing at the head of this article . A " Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent sensibility to all the influences which the surrounding creation is adapted to exert upon his mind . It should provide means for a constant right employment of that sensibility , by cultivating the habit of close and correct observation , and thus ensuring to the learner an ever increasing knowledge of the familiar aspects and phenomena of nature . And thus also , while it gratifies curiosity by both stimulating and answering enquiry , it should prove a welcome guide in pointing out to the young , the first sure steps toward the attainment of the highest mental and moral culture . Such is the object of this book . Its aim is to answer in a brief , correct and intelligible manner , a multitude of those questions , which the young learner will be sure to ask in some form , on awaking slowly to the consciousness of possessing an intelligent being , and finding himself surrounded with countless objects and influences to solicit his attention , and call forth his enquiries . And the book is designed to confer a double advantage in suggesting the question as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persevering habits of enquiry , not only by answering such questions as arise involuntarily , but also by supplying a multitude of others , by the solution of which the young learner will be equally interested and profited , though unable of himself to devise or express them . The object is certainly a good one ; and whether successfully accomplished or not in a first decisive attempt , the method of instruction adopted in the volume , deserves especial attention from all on whom is devolved the responsibility of guiding the early and the progressive development of the youthful mind . We all are or should be students , and the great business of life is to learn ,  --  to treasure up wisdom from whatever sources it can be obtained ,  --  to cultivate the purest and noblest aspirations in our souls ,  --  to habituate our minds to the most accurate observation of all truths within our reach , and to a practical familiarity with the principles of the most refined and impartial judgment . The instrumentalities for carrying forward this allimportant work of self-education , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued , and as numerous as the opportunities afforded to acquire new truths , or new evidence with which to confirm the old . Some of these instrumentalities are costly and difficult of acquisition , and consequently within the reach of but a few . And when secured , they often produce results disproportioned to the exertion they have cost . The cabinet of antiquities , so full that it shall bring up the dead past in living representation before us , can be found only in royal or national collections . Libraries , containing the written wisdom of all ages and all nations upon their loaded shelves , involve the expense of a princely fortune , and years of* research in collecting ; and then the life and the intellect of one man can do little more than master the briefest table of contents . But there is one vast volume , the possession of which is the birthright of every intelligent soul born into the world . It is ever lying open before us , inviting our study . Its pages are illumined all over with gorgeous light ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the decorations of art ; and it is so plainly written that he who runs may read , and the wa*faring man need not err therein . It is the book of nature . It is the vast and infinitely diversified volume of the Creator 's works . The first time our eyes fulfill for us their appointed function of vision , they must reveal to our wandering gaze some portion of that vast scroll which is written within and without by the finger of God . As we grow older , delighting more and more in the habit of observation ; as we come to the exercise of reason and the faculty of speech ; we find that we have everything to learn , and that everything has some secret knowledge which we shall be both pleased and profited in possessing . Study therefore by the simple process of direct observation , becomes the first and most agreeable exercise to the mind of the child . His senses are all fresh and keen , and he desires to keep them ever employed in enquiring out the nature of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes under his observation . lie feels , in common with his vigilant guardians of the nursery , that he has made some very important advances in the acquisition of " useful knowledge , " when he has learned that fire will burn , that knives will cut , that heavy bodies will fall unless held up , and that his own body forms no exception to the general rule . Much to his displeasure , he is often held back by the affectionate caution and anxiety of others , from persisting in many " exploring expeditions , " and many perilous experiments which he is eager to make in search of " useful and entertaining knowledge . " For the desire of knowledge is his ruling passion , and he will give himself , and // those about him , no rest , till either the desire is gratified , or quenched within him . And it is the surrounding sensible world ,  --  the world of nature , of reality in distinction from fiction or theory , that he most desires to explore . The inordinate craving for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domain of truth is shut against him , or that he has no patient and faithful guide to take him by the hand , and lead him forth into the broad and boundless fields of nature , teaching him to behold with a discriminating eye , and to adore with a grateful heart , the beauties and the glories which creative might has strewn all around him . The first instinctive impulse in the opening mind of the child , is to study the forms and phenomena of the natural world , and to ask , with most commendable perseverance and simplicity , the reason for everything . " What makes the rain and the snow , the night and the morning ? Where does the light come from ? What keeps the stars from falling ? Where does the sun go when it is night ? Why does the winter come , and why can not the summer stay always ? What makes the flower seeds come up ? flow does the bird fly , and who taught her to build her nest ? " Such questions are asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking them , until his patience is wearied out because he gets no answer , or his sense of duty or his fear of punishment compels him to keep silence under the stern command , to " hold his tongue . " And in the fact that the developing mind of the child is always pressing such enquiries , there is a reason , there is a deep philosophy , which it ill becomes children of a larger growth to disregard . Such questions show clearly what are the most inviting subjects of study . and what are the most fruitful sources of knowledge , not only to the young but to those who often conceal their incompetency to explain " things familiar , " by falsely telling the more ingenuous child , that they are " to make little boys and girls ask questions . " It were well if that habit of asking questions about things of common occurrence from the simple desire to know more about them , were carried into maturer years . It were well that that youthful desire to make a multitude of enquiries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely silenced by stern command , or misled and tantalized by answers more false and frivolous than the questions , were ever encouraged and cultivated , by affording it its rational and legitimate gratification . It were well that that perfectly natural and commendable disposition in the young , were never rebuked or stigmatized as a meddlesome and impertinent curiosity . Suppose that the child , as soon as he begins to manifest the // desire for knowledge , were encouraged by receiving in an appropriate form all the instruction he seeks . Suppose him to be led along from his youth up by parents , and teachers , and friends , who listen with patience to all his enquiries , help him to the expression of those that he could not make out alone , stimulate him to frame others which he never would have devised without assistance , and make every one an occasion for unfolding to the eager learner , the lesson taught by every object in the surrounding world , and every event in each day 's history of life . Would the spirit of enquiry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew older ? Would he , from indifference or satiety , shrink back from exploring the wonders and the glories of the material creation , while yet every additional enquiry answered , supplies new incentive , to make others , and every step of progress in the acquisition of knowledge , only convinces him that there is infinitely more to learn ? Would it be possible for one thus instructed from his earliest youth , ever to sink down into such a state of mental inaction , as almost to cease to observe and to enquire , and con* sequently to cease to learn ? Would it not rather become a principle with him to enquire after the reason of everything , and to search it out in all its connections and consequences ? Would not his faculty of observation , from long exercise , become so acute and active , that he would discover new objects of enquiry , as constantly as the old were sufficiently known ? It is by no means easy to answer such questions decisively* by adducing instances in which the experiment has been fully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who has had the full advantage of a system of instruction , so perfectly adapted to meet and satisfy the instinctive desires and necessi* ties of his developing mind , and to suit every degree of his growing capacities . Parents and teachers have been instructed , and have attained their own present habits of thinking and of observation , under the influence of the same false system of repression and denial , which is still famishing the fresh activities , and frowning down the rational curiosity , and quenching the new fire of awakened thought and restless enquiry , in the young. - The little child gazes from a window upon the cloud which " the sunbow 's rays arch with the many hues of heaven ; " clapping his hands with his light-hearted glee , he calls his best friend to share with him the pleasure of beholding the sight . But he can not long be satisfied with seeing . lie would know the cause . And his first question is , " mother , what makes the rainbow ? " But the fond mother asked the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . Wearied with // the vain search after knowledge , which none could help her to gain , she at last gave over the toil , and became content , like others , to live in the midst of a world of wonders , and no longer ask how they came , or for what end they were appointed . If she had the opportunity , as she grew older , to learn something of the philosophy of nature from the cramped and desiccated formulas of books , it could not atone for the first neglect . For when once the first instinctive desire for acquaintance with the living forms , and the loud voice of nature was suffered to die out , it could scarcely be kindled again by theoretic textbook , teacher , and schools . What was then learned , was a task , and as such , was painfully remembered and willingly forgotten . The mother , when herself a child , had the same spirit of true philosophy which she now sees revived in the desire of her own child , to know the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither answered nor rightly directed ; and consequently now she either is unable to answer the questions of her young pupil , or she thinks it a matter of very little consequence to do so . And so it is with most . Either they can not explain the most common and familiar phenomena of the visible world for the young , or they think it of very little importance to do so . And the consequence is , that the young , as they grow up to mature years , gradually cease to enquire into the nature of things , that are constantly passing under their observation . They gradually become indifferent to the forms and voices and influences of the natural world , and in the end , the whole surrounding creation is to them destitute of life and expression and beauty . Now the first step towards adopting a plan of early instruction , which shall prevent this confessedly undesirable consequence , must be a firm conviction on the part of all , that the consequence results from neglecting the lessons of truth , and therefore is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance from childhood to manhood , this world , so glorious and beautiful to the eye of youth , need not change into a dull and dead monotony of the same unvarying aspects , the same never increasing stores of knowledge . The objects to awaken and sustain an intelligent and commendable curiosity , are as numerous and inviting to the man , as to the child . The amount of knowledge possessed at any one time , compared with what may be still acquired after all our utmost experience and research , is so small , that with just reason , the greatest of philosophers might seem to himself , as he declared , to have been all his life but as a little child , playing upon the sea-shore , gathering up here and there a more beautiful shell or pebble , while // the great ocean of truth lay all unexplored beyond . There is a boundless ocean of truth-inviting and elevating , as well as practical truth-ever within reach of all , yet all unexplored . The combined and multiplied activities of this most active age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more closely to view , all the truths , displaying the constitution and laws of the physical world , and yet those who have gone farthest in the work of observation and of actual discovery , form the highest estimate of the riches of knowledge that still lie unexplored in the secret archives of nature . To those who already know most of the boundless creation ever open for our inspection , its fields of res&amp;hrch appear most inviting . They are led on in their investigations by the most sustained and satisfactory interest . To them , the whole surrounding world is most fully animate with the myriad forms of life , and most profusely adorned with its many shapes and hues of beauty . To them , the fields of research which have been most fully explored , are still ever new ; and the new are most familiar , from the fact , that they exhibit in different connections the harmonious action of the same laws , which have been already most frequently observed . The most enlarged and accurate experience of the philosopher , concurs with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature bounds as from her birth , The sun is in the heavens , and life on earth ; Flowers in the valley , splendor in the beam , Health on the gale , and freshness in the stream , Immortal man ! behold her glories shine , And cry , exulting inly , they are thine I " It is not simply the poet , with his more active sensibility , yet less instructed mind , who is enthusiastic in extolling the pleasure and the improvement to be constantly secured in the study of the works of nature . It is the most profound philosopher , who remonstrates most earnestly against the common indifference to the exhaustless stores of instruction , and the unfailing sources of pure and ennobling satisfaction , that may be obtained from a careful study of objects and phenomena most frequently brought under our observation . It is . the teacher of the most sacred truths , and the expounder of the most awful mysteries in revelation , who , if he possesses a mind duly trained to seize and appropriate all available means of instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Creator addresses his creature man , will be most ready to say , to those who receive the divine law from his lips ,  --  // " 0 ! how canst thou renounce the boundless store Of charms which nature to her votary yields ? The warbling woodland , the resounding shore , The pomp of groves , and garniture of fields ; All that the genial ray of morning gilds , And all that echoes to the song of even ; All that the mountain 's sheltering bosom shields , And all the dread magnificence of heaven ; 0 I how canst thou renounce , and hope to be forgiven ? " But we must not permit our interest in so definite and practical a subject , to dissipate itself in mere generalities of expression . Let us follow out in some of its details , 4a possible way of securing a better cultivation of the sensibilities of the heart , and a more full and natural development of the powers of the mind . It will be admitted on all hands that it is desirable , as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that buoyancy of feeling , and that ever active desire to know more of everything , which are so characteristic of youth . To gain such a result will be admitted to be one of the iml ) Ortant ends of education . And if it ever is gained , it must be done in accordance with some system by which the principle of rational curiosity in the child is cultivated , not quenched . He must therefore be taught from the earliest dawn of intelligence , that the world into which he has been born , is full of life , of meaning and of beauty . With the utmost care must he be guarded against relapsing into that dull and hopeless indifference , which looks upon the form and constitution of the visible world , as if they were utterly accidental , or unintelligible , or without design . If he has books , and can read them , it is.well . But on no account should he fail to be taught to read the great book of nature , which ever lies open before him . Teach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed page , and that therefore he does well to study it with the greater diligence . Teach him that it is highly appropriate and commendable in him , to ask for the meaning of everything , for everything has a meaning ; everything in some manner discloses its design ; everything is filling its appointed place in the universal system of the Builder and Maker of all . For example , let any one who would fulfill the office of instructor to the child , upon occasion direct his attention to some varied and beautiful landscape , such as thousands gaze upon every day of their lives from their own door . Here , then , is presented in one view , an illuminated chapter in the book of the Creator 's works . Perhaps it is one of the ten thousand valleys embosomed among the hills of our own New England . The neighboring heights are shaded with green woods . Their // 503 sloping sides are enlivened with flocks , cropping the fresh pasturage or ruminating beneath the grateful shade of scattered trees . The vale itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winding stream , murmuring with the cheerful notes of the insect and feathered tribe upon the wing , basking in the glorious light of the noonday sun . Now let the young student of nature be assisted first to take in , at one general view , the prominent outlines of such a scene , until his mind is sensibly impressed with its beauty , and his curiosity is awakened to present the question , how it came so , and what it all means . Then assure him that that is a most reasonable enquiry for him to make . For it all has a meaning , and though without speech or language , yet may its voice be heard . All the innumerable parts , and the general arrangement and relation of the whole panorama upon which he is gazing , are the result of intelligent design , as much as every shade and figure upon thecanvas , where the painter has spent wearisome days and months , in giving expression to ideal forms of beauty existing in his own mind . Teach the young observer that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all have come into being for a specific purpose ; all have assufned their present shape and relations in concurrence with appointed conditions ; all are still obeying invariable laws of being , and that therefore chance , disorder , accident or mystery can have nothing to do with them . The naked and seamless granite , crowning the hill ; the tilted strata of more recent rock , outcropping trom the terraced slopes ; the rough and coarsely abraded bowlder , standing alone upon the plain ; the rounded pebbles lining the bottom of the brook , have all received the original elements of their constitution , and have attained their l ) resent form and position , in the fulfillment of an intelligent design , and in accordance with invariable law . And therefore it is a commendable curiosity in the child , which prompts him to point to the great rock standing alone in the midst of the plain , and ask how it came there . Nor is his question answered , when he is told that " it was always so . " For it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety , to answer all the questions of the little philosopher , about the constitution and order of things in the natural world , by only telling him that " God made all things-God brings all events to pass , " - He did-He does . But he permits , he requires us to know much of the manner in which many things were brought into their present state , arid much of the means by which many events are brought to pass . The instructor who would rightly guide the development of // the youthful mind , must not treat the many questions of the young learner , as if they were of little moment . He should rather make it an object of study with himself to answer them to the fullest degree , that the present attainment of human knowledge will permit . And if the young pupil propose questions that are frivolous , as he certainly will sometimes , rather than rebuke him by forbiddiug his asking any , teach him to ask such as will lead him to new discoveries , and higher attainment in knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation of a single landscape , as supposed above , show him that it is not by accident that the gentle stream winds through the valley , lending fertility to the soil and beauty to the landscape . Show him that it is not an idle errand , on which the whispering breeze is sent , as it fans the heated brow of the weary husbandman , toiling in the hot sun , or resting beneath the shade of the green oak , thus wafting the fragrance of the ripening grain to its owner , and cheering him on to continued labor by the promise of approaching harvest . Teach the young learner , and if necessary teach him again and again , and by illustration , a thousand-fold varied , that there are lessons of wisdon* for him to acquire , in all the multiplied forms of vegetable life , from the feeble flower that shrinks and dies in the first breath of autumn , to the hardy oak against which the storms of a century have beaten in vain . Show him by familiar example , that in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the careful observer within the compass of any such landscape , there are equally countless evidence of infinite wisdom for him to study and admire . Assure him that the very voices of the natural world are intelligible to the reflective mind ; that the forms which it assumes are designed , and the uses which they subserve are beneficent . Cultivate in him the well.grounded impression , that he has but to open his eyes and observe wherever he may , in order to find something new to learn . He has only to attempt to enumerate the varying aspects which life assumes in the creation around him , to find that they surpass all computation . The philosophy of the drop of water taken from the pool by the roadside , combining an accurate analysis of its constituent element , together with the natural history of its million of inhabitants , might be made the study of a life . Thus he is encompassed with the idea , if not the reality , of infinity , on every side . The burnishing of the plumelet upon the insect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend . The distance of the star , that appears in the sky no bigger than the glow-worm in the meadow , is so great that he can not appreciate the difference between it and // double the amount . The whole substance of animal and vegetable bodies is organized and definitely arranged down to such a minuteness of division , that no natural sight or the magnifying power of optical instruments , will enable him to observe or to appreciate the reality . The whole mass of the earth which he treads , with its seemingly confused conglomeration of rocks , and hills , and plains , and streams , and oceans , is yet arranged from the surface down into its fathomless depths , in as definite and orderly a succession , as the leaves of a book , which when bound presents a continuous history or the words of a sentence , which when uttered expresses an intelligible thought . Teach the young enquirer by actual examples of things that are passing under his own observation , that such are the exhaustless stores of knowledge , ever inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of such a fearful and wonderful creation , that he is to live . Lead him along step by stel ) , in that very method of study , which affords the desired employment to his new and uncloyed senses , and his ever active spirit of observation . And will the child so instructed grow weary of learning as he grows older ? While every effort in progressive study receives a richer reward , and the ten thousand voices of nature are ever inviting him to new fields of enquiry , will he , in the silly cant of the cloistered boarding school , talk of " finishing his education ? " Will he count it a relief , when he is " no longer under a schoolmaster , " who can so successfully combine study and recreation , as to secure for him at once the pleasures and the advantages of both ? When the first few years of life are past , and the animal spirits have lost a little of their early buoyancy , will he " smoke-dry , and sere , and shrivel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his days in petty cares , and *ensual pleasures , and thoughtless indifference to the countless sources of instruction , which are still within his reach ? It may be objected to this method of inculcation , that it is " all mere fancy ; " or that it may do well enough in some possible cases , as a means of cultivating the taste and imagination , but that it can accomplish very little in the work of practical , common sense education . To such an objection it should be sufficient to reply , that this method of developing the youthful , and constantly storing and strengthening the mature , mind , is the most natural of any that can be conceived . It is cornplying with the suggestions of the intellectual nature of man , as strictly as it is obeying the laws of his bodily constitution , to supply food to sustain the animal life , in answer to the demands of appetite . And the plan of training the youthful mind , by first cultivating the habit of intelligent observation , upon outward // phenomena and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction ; since it first makes the child acquainted with things that he first desires and needs to know . And it leads him forward in a course of continual improvem*t , and with un* flagging interest , by employing his hearing , and his sight , and his touch , and all his faculties of observation , in increasing his store of useful knowledge , at that very time of life , when those senses and faculties are most keen and eager to be employed . And it ever teaches him first of all , the nature of the things with which he has most to do , and the laws of his own being , which he is under the most urgent and perilous necessity to obey . Such a system of instruction ought to take precedence of all others , for the very reason that it is most practicaltends most directly to answering the demands of every day life . The " fanciful , " the theoretical , the unnatural system of instruction , must be that which shuts up the child to the heavy task of burdening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his instinctive yearning for some further knowledge of the world of observation , and of sensible reality , by telling him that " little boys and girls must not ask questions . " They must sit up straight and still on their seats , and learn the lesson of words well from the hook , but not be inquisitive about things or thoughts-not trouble the kind teacher by asking about the pretty flower they found in the meadow , or how it is that the fly climbs up so nimbly on the smooth glass of the window , or how the spider spins the beautiful silk with which he weaves his geometric web in the corner ! Surely the most unnatural , unpractical , system of education , is the one which leaves that early , instinctive yearning alter the knowledge of the causes and principles of " things familiar , " to expend itself in fruitless and misdirected endeavor ; and instead of rightly directing and cultivating that desire , imposes the heavy and unwelcome task of learning words and forms that are arbitrary , and often in themselves most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young pupil has lost all interest in study of any kind , or has become so habituated to the repetition of the form of words as to take them for knowledge , and to be satisfied with them , undertakes to teach him systems of philosophy , so conceived as that the observable facts and realities of nature seem to be made for the book , quite as much as the book for them . The most unnatural , unpractical system of education , surely must be the one which thus leaves the child 's desire and faculty for observation unemployed , until it almost dies of inanition , and then , in the few whose thirst for knowledge can not be so easily quenched , seeks at last to revive a // love for nature , by means of formulas , and theorems , and demonstrations , rather than by the actual sight of its forms of beauty , and by the sound of its voices of gladness . The actual observation of nature should certainly be taught first , for the double reason that the faculty of observation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptibility to impressions from the visible world through the senses is keen and ever-active , before the ability to demonstrate or to understand a demonstration , has come into being . When the child is old enough to be attracted by the beauty of the flower and to enquire its name , then he is old enough to be taught more fully to observe its symmetrical proportions , its physiological structure , its laws of growth , distribution , propagation , and decay . When he has become inquisitive enough to ask how the bird flies , that is nature 's warning , that it is the times to teach him something of her mechanics , her laws of action and reaction , the principles of muscular force and motion , and the structural arrangement of limbs . When he asks what becomes of the birds in winter , and how the wild animals live when the earth is covered with snow ; then it is time to teach him something of the habits and instincts of animals , the climatic variations which govern their distribution and modes of subsistence throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into so high a region of philosophy as to prompt the enquiry , " where raisins come from , " he is not to be hushed by telling him that " he will know more about such things when he is older . " The question itself is nature 's method of showing that it is just the time for the young enquirer to be taken in imagination to the sunny vales of France or the vine-clad hills of Spain , and thus to be taught something that he will remember of the culture of the grape , the character and historic interest of the country and its inhabitants . When the child , at the approach of winter , is all impatient for the streams to be covered with crystal ice , and the hills to be whitened with the mantle of snow , and he asks many questions when , and how it will all be ; then is the time to explain to him something of the chemistry of heat and cold , evaporation and condensation , the mode and order of meteorological changes , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more , when the young pupil asks , as thousands have done , what keeps the stars in their places , '  --  and how far off they are , and whether they all shine to give light to the earth ; then is the time to teach him his first most impressive and lasting lesson upon the beauty , order , and magnificence of the Creator 's works , as displayed in the starry heavens . And he needs no books , diagrams or de // monstrations to help him understand what he most needs to learn , in his first exercise in astronomy . Lead him forth beneath the open sky . Choose the season when the disappearance of life below leaves the mind the more free for the contemplation of the worlds above . Go forth upon a winter 's night , when the earth , concealed in its dazzling robe of snow , increases the cold and cloudless transparency of the air , and the air itself , by its multiplied reflections , causes the sky to appear at the first glance , as if every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light . Direct the young learner to fix his eye intently upon some on&amp; quarter of the heavens , and thus see that though the actual number of the stars is much less than appears at first sight , still there are more renainin* than he can easily enumerate , and the apparent confusion disappears at once . Assure him that those little shining points preserve the same order , the same relative position , which they held when man 's first enquiring gaze was turned towards the heavens . There they stand , retired to such a distance within the silent and awful depths of infinite space , that human thought can not travel so far , " Though void of wing it rove Through the vast concave of the ethereal round . " Their goings forth are from of old , and the station held by each in the host of heaven , is still the same . While all things earthly fade and pass away , they still shine on , in the same undimned and seemingly eternal glory . The whole order and aspect of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set up anew , under the crushing footsteps *f time . But the clouds and the tempests of earth have not quenched the light of one of those orbs or shaken one from its appointed place . Arcturus and his sons are still circling around the pole , as they were , when the Almighty bade the complaining patriarch lead forth that prince of the ethereal host on his destined way . At his appointed hour , Orion still climbs the steep ascent of the heavenly path to the zenith . The seasons are still marked upon the glittering belt of Mazzaroth . Let the young observer , while contemplating the order , the constancy , the deep silence of the stars , be assured that though they have no speech nor language " to ears of flesh and blood , " yet is their voice heard . The tribute of praise which they render to the great Creator , by their beauty , order , and everlasting silence , as clearly and constantly declares his immutable perfection , as they could , were each permitted to send // through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , proclaiming the Almighty Maker 's name . But it may be that while the young observer is tasking his mind to grasp the deep meaning expressed by the constancy , regularity , and unbroken silence of the starry worlds above him , he is suddenly startled by what seems to him the brightest of all the host of heaven , rushing athwart the sky with furious speed , breaking the relative order and harmony with which each maintains its position , and conforms its motion to that of the whole firmament of stars , withdrawing attention from them by its own terrific glare of light , giving forth , perhaps , a sound as of rushing waters or of distant thunder , and then disappearing in darkness . He pauses in silence as if revolving the question , " can that be a lost world ? Is it thus that the Almighty hurls the sons of the morning from their thrones of light ? " But while he is still saddened and almost aifrighted by the thought , you bid him look for the space that has been left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone in the canopy of night . And he sees that " the night has not lost a gem . " Not a single ray has faded from her ancient glory . She still moves on , in the same solemn silence , her train still glittering with the same magnificent garniture of worlds . That seeming star , which emblazoned so wide a track across one half of the heavenly arch in its fall , was no more , in distance and dimensions , when compared to one of those still shining orbs , than the dew-drop of the morning which scarcely bends the slightest blade of grass , is to the ocean that rolls its measureless waters upon the shores of every land . Show the young student of nature 's mysteries , that , after its brief passage , when his eye looks again calmly into the blue depths of night , he can still see , far beyond the region where the meteor flames and expires , far beyond the path of the solar light , the same stars , shining with the same serene and awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the heavens . " Help him to lay open his mind to the full power of such a scene ; and then he has his first and most lasting lesson , in the most sacred and sublime of all the sciences . And to learn that lesson , the young astronomer needs no exhausting calculus , no spacepiercing telescope , no elaborate treatises . He need not count up constellations , and label the stars by numerals or alphabets . He must not associate with the sacred fires , the awful silences , and the sun-peopled immensities of infinite space , the debasing monstrosities of a pagan mythology . He must rather learn devoutly and reverently to trace the footsteps of an intelligent // Almighty Power , wherever His goings forth have been displayed in the creation of worlds . If the youthful enquirer be educated from the first dawn of intelligence , from the first manifestations of a rational curiosity , thus to study the works of creation , the world will never cease to seem to him to be clothed with divine beauty , and to resound with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will feel himself to be surrounded by innumerable forms of life . Whatever he beholds in the diversified field of nature , he will find expressive of intelligent design . However destitute of books or of teachers , he will still find within his reach , countless sources of instruction . He will not think himself vie Iding to the vagaries of an unrestrained imagination , if he finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , sermons in stones , and good in everything . Rather by cultivating the habit of thus interpreting nature , he will kindle in his own heart the sacred fire of that soft and impersonating devotion of prophets and psalmists of the ancient time , who addressed inanimate things , as if they were a living and conscious soul pervading every element ; as if every mountain and hill and tree of the forest possessed a tongue , and all were exalting the praise of Him " whose name alone is excellent , whose glory is above the earth and heaven . " We come then to this one conclusion , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , should be educated and should educate themselves , to the study of the laws , the phenomena and the objects of the visible creation , is , that they all speak of their Creator . They all exalt his greatness and display his glory . It is not merely the language of figure or of fancy when we say , that all things around us and within us , are full of Him . The dull clod beneath our feet , as well as every grade of organized being , and the immaterial essence of the deathless mind , declare the majesty and the love of Him whose great name is emblazoned on all his works ,  --  who manifests himself in the lowest and most sluggish creature that crawls the earth , as well as in the immortal faculties of the human soul . It is not a human , nor a profane , but a holy , a divine philosophy , which teaches man the nature of the beings that live , and of the substances that exist , and of the laws that are acting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such instruction , leads him to a better understanding and a more earnest contemplation of the One great Being who made them all . It is by the aid of such a philosophy , baptized in the light of revelation , that our condition in this world is to be made most to resemble that first state of happiness and of purity , when man held converse with // angels , and heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden of Paradise . If we avail ourselves sufficiently of its aid , even now , we shall be ready to behold the Creator in every creature into which he has breathed the lweath of life , in every shape , hue , and dimension of matter which he has formed . And when we cast our eyes over the widening landscape , the valley , the rivet ' , the plain , the harvest , upward to the hills , and then far above to the wide-arching heavens , illumined by the splendor of that one great orb in whose light , to our vision , the mingled radiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , with humility as well as with rapture , may we exclaim " My Father made them all . Holy is his name . The whole earth is full of his glory . The wide world which we inhabit is but a living temple for his praise . "
