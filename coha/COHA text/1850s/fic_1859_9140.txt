Preliminaries Title Page GIFTS OF GENIUS : A Miscellany OF PROSE AND POETRY , BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVENPORT . Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1859 , by C. A. DAVENPORT , In the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York . Main text I. BY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS . When I was in Venice I knew the Marchesa Negropontini . Many strangers knew her twenty and thirty years ago . In my time she was old and somewhat withdrawn from society ; but as I had been a fellow-student and friend of her grand-nephew in Vienna , I was admitted into her house familiarly , until the old lady felt as kindly toward me , as if I , too , had been a nephew . Italian life and character are different enough from ours . They are traditionally romantic . But we are apt to disbelieve in the romance which we hear from those concerned . I can not disbelieve , since I knew this sad , stern Italian woman . Can you disbelieve , who have seen Titian 's , and Tintoretto 's , and Paolo Veronese 's portraits of Venetian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Venice ? I was an American boy ; and my very utter strangeness probably made it easier for the Marchesa Negropontini to tell me the story , which I now relate . She told it to me as we sat one evening in the balcony of her house , the palazzo Orfeo , on the Grand Canal . II . The Marchesa sat for a long time silent , and we watched the phantom life of the city around us . Presently she sighed deeply and said : " Ah , me ! it is the eve of the Purification . My son , seventy years ago to-day the woman was born whose connection with the house of Negropontini has shrouded it in gloom , like the portrait you have seen in the saloon . Seventy years ago to-day my father 's neighbor , the Count Balbo , saw for the first time the face of the first daughter his wife had given him . The countess lay motionless  --  the flame of existence flickered between life and death . " Adorable Mother of God ! ' said the count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restorest my wife , my daughter shall be consecrated to thy service . ' " The slow hours dragged heavily by . The mother lived . " My brother Camillo and I were but two and four years older than our little neighbor . We were children together , and each other 's playmates . When the little neighbor , Sulpizia Balbo , was fourteen , Camillo was eighteen . My son , the sky of Venice never shone on a more beautiful girl , on a youth more grave and tender . He loved her with his whole soul . Gran ' Dio ! ' t is the old , old story ! " She was proud , wayward , passionate , with a splendor of wit and unusual intelligence . He was calm , sweet , wise ; with a depthless tenderness of passion . But Sulpizia inherited her will from her father , and at fourteen she was sacrificed to the vow he had made . She was buried alive in the convent of our Lady of the Isle , and my brother 's heart with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow bounds of the convent discipline . But her religious education assured her that that discipline was so much the more necessary , and she struggled with the sirens of worldly desire . The other sisters were shocked and surprised , at one moment by her surpassing fervor , at another by her bold and startling protests against their miserable bondage . " Often , at vespers , in the dim twilight of the chapel , she flung back her cape and hood , with the tears raining from her eyes and her voice gushing and throbbing with the melancholy music , while the nuns paused in their singing , appalled by the religious ecstasy of Sulpizia . She was so sweet and gentle in her daily intercourse that all of them loved her , bending to her caresses like grain to the breeze ; but they trembled in the power of her denunciation , which shook their faith to the centre , for it seemed to be the voice of a faith so much profounder . " While she was yet young she was elected abbess of the convent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the Count Balbo may have sometimes regretted that solemn vow , but he never betrayed repentance . Perhaps he would have been more secretly satisfied by the triumphant worldly career of a woman like his daughter , but he never said so . " Sulpizia knew that my brother loved her . I think she loved him  --  at least I thought so . " The nuns were not jealous of her rule , for the superior genius which commanded them also consoled and counselled ; and her protests becoming less frequent , her persuasive affection won all their hearts . They saw that the first fire of youth slowly saddened in her eyes . Her mien became even more lofty ; her voice less salient ; and a shadow fell gently over her life . The sisters thought it was age ; but Sulpizia was young . Others thought it was care ; but her duties could not harass such a spirit . Others thought it was repentance ; but natures like hers do not early repent . " It was resolved that the portrait of the abbess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents to select the artist . They , in turn , consulted my brother Camillo , who was the friend of the family , and for whom the Count Balbo would , I believe , have willingly unvowed his vow . Camillo had left Venice as the great door of the convent closed behind his life and love . He fled over the globe . He lost himself in new scenes , in new employments . He took the wings of the morning , and flew to the uttermost parts of the earth , * and there he found  --  himself . So he returned an older and a colder man . His love , which had been a passion , seemed to settle into a principle . His life was consecrated to one remembrance . It did not dare to have a hope . " He brought with him a friend whom he had met in the East . Together upon the summit of the great pyramid they had seen the day break over Cairo , and on the plain of Thebes had listened for Memnon to gush with music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together they had travelled over the sea-like desert , breaking the awful silence only with words that did not profane it . My brother conversing with wise sadness  --  his friend Luigi with hope and enthusiasm . " Luigi was a poor man , and an artist . My brother was proud , but real grief prunes the foolish side of pride , while it fosters the nobler . It was a rare and noble friendship . Rare , because pride often interferes with friendships among men , where all conditions are not equal . Noble , because the two men were so , although only one had the name and the means of a nobleman . But he shared these with his friend , as naturally as his friend shared his thoughts with him . Neither spoke much of the past . My brother had rolled a stone over the mouth of that tomb , and his friend was occupied with the suggestions and the richness of the life around him . If some stray leaf or blossom fell forward upon their path from the past , it served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my memory , ' he would say , touching his portfolio , which was full of eastern sketches . These are the hieroglyphics Egypt has herself written , and we can decipher them at leisure upon your languid lagunes . ' " It was not difficult for my brother to persuade Luigi to return with him to Venice . I shall not forget the night they came , as long as I remember anything . " The Marchesa paused a moment , dreamily . " It was the eve of the Purification , " she said , at length , pausing again . After a little , she resumed : " We were ignorant of the probable time of Camillo 's return ; and about sunset my mother , my younger sister Fiora , and I , were rowing along the Guidecca , when I saw a gondola approaching , containing two persons only beside the rowers , followed by another with trunks and servants . I have always watched curiously new arrivals in Venice , for no other city in the world can be entered with such peculiar emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recognized my brother , and was fascinated by the appearance of his companion , who lay in a trance of delight with the beauty of the place and the hour . " His long hair flowed from under his slouched hat , hanging about a face that I can not describe ; and his negligent travelling dress did not conceal the springing grace of his figure . But to me , educated in Venice , associated only with its silent , stately nobles ; a child , early solemnized by the society of decay and of elders whose hearts were never young , to me the magnetic charm of the young man was his youth , and I gazed at him with the same admiring earnestness with which he looked at the city and the scene . " The gondolas constantly approached . My brother lay lost in thoughts which were visible in the shadow they cast upon his features . His head rested upon his hand , and he looked fixedly toward the island on which the convent stands . A light summer cloak was drawn around him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . His cap was drawn down over his eyes . He was not conscious of any being in the world but Sulpizia . " Suddenly from the convent tower the sound of the vesper bell trembled in throbbing music over the water . It seemed to ring every soul to prayer . My brother did not move . He still gazed intently at the island , and the tears stole from his eyes . Luigi crossed himself . We did the same , and murmured an Ave Maria . " Heavens ! Camillo ! ' cried my mother , suddenly . He started , and was so near that there was a mutual recognition . In a moment the gondolas were side by side , and the greetings of a brother and sisters and mother long parted , followed . Meanwhile , Camillo 's companion remained silent , having respectfully removed his hat , and looking as if he felt his presence to be profane at such a moment . But my brother turned , and taking him by the hand , said : " Dear mother , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I have hoped to find a friend like this . ' " His companion smiled at the generosity of his introduction . He greeted us all cordially and cheerfully , and the light fading rapidly , we rowed on in the early starlight . The gondolas slid side by side , and there was a constant hum of talk . " I alone was silent . I felt a sympathy with Camillo which I had never known before . The tears came into my eyes as I watched him gently conversing with my mother , turning now and then in some conversation with Luigi and my younger sister . How I watched Luigi ! How I caught the words that were not addressed to me ! How my heart throbbed at his sweet , humorous laugh , in which my sister joined , while his eyes wandered wonderingly toward mine , as if to ask why I was so silent . I tried to see that they fastened upon me with special interest . I could not do it . Gracious and gentle to all , I could not perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a new sorrow . " So we glided over the Lagune into the canal , and beneath the balconied palaces , until we reached our own . The gondolas stopped . Luigi leaped out instantly upon the broad marble pavement , and assisted my mother to alight , then my sister . Then I placed my hand in his , and my heart stood still . It was a moment , but it was also an age . The next instant I stood free upon the step . Free  --  but bound forever . " We were passing up the staircase into the palace , Luigi plucked an orange bud and handed it to me . I was infinitely happy ! " A few steps further , and he broke an acacia for my sister : ah ! I was miserable ! " We ascended into the great saloon , and a cheerful evening followed . Fascinated by these first impressions of Venice , Luigi abandoned himself to his abundant genius , and left us at midnight , mutually enchanted . Youth and sympathy had overcome all other considerations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to show us his sketches . It was not until our mother asked of my brother who he was , that all the human facts appeared . " Heavens ! ' shouted my younger sister , Fiora , laughing with delight , think of the noble Marchese Cicada , who simpers , per Bacco , that the day is warm , and , per dieci , that I am lovelier than ever . Viva Luigi ! Viva O il pittore . ' " My daughter , ' said my grave , cautious mother , you are very young yet  --  you do not understand these things . Good night , my child ! ' " Fiora kissed her on the brow , and darted out of the room as if she were really alive . " When she had gone , Camillo smiled in his cold , calm way , and turning to me , asked how I liked Luigi . I answered calmly , for I was of the same blood as my brother . I did not disguise how much superior I thought him to the youth I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , and hoped the young man would come often to see us , and be very successful in his profession . " Then I was silent . I did not say that I had never lived until that evening . I did not say how my heart was chilled , because , in leaving the room , Luigi 's last glance had not been for me , but for Fiora . " Camillo did not praise him much . It was not his way ; but I felt how deeply he honored and loved him , and was rejoiced to think that necessity would often bring us together ; only my mother seemed serious , and I knew what her gravity meant . " Do not be alarmed , dear mother , ' I said to her , as I was leaving the room . " My daughter , ' she answered , with infinite pride , it is not possible . I do not understand you . And you , my daughter , you do not understand yourself nor the world . " " She was mistaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again the Marchesa was silent and tears stood in her eyes . She was seventy years old . Yes , but in love 's calendar there is no December . " The days passed , and we saw Luigi constantly . He was very busy , but found plenty of time to be with us . His paintings were full of the same kind of power I felt in his character . He never wearied of the gorgeous atmospheric effects of which Titian and Paul , Giorgione and Tintoretto were the old worshippers . They touched him sometimes with a voluptuous melancholy in which he found a deeper inspiration . " Every day I loved him more and more , and nobody suspected it . He did not , because he was only glad to be in my society when he wanted criticism . He liked me as an intelligent woman . He loved Fiora as a bewitching child . " My mother watched us all , and soon saw there was nothing to fear . I sought to be lively  --  to frequent society ; for I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice and Luigi . He had given me a drawing  --  a scene composed from our first meeting upon the Lagune . The very soul of evening repose brooded upon the picture . It had even an indefinable tone of sadness , as if he had incorporated into it the sound of the vesper bell . It had been simply a melancholy sound to him . To the rest of us , who loved Camillo , it was something more than that . In his heart the mere remembrance of the island rang melancholy vespers forever . " This drawing I kept in a private drawer . At night , when I went to my chamber , I opened the drawer and looked at it . It lay so that I did not need to touch it ; and as I gazed at it , I saw all his own character , and all that I had felt and lived since that evening . " At length the day came , on which the parents of Sulpizia came to my brother to speak of her portrait . Camillo listened to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could understand Sulpizia , and therefore paint her portrait . The parents were satisfied . It was an unusual thing ; but at that time , as at all times , a great many unusual things could be done in convents , especially if one had a brother , who was Cardinal Balbo. * I use , here , words corresponding to the Marchesa 's . IV . " It was a bright morning that Camillo carried Luigi in his gondola to the convent . He had merely said to him that there was a beautiful abbess to paint , an old friend of his ; and Luigi replied that he would always willingly desert beautiful waters and skies for beautiful eyes . They reached the island "  --  The Marchesa beat the floor slowly with her foot , and controlled herself , as if a spasm of mortal agony had seized her . " They reached the island , and stepped ashore into the convent garden . They went into the little parlor , and presently the abbess entered veiled . My brother , who had not seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil ; and as calmly as ever told her briefly the name of his friend , said a few generous words of him , and , rising , promised to call at sunset for Luigi , and departed . " The Marchesa now spoke very rapidly . " I do not well know  --  nobody knows  --  but Sulpizia raised her veil , and Luigi adjusted his easel . He painted  --  they conversed  --  the day fled away . Sunset came . Camillo arrived in his gondola , and Luigi came out without smiling . The gondoliers pulled toward the city . " Is she beautiful ? ' asked Camillo . " Wonderful , ' responded his friend , and said no more . He trailed his hands in the water , and then wiped them across his brow . He took off his hat and faced the evening breeze from the sea . He cried to the gondoliers that they were lazy  --  that the gondola did not move . It was darting like a wind over the water . " The next day they returned to the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not come to the gondola . Camillo waited , and sat until it was quite dark . Then he went through the garden of the convent , and inquired for the painter . They sought him in the parlor . He was not there . The abbess was not there . Upon the easel stood her portrait partly finished  --  strangely beautiful . Camillo had followed into the room , and stood suddenly before the picture . He had not seen Sulpizia since she was a child . Even his fancy had scarcely dreamed of a face so beautiful . His knees trembled as he stood , and he fell before it in the attitude of prayer . The last red flash of daylight fell upon the picture . The eyes smiled  --  the lips were slightly parted  --  a glow of awakening life trembled all through the features . " The strong man 's heart was melted , and the nuns beheld him kneeling and weeping before the portrait of their abbess . " But where was she ? " Nobody knew . There was no clue  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camillo took the portrait and stepped into his gondola . He returned to the city , to the palace of Sulpizia 's parents . Slowly he went up the great staircase , dark and silent , up which his eager steps had followed the flying feet of Sulpizia . He entered the saloon slowly , like a man who carries a heavy burden  --  but rather in his heart than in his hands . " It is all that remains to you of your daughter , ' said he in a low voice , throwing back his cloak , and revealing the marvellous beauty of their child 's portrait to the amazed parents . Then came the agony  --  a child lost  --  a friend false . " Camillo returned to us and told the tale . I felt my heart wither and grow old . My mother was grieved in her heart for her son 's sorrow  --  in her pride for its kind and method . Fiora did not smile any more . Her step was no longer bounding upon the floor and the stairs , and the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , Camillo returned to the island . The abbess had not returned , nor had any tidings been received . Only the gondola had been found in the morning in its usual place . The days passed . A new abbess was chosen . The church did not dare to curse the fugitive , for there was no proof that she had willingly gone away . It might be supposed  --  it could not be proved . Camillo hung in his chamber the unfinished portrait , and a black veil shrouded it from chance and curious eyes . He did not seem altered . He was still calm and grave  --  still cold and sweet in his general intercourse . " My friendship with him became more intimate . He saw that I was much changed  --  for although pride can do much , the heart is stronger than the head . But he had no suspicion of the truth . People who suffer intensely often forget that there are other sufferers in the world , you know . Camillo was very tender toward me , for he thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and often begged me not to wear away my health and youth in commiseration for what was past and hopeless . I cultivated my consciousness of his suffering as a defence against my own . We never mentioned the names of either of those of whom we were always thinking ; but once in many months he would call me into his chamber and remove the veil from the portrait , while we stood before it as silent as devotees in a church before the picture of the Madonna . Camillo pursued his affairs  --  the cares of his estate  --  the duties of society . He assembled all the strangers of distinction at his table . Yes , it was a rare and great triumph . " For myself , I was mistress of my secret , and I reveal it to you for the first time . Why not ? I am seventy years old . You know none of the persons  --  you hear it as you would read a romance . My heart was broken  --  my faith was lost  --  and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I distrust the sweetest smile if it move me deeply , and although men may sometimes be sincere , yet sorrow is so sure that we must steer by memory , not by hope . In this world we must not play that we are happy . That play has a frightful forfeit . Society is wise . It eats its own children , whose consolation is that after this world there is another  --  and a better , say the priests . Of course  --  for it could not be a worse . V. " Suddenly Sulpizia returned . My brother was in his library when a messenger came for him from her parents . He ran breathless and pale to his gondola . The man was conquered in that moment and the wild passion of the boy flamed up again . When he reached the Balbo palace he paused a moment , despite himself , upon the stairs , and the calmness of the man returned to him . Nature is kind in that to her noble children . Their regrets , their despairs , their lightning flashes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Every man is weak , but the weakness of the strong man is hidden . He entered the saloon . There stood Sulpizia with her parents . " Death and victory were in her eyes . They were fearfully hollow ; and the strongly-carved features , from which the flesh had fallen during the long struggles of the soul , were pure and pale as marble . It seemed as if she must fall from weakness , but not a muscle moved . " Nothing was said . Camillo stood before the woman who had always ruled his soul , to whom it was still loyal . The parents stood appalled behind their daughter . It was a wintry noon in Venice  --  cold and still . " Camillo , ' said Sulpizia at length , in a tone not to be described , but seemingly destitute of emotion  --  as the ocean might seem when a gale calmed it  --  he has left me . ' " Child , I have not fathomed the human heart ; but after a long , long silence my brother answered only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sacrifice : " Sulpizia , will you marry me ? ' " Cardinal Balbo arranged the matter at Rome , and after a short time they were married . I was the only one present with the parents of Sulpizia , who were glad enough so to cover what they called their daughter 's shame . My mother would not come , but left Venice that very day and died abroad . The circumstances of the marriage were not comprehended ; but the old friends of the family came occasionally to make solemn , stately visits , which my brother scrupulously returned . " You may believe that we enjoyed a kind of mournful peace after the dark days of the last few years . I loved Sulpizia , but her cheerfulness without smiling was the awful serenity of wintry sunlight . She faded day by day . It was clear to us that the end was not far away . " Two years after the marriage , Sulpizia was lying upon a couch in the room behind us , where you have seen the veiled portrait which hung in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors were open and we sat by her side , talking gently in whispers . I knew that death was at hand , but I rejoiced to think that much as he had suffered , there was one bitter drop that had been spared him . " Sulpizia 's voice was scarcely audible , and the deadly pallor deepened every moment upon her face . Camillo bent over her without speaking , and bowed his head . I stood apart . In a little while she seemed to be unconscious of our presence . Her eyes were open and her glance was toward the window , but her few words showed her mind to be wandering . Still a few moments , and her lips moved inaudibly , she lifted her hands to Camillo 's face and drew it toward her own with infinite tenderness . His listening soul heard one word only  --  the glimmering phantom of sound  --  it was Luigi . ' " His head bowed more profoundly . Sulpizia 's eyes were closed . I crossed her hands upon her breast . I touched my brother  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , and sunk slowly , senseless by the couch . " VI . Think of it ! The birds sing  --  the sun shines  --  the leaves rustle  --  the flowers bud and bloom  --  children shout  --  young hearts are happy  --  the world wheels on  --  and such tragedies are , and always have been ! I sat with the old Marchesa upon her balcony , and listened to this terrible tale . She tells it no more , for she is gone now . The Marchesa tells it no more , but Venice tells it still ; and as you glide in your black gondola along the canal , under the balconies , in the full moonlight of summer nights , listen and listen ; and vaguely in your heart or in your fancy you will hear the tragic strain .
