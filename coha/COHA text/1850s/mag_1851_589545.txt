POLITICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . MAJOR-GENERAL AARON WARD , OF NEW-YORK . GENERAL AARON WARD , of Westchester County , New-York , has long been known to the public as one of those unwavering democrats of the old school , whose guiding star through the storms and ( larkuess of political life , is principle , and who therefore holds a straight course , uninfluenced by the thick fogs of false theories engendered by time-serving demagogues , or the false lights hung out by concealed enemies to lure patriots to destruction . During the sectional storm which swept over the democratlo party in the last presidential campaign , the blue lights of Van Burenism , more successful than those of the Hartford Convention , lured to destruction many a less clear-sighted statesman than Gen. Ward . His steady patriotism , based on the revolutionary traditions of his family , saw only in the general welfare of the whole Union , flowing from the federal constitution , an object worthy of political effort . His , therefore , is an example of value , and a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonial Government , a large tract in Westchester county , on the Hudson , composed the manorial estate of Frederick Philips , a tory . This estate being forfeited in consequence of his attainder , a portion of it , including the present village of Sing Sing , was purchased , in 1785 , by Moses Ward , the father of General Aaron Ward . Where there are now many flourishing towns , at that time there were but three dwellings , one of which was the old stone fortress which had long been a place of refuge for the settlers during the Indian wars , and which became the dwelling of the purchaser . The family of Moses Ward was one of the oldest settled in the country . Its members had been conspicuous on the side of the people in the disputes of the crown . One of them fell at Saratoga , an officer in Philip Van Courtland 's regiment . While Moses took an active part in the great struggle for liberty , he married the niece of Colonel Drake , of the Continental army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward inherited his republican ardor . With the view to the profession of the law , Aaron Ward , at an early age , was placed under the charge of the Rev. Mr. Nelson , principal of the Mount Pleasant Academy , and then entered the law office of Alexander M'Donald , Esq. , an eminent lawyer . Ere he had made much progress , however , in his profession , all the fire of his ancient republican blood burst forth at the declaration of war with Great Britain , and he instantly abandoned the library for the camp . The Secretary of War being at Albany at the time , Governor Tompkins procured him a lientenancy in the 29th regiment of infantry , and he was ordered to report for duty immediately . Lieutenant Ward , on his arrival in Albany , to report for duty , and to commence his military career , was in his eighteenth year . He was offered the appointment of aid to Gen. Brown ; but learning that a conditional promise of the same office had been made to Lieutenant Spencer , ( son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the late Chief Justice Ambrose Spencer , ) notwithstanding that in the opinion of the governor he was entitled to the post , Lieutenant Ward regarding the claims of Judge Spencer on the executive as superior to his own , magnanimously declined in favor of Lieutenant Spencer , who subsequently fell at Lundy 's Lane . Gov . Tompkins then procured for Lieut . Ward a staff appointment in the 29th regiment , who , however , preferring active service , was , at his own request , removed into the line . One or two incidents of his first campaign will illustrate his character as a brave soldier . in August , 1813 , while the army under Gen. Hampton was on the march towards Montreal , Lieutenant Ward , with a company of picked men , was sent forward as an advanced guard . Not far from the American lines they saw the enemy , and pressing on to meet them , were saluted with a sharp volley from an advance force . A second and a third volley ensued , but nothing daunted , the gallant band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Halt ! ready , my lads ! steadily , coolly . Let every ball tell . Fire ! " and springing to the front , he shouted , " Forward ! quick march ! charge ! " The brave men , not a whit behind their brave leader , scattered the enemy like chaff . The rout was total , and the retreat of the British so prompt , that their dead and wounded were left on the field . On the 25th of November , a division of the same army , then under command of Col. Purdy , broke up its encampment before sunset , with a view of reaching the Chateaugay river , in the rear of the enemy . They had orders to cross and commence the attack at one o'clock the next day , at which time it was also to be made in front . The division being compelled to march through a dense forest , did not reach the ford in time . Brig . Gen. Izard commenced the attack , and drove the enemy from the out-posts . But finding that Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , could not bring his men into action , he withdrew his brigade , and orders were sent to Col. Purdy to construct a bridge and cross the river . But before this could be accomplished , the enemy fell on his command , threw them into confusion , and many of his officers fled ingloriously from the field . In this emergency , Lieut . Ward , with a few brave companions , uniting with Col. J. E. Wool and the officers in command , rallied the men and brought them into action . Lieut . Ward found himself at the head of a company of a hundred men , with only one officer to assist him . The enemy being repulsed , renewed the attack at ten o'clock P. M. , and continued it till morning . The gallant conduct of Lieutenant Ward during that fearful night , elicited the highest approbation of his superiors , and the next day he had the honor of leading the rear of the army safely into camp . In 1814 , he was promoted to a captaincy . On the 29th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under General Wilkinson , concentrated at Champlain , preparatory to marching against the enemy , then in Canada , 2,500 or 3,000 strong . The march began at an early hour in the morning . Lieut . Scofield had been ordered to the right flank , with a command of fifty men . He was instructed to keep at a djstance from the main body , to protect it against scouting parties of the enemy . He was attacked by an advance of the latter , who were securely posted in a forest near which the army should have passed , but for a mistake or the treachery of the guide A halt was ordered , with a view of giving the advance , // then two miles distant , an opportunity to countermarch , and the general in command perceiving the exposed situation of Lieut . Scofield , sent Capt . Ward with a company to his support . Assuming the command , Capt . Ward strengthened his position , and maintained it against a largely superior force ; and ultimately , by a well-directed movement on their flank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he received orders to maintain his position at all hazards ; and he not only did so , but , aftei* a severe conflict , he compelled the enemy to retreat . The limits of this sketch forbid our entering farther into the military career of Gen. Ward . It will be sufficient to say , that he continued in the service till the close of the war , adding new laurels to those already won , and discharging every duty with rigid exactness , and in such a manner as to obtain for him the repeated approbation of his superior officers . At the close of the war , at the head of a battalion , he conducted the first detachment of British prisoners , numbering some six or seven hundred men , from Pittsfield , Mass. , to Canada . His kindness to them on their march , in an inclement season , drew from them an expression of hearty thanks , and they begged him to accept a valuable watch , as a token of their esteem and gratitude . Capt.Ward was , of course , highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vote of thanks , and replied to it , declined receiving the present with which it was accompanied . The circumstances of such an offer are far more gratifying than the most costly presents from crowned heads . The war being terminated , and his services no longer required , Captain 7Vard resumed and completed his legal studies in the office of H. Van Derlyn , Esq. , of Oxford . On his admission to the bar , he returned to his native village , and commenced the practice of his profession . In January , 1820 , he married the only daughter of Elkanah Watson , of Albany , a lady who has always commanded , by her worth and amability , the highest esteem of all who have the honor of her acquaintance . Mr. Watson is well known in the state , as a philanthropist of the noblest order . Capt . Ward was soon afterwards appointed district attorney for Westchester county . On the 1st of September , 1824 , he was elected colonel of a regiment in Mount Pleasant . On the 6th of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 10th of February , 1830 , was promoted to the rank of Major-Gen. by Gov . Marcy , in which rank he is still continued under the new constitution . Devoting himself with patience and perseverance to his profession , he soon attained a high standing at the bar , which in connection with his private worth and great popularity , indicated him as the most fitting representative of his district in Congress , to which he was elected and rechosen six terms , his last term expiring in 1843 . This unusual length of time passed in Congress , indicates how fully he possessed the confidence of his constituency . In the broad field which then opened to the talents of Gen. Ward , he speedily evinced that *ommanding character among the national statesmen which had long attached to him in his own district . Pursuant to his election , Mr. Ward took his seat as a member of the 19th Congress , Dec. 5 , // volunteers , some of them not more than 16 to 17 years of age , without pay , and at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomely acknowledged hy Gen. Macomb , who promised them each a new rifle , as both a reward and a testimonial . This promise was sanetioncd by the department , but no bill to authorize the issue of the arms was got through Congress until Gen.Ward took the matter up , and it was passed , 161 to 58 . Numerous meetings were held in consequence , by his companions in arms , acknowledging his zeal and capacity . In the following year his eloquence , on more than one occasion , drew forth the warm and spontaneous encorniums of the press . The records of Congress show , that during his long membership , Gen. Ward was always the champion for the redress of wrongs ; and no district was ever better represented than w* 5 that which sent him to Congress . The interests of the Union , his state , and his district , were always uppermost ; and he contrived , while serving all , to harmonize their interests . The tariW soon after his entrance into Congress , became the subject of that controversy , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , and the vigorous prod mation of Gen. Jackson . Through all that controversy Gen. Ward maintained the soundest economical principles , siding with the south in her just demands , but firmly supporting Gen. Jackson when the question was of the supremacy of the laws . He was always the friend of home industry , rightly understood , that is , of the just reward of the labor of the country , and not bounties to capital at its expense . His service was active and his vote effective against the black tariff of 1828 . But when that most iniquitous scheme of monopoly and corruption roused the southern blood into resistance , Gen. Ward , although sympathizing with their wrongs , rallied to the support of the executive , but at the same time labored sedulously for the compromise bill of Mr. Clay , which was the remedy . His speech in favor of that bill , was one of the most able of the time , excited as were men 's minds upon that subject . It is known that the manufacturing interest of which Mr. Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in their behalf at the expense of their fellow citizens . He alleged that ten years would place them beyond the need of protection ; and on this allegation Mr. Clay 's compromise was based . The tariff of 1828 was to be reduced every two years , by a reduction , until a horizontal duty of 20 per cent . should be reached in 1842 . This was carried , and Gen. Ward most effectually supported it . Although the compromise was infanmously violated when the time was up , and the tariff of 1842 restored the obnoxious principle of protection , the compromise worked well while it lasted . The alarm and aaitation in relation to nullification was , in 1842 as great as recently upon 6 the slave question , and curiously enough Mr. Van Buren was seeking his own au*randizement in both agitations . Some portions of Gen. Ward 's speech will throw light not only upon the tactics of that day , but evince the bold bearing he always assumed when principle was at stake . " And , Sir , I should not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill at this time , but for the speech which the Hon. gentleman from Georgia Mr. Wilde made a few days since on ths bill , when he took occasion to read a paragraph from a Baltimore newspaper , wherein it was stated that the Governor of the State of New York had written to the friends of Mr. Van Buren in Congress , ' from that State , to vote against this bill . I am now , however , entirely satisfied , frem the explanation which that Hon. gentleman has // since made , and I take great pleasure in making this acknowledgment , that he did not intend to make the remarks he did in any spirit of unkindness . But , Sir , as one of the Representatives of this House from that State , I feel it to be my duty to say , that my vote on this bill will be , as I hope it ever has been , based upon principle , and not influenced , in the slightest degree , by considerations of personal favor to any man . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had a father a candidate for the Presidency , and I believed I should promote , or even secure his election to that high office by voting against a bill , the rejection of which might hazard the prosperity of our free and happy Union , I have no fear that I should hesitate between duty and affection , even in such a case . " * * * 1* * " Sir , there are no men upon the face of the earth more deserving the sympathy of the brave and patriotic , whether we consider the perils to which they are exposed , or the spirit with which they meet it , than the friends of our great Union in South Carolina . Pass this bill , and you save them from a state in which it is to be apprehended they must either engage in deadly strife with their brethren or submit to an usurpation the most cruel and unrelenting . Sir , I confess I am not insensible to this claim on my sympathy , and while I avow my desire , by the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peace to our whole land , I do avow that I am ready to give to the administration of the general government ( as I trust we shall do ) the most ample powers for their protection , that it may be enabled to defend this gallant and patriotic minority from its oppressors , and to save with the shield of the Union those who have dared to be faithful to the Union . " And when an appeal is made to the patriotism of our fellow citizens , in behalf of the institutions of our country , when they are told that their Constitution is in danger , that their peace and prosperity will be blighted , their Republican principles trampled upon , their hopes of happiness in their beloved land for ever blasted-tell them this , and a spirit would go forth , rousing the sons of Liberty in their strength , and millions would go forth and beg the privilege of dying as their fathers died , and of leaving to their children the legacy of a martyr 's name . " * * * " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-government , and on our success or failure hang the hopes of a rising world . There have been governments styled Republics and ruled by tyrants who taught the people that they were free , while the chains were forging for their necks . Rome was a Republic ; but liberty there was only a name for licentiousness or a cloak for despotism . Greece was a Republic while a demagogue swayed the ignorant and deluded multitude , and needed but a sceptre to make him a King . " But where are these Republics ? The sepulchre of nations is inscribed with their epitaph . The flames that consumed their foundations still burn as beacons to warn us of their fate , They perished ( as we must perish , if we ever perish ) by their own hands . Invincible in arms , a world could not enslave them , while the factious spirit of a few spread the elements of discord among the people and rendered them an easy prey to a foreign enemy . And thus it may be with us . Sunder the cords that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , arouse the jealousy and ill will and contention that would naturally spring from such a state of things , and the last ray of liberty is extinguished . " Up to the year 1832 , although Congress had framed many private bills for the relief of the militia-men of the revolution , no general law to meet this case had been passed . In that year a bill came before the House for the relief of those who served prior to 1780 ; that is to say , of those brave militia who fought and won our earliest and most brilliant triumphs . General Ward made one of his most brilliant efforts on behalf of this bill , which aroused all the latent fire of his republican heart , and stimulated his energies and his genius . He remarked : // " I am , sir , for one , exceedingly gratified that it contains a provision in favor of the militia of the revolution . It is well known that the first militia inca started as patriots , and risked everything for their country . And although several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensions to a number of the militia men of the revolution , yet it is much to be regretted that no general provision has been made for that meritorious class . " Nor , sir , can the names of any of these brave militia be found on the pension list , who fought and won the battles of Bunker 's Hill , Trenton , Bennington , Saratoga , King 's Mountain , Guilford Court-House , the Cowpens , or Eutaw Springs . Nor , sir , can the names of any of the followers of Marion , Sumpter , Shelby or Clark  --  to whose gallant achievements an ample page is given in the annals of our revolutionary conflict-be found among those who now share the country 's bounty . " Sir , it is a remarkable fact , and doubtless within the knowledge of all who hear me , that from the commencement of hostilities up to the declaration of independence , and whilst our forces consisted of militia only , our affairs had prospered beyond the most sanguine expectations of the wisest amongst the patriots of that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every enterprise , and had completely frustrated every attempt that had beea concerted against them . " This bill became a law , and was one of the most gratifying of the Con. gressional triumphs of General Ward . It was the expression of a nation 's gratitude to those brave men who laid with their blood the corner-stone of our nationality . In the same year , the important subject of the coast survey came before Congress . That work had hitherto been considered the peculiar property of the army and navy , and its execution had been limited to the officers in those services by law . Under the system pursued , but little had been accomplished . Chiefly through the efforts of General Ward , this subject was brought to the attention of the President . He urged the adoption of the chronometric mode , instead of triangulation , showing the former to be the most prompt , effective , and least expensive . " The coast survey , " said Mr. W. ; " will not be completed , if the method of triangulation is again adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of many millions of dollars , and our navigating interests will derive no earthly benefit from it whatever during all that time . Whereas , if the chronometrical mode should be adopted , ( and he hoped the committee would propose an amendment to the bill to that effect , when it shall have been reported to the House , ) it may be completed in five years , and the results will be of use immediately to the commercial and shipping interests of our country . " Unfortunately the triangulative system was adopted , and the prophecy of General Ward has been fulfilled to the letter . Little or no progress has been made in the survey , while its expense and patronage are annually increasing , and now absorb very nearly $300,000 . That is to say , eighteen years have elapsed , and nearl $4,000,000 been expended since General Ward spoke on the subject , and scarcely any progress beyond verification has been made . What General Ward contended for was a prompt and accurate survey , which should be of use to the commercial interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1834 , a cry had been raised in certain quarters against the West Point Academy , as inexpedient , unconstitutional , and as a hot-bed of aristocracy . The Legislatures of the States transmitted resolutions to Congress for inquiring into the expediency of abolishing it . The matter // was referred to a Committee of the Whole ; Ti . M. Johnson was chairman , and his most able report in favor of the institution was adopted . On the coming up of the appropriation bill , Mr. Dickerson , of Tennessee , moved to strike out the enacting clause . General Ward then delivered a speech in favor of the institution , which put the subject to rest . He showed conclusively the great importance of keeping alive the military spirit of the country , and throwing off annually among the people numbers of young officers , skilled in military and engineering science , and ready on all occasions to give efficiency to that indomitable spirit which , from the first riflecrack at Lexin ton to the last shot in Mexico , has pervaded our national militia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound views of General Ward , is known to all . While that gentleman strongly advocated the preservation of the means of scientific education for officers , in a school open to all , he no less ardently advocated schools for the soldiers . In this view he introduced two resolutions . One was to establish schools at such military posts as should be the station of soldiers enlisted at the ages of sixteen or seventeen , for the purpose of teaching such branches of education as should prepare the soldiers for future usefulness in life . Another was to retain the whiskey portion of the ration , to be paid either in money , equipments , or some suitable badge of honor . Mr. Ward , in enforcing his resolutions , romarke d that schools had been established at some of the military posts for the purpose of teaching the children of the soldiers , but not the soldiers themselves ; and his information led him to believe those schools had done much good . But in consequence of various alleged evils connected with the army , especially that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied . Against efforts to reduce the army , similar to those which had been directed against the West Point Academy , General Ward opposed the force of his argument and eloquence . A bill was introduced in 1842 for the reduetion of the number of privates in the army by about 3000 , leaving the officers the same . This General Ward opposed , in a speech which afforded a valuable exposition of the character , services , condition and importance of the army , as connected with the militia and its various systems in the several states . And coming from the lips of one so admittedly familiar with historical and military science , commanded profound attention . The wisdom of his view is evident in the following prophetic paragraph in the speech : " The chief objection to the reduction had been the state of our foreign relations , especially with England . These had assumed recently a more pacific aspect ; but our relations with Mexico remained the same , or were become even more hostile in their appearance . This was a reason against weakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was to be considered the peculiar situation of opr brethren in the West and South-west , whose wishes seemed very much opposed to the reduction , especially of the mounted corps . " Four years subsequently , the storm which , with the eye of the statesman , he then saw in the horizon , burst upon the couyitry , which did not fail to benefit by the means he had advocated in relation to volunteers , to the West Point Academy , and the efficiency of the army . Pursuant to that enlightened view of our national resources for defence , which did not restrict itself to the prejudices of a soldier of the // " regular army , " although he himself had been one of its bravest members , General Ward recognized the fact that ours is a citizen soldiery ,  --  the best , the cheapest , and as brave as any in the world ; and while he sup. * ported the nucleus of science in the Academy , and a small regular force , he gave full weight to the importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clearly laid before Congress in 1836 , upon several occasions , in connection with the service of volunteers in Florida , and the Blackhawk war . The statesman-like views then laid down contrast favorably with the vacillating conduct of certain officers high in command in the Mexican war , who , while professing the most narrow-minded contempt for volunteers , built their fame and fortune on their blood and bravery . Although on all occasions he was the firm and zealous friend of the army , he never allowed his predilections for that arm of the service to blind him to the importance of the other . On the contrary , when , in 1841 , Mr. M'Kay , of North Carolina , moved to strike out the enacting clause of the navy appropriation bill , General Ward stepped promptly forward to its defence . He advocated the placing of that arm on an cf-li. cient footing , and to increase the pay , more particularly in respect of our West India connections . That net-work of intrigue which England has for so many years been weaving in the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he reminded the House that not only were English agents at work in Texas , Mexico , Mosquito and Cuba , but that the army of 10,000 black troops in the service of England , and oflicered by whites , had been recently increased to 25,000 . That pretended mail steamers , in the pay of the English Government , were accumulating in the Gulf ; ready to transport those black troops , and that no opposing American force was there to assert our rights , protect our shipping , or defend our coast . He remarked : " By reference to the map of the West India mail lines , it will be seen that , in our present defenceless condition , a force composed of armed steamers and troops of that description would not only give great annoyance to our coast , hut most effectually and at once put a stop to all communication around Cape Florida , or through the passes of the West Indies , to or from the Gulf of Mexico ; and , consequently , the commerce of the great valley of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or its vast productions , cut off from market , be rendered valueless . " Such being the present attitude of the two nations , " said Mr. Ward , " it seemed little less than folly to delay preparing for defence . It seemed to him that to put off preparation for a moment longer , while we were engaged here in acting on subjects of infinitely less moment , was unworthy of the country and its cause . If we are to expect justice from any power , we must put ourselves in a condition to resent injustice . " Throughout that long and severe contest against the corrupt power of the National Bank , which commenced under the administration of General Jackson , and was not effectually destroyed until the defeat of Mr. Tyler 's " fiscality , " General Ward was the open , bold , fearless and unremitting adversary of a government bank , in all its aspects . Possessed of great financial knowledge , and clearness of perception , he was never misled by change of plan or alteration of names . Fully convinced of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " in all its shapes , And scorned them all " // In 1841 , the party newly come to power , after twelve years ' retirement , rushed recklessly into alterations of all that had been done , or that had grown up under the three previous administrations . The Independent Treasury law was repealed ; the public lands distributed among the States ; a special session of Congress called , at great expense ; projects for new loans put forward ; internal improvement schemes projected , and every means of exhausting the treasury adopted , in order to make a pretence for breaking the solemn pledge of the government in relation to the Tariff compromise , and returning to the protective theory . Here again General Ward was found the firm supporter of the Jackson policy , which had been so triumphantly sustained by the people . In his speech of July , 1841 , he thus ably sketched the course of affairs in relation to the Tariff : " At the session of 1827-8 , this project , thus recommended , was brought before Congress . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat here , and he was proud to say that he voted ngainst it ; but the measure , after a warm contest , prevailed . This odious act-well called at the time the bill of abominations ' - passed this House by the ominous majority of eight votes ; the same majority by which the House , at this session , have passed the land bill-another hasty and ill-advised measure , which was destined in like manner to public condemnation . He well remembered , he said , the sensation produced in this body by the annunciation of the final vote on the passage of the bill . There was the stillness of death in the hall while the Clerk was reading the yeas and nays ; and when the Chair pronounced that the bill had passed , the deepest excitement prevailed here . He well recollected that , on this occasion , a representative from the South , who was justly esteemed for moderation and dignity of character , as well as for intelligence , rose , under great excitement , from his seat , and declared in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many around him , that this oppression was too much to bear , and that he was prepared to advocate secession rather than submit to it . What followed in South Carolina and elsewhere , in consequence of the passage of this odious law , forms a part of the history of the country . It was deemed oppressive , and an abuse of the powers of government , and the people were everywhere resolved on its repeal or modification . It was not only oppressive and odious to the people at large , but it was soon found to be injurious to the very interests which it was designed to benefit . By inducing large investments of capital , and creating an undue competition in several branches of manufactures , it had the effect to embarrass and break down many establishments that were previously in a thriving condition . So loud were the complaints of the country against this act , that it soon underwent a revision . The act of the 14th of July , 1832 , was passed , to take effect on the 3d day of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being still unsettled as to this subject , and general dissatisfaction prevailing in the country in regard to the existing tariff , Mr. Verplauck , at the session of 1832- ' 33 , brought forward his bill for its modification . The subject attracted universal attention , and the public mind was deeply agitated by the various considerations connected with it . The happy result of the deliberations of the session was the passage of the act of March 2 , 1833 , to modify the several acts imposing duties on imports , commonly called the compromise act . ' Mr. W. would now give some facts in reference to the history of this act , which would , he hoped , independently of the considerations which he before presented , render it apparent to the committee that it ought not to be disturbed at the l ) resent time . He would be able to show that the faith of the government was pledged , in the most solemn manner , that it should not be disturbed before the 13th June , 1842. * * * * * * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impressive circumstances ; which was sustained on a principle of mutual accom // modation to all the interests affected by it ; which allayed the discord and discontents that then distracted the Union , and which had the approbation of so large a majority of both Houses of Congress , and the concurrence of the executive department of the government , could hardly be regarded as an ordinary act of legislation , which we were at liberty to alter at pleasure . He submitted that it was impolitic and improper to infringe upon the provisions of an act passed under such solemn sanctions . But it is urged on the other side , that one of the provisions of the compromise act is , that nothing in it contained shall be so construed as to prevent the passage , prior or subsequent to the 13th June , 1842 , of any act or acts that may be necessary to detect , prevent or punish evasions of the duties on imports imposed by law , nor to prevent , in the contingency either of excess or deficiency of revenue , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties under the revenue acts . They allege , further , that the contingency thus provided for has happened ; and that it is necessary to alter the rates of duties , in order to supply a deficiency in the revenue . But Mr. W. contended that there would be no deficiency , unless the administration chose to maKe it by alienating a portion of the revenue to objects unconnected with the expenditures of the government . It certainly could not be contended that a deficiency thus created was such a one as the bill contemplated . " The bill under consideration provided for a tax on coffee and tea , and an increased tax upon sugar , under the name of luxuries . Firmly and heartily did General Ward denounce this burdening of the enjoyments of the poor throughout the land , in order to feed the extravagance of government-jobbers . The faith of the government was , however , broken , and in the Tariff of 1842 the system of monopoly was restored . In the following year , 1843 , his Congressional term having expired , he declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , the Constitution of the State of New-York was to be revised , General Ward was of course nominated as a member of the Convention . This honor he declined , hut such was the enthusiasm of the people of the county whom he had served so long and so faithfully in Congress , that he was induced to withdraw his declination . His election followed , as a matter of course . In relation to the judiciary and the finances of the State , he displayed , in brilliant speeches , his great ability . Although alive to the importance of the internal improvements of the State , he advocated their prosecution in such a way as to relieve the River Ccunties of New-York from too oppressive a taxation for their construction . His constituency were by no means backward in appreciating the great merits of their Congressional delegate , and on the expiration of each succeeding term for which he was elected , the enthusiasm in his favor increased in fervor , and enhanced majorities , ranging , after the first election , from 1,300 to 1,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony of public confidence . In making extracts from the numerous speeches of a long career , we have been attracted less by the flowers of his brilliant eloquence , than by those remarkable passages which disclose the profound forecast of the statesman . General Ward acquired , while in Congress , a high reputation as a presiding officer . In discharging the duties as Chairman in Committee of the Whole , but few men possess greater tact in the despatch of public business , or in preserving order in debate . Although not ambitious of being heard on any question , he spoke on all proper occasions ; and whenever he rose , he shed light upon the subjecI* he discussed . // Throughout his whole career Gen. Ward afforded an eminent ex ruple or the patriot . Prompt and eager to offer his blood in defence of his country , and when peace rendered such efforts no longer necessary , his unremitting labors in the cabinet displayed the true character of an American statesman . A practical representative of the interests of his district-by every inhabitant of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighboring commercial emporium , which is indebted to him for eminent exertions in behalf of many commercial measures .
