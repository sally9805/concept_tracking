ARTICLE IV. - CIIINA AND THE CHINESE . IT is a singular circumstance , which has not failed to attract remark , that the Atlantic cable seems to have been laid for no other practical end , so far as we on this side the ocean are concerned , than to let us know , a few days earlier than we should otherwise have learned it , that a treaty had been concluded with China by the two greatest European powers ; a treaty which promised the attainment , at last , of the purpose of long years of peaceful diplomacy and warlike endeavor , in the laying open of that vast and populous empire to the knowledge of . Europe , and the influence of European ideas . Certainly , no other event of the century has had so costly and conspicuous an instrumentality provided for its announcement . And although , in an age of cool-headed reason and contempt of omens like the present , we shall hardly be allowed to draw from this fact the inference that no other event of the century has been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without danger of serious contradiction , that it stands prominently forward among the great events of the time , and that its bearings require to be carefully studied ; the more so , on account of the acknowledged difficulty of the subject . More discordant opinions than may be found recorded respecting China , the character of its people , the value of their institutions , their accessibility to trade , their capacity of adopting new ideas and new forms of social and political life , the possibility of their reception into the brotherhood of nations-if it be not impertinence in us , wrangling and mutually exclusive set that we are , to talk of our fraternity , and of admitting into it a member as big , and many times as old , as all the rest of us together-more discordant opinions than have been expressed upon such points as these , even by the well informed , it would not be easy to find put forth upon any other similar subject . We by no means suppose that anything we can say will go far toward reducing this discordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal , we must have our word upon whatever the // world is talking most about , whether it shall prove to be wellsaid or ill-said . Perhaps we may be able to bring forward facts , or present views , which will enable some minds to arrive at juster and clearer judgments than they would otherwise form respecting the Celestial Empire and its inhabitants . We candidly warn our readers , at the outset , that we feel a strong inclination to side with the Chinese in their present difference with the rest of mankind , so far as a regard for the rights of the case shall not forbid it . We wish to take the most favorable view that we can of all that concerns them ; to allow them credit for all that is justly their due , and to look with compassion and indulgence upon their short-comings and faults ; to place ourselves , in short , in as close sympathy with them as shall be found possible . Various potent considerations move us to this . Feelings of gratitude , in the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit over that cup , of all cups the most social and cheering , and the most harmless withal , and not feel within him a warm glow of something like affectionate good-will toward a country which has given , and which alone continues to supply , such a gift to man and womankind ? Can that part of earth 's surface , after all , be truly said to have cut itself off from communion with the rest , from contributing intimately and efficiently to their pleasures , which in so many and so widely scattered homes fills the steaming urn with its enlivening beverage ? What shall we say , farther , of silk and porcelain , as contributions to the material comfort of the race ? We will not insist too strongly upon the Chinese inventions of the mariner 's compass , gunpowder , and the art of printing , since , while some of them may be claimed to have done nearly as much mischief as good in the world , we can not trace their origin , as possessions of our own , directly and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon mankind silk , porcelain , and tea , we might almost regard as having done its fair part , and allow to build up as high a fence as it pleased about itselt ' , even at the risk of shutting out much sunlight , and to be happy within in its own chosen way . Again , we can not help feeling a great respect and admira // tion for a country which has had such a history as China . The remarkable character of the spectacle it presents among the nations of the earth is not seldom remarked upon , but can not be too often or too impressively called to notice . China was one people and one kingdom a thousand years before that dim and half-mythical period when the Greek heroes led their followers to the siege of Troy , and it has maintained ever since , unbroken , the identity of its language , its national character , and its institutions . What changes , what overturnings and reconstructions , has not every other part of the world had to undergo during that interval of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face does stability seem to have reigned , while revolution has been elsewhere the normal order of things . We say deliberately stability , not inaction . China has known during all that time as constant action , often as violent commotion , and in many respects no less real progress , than other countries : had it been stagnant only , had there not been in it a healthy vital action , it must long since have perished in inanity and putrescence : but , far from that , China has seen within the last two hundred years one of its happiest and most prosperous periods . Here is a problem for the student of history of which the interest can not easily be overstated . How have the Chinese succeeded in finding and maintaining the stable equilibrium which other races have vainly sought ? Is it in their character , or their peculiar external circumstances , or in the wisdom with whiclt they have harmonized the two , that their strength has lain ? As we look upon this venerable structure , fhe sole survivor of all the fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olden time , we can hardly help wishing that it might have been left to stand until it should fall of itself ; that the generations to come might have seen whether there yet remained in it enough of the recuperative energies which had already more than once raised it from an estate far lower than that into which it was seeming now to be fallen , to give it a renewed lease of its old life , a return to its ancient prosperity and vigor . That is now no longer possible . China was able , by the force of her superior gifts and culture , to overbear and assimilate the wild tribes of the northern and // western deserts , her only conquerors hitherto : but now an element is being forcibly introduced into the workings of her history which can not be thus dealt with , which must either leaven or destroy her . This is another , and a principal reason , why we feel impelled to plead the cause of the Chinese . They are undergoing subjection to an influence which is irresistible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even existence , is , to say the least , extremely doubtful . All the power of the West is arrayed together against them , and they are but as infants in the hands of us wise , daring , and rapacious children of Europe , armed with the terrible engines of destruction which our ingenuity has supplied to our combativeness . They must needs yield ; it is only a question of time , of the forbearance or the mutual jealousies of their antagonists . And does the right of the question lie so entirely upon our side as we are ready to persuade ourselves ? For whose advantage is it that the western world is striving to break its way into China ? Primarily , of course , for its own , and not for that of the Chinese . We want more of their silk , their tea , their thousand articles of pleasant and profitable trade ; and we do not wish to pay for them in hard cash , making only one profit ; we desire that they in turn should buy what we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that China will be the gainer by thus dealing with us . Free trade , brotherhood of nations , spread of civilization , are not these the universal regenerators , the forerunners of the millenium of culture ? Are not we vastly richer , stronger , braver , more virtuous , more enlightened , more progressive , than those poor Chinese ? Do we not know that they are fools and blind , and have everything to learn of us ? But if we say yes to all this , the question is still by no means settled . The Chinese themselves dislike and fear us , and their opinion should not go for nothing in a matter which so nearly concerns them . It is so convenient and easy for us to assume that they are unjust both to us and to themselves in shutting their borders against us , that we ought to be very sure that it is really so before we break down the barrier . Our assumption may savor of that convenient philosophy which maintains that the African race // is to be exalted to Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its superiors . The exclusiveness of China is no immemorial policy ; it is comparatively a recent measure of precaution , suggested and enforced by experience ; it may yet prove to have been prompted by the instinct of self-preservation . The history of the past few centuries affords more than one melancholy spectacle of the ruin and annihilation of a race , by contact with a higher civilization , which it was itself incapable of adopting . It is upon our heavy responsibility if we crowd ourselves , with all our superior wisdom and virtue , upon a resisting people ; and if Chinese nationality goes down in consequence of it , if the race that has maintained itself for four thousand years in such general contentment and prosperity as no other race on earth has known , hastens to swift decay and extinction , our guilt will be great indeed . We do not assert that this is to be the unfortunate result of our more intimate relations with China ; we hope the contrary ; but we do claim that the possibility of it requires to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little ignorance and arrogance in the popular estimate of the Chinese and of the value of their civilization , and somewhat of selfish inconsideration in the plans formed respecting them . We hold that , in virtue of what they have been and still are , they deserve to be treated with more forbearance and generosity than has been wont to be exhibited toward them by the West ; that their own welfare ought to be more carefully and more intelligently considered in all the dealings with them of the more enlightened nations . To this end we desire to contribute our mite by a view of the Chinese character , as exhibited in the history of China , its native institutions , and its relations with the rest of the world . The history , religion , and polity of China , more than that of any other country in the world , center in a single individual-in the sage Confucius . No man ever stamped his impress more thoroughly upon the character of a whole nation perhaps none who ever lived has affected more powerfully the fates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve aright the problem of the Chinese nature and its development in history , it must be , in great measure , by comprehending the great Chinese philosopher , his relation to the times that preceded , his influence upon the times that followed him . We can find no better vantage-ground for taking a survey of the Chinese character and history , than is afforded us by his life and doctrines . Kong-tse , or Kong-fu-tse , the Sage of the Family of Kong , was born in the year 551 B. C. , which is very nearly the same date with that commonly assigned to the appearance of the no less famous Hindu teacher , Buddha . China was at that period broken up into a number of petty feudatory kingdoms , which owed but a nominal submission to the central authority , and were engaged in perpetual quarrels with one another . The political condition of the country was sad enough , and , in sympathy with it , the bands of social and moral order were also relaxed . Confucius felt keenly the evil character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devoted himself with deliberate purpose to the work of reform . Being called , as all of his genius and learning invariably are called in China , to high political office , he tried first , as chief minister of his native state , the little kingdom of Lu , in the present province of Shan-tung , what he could accomplish by personal interference in the affairs of state . Soon discouraged , however , by the little success which rewarded his efforts , he withdrew into private life , and set himself to infuse into the sum of affairs a leaven which should spread and work through all China , for all time , producing , by an organic process , those results which no effort of his single administrative arm could bring about . In this , his success was complete . His instructions were eagerly resorted to , and he soon saw about him a band , we are told , of three thousand disciples . The affection and reverence with which he inspired them were unbounded , and , through them , his influence soon began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died B. C. 479 , at the age of seventythree ; but he left works , compiled or composed by himself , to represent his doctrines , and his school long survived him , working on in his spirit , promulgating and expounding them . // His influence went on steadily increasing ; his own works , and those of his nearest disciples and their followers , became by degrees the moral and political bible of the nation , the fountain of wisdom , the norm of virtuous and useful conduct . Successive dynasties vied with one another in paying honors to his memory ; the whole educated class , the aristocracy of China , took him for their patron and model . He has at this day nearly six hundred temples in the different provinces of the empire , in which , at stated seasons , reverential honors , of a kind to be more particularly described hereafter , are paid to his memory . And it should be particularly observed that all these honors have been and are paid to the actual Confucius himself , and for what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorified image of him , enthroned in the popular mind , and become the recipient of a worship which understands neither itself nor its object . The difference in this respect between Confucius and the great teachers and reformers of other lauds , is not a little striking and significant . Thus , to cite but an instance or two , the Persians soon made of their Zoroaster a being of supernatural gifts , who in person fought with the powers of darkness , and held converse with the Supreme Being . Thus the Indian monk , Buddha , underwent a yet more wondrous transformation ; his life , as related by his followers , is filled ad nauseanm with preposterous niarvels , while his doctrines have been so changed , and perverted , and overlaid , that their identity is almost utterly lost : neither the Buddha nor the Buddhism of the modern Buddhists has any fair title to the name . But Confucins has no more been a subject of mythical and legendary history to the Chinese , than Washington to us ; he is a man , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plainly on record , and incapable of misapprehension . The Chinese have treated him in the spirit of his own character . No one was ever more free from pride , from arrogant assumption of authority , from pretensions to superhuman wisdom , than was Confucius . He would not even lay claim to originality ; he professed to be only a reverent student of the past , and a restorer of the principles and practices of the olden and golden time . This // is the key-note of his whole philosophy . To extract from the past all that it contained which was best and worthiest of imitation , to combine it into a system of precepts of wise and righteous conduct , and to urge it by every available argument upon the acceptance and observance of the nation-this , and this alone , was what he attempted . How well he comprehended the work he had to perform , and how wisely he chose his means for its accomplishment , the result bears him witness . We can not refrain from comparing him here with one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most eminent men whom China has ever produced . He , too , felt and mourned over the corruption of the times , and endeavored in his own way to set bounds to it , and to restore men to virtue . But his method was an altogether independent and original one . He was a transcendental philosopher , and had arrived at the apprehension of an absolute , spiritual , impersonal being , the cause and principle of the universe , to which he gave the name of Tao , the Way ; and he taught that by intimate recognition of this being , and spiritual union with it , through the means of the negation of whatever constitutes the nature and attributes of man , were to be attained virtue and its consequence , happiness . ILao-tse gave origin to a school , or sect , which is not yet extinct . The " religion of Tao* ' has at times enjoyed a wide popularity throughout China , and the countenance and patronage of its rulers ; and it is still counted as one of the three creeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet not in its original form , as a mystical philosophy ; it has been for long centuries corrupted into a low form of idolatrous superstition and necromancy , and its priests and adherents are justly held in contempt by all the more enlightened of the people . Thus the system of Lao-tse , which was not deeply based upon the national character , and met with no genuine response from the national mind , was doomed , spite of the genius of its founder , to corruption and virtual extinction ; while the philosophy of Confucius so closely adapted itself to the wants and the capacities of the nation , that it commanded and attained universal acceptance . Indeed , we know not how to characterize Confucius // more summarily and more truly than by saying that he is the representative man of China , the highest exponent of the national character in its ' best normal development . Hence it is that the great philosopher is , as it were , the focus of Chinese history ; all the culture and wisdom of the past center in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is even true that almost all the records which have come down to us of the early history of China , the relics which we have received of its ancient literature , owe to him the form in which they have been preserved , and to his sanction their preservation itself Of the five canonical works , the King , which stand at the head of the Chinese literature , three were compiled , and one composed by him . The foundation-text of the first , the I-King , or Book of Changes , is ascribed by tradition to the mythical Emperor Fu-hi . It is simply a number of figures made up of straight lines , entire and broken , variously put together in parallel arrangement . These are regarded as typifying the elements and processes of nature , and the great truths of the moral and intellectual world ; in them the earliest cosmical philosophy of the Chinese was pleased to find its expression . To the brief interpretation of these emblematic fignres by the earliest founders ( 1100 B. C. ) of the dynasty under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It tells of the reverence of Confucius for what long tradition had hallowed , that he accepted such a text for his philosophy : his own straight-forward common sense would never of itself have led him to so fantastic an invention . Again , the early ages of China , like those of other primitive nations , had not failed to produce popular lyric poetry . And it is curiously characteristic of the elaborate system of polity by which the affairs of the nation were regulated even at so remote a period , that the provincial governors had long had it for their duty to collect the lyrics which sprang up in their respective provinces , and to send them to the capital , as evidences of the state of opinions and morals prevailing among the people : it is clearly no modern discovery that the songs of a people are the most faithful reflection of the popular sentiments . * From the material // thus assembled , and from the mass of like material otherwise placed within his reach , Confucius selected three hundred and eleven pieces , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and combined them to form the Shi-King , the Canon of Songs : all the rest have since perished . The third canonical book , the Shu-IKing , is the most important of all . It is a work of historical character , yet by no means a chronicle of events alone ; it is rather a record of the wisdom and virtue of the past ; it is made up for the most part of the conversations , the counsels , the decrees , the institutions of the sovereigns of ancient China . It claims to be derived from authentic annals , and must , at any rate , represent the traditional belief of the Chinese at that period respecting the men and deeds of their country 's early history . The record is brought down to a time about two hundred years before that of Confucius himself . As its continuation to his own period , the philosopher himself composed the Chun-tsieu , Spring and Autumn , a brief historical compendium , which ranks as the fourth of the canonical books , and is the only work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Confucius : so faithful was he to his own idea of his mission , as the interpreter and mouth-piece of the past , and so little did he put forward his own personality in connection with his work . The fifth of the canonical books is the Li-Ki , or Book of Rites , a compilation brought into its present form some centuries after Confucius , and made up from material of very different age and character , but a text-book especially of ceremonial and etiquette . An important place in it is occupied by the personal teachings of Confucius himself . The doctrines of the great philosopher are likewise exhibited in the Sze-shu , or Four Classics , which emanated from his school during the course of the first centuries after his death , and which , together with the five King , make up the sacred literature of the Chinese people . As the Confucian philosophy is thus essentially a digest of the wisdom of the past , it will be well , instead of proceeding to a direct consideration of its character and import , // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sprang . The origin of the Chinese people is to be sought , if it be possible ever to trace back their movements beyond the limits of their own territory , in the northwest . The mountains of the southwest are yet occupied by wild tribes of another race , which perhaps once possessed the whole country . The earliest history of China has for its theater only the northern and northwestern provinces . The great event with which its authentic history is generally regarded as commencing , is the success of Yu the Great , the founder of the first clearly historical dynasty , that of the ha , in damming the furious waters of the Great Yellow River , the bang-ho , and rescuing its immense and fertile valley , still the richest and most populous part of the empire , from inundation and waste . Yu is said to have commemorated his great work by an inscription cut upon the face of a mountain that overlooks the valley ; of this inscription a copy still exists , which is by high authority pronounced unquestionably authentic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2000 B. C. Its nature , and the employment in recording it of a written character radically akin with that still in use , prove that even at that early period the Chinese nation was no mere aggregate of wandering tribes , but at least beginning to be a great , powerful , and well ordered state , and that it had already passed through no very brief history of growth in knowledge , arts , and institutions . There are , unquestionably , elements of historic truth in the traditional accounts of the dynasties preceding the ha , although largely mingled with mythological and cosmogonical legends : to their emperors are ascribed the first constitution of society , the invention of the useful arts , and the like . Conspicuous among these founders of the Chinese state and culture are Fn-hi and bang-ti ; the two latest of them , Yan and Shun , find a place in the earliest , half-legendary accounts of the Shu-King . It is not necessary for us to go into any detail respecting the external history of the first dynasties . The ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years , and then gave place to the Shang ; this , in its turn , // lasted nearly six hundred and fifty years , when the weakness and tyranny of its princes , and the unhappiness of the people under their rule , caused the revolution which placed upon the throne the heroic Wu-Wang , chief of the illustrious house of Chau . This emperor and his father are two of the brightest examples of wise and good rulers which ancient Chinese history affords , and are among those oftenest held up by Confucius to the admiration and imitation of posterity . They committed , however , the capital political error of dividing the empire into feudal provinces , of which the rulers received , or soon acquired , too much independent power to consist with due subordination to the imperial authority ; and the result became , during the six centuries which intervened between the establishment of the dynasty and the manhood of Confucius , that disturbed and anarchical condition of the country which , as above stated , called out his efforts at reform . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese nation had passed through a history abundantly long enough for the full development of a national character , the growth of a creed , the establishment of a system of polity . Indeed , at the epoch of Yu the Great himself , the Chinese were , in all probability , essentially the same as they have ever since remained , and that persistency and stability which have always distinguished them in so marked a manner , were even then beginning to find scope for their exercise in the maintenance of past conditions . Physical ethuologists reckon the Chinese as belonging to the race called Mongolian . That is , however , a classification of them which is of little value , or of none at all , as indicating their actual origin and relationship ; for , by the language which they speak , they are severed by a deep gulf from all other people on the face of the earth . The general character of this language is well known to almost every one ; it is a language of monosyllables , a root-language , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving in each of its words only the central , the radical idea , and lacking the whole apparatus of derivative and inflective syllables , which , in their infinite variety of form and use , make up so important a part // of the mechanism of ' all other known tongues . Order of collocation , and the requirements of the sense , as gathered from the totality of the sentence , are in Chinese obliged to do the whole work of declension and conjugation , and even , in great measure , of the distinction of parts of speech . As an instrument and aid of human thought , then , it is of all known languages the most unmanageable , the most defective and insufficient . Yet , such is the power of the mind independent of and over , the means of its expression , that this imperfect language has served the ends of a cultivated and thinking people throughout its whole history , has conveyed far nobler and profounder views and reasonings than the greater part of the multitude of inflective dialects spoken by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high uses , weak in the ignorance and feebleness of the minds which should so apply them . The whole vocabulary of the Chinese spoken language is made up of only about five hundred syllables , each constituting a word ; although this number is virtually rather more than doubled by the use of different tones of utterance , which give the syllables a distinction of meaning . The written language is vastly more complicated ; a written language in truth it is , an auxiliary to the spoken , instead of being its reflection merely . The Chinese , like all the other modes of writing of which the history is traceable back to its origin , began with rude pictorial representations of visible objects , with hieroglyphics ; but , instead of passing by degrees into a phonetic alphabet , it adapted itself ingeniously to the peculiar needs of the language which it was to represent , and by combining in its characters a phonetic and an ideographic element , and bringing forth an immense variety of combinations , it was able to remedy in part the defects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , it could not represent , but it could relieve the ambiguity arising from the host of different significations of which each word , as pronounced , admitted . Thus , for a language of five hundred words , there is an alphabet of which the characters are counted by tens of thousands . Yet only a small part of these , of course , are in constant and familiar use . Dr. Willjams 's dictionary , the latest , and the most practically useful // gives about eight thousand , as supplying all ordinary needs , and even enabling one to read much of the literature . The style of writing the character has varied greatly at different epochs , and several forms of it , as employed for different purposes , are even now in use . In the character of the language , as thus described , we find two of the distinguishing features which belong to everything that is Chinese ; in the first place , an exceeding simplicity , amonuting even to poverty , of means , material , first prihciples , combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in the second place , a not less remarkable stability . The Chinese is almost altogether exempt from the working of those alterative processes which are so active in other languages ; its stiff monosyllables admit neither composition nor mutilation ; they are exposed only to the slow modifying effects of euphonic laws ; hence it has undergone less alteration , during the four thousand years of its traceable history , than almost any other living language in four hundred years . The religion of the ancient Chinese was of the same simplicity as their language , and it , too , seems to be preserved to us from the earliest period , unchanged , as to all its essential features , in that body of rites and observances which is wont to be called the state religion , together with one important and prominent popular cultus , the homage paid in each family to the ancestors . Like so many other of the primitive religions of the world , it was a worship of the powers of nature . In virtue of its character , it is fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere superstition , no expression of a timorous dread of the powers of evil , seeking refuge in a cringing and deprecatory homage rendered to them ; it was the outpouring of a genuine religions feeling , the offering in admiring awe , and gratitude , and trust , to the supposed rulers of the universe , of a worship which exalted and benefited the worshiper . It was , indeed , to a remarkable degree , free from the features which disfigure so many of the ancient religions ; it was free from idolatry , from all cruel and bloody rites , from all taint of vicious and lustful indulgence ; its ceremonies were of a // purity and simplicity almost unexampled . Yet even these its virtues were in part the result of the unideal nature of the Chinese , and of the feebleness and lack of vital energy of religious sentiment which has always distinguished them . The native Chinese religion can hardly be said to have had a history ; it remained forever stationary at a stage which in other religions has been but the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its adoration were heaven and earth , and the sun and moon . Now these natural objects have been the germs of the principal divinities of many another ancient religion ; but almost everywhere their original identity has been lost in the personal deities which have grown out of them , hidden by the mythology of which these have been made the subject . But the Chinese religion never produced any mythology ; . it can hardly be said to have had any personal gods ; the nation had a devout sense of an overruling power , or powers , under the supreme government and direction of which the affairs of the world went on , and devoutly and decorously they paid it their homage ; but this was all . The weakness of their sense of personal relation to the divinity , and individual duty growing out of that relation , the comparative insignificance of the element of religion in the general sum of the affairs of life , is farther evidenced by the fact that neither order nor class of priesthood ever grew up among them , charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worship became an affair of state , the performance of the religious rites of the nation the business of the civil authorities . The object of highest worship , heaven , might be addressed only by the Emperor himself ; it was high treason for any one less exalted to offer solemn sacrifice to the Supreme Ruler ; and each successive order of officials below him had likewise , in virtue of its official position , religious services to perform , at stated seasons , to the divinities of lower rank . One class of religious rites , however , remained in the hands of the people at large . It is well known to all who have made any study of early religions , how often the almost universal primitive belief in immortality takes such a form as leads to a kind of worship of deceased ancestors . Their de // parted spirits are supposed to have entered upon a new life , which in many respects is a counterpart of the old one ; they still own the ties and feel the wants of their earthly existence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to confer blessings upon them , while they are also accessible to their pious attentions , and even in a measure dependent upon them for support in the world of shadows . Such was the belief also of the earliest Hindus , a race the most widely removed from the Chinese in place , origin , and character ; and the pious Brahmin still holds monthly the ancestral feast , at which the fathers are invited to assemble and partake of the food set forth for them , although it is with him only a dead ceremony , inherited from the remote past , while his own present belief has assumed a form with which such rites are wholly inconsistent . But this ancestral worship has nowhere else attained to such prominent importance as a part of the national religion , as in China ; it even constituted , as already stated , and still constitutes , almost the only religious observance of the common people ; and one which no decay of belief , no importation of foreign creeds , no upspringing of superstitious rites , has been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rich , this has a separate building allotted to it ; with the poorer , it occupies a room , a closet , a corner , a shelf . There the commemorative tablets are set up , and there , at appointed times , are presented offerings of meats , fruits , flowers , apparel , money . But this part of the Chinese religion has also its public and official side . Although , in general , the ancestors of each family are the care of their own particular descendants , and not of strangers , yet an exception is made in the case of those who have been benefactors of the whole nation ; distinguished philosophers and statesmen , patriots who have given their lives for their country , are in a manner canonized by having their memorial tablets removed from the privity of the family mansion , set up in public temples , and honored with official worship . Of this character , and of a prominence befitting his high rank and desert , is the homage paid to the sage Confucius . The form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expansion of the family . The latter was both its model and its composing element ; the individuals of whom the state was made up were heads of families . Neither age , nor property , nor wisdom , conferred political rights . So long as the father lived , the son was a minor ; he was incapable even of acquiring real estate , or executing a contract , without the consent of the father , expressed in due form . Heads of families , associated together according to neighborhood , formed the primary political assemblies ; and to them , or to their combination into secondary organizations , or to the officers freely elected by them , were committed many and important functions of administration . This , however , was not in virtue of an established constitution , or compact between the nation and its rulers ; neither the theory nor the practice of the Chinese recognized any such . They had devised no fine theories respecting the constitution of a state , respecting the rights of the individual , and the checks and balances necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that of the family . As the family is a natural community , having for its head the father , not by any election or convention , but by the very nature of things , so the nation is a natural community , of which the Emperor is the head ; as reverence and implicit submission are due from children to a parent , so also the same are to be paid , with no abatenient , by all the members of the national family , to its father and head . The Emperor is , as he is styled , the Son of Heaven . He derives his authority directly from the Supreme Ruler . As he owes his place to no election , he is limited by no human statute . He is the source of all honor and all authority throughout his empire ; his word is law . By technical definition , then , the Chinese government is a despotism ; and yet it would be unjust to stigmatize it by that term , as ordinarily nuderstood by us . For , in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese by no means held that it existed in the Emperor , and was to be administered for his benefit , the people being his vassals and slaves . They believed , no less than we , that governments exist for the benefit of the governed . Their system demanded of the Emperor the strictest devotion // to the welfare and happiness of his subjects . He was not exempted from the binding force of any of the principles of morality and justice which were made obligatory upon the private individual . Heaven had made him , it is true , the father of his people , giving him unlimited domiuion over them ; yet for their good , that he might be their father indeed , and might make his children happy and prosperous . It is easy for ns to say that this moral obligation is but a weak restraint , and that despotic power will and must be abused . The Chinese have learned that , tao , and by sore experience . And yet this experience has never taught them that their system was radically defective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through frightful convulsions , in its endeavors to rid itself of a corrupt and tyrannous dynasty , but never , so far as we are aware , has it made the attempt , by limitation of authority , by the imposition of checks and the exaction of guarantees , to guard against farther tyranny . Content with the ancient constitution , not even imagining the possibility of a different one , the nation has sought only to place its administration in better hands . But there have not been wanting , in the Chinese system , elements of which the practical working has operated powerfully to check tyranny , and to soften the hard features of absolute power . In the first place , the absence of all disposition , on the part of either the governors or the governed , to find fault with the established order of things , introduce innovations , encroach upon one another 's prerogatives , has tended at least to promote tranquillity . Again , no people in the world have ever been more orderly and methodical , more attached to ancient institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The laws and methods of administration of their great empire became very early an immense and elaborate system , which grew more stable and rigid with every century of its subsistence , and which no Emperor , no dynasty even , was able essentially to alter . The will of the Emperor was law , it is true ; but it was greatly hampered in its exercise by the stiff and unwieldy apparatus of councils , and boards , and courts , through which it was compelled to act . Nor was it possible // for the sovereign to win a class or a caste to his personal support , and to fill all offices with his creatures . Of classes and castes there were none ; neither rank , nor dignity , nor authority , were hereditary . If it were desired , in recompense of extraordinary merit , to extend to the family of the meritorious individual the favors shown to himself , the Chinese have always been used to confer dignity , not on his descendants , but upon his ancestors ; an ingenious and happy device , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitated . Surely , an aristocracy is not necessary to the stability of the institutions of a country , if the most populous empire in the world has been able to subsist for four thousand years without a noble . The Chinese officials do indeed form a terrible bureaucracy , uplifted above the heads of the people in virtue of the delegation to their hands of part of the heaven-derived authority of the nation 's father , proud of their position and presuming upon it , and often weighing heavily upon their plebeian countrymen ; yet their general independence of the Emperor , and sympathy with the nation , are assured by the fact that their ranks are recruited directly from the mass of the people , and by a process which really brings , in the main , the best talent of the country to the management of its affairs . It is well known that for ages past the incumbents of office in China have been taken exclusively from the so-called lettered class ; the class of those who , having been thoroughly instructed in the various branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination , the highest capacity and the profoundest acquirements . Access to this examination is denied to no one ; the career of honors and dignities is open to every individual in the empire who has the requisite talent and industry . In this provision , and in the primary municipal institutions already referred to above , there is laid a foundation of real democratic equality , and one of no little depth and firmness , for the fabric of absolutism to rest upon . And the general result has been , that the empire has been governed under a system of laws of rare wisdom , equity , and humanity , which need not shrink from a comparison with those of the most favored epochs of the most enlightene4 nations . in the // world . When the Chinese have suffered under tyrannical oppression , it has been from the abuse of absolute power , exercised arbitrarily and in contravention of law . Against this they have reserved to themselves but a single remedy , and that is , the right of rebellion . When matters have been borne with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reigning dynasty , and the impossibility that the nation should be hippy under its charge , are evident beyond dispute , then it is assumed that the commission of heaven has been withdrawn ; pretenders to the virtually vacant office start up , and he who succeeds in crowding himself into the throne , and setting successfully in motion the machine of state , is accepted anew as the nation 's parent and absolute lord . It is not difilcnlt to see the consistency between a political constitution like this , and the form and condition of the national religion , as we have described it . The family being the norm of the state , and the parental relation being held in the highest respect in the one as in the other , it was the more natural and easy to maintain the popular worship of the ancestors : this was hardly more than a transfer of the filial submission , attention , and reverence , always paid to the living parents , to their departed spirits . In the patriarchal state , again , there is no distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the head of the family , and to his delegated representatives . The Chinese , indeed , can hardly be said ever to have established a distinction between religions , moral , and political principles , acts , and duties . All were alike incumbent upon the individual , and necessary to the well-being of society ; why should they be severed from one another ? We can not forbear calling attention once more to the fundamental traits of the Chinese character , as displayed in their system of government : the simplicity , the primitiveness in the common order of historical succession , of their form of polity ; and , on the other hand , the magnificence of the development which it received , as applied to regulate the affairs of a vast and cultivated empire , instead of the petty concerns of a feeble tribe , or aggregate of tribes , such as those among whom we generally find that form prevailing , and the high meas // ure of success which attended its workings . ft never produced a separation of the people into privileged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogance on one side and abjectness on the other , which are wont to result from such a separation . The distinction of wealth and poverty , and such others as seem to inhere in the very constitution of human society , did indeed exist in China , as elsewhere , and produced enough of practical inequality ; but the law did nothing to aggravate or perpetuate it . Nor did the system degenerate into one of organized oppression , or of galling interference with individual rights . Not a little of personal freedom was enjoyed under it . The individual was left at liberty to go and come , to follow what course of life he would ; he was protected in the acquisition and the enjoyment of wealth . There was wanting only that he should be fenced about with those safeguards against arbitrary violence on the part of his rulers , without which civil liberty , as we understand it , does not exist ; but this was a want of which he himself at least , was not conscious ; he neither knew nor dreamed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe to have been , in their main features , the institutions of China at the time of the appearance of Confucius . We have already briefly characterized the nature of the work which he undertook with reference to them . He came , not to overthrow , but to establish ; not to reform , but to restore . He came to rouse the conscience of the nation , and to recall it to the fulfillment of known duty , and the practice of acknowledged virtue ; to rescue the national institutions from the destruction with which they were threatened , by selfseeking rapacity on the one side and insubordination on the other , and by the general corruption of morals and manners* He came to give to the national ideas their highest , clearest , and most authoritative expression , that the nation might never forget or neglect them . He was not a religious teacher , because the national spirit , of which he was the reflection , was by no means religious . At his time , indeed , even the modicum of religious faith which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nearly died out , and the // ceremonies both of official and private worship to have become the forms which they have since continned to be , tenaciously adhered to and faithfully practiced , but no longer representing a living belief Confucius accepted these ceremonies , and enjoined their careful observance , but , as it seems , from no higher regard for them than as they formed a part of the system under which virtue had flourished , and happiness reigned , in the ancient times of the empire . lie expressly declined to meddle with matters lying beyond the present world and mortal life , in words identical in spirit with those of the famons couplet of Pope . " While I know so little of myself , my fellow beings , and the world which I see about me , " he says , " how should I ventnre to carry my inqniries beyond them ? " Accordingly , he bases his system upon no alleged revelation of a divine will ; he derives for it no support from the retributions and recoinpenses of a future state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the love of right and justice and virtue inherent in the human mind , and in the dependence upon these of the happiness of the individual and the welfare of society . These principles he lays down broadly and faithfully enough ; the simplicity , dignity , and purity of his moral teachings are unsurpassed . He makes no pretension to metaphysical profundity , or to subtlety of casuistical reasoning : the results he arrives at are reached directly , by the intuition of an enlightened mind and a benevolent heart ; they are stated aphoristically , and the sympathy , rather than the intellectual acumen , of the disciple , are trusted to for a favorable response . He contents himself with laying down guiding principles , not following out their application into all the details of life and action . It would be an ungrateful task to criticise the work of Confucius , and dwell with reprobation upon what he did not accomplish . In the most important point of all he is above the reach of criticism : he did all that was in him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was as sincere , as devoted , as disinterested , as any of those who are numbered among the world 's great teachers . His deficiencies may be summed up in a word : he was Chinese , and Chinese only . But it is on that very account that his influence over his countrymen has // been so unbounded . That it has been for good , too , and almost only for good , does not admit of question . That the Chinese system found at that time so noble and unexceptionable an expression was a matter of no slight moment to the nation . It was a critical period in their history . A philosophy specious in appearance , but corrupt at the core , and which cunningly adapted itself to the salient features of the Chinese character , might then have won currency , to promote powerfully the disorganization of society , and to bring down the permanent ruin of the empire . The influence of the Confucian doctrine , on the contrary , has been in a high degree conservative ; it has contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . The nation , on its part , deserves not a little credit for having implicitly accepted , and faithfully adhered to , a system of teachings of so pure and elevated a character . Their adoption of it , as we have already seen , was complete . For two thousand years the Confucian doctrines have been the moral basis of the whole fabric of Chinese thought and action . The works which contain them have been the invariable text-books , by and from which each successive generation has been educated . To appreciate the significance of this fact , we need to note the special importance of the sys tem of instruction in a country where instruction is so general and so highly considered , and where eminence in learning is the path to honor and authority ; where the educated are the only aristocracy , and form the class from which are drawn the rulers of the nation . And farther , we need to note the peculiar character of the process of education in China ; how that , owing to the great difficulty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it than with us ; how that , by the intense and prolonged toil which the student is compelled to d&amp;vote to his text-books , in order to answer the requirements of the system of examinations , the native energy of his mind is impaired , and he becomes rather mastered by their contents than himself master of them . All the educated intellect of China has been thus imbued with Confucianism ; even those have been schooled in it who were votaries of other religions than that of the state . As the Bible underlies all the // varying forms of religion of the Christian world , so Confucianism has underlain all the phases of Chinese doctrine . That it admitted of being overlaid with new growth is not its least virtue . It trammeled the progress neither of religion nor of science , for it was not based upon any system of religions belieS nor identified with any scheme of physical or metaphysical philosophy . If the Chinese have fallen later into idolatry and superstition , and have made little valuable progress in knowledge , it has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to defects more radical in the national character . Before going on to present our views of the Chinese character , we will briefly sketch the history of the empire since the epoch of the great philosopher . The dynasty under which Confucius lived eked out its existence for more than two centuries after his death , or until B. C. 255 , without any marked change in the conditions of the country . The Confucian school flourished in high esteem ; about a hundred years after the death of its founder it produced its next most eminent sage , Mencius , the record of whose wisdom is included in , and closes , the sacred canon . Under the following dynasty , however , the Confucian doctrines and their representatives suffered a severe persecution , which , had their hold upon the popular mind been less firm , might have extinguished them forever . About 250 B. C. , the princes of the kingdom of Tsin , in the northwestern part of the empire , rebelled against the imperial authority , extinguished the dynasty of Chau , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new dynasty of Tsin , Chi-hoang-ti , is one of the most remarkable figures presented by Chinese history . A great statesman and warrior , he destroyed the independent power of the petty sovereigns of pro ' *inces , and made the whole empire once more submissive to the imperial scepter ; he carried his arms far to the west , extending the dominion of China over nearly all central Asia ; he chased the linus across the northern frontier , and , to check their incursions for the future , he built the Great Wall , which has ever since remained one of the wonders of the world . But , in spite of his // great deeds , his memory is execrated by the Chinese . His temper and spirit were thoroughly un-Chinese. lie abhorred the servitude to usage and precedent to which even the imperial power had been wont to be subjected . He detested the authority of the past ; he wished to blot out all memory of it even , and to begin on white paper a new history of the empire . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confucian , and to destroy its sectaries . The books he burned , all that the strictest requisition could bring into his power ; the philosophers he buried alive , or sent to work upon the Wall . This state of things did not , however , endure long . Hardly was the great Emperor dead when his family were hurled from the throne , and one of the first acts of the founder of the dynasty which succeeded was to make a solemn pilgrimage to the grave of Confucius . The dynasty of Han held the great fabric of the empire together for about four hundred years , or during the two centuries that preceded , and the two that followed , the birth of Christ . Such was the general wisdom of their rule , and the happiness of the country under it , that the Chinese even yet love to call themselves sons of Han . During the first century after Christ , Buddhism was introduced from India , and made immense progress among the people . To this great event in the history of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuller consideration belongs to another department of our subject . As had been the case with its predecessors , however , the power and success of the dynasty waned at last , and about 200 A. D. , the empire was rent into three independent kingdoms , and a new era of intestine war and commotion began . Yet even this was not without its glories . The period of the San-Kwo , or Three Kingdoms , is the heroic age of Chinese history , prolific of striking character and startling incident , the source whence the novelists and dramatists of after times have drawn their best materials . We pass over the five following dynasties , which , together , lasted only a little more than three hundred years , from 264 to // the invention of printing from wooden blocks , as at present practiced by the Chinese , was made about the close of this period . The dynasty of Sui , which next obtained the control of affairs , once more united the dismembered empire , but , after only thirty years of power , was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasty of Tang . Now followed a period of internal order and prosperity , of outward power and glory . The limits of the empire were again carried to the Caspian . Lyric poetry was revived , and attained its highest perfection . The drama arose . The examinations for literary dignity and political office were placed upon the footing which they have from that time maintained . The Chinese Academy , which has since played a conspicuous and important part in both the literary and political history of the country , was founded . During the reign of the Tang , China was probably the most enlightened and happy country on the face of the earth . But this dynasty , too , degenerated , and , after a period of weakness and misery , became extinct at the beginning of the tenth century . During the fifty-three years of civil war which succeeded , five different dynasties arose and fell . At last , in A. D. 960 , the house of Sung seized the reins of authority , and reiistablished peace and order throughout the empire . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese state . The Tatar and Mongol tribes of the great platcau of Central Asia were beginning those restless heavings which not long after poured them , like a deluge of destruction , over all the countries of the east , the south , and the west . By the year 1127 , they had wrested from the empire all the territory north of the bang-ho , and were pressing on to the conquest of the rest . In this time of internal and external misery and danger , appeared the last great representative of Chinese philosophy , the sage Chn-hi . In wisdom and virtue he is accounted ahnost another Confucius ; he is universally regarded as the man who has best comprehended , and most truly reproduced , the spirit of the Confucian doctrines ; his interpretation and explication of the canonical and classical books has had , for all after time , // an authority only inferior to that of those books themselves . Like his master and exemplar , he devoted himself , as statesman and as teacher , to the restoration of virtue and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to be arrested ; China was doomed to pass , for the first time in her history , under a foreign yoke . The Mongols , under Genghis Whan , invited in at first as auxiliaries against the Tatars , seized upon the empire for themselves , and in 1279 , IKublai IKhan , the grandson of Genghis , became the first emperor of a new Mongol dynasty , to which he gave the name of Yuen . That was a splendid vassalage in which the Chinese empire was now held . From his throne at Pekin , Kublai swayed the affairs of all the countries from the eastern seas to the very borders of Germany . The EmperQr of China was sovereign of the most enormous empire which the world has ever seen . IKublai was a great ruler , too , and he had especially at heart the welfare of China , the richest and most populous part of his dominions , and his residence . He reformed the abuses which under the Sung had crept into every department of the administration . lie executed great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wise policy . Literature flourished under him : the period of the Yuen is that of the highest perfection of the drama . Altogether , the country enjoyed greater prosperity under his government than for centuries before . Yet was the nation impatient of foreign rule , and when , under the successors of IKublai , weakness and tyranny began to usurp the place of vigor and justice at the capital , a general insurrection took place , which expelled the intrusive dynasty before it had completed its first century of dominion . With the dynasty ofMing , which mounted the throne in 1368 , begins the modern epoch of Chinese history . Founded by a man of various and remarkable genius , who was the son of a common laborer , and had been a Buddhist priest before he became a soldier of fortune , it upheld for a time the glory and prosperity of the empire , but later , lapsing into imbecility , it met with the fate of the Sung . Early in the sixteenth century , the Manchus , another branch of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern frontier , // and , between foreign invasion and internal oppression and rebellion , the country was reduced to a state of extreme misery . Thongh the Mauchus doubtless aimed at making the whole empire their own , it was not as conquerors that they actually possessed themselves of the throne . They were called in by a faithful servant of the iMling , to save the dynasty from destruction by successful rebellion : but they reached Pekin too late ; the last iMling emperor had slain his family and hung himself , to avoid falling into the hands of the rebel leader . Advantage was at once taken of so favorable a conjuncture ; the lMlanchu chief seated himself upon the vacant throne , and China once more saw a dynasty of foreign birth . This was in 1644 . The new dynasty gave itself the name of Ta-Tsing , or Great-Pure . It was not firmly and peaceably established upon the throne until after fifty years of struggle ; then , the last grand rebellion was repressed by the wisdom and valor of the illustrious Kang-hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his descendant is still Emperor of China . The lMlanchu conquest is to be looked upon rather as a blessing than as a misfortune to the country . China had never been in such a condition of anarchy and distress as during the last years of the IMling . Civil war and oppression ran riot in the land . It almost makes one 's blood run cold to read of horrible massacres and devastations , by which whole provinces were turned into deserts . The IMlanchus were a hardy race of n*rthern warriors , greatly superior to the Chinese in warlike prowess , and they soon established comparative order throughout the empire . Like the Mongols , they attempted no revolution , no great and sweeping change even , in the order of the state . The submission of these wild tribes to the superior enlightenment of the people whom they had brought under their sway is remarkable . It would have been , indeed , no light undertaking for a horde of warlike barbarians to force into new ways the teeming millions of the Chinese population , more inflexibly attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of immemorial antiquity ; but we should hardly have expected them so fully to realize this truth , and so wisely to govern themselves by it . Aided by the all-controlling // centralism of the Chinese system , they have simply infused an element of their own nationality through all the departments and grades of office , and allowed the great machine to work on as before , only with another engineer . Perhaps-we would not venture to affirm or deny it with confidence-perhaps the vital force of the Chinese race , after an existence so immensely prolonged , was becoming exhausted , and an infusion of new and vigorous blood was needed , in order to the farther continuance of healthy life . However that may be , the best period of the IMlauchn domination , including the reigns of the great Kang-hi and his grandson Kien-lung , each of them of sixty years ' length  --  the former reigned from 1662 to 1723 , the latter from 1736 to 1796-has been not less distinguished by power and consideration abroad , by tranquillity , prosperity , and contentment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the success of industry , by the increase of population , by the activity of literary production , than the best which the Chinese annals can boast . Since the beginning of this century , the vigor and purity of the administration have greatly fallen off ; discontent has arisen , to which additional violence has been given by the antagonisin of the two nationalities , and many of the signs have appeared which in China are wont to indicate the downfall of an old dynasty , and the accession to power of a new one , with the intervention of a longer or shorter period of confusion and anarchy . As to what the result is to be , we will not at present trust ourselves to offer an opinion , or even a conjecture . Two questions , of the most important bearing upon the future of the empire , demand first to be settled . Has the national character indeed so fatally degenerated that the country is no longer capable of rising by its own internal forces , as of old , from depression and misery ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation of the intrusion of foreign ideas , foreign arms , and foreign poisons ? Both these questions are not a little difficult of solution . As to the first , the testimony of those who speak from personal observation is often very conflicting , even as regards the character of the Chinese of the // present day , and generally very unreliable , as regards the comparison of the present with the past . Assignable reasons for this are not wanting . Many have jndged the whole nation from a brief knowledge of the inhabitants of the sea-board cities , unquestionably the lowest class of the whole population , representing the native character as most altered for the worse by foreign trade and piracy . Those who know the Chinese most thoroughly , by continued , wide-extended , and familiar intercourse , are generally those whose opinion of them is most favorable . But the Chinese nature must not be too exclusively judged by the impression it makes upon those who at the present day are brought in contact with it . Its deficiencies have always been of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to affect our judgments . There has been in it a dryness , a lack of ideality , of affection , of enthusiasm , which strikes us more strongly and unfavorably than the want in others of many a real sterling quality which the Chinese have possessed . In almost all that they are and do , there is something which spoils its savor for us . Their faces and forms are ugly in our eyes ; their elaborate and exaggerated manners , regulated by rules older than all the Occidental literature , seem to us almost a mockery . Their capacities are limited by bounds of which we are so impatient , that we fail to appreciate how admirably they work within those limits . They exhibit in everything a childishness which sits most ungracefully upon their antiquated stiffness . In short , they seem a miraculously preserved relic of antediluvianism , most unlike us , and hardest for us to understand , or feel sympathy with . Their music illustrates the difference in our make and theirs . What to them is delightful harmony , to us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accompaniment of a war-dance of savages , but we can not bear it from a people pretending to culture . Their drawing and painting , too , though showing close and shrewd observation , great faculty of imitation , skill in the use of colors , and a power of expression and artistic freedom of handling which Egyptian art does not even approach , not only is ignorant of perspective , but wants the very vivifying // spirit of beauty which should elevate it from a mere talent to the dignity of an art . All this we should find much more tolerable if the Chinese mind were more open to instruction , could be convinced of its deficiencies , and brought to acknowledge the superiority of another culture . And thus it might be , were it only half-grown and still developing . But it has been for these thousands of years fully grown and completely developed ; it has virtually worked out whatever of capacity there was in it . During all that time , China has been immensely superior to all the neighboring nations . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and letters . lilt has brought barbarous hordes under the sway of its regulated polity . Repeatedly overrun and conquered , it has , like Greece , vanquished its victors ; and even more truly than Greece , for it has never been ruled under any other than its own institutions . What wonder , then , if it is unable and unwilling truly to appreciate , and ingenuously to accept , what is now offered it from without ? Is it not the very essence of the Chinese nature to be fixed and immovable ? + The brief historical sketch which we have given will serve to show , we think , that the theory of Chinese quietism and immobility must be held under some restrictions . The outward condition , at least , of the empire , has not been one of tranquil and unbroken uniformity . It has passed through much the same series of convulsions and revolutions , though on a far grander scale of numbers and of years , as has also vexed the petty empires of the West . The grand and striking difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equilibrium has never been quite lost ; mighty as the elements of disorder and destruction have been , those of order and conservatism have shown themselves yet more powerful . For this it is impossible to account by any assignment of secondary causes . The reason lies deep in the foundations of the national character itself ; in the truly conservative bent of the Chinese mind , which has given to all its productions a form calculated for endurance , and has steadfastly adhered to them , and persistently maintained them upright . The same conservatism is exhibited by the intellectual life of China . There // has been vast and unceasing activity , wonderful industry and productiveness , but next to no real advance . But we must never forget , in judging China , that , according to the ordinary march of events in human history , the Chinese empire should have perished from decay , and its culture either become extinct or passed into the keeping of another race , more than two thousand years ago . It had already reached the limit to its capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have left behind , for the unmixed admiration of all after generations , the memory of a nation wise , powerful , and cultivated , beyond almost any other of the olden time . Consider how many nations have died in giving birth to the modern Christian civilization , of the possession of which we are so proud . Where is Egypt now , that most ancient home of so many of the germs of our culture ? Where are the two Semitic races , the Phomician and the Hebrew , whose influence on commerce , literature , religion , has been of such exceeding importance ? Persia , too , has borne her part , if only subordinately , in the search after light and the struggle for empire : but how short-lived was her glory ! And of our own chosen European races , the heirs of all the best wisdom of the past , the depositories of ail the best hopes of the future , how has one fallen and another risen ! How soon waned the transcendent genius of the Greek ! How did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over all Europe settled down the gloom of the IDark Ages ! How is Spain degraded from the foremost rank she once held ! And who shall tell what the future may have in store for those who are now the representatives of the world 's best thought and action ? Such considerations as these should make us modest and merciful in passing judgment upon China . If the present is ours , the past is hers . Were it possible to multiply the amount of enlightenment which she has enjoyed by the years of its duration , and the number of human beings who have profited by it , we have little doubt that there would be found to have shone in China , in the aggregate , not much less light than in all the rest of the earth taken together . It is our // duty , too , in forming our estimate of the value of a system , to take fully into account its adaptedness to the people who have lived under it , as indicated by its successful working . And we must perforce acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical capacity which they evince in the petty concerns of ordinary life , by giving origin to a system of morality and polity which , however imperfect we may deem it in many respects to be , has proved itself so precisely suited to them . So long a life necessarily implies the presence of sound and healthful qualities . The history of the Chinese proves them to have been distinguished , as a nation , by many saving virtues ; by orderliness , by submissiveness , by contentment of spirit , by industry , by frugality , by temperance , by general morality . We have felt that these aspects of Chinese character , that this method of viewing it as exhibited in the whole history of the country and its institutions , had been too much neglected ; that the general opinion did not do justice to its many great and admirable qualities . Hence we have been the more solicitous to set them forth prominently , and in as favorable a light as historic verity would allow . If we shall seem to any to have done them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to judge harshly the unfortunate Chinese , and to heap contumely upon them , and that they deserve to find also a friendly advocacy . ( That they have fallen from the normal standard of their national character , we do indeed fully believe : their religious condition is sufficient proof of it : they have passed from that negative state in which we have depicted them , and in which history shows that no nation can long abide , into positive idolatry and superstition . No satisfctory discussion of this point and of its bearings is possible , however , without a much fuller consideration of the intercourse of China with the rest of the world , and its effects upon her , than we have left ourselves room for at this time . M'e hope to be able to return to the subject at a future opportunity .
