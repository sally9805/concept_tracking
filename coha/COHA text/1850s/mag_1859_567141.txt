ARTICLE YI. - TIIE OBERLIN-WELLINGTON RESCUE . THE proceedings in Ohio , in reference to the arrest and prose* cution of several citizens of that State for the crime of rescuing a fugitive slave from his captors , constitnte a marked feature in the history of the proceedings under the fugitive slave law . They have naturally awakened a wide-spread interest . The story is as follows . On the fifteenth day of September last , two slave catchers from Kentucky , having been for a few days previous at Oberlin , Ohio , induced a lad of about thirteen years of age , by the gift of twenty dollars , to entice a negro away from his residence in that town , under the false pretense of giving him work , to a place where they could conveniently seize him and carry him off . Some citizens of Oberlin , who had been aware of the presence of these southern slave hunters in their neighborhood , and who had been apprehensive that an attempt would be made to kidnap some of the colored persons living in that vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtaking the captors and the captive at Wellington , some ten miles distant , rescued the captive from those who had seized him , and he is now free . Thirty-seven of the citizeus of Oberlin and Wellington were indicted , for a violation of the fugitive slave act of 1850 , in the United States District Court for the northern district of Ohio . Two of them have been convicted and sentenced : a few , under the influence of the result of the trials and convictions , which had taken place , entered a plea of noli contendere , and have also been sentenced ; and thirteen are now confined , in the county jail at Cleveland , to await their trial . That the local interest in this prosecution has been very great , will not appear surprising , when it is remembered that the prisoners are highly respectable citizens of northermi Ohio ; one of them being a Professor in the Oberlin College and one having been a member of the State legislature . Never has // such a band of prisoners been confined in anyjail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their imprisonment , Professor Peck preached to his fellow prisoners , and to such others as chose to assemble . A Cleveland newspaper says , " the extensive jail-yard was literally packed with human bodies  --  the space and street beyond filled , and every roof and shed , that afforded a prospect of the sneaker , crowded . " The number present was estimated at over three thousand . At a later day a large convention of those who sympathized with the prisoners was held at Cleveland , at which were present , the Governor of the State of Ohio , representatives in congress , past and present , and other eminent civilians . The interest thus manifested is not merely a local interest . The General Association of the State of Illinois has expressed its sympathy with the prisoners by a formal vote , and in many other - portions of the country expressions of interest and sympathy have been made . Nor is this merely the interest of partisans , for it arises from the nature of the questions involved , affecting , as they do , the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which show a disposition on the part of the federal officers to succeed in convicting and punishing these accused persons at all events , may receive a passing notice . We can only refer to the facts that one of the grand jurors , who found the bill of indictment , was the father of the lad , by whose purchased deception the negro was decoyed into the power of his enemies ; that the petit jury , which tried the case of Bushnell , the first one tried , was selected from one political party , whose creed is reported to have been expressed by one of these jurymen in the following language , " I think more of the democratic party than of all the niggers in the land , and would rather sacrifice the whole of them to keep it safe ; " that one of this jury was a deputy marshal of the United States ; that the attempt was made , and strenuously persisted in , to compel the other parties accused to go to trial before the same jury , who had just convicted Bushnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had passed on many of the material facts , which would be put in issue a second time on the trial of these other parties-which attempt // was frustrated only by the firm and manly refusal of the accused to offer any defense before a jury , which had already * ) rejudged their case , in the conviction of Bushnell ; that the presiding judge caused to be entered on the records of his court , as a part of the proceedings , that the accused had voluntarily surrendered themselves into cnstody , notwithstanding the positive declaration of the parties themselves that they had not done so , thus compelling them to remain in confinement or obtain release , on giving bail , only by incurring , ( to use their own language , ) " the personal disgrace of acknowledging that they had ( lone a very foolish action , contrary to the fact , and were ready to sneak away from the dilemma in which that act had placed them . " This shows the animu8 of the court , falsifying facts to the prejudice of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishing men not yet convicted of violating any law . We can only quote a few passages from the speech of Langston , a colored man , after his trial and conviction , when asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced ; a speech which tbr impassioned eloquence , unshaken firmness and moral power is rivaled only by that of Robert Emmet , before Lord Norbury , when sentence of death was about to be pronounced upon him . To be properly appreciated the quotations should be read in the connection in which they occur . " Bein , identified with that man by color , hy race , by manhood , hy sympathies , such as God has implanted in us all , I felt it my duty to go and do what I could toward liberating him . I had been taught by my revolutionary father , that the fundamental doctrine of this government was that all men have a right to life and liberty , and coming from the Old Dominion I brought into Ohio these sentiments deeply impressed upon my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties themselves by what authority the boy was held in custody , I conceived , from what little knowledge I had of law , that they had no right to hold him . And as your Honor has repeatedly laid down the law in this Court , a man is free until he is proven to be legally restrained of his liberty , and I believe that upon that principle of law , those men were hound to take their prisoner before the very first magistrate they found , and there establish the facts set forth in their warrant and that until they did this every man should presume that their claim was unfounded , and to institute such proceedings for the purpose of securing an investigation as they might find warranted by the laws of this State . * * " It is said that they had a warrant . Why then should they not establish its // *39O The Oberlin - Wellington Re8cue. validity before the proper officers ? And I stand here to-day , sir , to say that with an exception of which I shall soon speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which they claimed to act , was the part I took in that day 's proceedings , and the only part . I supposed it to be my duty as a citizen of Ohioexcuse me for saying that , sir-as an outlaw of the United States , to do what I could to secure at least this form of justice to my brother , whose liberty was in peril . Whatever more than that has been sworn to on this trial , as an act of mine , is false , ridiculously false . When I found these men refusing to go , according to the law as I apprehended it , and submit their claim to an official inspection , and that nothing short of a haheas corpus would oblige such an inspection , I was willing to go even thus far , supposing in that county a sheriff might perhaps be found with nerve enough to serve it . In this , I again failed . Nothing , then , was left to me , nothing to the boy in custody , but the confirmation of my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment of those means of liberation which belong to us. * * * * * * * * " But I have another reason to offer why I should not be sentenced , and one that I think pertinent to the case . I have not had a trial before a jury of my peers . The common law of England  --  and you will excuse me for referring to that , since I am but a private citizen-was that every man should be tried before a jury of men occupying the same position in the social scale with himself That lords should be tried before lords ; that peers of the realm should be tried before peers of the realm ; vassals before vassals , and aliens before aliens . The Constitution of the United States guarantees-not merely to its citizens , but to all persons , a trial before an impartial jury . I have had no such trial . * * " I was tried by a jury who were prejudiced ; before a court that was prejudiced ; prosecuted by an officer who was prejudiced , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And therefore it is , your Honor , that I urge by all that is good and great in manhood , that I should not be subjected to the pains and penalties of this oppressive law when I have not been tried , either by a jury of my peers , or by ajury that were impartial . One word more , sir , and I have done . I went to Wellington , knowing that colored men have no rights in the United States which white men are bound to respect ; that the Courts had so decided ; that Congress had so enacted ; that the people had so decreed . * * " There is not a spot in this wide country , not even by the altars of God , nor in the shadow of the shafts that tell the imperishable fame and glory of the heroes of the revolution ; no , nor in the old Philadelphia Hall , where any colored man may dare to ask a mercy of a white man . Let me stand in that ball and tell a United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he served under Lafayette , and fought through the whole war , and that he fought for my freedom as much as for his own ; and he would sneer at me and clutch me with his bloody fingers and say he has a right to make me a slave . And when I appeal to Congress , they say he has a right to make me a slave ; when I appeal to the people , they say he has a right to make me a slave , and when I appeal to your Honor , your Honor says he has a right to make me a slave , and if any man , white or black , seeks an investination of that claim , they make themselves amenable to the pains and penalties of the fugitive slave act , for black men have no rights which white men are bound to respect . * * * * * * * // " In view of all the facts , I say that if ever again a man is seized near me , and is ahout to be carried southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall hold it to be my duty , as I held it that day , to secure for him , if possible , a legal inquiry into the character of the claim hy which he is held . And I go further , I say that if it is adjudged illegal to procure such an investigation , then we are thrown back upon those last defenses of our rights which can not be taken from us and which God gave us that we need not be slaves . " We do not propose to discuss all the legal questions which arose in the trial of these cases , or which might be considered in connection with it ; but some points seem worthy of notice , and in place of an abstract discussion , we prefer to look at the defense actually made in these cases . The defendants demanded an acquittal principally on the following grounds : 1 . That the power of attorney from the master , under which the i ( entuckians claimed the right to arrest and detain the negro , was not valid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not know whether the authority from the master , in this particular case was correct , in point of form , or not ; but we do say that if any law ought to receive a strict construction , this law ought to , and that those who seek to enfbrce it should be required to comply with its minutest provisions . It is an odious law , making the free territory of the northern states a hunting-ground for slaves , violating the moral sense of every man not debased by the system of slavery , and should have no presumptions in its favor . It is a hard law , wringing its demands from the northern freeman most unwillingly . It is an unjust law , making slaves of those who have become free . It is an unrighteous law , declaring , by its enactments , deeds of charity and kindness to be crimes , punishable with severe penalties . It should be strictly construed , like the bond which Shylock held , and Portia interpreted ; and he who claims under it , should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 2 . The second ground of defense involves the essence of the act made criminal by the section of the law under which these men have been indicted . The seventh section provides , " that any person who shall knowingly and willfully obstruct , // hinder or prevent , any such claimant , " &amp;c . Knowledge on the part of the accused , is an important ingredient of the offense . If he does not know that the person whose abduction he hinders or obstructs , is a fugitive slave , he can not be guilty of a violation of this law . We think great inj ustice was done by the jury and court in the cases which have been tried , in this particular . By the jury , in convicting without clearer evidence that the defendants had knowledge of the fact that the negro claimed was a fugitive slave . It seems to us , from an examination of the evidence , that while only a faint presumption was raised against the prisoners , on this point , from the testimony introduced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such knowledge was brought home to them . Now , it is evident that there can be no violation of this law without a knowledge of this fact ; for , in the free states , the presumption of law still is , that every man is free , whatever the color of his skin , and something more than a mere seizing and attempt at abduction are necessary to rebut this presumption . How important this principle is , will he evident , when we recall to mind the fact stated by Langston , in the speech from which we have made quotations , that of the eight persons who were first taken into slavery under the operation of the fugitive slave law , four were afterwards proved to have been free . And from this further quotation also : " A letter was not long since found on the person of a counterfeiter , when arrested , addressed to him by some southern gentleman , in which the writer says , Go among the niggers , find out their marks and scars , make good descriptions and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ** In prosecutions like those in Ohio , strict proof should be required , not only of the fact that the person whose abduction has been obstructed had been a slave ; but of the further fact , that those accused of making obstruction had knowledge of the servile condition of the person whose abduction was attempted . It is no violation of this law to hinder or obstruct a kidnapper ; and every forcible al*duction of a person not owing service or labor , is kidnapping . So // one who does not make known his authority to carry off a free person Porn the free states , is presumptively a kidnapper . It may be compared to the case of passing counterfeit bills . Any one , with the most honest intentions , and with the most scrupulous regard for the observance of the law , is liable to pass a counterfeit bill . Good judges , even the officers of banks themselves , have been deceived with counterfeited bills of their own institutions . But unless a man knows a bill to be counterfeited , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . His knowledge is the essence of the offense and itis important , for the safety of every individual , that proof should be required of this essential fact . So , under the fugitive slave law , knowledge is equally essential , and vastly more important , as the life and liberty of a man are of primary regard . The weight of evidence on this point , as it seems to us , was so clearly on the side of the prisoners , that we are forced to the conclusion that the jury were influenced more by the appeals to their p#ejudices against Oberlin men as being heedless of all civil law , and especially determined to violate this law , than by the testimony of the witnesses sworn before them . The solemn assertion of Langston , that he did not know that the negro was a slave , will be believed by all who read his simple and ingenuous speech . We think the court also erred upon this point , in refusing to allow the defendants to prove the manner in which these slave-catchers acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of the defendants is necessary to be determined in deciding on their guilt or innocence , then all the facts which throw light ( in their means of knowledge , ought to be investigated and understood . If it could be established by proof that the whole course of proceeding on the part of these slave-catchers , from the first enquiries they made in the neighborhood of Oberlin , until the final act of deceit by which they succeeded in seizing their prey , had been such as to excite the fears of the coummunity so that multitudes were alarmed for their safety , and parents dared not suffer their children to go out of the house . even to school ; we say , if such a course of proceeding // could be shown , a presumption would be raised , in the absence of more positive proof , that these men were kidnappers , and the citizens of Oberlin might well believe that those who resorted to secresy and deceit to accomplish their ends , were not armed with any legal authority . On a trial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of knowledge , of the defendant , may be presumptively shown from any circumstances about the bill itself , such as its good or bad execution , the person from whom received , and the manner of the accused when the bill was passed , as well as the circumstances under which it was passed . Under the fugitive slave law a similar course of inquiry is clearly admissible to show knowledge or want of knowledge on the part of the accused . A man may know a counterfeit bill by looking at it , but a slave can not be detected by his looks . " Hath not a " slave " eyes ? Hath not a " slave " hands , organs , dimensions , senses ? fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a " freeman " is ? " But there may be other circumstances , in the absence of positive proof , to furnish grounds for believing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did not know this essential point , and in ruling out testimony , which would have thrown light upon it , we think the court erred . 3 . The only other point relied on by the defendants , which we propose to comment on , is the unconstitutionality of the law under which they were indicted . In our judgment the fugitive slave law of 1S50 is clearly unconstitutional , because , I st , The power to pass such a law is not granted to the Federal government , and the powers not granted remain in the states . The only section of the constitution , which relates to fugitives from service or labor , prohibits , it is true , the discharge from such service or labor by the laws of any state into which such fugitive shall flee , but does not confer on Congress the power to provide for their rendition . 2d . The law provides for the appointment , by the Circuit Courts of the United States , of commissioners , who shall hold their offices at the will of the // court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fees , and whose powers and functions under the law are of a judicial character , while the Constitution provides that all judicial officers shall be appointed by the President , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , who shall receive a fixed salary and hold their offices during good behavior. 3d . The Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property , but by due process of law , while this statute allows a claimant or his a*ent to seize a fugitive without process . We say , for these reasons , we regard the fugitive slave law unconstitutional , and we know that this opinion is held by many other persons , and all the arguments which have been used in favor of its constitutionality have failed to carry conviction . Every man has a right to his own opinion and to bring others , if he can , to agree with him , and we trust the time will come when this law will be generally regarded as unconstitutional . But this question has been before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that court has pronounced the decision that the law does not conflict with the Constitution . It is in vain to reargue the question before this court , as at present constituted . It is in vain to expect a reversal of that decision now . The Supreme Court is the court of final resort , the arbiter appointed by the constitution itself , to declare the law of the land . While this decision remains unreversed and in full force , whatever our private opinions may be , we must conform our practice to the decision of the court . Although we think the law to be unconstitutional , we must act as though it is constitutional . There can be no security for any man 's life , liberty , or property if the private judgment of the citizen can annul the law of the state . This is consonant with reason , and with the precepts of the Bible . The directions of the apostle , " Let every soul be subject to the higher powers , for there is no power but of God ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God . " And again , " Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man , for the Lord 's sake ; whether it be to the // king as supreme , or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him , for the punishment of evil doers , and for the praise of them that do well . For so is the will of God , " are not arbitrarv commands . Nor are they of local or temporary policy . They are founded in the nature of man , as he is constituted by his Maker . It is the will of God that man should live in societies . Society necessitates government . Government can only exist by the enforcement of law . The right of a civil government to enact laws , involves the duty of obedience on the part of the subjects . Thus it is seen that the duty to obey the civil authority is a religious duty , and an enlightened conscience will demand obedience to the law of the land , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it will demand disobedience to those enactments which contravene the law of God . Conscience is the rule of right for the individual . One man can not make his conscience a rule for another . Conscience takes cognizance of our own thoughts and feelmugs and actions , and forbids us to violate its dictates , but can never decide for others . It never prompts a man to redress his own wrongs , much less to seek to redress the wrongs of his fellows . The directions of the apostle on this subject were given when the world was suffering under tyranny and oppression to an extent hardly ever equaled ; but we nowhere find , either in the precept or example of the apostles , warrant for resisting the authority of the law , however great the wrong , however severe the oppression . There is a manifest difference between refusing to do a wrong , or omitting to perform a duty , although in this we disobey the civil authority , and resisting the civil authority by force , even when its requirements are , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the principle " We ought to obey God rather than men ; " in the other , we fall under the condemnation , " whoso resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God . " Paul and Silas suffered imprisonment for disobeying an unrighteous law ; but we do not learn that the disciples used any other means for their rescue than prayer to God . // Other examples of disobedience to wicked laws , and nonresistance to oppressors , will recur to the reader . Under our form of government , the Supreme Court of the United States has the duty and the right of determining whether the enactments of the law-making power of the federal government have the force of law . When , therefore , their decision is made , and as long as it is unchanged , obedience becomes the duty of the citizen . Are we asked on what principle disobedience to unrighteous enactments can be justified ? We answer , on the grounds already stated , that all law proceeds from God , and every civil enactment which violates the moral sense which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and what is wrong , is no law , has no binding force . Civil law has been well defined by Blackstone , to be " the rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in the state , coinmanding what is rigid , and prohibiting what is wrong . " A statute which commands what is wrong , and prohibits what is right , no matter from what authority it issues , is no law , and may be rightfully disobeyed . So , too , when a government is unjust and oppressive to such an extent that it can not be looked on " as ordained of God , " and is clearly seen to be unrighteous , the majority of the people having the power may resort to revolution , and change the government . But there is no middle ground , in such cases , between revolution and submission to the penalty for disobedience . IResistance to the civil authority is , so far forth , revolution , and can never be justified except in an extreme case . The men whom we most highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the oppressive enactments of Laud and the tyranny of the Stuarts , refused to submit their consciences to the dictation of their oppressors , but they did not revolt until forbearance ceased to be a virtue , and until the way to a change in the government was opened , yet we are accustomed to call them the fathers of civil and religious liberty . When three of the judges , who condemned IKing Charles L to death , were compelled , after the restoration of the mon // archy in England , to flee to this country , John Davenport , the first minister in the New Haven Colony , preached a series of sermons , in which he taught his people their duty in reference to those fugitives from an unjust persecution . Those among whom they took refuge gave them protection , but they did not accomplish this object by rebellion against the government , nor by armed resistance to the legally constituted authorities ; neither did they violate their consciences by obeying righteous enactments . Such is the duty of all who regard the fugitive slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringement on the rights of conscience . Not to submit their consciences to the unrighteous enactments of the civil power , and do what they regard as contrary to God 's will , but , on the other hand , not to resist the officers of the law , unless prepared , with the great majority of the people , to effect an entire revolution and remodel the government . When they are prepared for this , the law can be changed under the forms of law . ( For a full discussion of " the doctrine of the higher law , " the reader is referred to an article on that subject , published in this Journal , May , 1853 , from the pen of the venerable President Day , late of Yale College . ) We do not suppose that those , who were engaged in the rescue we have been discussing , rest their justificatioii on any supposed right of resistance to law , short of revolution . We have supposed that they base their defense on the facts and principles to which we have already alluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free ; that the man rescued was not proved to be a slave ; and if he was such , not known to them to be a slave , and that the authority under which he was seized was invalid and without effect . There is danger , however , that in our sympathy for those who suffer bonds and imprisonment unjustly , and in our abhorrence of an unrighteous law , we may forget the duty we owe of obedience to righteous law , and may lose our reverence for that which is truly the ordinance of God . There is another point in this case of great interest , with reference to which we presume the question of the constitutionality of the law was raised , viz , the power and right of the // state courts to set free those imprisoned by order of the federal courts . After the conviction and sentence of Bushnell by the District Conrt of the United States , his counsel obtained , from the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio , a writ of habeas corpus , that that court might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order for his liberation , and so a question of the gravest importance has arisen which must be settled by the tribunal of public opinion . After what we have already said , it is hardly necessary to repeat that in our opinion Bushnell was unjustly convicted , the evidence and the law being both in his favor ; but the question here involved depends on the relative rights and powers of the general government and the individual states , and however much our prejudices and sympathies may be enlisted in the particular case affected , the decision must be made upon general principles . It has bearings quite beyond the present issue . The question is not altogether a new one . Thirty years ago a law of Congress was in force , which was regarded by the people of some of the states as clearly unconstitutional , pal*ably unjust and oppressive to individuals . They proposed at that time , by the interposition of state authority , to obtain protection from what they regarded as gross invasions of their rights . We well remember how the great " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invincible powers of logic , wit , and eloquence , and discomfited and confounded it , as was thought , forever . We remember how that unanswerable argument passed from city to city , from farmn-honse to farmhouse , through the northern states , how every hearth-stone re*choed its eloquence , and every school-boy chose for his declamation , a selection from Webster 's reply to iLiayne . Then young and old alike uttered their congratulations that the North had found a voice and the Constitution a defender , while they cherished the hope that the principles , on which the rights of the federal government and the states rested , were now definitely and finally established . We know it is the fashion at the present day , in some quarters , to speak with slight , even with reviling , of Daniel Webster . We are not // about to commend his political course during the last years of his life . We never think of it but with mortification and regret , feeling that his sun set under a cloud . But the eloquence , which kindled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ; the logic , which carried conviction to all minds , which was embodied by political opponents , then in power , in the form of a proclamation from the President , was not sophistry . That principle which was right in 1830 is not wrong now . It is better for the north , it is better for the south , it is always better , to follow the principles of right , than by consulting expedients of temporary advantage to put everything at hazard . The question now presented is , have the state courts the right to release from imprisonment those who have been convicted and sentenced for crime in the federal courts , in cases where , in the opinion of the state courts , the federal courts have erred ? NVe can answer this question if we determine the nature and relationof the federal and state governuients and in whom the decision of questions of constitutional law is vested . We hold to the doctrine that the constitution of the United States and the government formed under it derive their obligatory force from the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this constitution as the supreme law of the land . The state governments derive their authority from the same source . Neither can be said to be primary , in relation to the other ; neither supreme as respects the other ; although each is supreme in its own sphere , as respects the people . The people of the United States owe a double allegiance to the general government in all matters within its delegated powers , and to the state governments in all matters not conferred upon the general government . The nature of government and of law is not changed , but the powers of government are divided , a part being given to the federal union and a part remaining with the states . In the language of Mr. Webster , " The people erected this government . They gave it a constitution , and in that constitution they have enumerated the powers which they bestow // upon it . They have made it a limited government . They have defined its authority . They have restrained it to the exercise of such powers as are granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the states or to the people . But they have not stopped here . If they had they would have accomplished but half their work . No definition can be so clear , as to avoid possibility of doubt ; no limitation so precise as to exclude all uncertainty . Who , then , shall construe this grant of the people ? Who shall interpret their will , where it may be supposed they have left it doubtful ? With whom do they repose the ultimate right of deciding on the powers of the government ? They have settled all this in the fullest manner . They have left it with the government itself in its appropriate branches . The very chief end , the main design , for which the whole constitution was framed and adopted , was to establish a government that should not be obliged to act through state agency , or depend upon state opinion and state discretion . The people have wisely provided in the constitution itself ; a proper , suitable mode and tribunal for settling questions of constitutional law . There are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restrictions on these powers . There are , also , prohibitions on the states . Some authority must , therefore , necessarily exist , having the ultimate jurisdiction to fix and ascertain the interpretation of these grants , restrictions and prohibitions . The constitution has itself pointed out , ordained , and established that authority . How has it accomplished this great and essential end ? By declaring that the constitution and the laws of the United States , made in pursuance thereof , shall be the supreme law of the land , anything in the constitution and laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding . " " But who shall decide the question of interference ? To whom lies the last appeal ? This the constitution itself decides , also , by declaring that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under the constitution and laws of the United States . ' These two provisions cover the whole ground . They are , in truth , the keystone of the arch . With these it is a constitution , without them it is a confederacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress established at its very first session , in the judicial act , a mode for carrying them into full effect and for bringing all questions of constitutional power to the final decision of the Supreme Court . It then became a government . It then had the means of selfprotection . Having constituted the government and declared its powers , the people have further said that since somebody must decide on the extent of these powers , the government shall itself decide ; subject , always , like other popular governments , to its responsibility to the people . And now , I repeat , how is it that a state legislature or court acquires any power to interfere ? Who , or what , gives them the right to say to the people , We , who are your agents and servants for one purpose , will undertake to decide that your other agents and servants , appointed by you for another purpose , have transcended the authority you gave them I ' The reply would , I think , not be impertinent , Who made you a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stand or fall . ' " We can hardly add anything to this able exposition of constitutional law . Obedience is the correlative of law , and if the right of resistance on the part of individuals can not be maintained , as we have argued in a former part of this Article , the right of resistance by organized bodies , whether legislatures , courts or states , can not be maintained . Law and resistance , government and rebellion are inconsistent ideas , and can not exist together . They inevitably result in collision , force against force , and " this is war-civil war . " The people have established the constitution of the United States as the supreme law of ' the land . In this constitution , they have provided that " The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court , and such inferior courts as the Congress may , from thue to time , ordain and establish . The judicial power shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this constitution , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no tribunal authorized to revise the decisions of this supreme court , and to declare that they have committed error . True it is , that the same people who // have collectively constituted the federal courts for the purposes stated in the federal constitution , have separately under their state organizations , constituted other conits with different powers , and for other purposes . But they have given to these state courts no authority to pass upon the decisions of the federal courts . The question is sometimes put in this form , may not the courts of a state protect the citizens of that state from the niiconstitutional decisions of the federal courts ? May not a state court , ; there the process of a federal court is informal , set at liberty a person held in custody under such informal process ? We need add nothing to what has been said to show that the federal courts are the sole judges of questions arising under the constitution and laws of the United States . With regard to the other question we say , if an inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutional mode of ascertaining the fact , is in the federal courts themselves , for the jurisdiction of these courts extends to precisely these matters as well as to the weightier matters of constitutionality . The fact that an individual holds the office of judge under a state organization , gives him no more right , in a case arising under the constitution and laws of the United States , to oppose the federal courts , than any individual has who is not a judicial officer . His jurisdiction does not extend to this class of subjects . The people , from whom he derives his authority , have given to other tribunals the right to decide these questions , and have restricted him . He may have his opinions , as an individual , upon these as upon all other subjects , but the fact that he is a judge for one purpose , does not make him a judge for all purposes . So that while we agree in the main with the views expressed by Judge Brinkerhoff of the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entitled to weight , as those of a learned jurist , they can have no practical force , because they can not be carried into practical effect , without direct opposition-rebellion rather to the supreme law of the land . But it is said " the state must protect the citizen , " and so it can and ought to do in all cases , where it has jurisdiction . // But the people , who gave the state its being , have submitted certain questions affecting their rights to a different tribunal , and have placed in that fortress all the defenses they have deemed necessary . They did not organize the state to stand between the general government and the indiVidual citizen ; nor is the general government responsible to the states , but to the people . The people in their sovereign capacity are their own defenders against the oppression , either of the states or of the general government . If it is said this ought not to be ,  --  it is dangerous to lodge so much power in the general government ,  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a constitution of government , discussing its provisions and defining and limiting powers under it . The question is not what we should do under such circumstances . It is a question of the construction of a constitution already formed . The question is not what ought to be , but what is the law of the land . If that law is unjust and oppressive , it may be repealed or changed in a peaceable way , under the provisions of the constitution , or in an extreme case by a revolution . There is , there can be , no middle ground . We f*ar that the feeling of many against the fugitive slave law will lead them to refuse their assent to these principles and arguments addressed to the reason . Let us take a case where our feelings will harmonize with the argument , and if conviction does not follow , it will at least be evident that the question is not one of feeling , but of constitutional law , and must be decided by the calm exercise of reason , and not by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Suppose , then , if such a supposition were possible , that Capt . Corrie had been convicted , in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina , by a southern jury , of the crime of piracy , for having been engaged in the foreign slave trade , and that after his conviction and sentence , the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina had been applied to for a writ of 1*abeas corpus , that the causes of Corrie ' s imprisonment might be enquired into , and he be set at liberty . Suppose that the State Court of South Carolina // had examined the case , and had decided that the laws of the United States against the slave trade were unconstitutional , and that therefore Capt . Corrie was unlawfully detained in custody . Putting this opinion in practice , they proceed to discharge Capt . Corrie , and thus are brought in direct collision with the general government . What an outrage would all this seem on the rights of the government ! What a trampling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sanctity of the supreme law of the land must be preserved , and the whole force of the government employed to put down this resistance , this rebellion , this practical nullification . Such would be the feeling at the north in this supposed case ; and have we not the moral courage to adhere to principle , although the application of the principle may bear hardly on ourselves ? The supposition we have made might be extended to a variety of cases ; for every law is a restriction upon some man 's interest , or feelings , or passions , and these must be subordinated to the law . The government which can not enforce its commands , but may be checked and resisted by the will of any individual or organization of individuals , is no government , but confusion and anarchy . Obedience to law is the only bond of union among men in organized coinumunities. " untune that striug , And hark , what discord follows ! each thing meets In mere oppugnancy : Force should be right , or rather right and wrong Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything includes itself in power , Power into will , will into appetite ; And appetite , a universal wolf So doubly seconded by will and power , Must make perforce a universal prey , And , last , eat up himself . " We have alluded to the case of Captain Corrie . What a contrast is this case to that of the men in Ohio ! In one we see a grand jury finding a bill of indictment ; a petit jury trying the cases and convicting the offenders ; and the court // inflicting upon them the penalty of the law . Their friends sympathize with them as honest men , unj justly convicted , and their counsel , exhausting every legal means for their relief , apply to the Supreme Court of the State in hopes of obtaining the liberation of their clients . But this is all . No one doubted that the men would be convicted and sentenced , if guilty ; many feared that they would be convicted and punished by partisans , whether guilty or not ; and many now think the conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the slave traders ? No one doubts their violation of the law . They openly boast of it and proclaim their determination to continue it . Did any one at the north or south suppose that these slave traders would be convicted ? Only one of them , we believe , and he not a southern man , has been put on trial . This is a gross perversion of law and justice , equally great and dangerous when done by juries as when done by courts . Many are ready to cry out against the Oberlin men , puni8h them , pun i8h them , insisting with solemn dignity on the majesty of the law , and the necessity of its rigid enforcement , not reflecting that their violation of law , if any , has occurred from an error on the side of mercy and liberty . How many of these very men dare open their months , when the laws are openly violated with impunity , in favor of slavery and oppression , by the slave trade ! And this is not all . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , to kindle the feelings , and arouse the action of his fellow citizens , how many are there , with loud professions of hostility to slavery , ready to say , " He is an agitator. " - " I am tired of hearing Mr. A. preach so much on slavery . " " It is better to let slavery alone . " " Its power would have decreased before this , if it had not been attacked . " At the close of our Article , already extended , we can only say to such persons , perhaps if you will examine your feelings thoroughly , you will find that you are not so much opposed to slavery as you have professed to be . Your opposition may be after all only theoretical , never to be put in practice . If you think again , you may perceive that it is from the action , // or rather the inaction , of just such professed opponents of slavery as yourself that the people of the south are so united in support of the system , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not impossible that you may come to the conclusion that this privilege of hunting slaves on the free territory of the north , sanctioned by Congress , the courts and the people , and by yourselves , if you have not manifested your oppositiou to it , has emboldened the slave traders to seek their prey , more securely and at less expense , in Africa itself . While these sheets are passing through the press we learn that the particular case , which has called forth this discussion , is ended by the discharge of all the prisoners . We rejoice in this issue . Although this trial is ended , the questions involved are not settled ; they may arise again to-morrow . Is the fugitive slave saw constitutional ? May it consistently with the dictates of conscience be obeyed or disobeyed ? May its execution be resisted by force ? On what principles shall trials for its violation be conducted ? Shall there be one answer to these questions at the north and another at the south ? Under our general government shall those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who violate the law against the foreign slave trade go free ?
