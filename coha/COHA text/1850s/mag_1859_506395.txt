THE VIRGINIANS . BY W. M. THACKERAY . IN WHICH HARRY GOES WESTWARD . OUR tender hearts are averse to all ideas and descriptions of parting ; and I shall therefore say nothing of Harry Warringtou 's feelings at taking leave of his brother and friends . Were not thousands of men in the same plight ? Had not Mr. Wolfe his mother to kiss ( his brave father had quitted life during his son 's absence on the glorious Louishourg campaign ) , and his sweet-heart to clasp in a farewell emhrace ? Had not stout Admiral Holmes , before sailing westward with his squadron , the Somerset , the Terrible , the Northumberland , the Royal Willjam , the Trident , the Diana , the Sea-horse-his own flag being hoisted on hoard the Dublin-to take leave of Mrs. and the Misses Holmes ? Was Admiral Saunders , who sailed the day after him , exempt from human feeling ? Away go William and his crew of jovial sailors plowing through the tumbling waves , and poor Blackeyed Susan on shore watches the ship as it dwindles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The night falls darkling over the ocean . They are gone : but their hearts are at home yet a while . In silence , with a heart inexpressihly soft and tender , how each man thinks of those he has left ! What a chorus of pitiful prayer rises up to the Father , at sea and on shore , on that parting night : at home by the vacant bedside , where the wife kneels in tears ; round the fire , where the mother and children together pour out their supplications : or on deck , where the sea-farer looks up to the stars of heaven , as the ship cleaves through the roaring midnight waters ! To-mor row the sun rises upon our common life again , and we commence our daily task of toil and duty . George accompanies his brother , and stays a while with him at Portsmouth while they are waiting for a wind . He shakes Mr. Wolfe 's hand , looks at his pale face for the last time ; and sees the vessels depart amidst the clangor of hells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is hack at his home , and at that hu*iness which is sure one of the most selfish and absorbing of the world 's occupations , to which almost every man who is thirty years old has served ere this his apprenticeship . He has a pang of sadness as he looks in at the lodgings to the little room which Hnrry used to occupy , and sees his half-burned papers still in the grate . In a few minutes he is on his way to Dean Street again , and whispering by the fitful firelight in the ear of the clinging sweet-heart . She is very happy-oh ! so happy ! - at his return . She is ashamed of being so . Is it not heartless to be so , whcu poor Hetty is so melancholy ? Poor little Hetty ! Indeed , it is selfish to be glad when she is in such a sad way . It makes one quite wretched to see her . " Do n't , Sir ! Well , I ought to be wretched , and it 's very , very wicked of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one can understand her soft-hearted repentance . What she means hy " Do n't " who cnn tell ? I have said the room was dark , and the fire burned fitfully-and " Do n't " is no doubt uttered in one of the dark fits . Enter servants with supper and lights . The family arrives ; the conversation becomes general . The destination of the fleet is known every where now . The force on board is sufficient to heat all the *rench in Canada ; and , under such an officer as Wolfe , to repair the blunders and disasters of previous campaigns . He looked dreadfully ill , indeed . But he has a great soul in a feeble body . The ministers , the country hope the utmost from him . After supper , according to custom , Mr. Lambert assemhles his modest household ; of whom George Warrington may be said quite to form a part ; and as he prays for all travelers by land and water , Theo and her sister are kneeling together . And so , as the ship speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue it : and the night passes , and the sun rises . A day or two more and every body is at his hooks or his usual work . As for George Warrington , that celebrated dramatist is busy about another composition . When the tragedy of Carpezan had run some thirty *r two-score nights other persons of genius took possession of the theatre . There may have been persons who wondered how the town could be so fickle as ever to tire of such a master-piece as the Tragedy - who could not bear to see the actors dressed in other habits , reciting other men 's verses ; but George , of a skeptical turn of mind , took the fate of his Tragedy very philosophically , and pocketed the proceeds with much quiet satisfaction . From Mr. Dodsley , the bookseller , he had the usual CHAPTER LXVIII. // complem'mt of a hundred pounds ; from the manager of the theatre two hundred or more ; and such praises from the critics and his friends , that he set to work to prepare another piece , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first performance . Over these studies , and the other charming business which occupies him , months pass away . Happy business ! Happiest time of youth and life , when love is first spoken and returned ; when the dearest eyes are daily shining welcome , and the fondest lips never tire of whispering their sweet secrets ; when the parting look that accompanies " Good-night ! " gives delightful warning of to-morrow ; when the heart is so overflowing with love and happiness that it has to spare for all the world ; when the day closes with glad prayers and opens with joyful hopes ; when doubt seems cowardice , misfortune impossible , poverty only a sweet trial of constancy ! Theo 's elders , thankfully remembering their own prime , sit softly by and witness this pretty comedy performed by their young people . And in one of his later letters , dutifully written to his wife during a temporary absence from home , George Warrington records how he had been to look up at the windows of the dear old house in Dean Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Theo had been so happy . Meanwhile we can learn how the time passes , and our friends are engaged , by some extracts from George 's letters to his brother . " From the old window opposite Bedford Gardens , this 20th August , 1*'b9 . " Why are you gone back to rugged rocks , bleak shores , burning summers , nipping winters , at home , when you might have been cropping ever so many laurels in Germany ? Kingsley 's are coming back as covered with em as Jack-aGreen on May-day . Our six regiments did wonders ; and our horse would have done if my Lord George Sackville only had let them . But when Prince Ferdinand said Charge ! ' his lordship could not hear , or could not translate the German word for Forward ; ' and so we only beat the French , without utterly annihilating them , as we might , had Lord Granby or Mr. Warrington had the command . My lord is come back to town , and is shouting for a Court Martial . He held his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constancy of arrogance that one almost admires him . He looks as if he rather envied poor Mr. Byng , and the not shooting him were a manqee d ' *gards toward him . " The Duke has had notice to get himself in readiness for departing from this world of grandcurs and victories , and dowufalls and disappointments . An attack of palsy has visited his Royal Highness ; and pallida soors has just peeped in at his door , as it were , and said , I will call again . ' Tyrant as he was , this prince has been noble in disgrace ; and no king has ever had a truer servant than ours has found in his son . Why do I like the losing side always , and am I disposed to revolt against the winners ? Your famous Mr. P- , your chief 's patron and discoverer , I have been to hear in the House of Commons twice or thrice . I revolt against his magniloquence . I wish some little David would topple over that swelling giant . His thoughts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner best , though the other is the more awful actor . " Pocahontas gets on apace . Barry likes his part of Captain Smith ; and , though he will have him wear a red coat and blue facings and an epaulet , I have a fancy to dress him exactly like one of the pictures of Queen Elizabeth 's gentlemen at Hampton Court : with a ruff and a square beard and square shoes . And Pocahontas-would you like her to be tattooed ? ' asks Uncle Lambert . Hagan 's part as the warrior who is in love with her , and seeing her partiality for the Captain , nobly rescues him from death , I trust will prove a hit . A strange fish is this Hagan : his mouth full of stage-plays and rant , but gund , honest , and brave , if I do n't err . He is angry at having been cast lately for Sir OBrallaghan , in Mr. Macklin 's new farce of Love A-la. mode . He says that he does not keer to disgreece his tongue with imiteetions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for imiteetions , when he has such an admirable twang of his own ! " Shall I tell you ? Shall I hide the circumstance ? Shall I hurt your feelings ? Shall I set you in a rage of jealousy , and cause you to ask for leave to return to Europe ? Know , then , that though Carpezan is long since dead , Cousin Maria is forever coming to the play-house . Tom Spencer has spied her out night after night in the gallery , and she comes on the night when Hagan performs . Quick , Burroughs , Mr. Warrington 's boots and portmanteau ! Order a chaise and four for Portsmouth immediately ! The letter which I burned one morning when we were at breakfast ( I may let the cat out of the bag , now puss has such a prodigious way to run ) was from Cousin M. , hinting that she wished me to tell no tales about her ; but I ca n't help just whispering to you that Maria at this moment is busy consoling herself as fast as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" Our mother 's friend , Mynheer Van den Bosch , has been away on a tour to discover his family in Holland , and , strange to say , has found one . Miss ( who was intended by maternal solicitude to be a wife for your worship ) has had six months at Kensington School , and is coming out with a hundred pretty accomplishments , which are to complete her a perfect fine lady . Her Papa brought her to make a courtesy in Dean Street , and a mighty elegant courtesy she made . Though she is scarce seventeen , no dowager of sixty can be more at her ease . She conversed with Aunt Lambert on an equal footing ; she treated the girls as chits  --  to Hetty 's wrath and Theo 's amusement . She talked politics with the General , and the last routs , dresses , operas , fashions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for a blunder or two , you might have ' fancied Miss Lydia was born in Mayfair . At the Court end of the town she will live , she says ; and has no patience with her father , who has a lodging in Monument Yard . For those who love a brown beauty , a prettier little mignonne creature can not be seen . But my taste , you know , dearest brother , and . Here follows a page of raptures and quotations of verse , which , out of a regard for the reader , and the writer 's memory , the editor of the present pages declines to reprint . Gentlemen and ladies of a certain age may remember the time when they indulged in these rapturous follies on their own accounts ; when the praises of the charmer were forever warbling from their lips or trickling from their pens ; when the flowers of life were in full bloom , and all the birds of spring were singing . The twigs are now bare , perhaps , and the leaves have fallen ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vernal time ? As for you , young people , whose May ( or April , is it ? ) has not commenced yet , you need not be detained over other folks ' love-rhapsodies ; depend on it , when your spring-season arrives , kindly Nature will warm all your flowers into bloom , and rouse your glad bosoms to pour out their fall song . A LITTLE INNOcENT . GEOEGE WAItRINOTON has mentioned in the letter just quoted , that in spite of my Lord Castlewood 's previous play transactions with Harry , my lord and George remained friends , and niet on terms of good kinsmanship . Did George want franks , or an introduction at Court , or a place in the House of Lords to hear a debate , his cousin was always ready to serve him , was a pleasant and witty companion , and would do any thing which might promote his relative 's interests , provided his own were not prejudiced . Now he even went so far as to promise that he would do his best with the people in power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed a greater disinclination to return to his native country , and place himself once more under the maternal servitude . George had not merely a sentimental motive for remaining in England ; the pursuits and society of London pleased him infinitely better than any which he could have at home . A planter 's life of idleness might have suited him could he have enjoyed independence with it . But in Virginia he was only the first , and , as he thought , the worst-treated , of his mother 's subjects . He dreaded to think of returning with his young bride to his home , and of the life which she would be destined to lead there . Better freedom and poverty in England , with congenial society , and a hope perchance of future distinction , than the wearisome routine of home life , the tedious subordination , the frequent bickerings , the certain jealousies and differences of opinion , to which he must subject his wife so soon as they turned their faces homeward . So Lord Castlewood 's promise to provide for George was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My lord had not provided very well for his own brother to be sure , and his own position , peer as he was , was any thing but enviable ; but we believe what we wish to believe , and George Warrington chose to put great stress upon his kinsman 's offer of patronage . Unlike the Warrington family , Lord Castlewood was quite gracious when he was made acquainted with George 's engagement to Miss Lambert ; came to wait upon herparents ; praised George to them andthe young lady to George , and made himself so prodigiously agreeable in their company that these charitable folk forgot his bad reputation , and thought it must be a very wicked and scandalous world which maligned him . He said , indeed , that he was improved in their society , as every man must be who came into it . Amoug them he was witty , lively , good for the time being . He left his wickedness and worldliness with his cloak in the hail , and only put them on again when he stepped into his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some such harbor of rest and calm , some haven where he puts in out of the storm ? Very likely Lord Castlewood was actually better while he staid with those good people , and for the time being , at least no hypocrite . And , I dare say , the Lambert elders thought no worse of his lordship for openly proclaiming his admiration for Miss Theo . It was quite genuine , and he did not profess it was very deep . " It do n't affect my sleep , and I am not going to break my heart because Miss Lambert prefers somebody else , " he remarked . " Only I wish when I was a young man , Madam , I had had the good fortune to meet with somebody so innocent and good as your daughter . I might have been kept out of a deal of harm 's way . But innocent and good young women did not fall into mine , or they would have made me better than I am . " " Sure , my lord , it is not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castlewood started back , misunderstanding her . " Not too late , Madam ? " he inquired . She blushed . " It is too late to court my dear daughter , my lord , but not too late to repent . We read , t is never too late to do that . If others have been received at the eleventh hour , is there any reason why you should give up hope ? " " Perhaps I know my own heart better than you , " he says , in a plaintive tone . " I can speak French and German very well , and why ? because I was taught both in the nursery . A man who learns them late can never get the practice of them on his tongue . And so t is the case with goodness ; I ca n't learn it at my age . I can only see others practice it , and admire them . When I am on-on the side opposite to Lazarus , will Miss Theo give me a drop of water ? Do n't frown ! I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doomed so ; and I think some of our family are among these . Some people are vacillating , and one hardly knows which way the scale will turn . Whereas some are predestined angels , and fly heavenward naturally , and do what they will . " " Oh , my lord , and why should you not be of the predestined ? While there is a day leftwhile there is an hour-there is hope ! " says the fond matron . " I know what is passing in your mind , my dear madam-nay , I read your prayers in your looks ; but how can they avail ? " Lord Castlewood asked , sadly . " You do n't know all , my good lady . You do n't know what a life ours is of the world ; how early it began ; how selfish Nature , and then necessity and education have made us . It is Fate holds the reins of the chariot , and we ca n't escape our doom . I know better : I see better people : I go my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is not altogether without pity for us , since it allows us , from time to time , to see such people as you . " And he took her hand and looked her full in the face , and bowed with a melancholy grace . Every word he said was true . No greater error than to suppose that weak and bad men are strangers to good feelings , or deficient of sensibility . Only the good feeling does not last-nay , the tears are a kind of debauch of sentiment , as old libertines are said to find that the tears and grief of their victims add a zest to their pleasure But Mrs. Lambert knew little of what was passing in this man s mind ( how should she ? ) , and so prayed for him with the fond persistence of woman . He was much better-yes , much better than he was supposed to be . He was a most interesting man . There were hopes , why should there not be the most precious hopes for him still ? It remains to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my lord 's character . Meanwhile , if the gentleman was right , the lady was mollified , and her kind wishes and prayers for this experienced sinner 's repentance , if they were of no avail for his amendment , at least could do him no harm . Kind-souled doctors ( and what good woman is not of the faculty ? ) look after a reprobate as physicians after a perilous case . When the patient is converted to health their interest ceases in him , and they drive to feel pulses and prescribe medicines elsewhere . But while the malady was under treatment our kind lady could not see too much of her sick man . Quite an intimacy sprung up between my Lord Castlewood and the Lamberts . I am not sure that some worldly views might not suit even with good Mrs. Lambert 's spiritual plans ( for who knows into what pure Eden , though guarded by flaming-sworded angels , worldliness will not creep ? ) . Her son was about to take orders . My Lord Castlewood feared very much that his present Chaplain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations might lead him to give up his chaplaincy ; in which case , my lord hinted the little modest cure would be vacant , and at the service of some young divine of good principles and good manners , who would be content // with a small stipend , and a small but friendly congregation . Thus an acquaintance was established between the two families , and the ladies of Castlewood , always on their good behavior , came more than once to make their courtesies in Mrs. Lambert 's drawing-room . They were civil to the parents and the young ladies . My Lady Castlewood 's card assemblies were open to Mrs. Lambert and her family . There was play , certainly-all the world played- his Majesty , the bishops , every peer and peeress in the land . But nobody need play who did not like ; and surely nobody need have scruples regarding the practice when such august and venerable personages were daily found to abet it . More than once Mrs. Lambert made her appearance at her ladyship 's routs , and was grateful for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which her daughters excited . Mention has been made , in a foregoing page and letter , of an American family of Dutch extraction , who had come to England very strongly recommended by Madam Esmond , their *firginian neighbor , to her sous in Europe . The views expressed in Madam Esmond 's letter were so clear that that arch match-maker Mrs. Lambert could not but understand them . As for George , he was engaged already ; as for poor Hetty 's flame , Harry , he was gone on service , for which circumstance Hetty 's mother was not very sorry perhaps . $he laughingly told George that he ought to obey his mamma 's injunctions , break off his engagement with Theo , and make up to Miss Lydia , who was ten times-ten times ! a hundred times as rich as her poor girl , and certainly much handsomer . " Yes , indeed , " says George , " that I own : she is handsomer , and she is richer , and perhaps even cleverer . " ( All which praises Mrs. Lambert but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ? So is Mr. Johnson much cleverer than I am : so is , whom shall we say ? - so is Mr. Hagan , the actor , much taller and handsomer : so is Sir James Lowther much richer : yet pray , maum , do you suppose I am going to be jealous of any one of these three , or think my Theo would jilt me for their sakes ? Why should I not allow that Miss Lydia is handsomer , then ? and richer , and clever , too , and lively , and well bred , if you insist on it , and an angel if you will have it so ? Theo is not afraid : art thou , child ? " " No , George , " says Theo , with such an honest look of the eyes as would couviuce any skepticism , or shame any jealousy . And if , after this pair of speeches , mamma takes occasion to leave the room for a minute to fetch her scissors , or her thimble , or a boot-jack and slippers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , or her pocket-handkerchief which she has forgotten in the parlor - if , I say , Mrs. Lambert quits the room on any errand or pretext , natural or preposterous , I shall not be in the least surprised if , at her return in a couple of miuntes , she finds George in near proximity to Theo , who has a heightened color , and whose hand George is just droppiug , I shall not have the least idea of what they have been doing . Have you , madam ? Have you any remembrance of what used to happen when Mr. Grundy came a-courting ? Are you , who , after all , were not in the room with our young people , going to cry out fie and for shame ? Then tie and for shame upon you , Mrs. Grundy ! Well , Harry being away , and Theo and George irrevocably engaged , so that there was no possibility of bringing Madam Esmond 's little plans to bear , why should not Mrs. Lambert have plans of her own ? and if a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , why should not Jack Lambert from Oxford have her ? So thinks Mamma , who was always thinking of marrying and giving in marriage , and so she prattles to General Lambert , who , as usual , callsheragoose for her pains . At any rate , Mrs. Lambert says , beauty and riches are noobjection ; at any rate , Madam Esmond desired that this family should be hospitably entertained , and it was not her fault that Harry was gone away to Canada . Would the General wish him to come back ; leave the army and his reputation , perhaps ; yes , and come to England and marry this American , and break poor Hetty 's heart-would her father wish that ? Let us spare further arguments , and not be so rude as to hint that Mr. Lambert was in the right in calling a fond wife by the name of that absurd splay-footed bird , annually sacrificed at the Feast of St. Michael . In those early days there were vast distinctions of rank drawn between the Court and city people : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , scarcely associated with any but the latter sort . He had a lodging near his agent 's in the city . When his pretty girl came from school for a holiday , he took her an airing to Islington or Highgate , or an occasional promenade in the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields . They went to that Baptist meetinghouse in Fiusbury Fields , and on the sly to see Mr. Garrick once or tWice , or that funny rogue Mr. Foote , at the Little Theatre . To go to a Lord Mayor 's feast was a treat to the gentleman of the highest order : and to dance with a young mercer at Hampstead Assembly gave the utmost delight to the young lady . When George went to wait upon his mother 's friends , he found our old acquaintance , Mr. Draper , of the Temple , sedulous in his attentions to her ; and the lawyer , who was married , told Mr. Warrington to look out , as the young lady had a plumb to her fortune . Mr. Drabshaw , a young Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bristol agent , was also in constant attendance upon the young lady , and in dreadful alarm and suspicion when Mr. Warrington first made his appearance . Wishing to do honor to his mother 's neighbors , Mr. Warrington invited them to an entertainment at his own apartments ; and who should so naturally meet them as his friends from Soho ? Not one of them but was forced to own little Miss Lydia 's beautf She had the foot of a fairy ; the arms , // neck , flashing eyes of a little brown huntress of Diana . She had brought a little plaintive accent from home with her-of which I , moi qui vous pane , have heard a hundred gross cockney imitations , and watched as many absurd disguises , and which I say ( in moderation ) is charming in the month of a charming woman . Who sets up to say No forsooth ? You , dear Miss Whittington , with whose h 's fate has dealt so nukindly ? - you , lovely Miss Nichol Jarvie , with your northern burr ? - you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All accents are pretty from pretty lips , and who shall set the standard up ? Shall it be a rose , or a thistle , or a shamrock , or a star and stripe ? As for Miss Lydia 's accent , I have no doubt it was not odious even from the first day when she *et foot on these polite shores , otherwise Mr. Warring ton , as a man of taste , had certainly disapproved of her manner of talking , and ber school-mistress at Kensington had not done her duty by her pupil . After the six months were over , during which , according to her father 's calculation , she was to learn all the accomplishments procurable at the Kensington Academy , Miss Lydia returned nothing loth to her grandfather , and took her place in the world . A narrow world at first it was to her ; but she was a resolute little person , and res6lved to enlarge her sphere in society ; and whither e*e chose to lead the way , the obedient grandfather followed her . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little good came of the severity he underwent . - He had thwarted his own son , who had turned out but ilL As for little Lyddy , he . was determined she should have as pleasant a life as was possible . Did not Mr. George think he was right ? T was said in Virginia-he did not know with what reason-that the young gentlemen of Castlewood had been happier if Madam Esmond had allowed them a little of their own way . George could not gainsay this public rumor , or think of inducing the benevolent old gentleman to alter his plans respecting his grand-daughter . As for the Lambert family , how could they do otherwise than welcome the kind old man , the parent so tender and liberal , Madam Esmond 's good friend ? When Miss came from school , grandpapa removed from Monument Yard to an elegant house in Bloomsbury , whither they were followed at first by their city friends . There were merchants from Virginia Walk ; there were worthy tradesmen , with whom the worthy old merchant had dealings ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly gracious to Miss Lyddy . It would be a long task to describe how these disappeared one by one-how there were no more junketings at Belsize , or trips to Higbgate , or Saturday jaunts to Deputy Higgs 's villa , llighbury , or country dances at honest Mr. Lutestring 's house at Hackney . Even the Sunday practice was changed ; and , Oh abomination of abominations ! . Mr. Van den Bosch left Bethesda Chapel in Bunhill Row and actually took a pew in Queen Square Church ! Queen Square Church , and Mr. George Warrington lived hard by in Southampton Row ! T was easy to see at whom Miss Lyddy was setting her cap , and Mr. Draper , who had been full of her and her grandfather 's praises before , now took occasion to warn Mr. George , and gave him very different reports regarding Mr. Van den Bosch to those which had first been current . Mr. Van d . B. , for all he bragged so of his Dutch parentage , came from Albany , and was nobody 's son at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by privateering ( which was uncommonly like piracy ) , and by the Guinea trade . His son had married-if marriage it could be called , which was very doubtful-an assigned servant , and had been cut off by his father , and had taken to bad courses , and had died , luckily for himself , in his own bed . " Mr. Draper has told you bad tales about me , " said the placid old gentleman to George . " Very likely we are all sinners , and some evil may be truly said of all of us , with a great deal more that is untrue . Did he tell you that my son was unhappy with me ? I told you so too . Did he bring you wicked stories about my family ? He liked it so well that he wanted to marry myLyddy to his brother . Heaven bless her ! I have had a many offers for her . And you are the young gentleman I should have chose for her , and I like you none the worse because you prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss , as compared to my Lyddy , begging your honor 's pardon , I am at a loss to understand . " " There is no accounting for tastes , my good Sir , " said Mr. George , with his most superb air . " No , Sir ; t is a wonder of nature , and daily happens . When I kept store to Albany , there was one of your tip-top gentry there that might have married my dear daughter that was alive then , and with a prett*r piece of money , whereby-for her father and I had quarreled-Miss Lyddy would have been a pauper , you see : and in place of my beautiful Bella , my gentleman chooses a little homely creature , no prettier than your Miss , and without a dollar to her fortune . The more fool he , saving your presence , Mr. George . " " Pray do n't save my presence , my good Sir , " says George , laughing . " I suppose the gentleman s word was given to the other lady , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your charming daughter . " " I suppose when a young fellow gives his word to perform a cursed piece of folly he always sticks to it , my dear Sir , begging your pardon . But Lord , Lord , what am I speaking of ? I am a speaking of twenty year ago . I was well - to - do then , but I may say Heaven has blessed my store , and I am three times as well off now . Ask my agents how much they will give for Joseph Van den Bosch 's bill at six months on New York  --  or at sight maybe-for forty thousand pound ? I warrant they will discount the paper . " " Happy he who has the bill , Sir ! " says George , // with a bow , not a little amused with the candor of the old gentleman . " Lord , Lord , how mercenary you young men are ! " cries the elder , simply . " Always thinking about money nowadays !

We were talking about you , and Mr. George said he would n't take you with all the money your poor old grandfather can give you. ** " Nay , Sir , " says George . " Well , you are right to say nay , for I did n't say all , that 's the truth . My Blessing will have a deal more than that trifle I spoke og when it shall please Heavea to remove me out of this world to a better-when poor old Gappy is gone , Lyddy will be a rich little Lyddy , that she will . But she do n't wish me to go yet , does she ? " " Oh , you darling , dear grandpapa ! " says Lyddy . " This young gentleman wo n't have you . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her brown eyes . ) But at any rate he is honest , and that is more than we can say of some folks in this wicked London . 0 Lord , Lord , how mercenary they are ! Do you know that yonder , iu Monument Yard , they were all at my poor little Blessing for lier money ? There was Tom Lutestring ; there was Mr. Draper , your precious lawyer ; there was actually . Mr. Tubbs , of Bethesda Chapel ; and they must all come buzzing like flies rouud the hou - pot . That is why we came out of the quarter where my brother tradesmen live . " " To avoid the flies , to be sure ! " says Miss Lydia , tossing up her little head . " Where my brother tradesmen live , " continues the old gentle*man . " Else who am I to think of consorting with your grandees and fine folk ? I do n't care for the fashions , Mr. George ; I do n't care for plays and poetry , begging your honor 's pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to please this little miux . " " Oh , Sir , t was lovely ! and I cried so , did n't I , grandpapa ? " says the child . " At what , my dear ? " " At-at Mr. Warrington 's play , grandpapa . " " Did you , my dear ? I dare say ; I dare say ! It was mail day : and my letters had come in : and my ship the Lovely Lyddy had just come into Falmouth ; and Captain Joyce reported how he had mercifully escaped a French privateer ; and my head was so full of thanks for that escape , which saved me a deal of money , Mr. George-for the rate at which ships is underwrote this war time is so scandalous that I *ften prefer to venture than to insure-that I confess I did n't listen much to the play , Sir , and only went to please this little Lyddy . " " And you did please me , dearest Gappy ! " cries the young lady . " Bless you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man want more here below than to please his children , Mr. George ? especially me , who knew what was to be unhappy when I was young , and to repent of having treated this darling 's father too hard . " " Oh , grandpapa ! " cries the child , with more caresses . " Yes , I was too hard with him , dear ; and that 's why I spoil my little Lydkin so ! " More kisses ensue between Lyddy and Gappy . The little creature flings the pretty polished arms round the old man 's neck , presses the dark red lips on his withered cheek , surrounds the venerable head with a halo of powder beaten out of his wig by her caresses ; and eyes Mr. George the while , as much as to say , There , Sir ! should you not like me to do as much for you ? * We confess  --  but do we confess all ? George certainly told the story of his interview with Lyddy and Gappy , and the old man 's news regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told every thing ; else Theo would scarce have been so much interested , or so entirely amused and good-humored with Lyddy when next the two young ladies met . They met now pretty frequently , especially after the old American gentleman took up his residence in Bloomsbury . Mr. Van den Bosch was in the city for the most part of the day , attending to his affairs , and appearing a*his place upon Change . During his absence Lyddy had the command of the house , and received her guests th&amp;re like a lady , or rode abroad in a fine coach , which she ordered her grandpapa to keep for her , and into which he could very seldom be induced to set his foot . Before longMiss Lyddy was as easy in the coach as if she had ridden in one all her life . She ordered the domestics here and there ; she drove to the mercer 's and the jeweler 's , and she called upon her friends with the utmost stateliness , or rode abroad with them to take the air . Theo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the elder have been quite as well pleased had she known all Miss Lyddy 's doings ? Not that Theo was of a jealous disposition-far otherwise ; but there are cases when a lady has a right to a little jealousy , as I maintain , whatever my fair readers may say to the contrary . It was because she knew he was engaged , very likely , that Miss Lyddy permitted herself to speak so frankly in Mr. George 's praise . When they were alone - and this blessed chance occurred pretty often at Mr. Van den Bosch 's house-for we have said he was constantly absent himself on one errand or the other - it was wonderful how artlessly the little creature would show her enthusiasm , asking him all sorts of simple questions about himself , his genius , his way of life at home and in London , his projects of marriage , and so forth . " I am glad you are going to be married , oh , so glad ! " she would say , heaving the most piteous sigh the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite frafikly as a brother , and not be afraid // of that odious politeness about which they were always scolqing me at boarding-school . I may speak to you frankly ; and if I like you , I may say so , may n't I , Mr. George ? " " Pray , say so , " says George , with a bow and a smile . " That is a kind of talk which most men delight to hear , especially from such pretty lips as Miss Lydia 's . " " What do you know about my lips ? " says the girl , with a pout and an innocent look into his face . " What , indeed ? " asks George . " Perhaps I should like to know a great deal more . " " They do*i't tell nothin ' but truth , any how ! " says the girl- " that 's why some people do n't like them ! If I have any thing on my mind it must come out . I am a country-bred girl , I am - with my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have learned I do n't know what at their boardingschools and from the men afterward . " " Our girls are monstrous little hypocrites , indeed ! " cries George . " You are thinking of Miss Lamberts ? and I might have thought of them ; but I declare I did not then . They have been at boarding-school ; they have been in the world a great deal-so much the greater pity for them , for be certain they learned no good there . And now I have said so , of course you will go and tell Miss Theo , wo n't you , Sir ? " " That she has learned no good in the world ? She has scarce spoken to men at all , except her father , her brother , and me . Which ofus would teach her any wrong , think you ? " " Oh , not you ! Though I can understand its being very dangerous to be with you ! " says the girl , with a sigh . " Indeed there is no danger , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't say bite , " says the girl , softly . " There 's other things dangerous besides biting , I should think . Are n't you very witty ? Yes , and sarcastic , and clever , and always laughing at people . Have n't you a coaxing tongue ? If you was to look at me in that kind of way I do n't know what would come to me . Was your brother like you , as I was to have married ? Was he as clever and witty as you ? I have heard he was like you : but he had n't your coaxing tongue . Heigho ! T is well you are engaged , Master George , that is all . Do you think if you had seen me first you would have liked Miss Theo best ? " " They say marriages were made in heaven , my dear , and let us trust that mine has been arranged there , " says George . " I suppose there was no such thing never known as a man having two sweet-hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a pity . Oh me ! What nonsense I 'm a-talking ; there now ! I 'm like the little girl who cried for the moon ; and I ca n't have it . T is too high for me-too high , and splendid , and shining : ca n't reach up to it nohow . Well , what a foolish , wayward , little spoiled thing I am now ! But one thing you promise-on your word and your honor , now , Mr. George ? " " And what is that ? " " That you wo n't tell Miss Theo , else she 'll hate me . " " Why should she hate you ? " " Because I hate her , and wish she was dead ! " breaks out the young lady . And the eyes that were looking so gentle and lachrymose but now , flame with sudden wrath , and her cheeks flush up . " For shame ! " she adds , after a pause . " I 'm a little fool to speak ! But whatever is in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , I am . I was bred where the sun is hotter than in this foggy climate ; and I am not like your cold English girls , who , before they speak , or think , or feel , must wait for Mamma to give leave . There , there ! I may be a little fool for saying wlLat I have . I know you 'll go and tell Miss Lambert . Well , do But , as we have said , George did n't tell Miss Lambert . Even from the beloved person there must be some things kept secret ; even to himself , perhaps , he did not quite acknowledge what was the meaning of the little girl 's confession ; or , if he acknowledged it , did not act on it ; except in so far* as this , perhaps , that my gentleman , in Miss Lydia 's presence , was particularly courteous and tender , and in her absence thought of her very kindly , and always with a certain pleasure . It were hard indeed if a man might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a warm young heart . What was that story , meanwhile , which came round to our friends , of young Mr. Lutestring and young Mr. Drabshaw , the Quaker , having a boxing-match at a tavern in the city , and all about this young lady ? They fell out over their cups , and fought , probably . Why did Mr. Draper , who had praised her so at first , tell such stories now against her grandfather ? " I suspect , " says Madame de Bernstein , " that he wants the girl for some client or relation of his own ; and that he tells these tales in order to frighten all suitors from her . When she and her grandfather came to me she behaved perfectly well ; and I confess , Sir , I thought it was a great pity that you should prefer yonder redchecked countryfled little chit , without a halfpenny , to this pretty , wild , artless girl , with such a fortune as I hear she has . " " Oh , she has been with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relative . " Of course she has been with me , " the other replies , curtly . " Unless your brother has been so silly as to fall in love with that other little Lambert girl- " " Indeed , ma'am . I think I can say he has not , " George remarks . " Why , then , when he comes back with Mr. Wolfe , should he not take a fancy to this little person , as his Mamma wishes-only , to do usjustice , we Esmonds care very little for what our Mammas wish  --  and marry her , and set up beside you in Virginia ? She is to have a great // fortune , which you wo n't touch . Pray , why should it go out of the family ? " George now learned that Mr. Van den Bosch and his grand-daughterhad been often at Madame de Bernstein 's house . Taking his favorite walk with his favorite companion to Kensington Gardens , he saw Mr. Van den Bosch 's chariot turning into Kensington Square . The Americans were going to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry , that they had been more than once with her ladyship . It was , perhaps , strange that they should have said nothing of their visits to George ; but , being little curious of other people 's affairs , and having no intrigues or mysteries of his own , George was quite slow to imagine them in other people . What mattered to him how often Kensington entertained Bloomsbury , or Bloomsbury made its bow at Kensington ? A number of things were happening at both places , of which our Virginian had not the slightest idea . Indeed , do not things happen under our eyes , and we not see them ? Are not comedies and tragedies daily performed before us of which we understand neither the fun nor the pathos ? Very likely George goes home thinking to himself , " I have made an impression on the heart of this young creature . She has almost confessed as much . Poor artless little maiden ! I wonder what there is in me that she should like me ? " Can he be angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry at such a reason ? He would not have been so well pleased , perhaps , had he known all ; and that he was only one of the performers in the comedy , not the principal character by any means ; Rosenkrantz and Gildenstern in the tragedy , the part of Hamlet by a gentleman unknown . How often are our little vanities shocked in this way , and subjected to wholesome humiliation ! Have you not fancied that Lucinda 's eyes beamed on you with a special tenderness , and presently become aware that she ogles your neighbor with the very same killing glances ? Have you not exchanged exquisite whispers with Lalage at the dinner-tahle ( sweet murmurs heard through the hum of the guests , and clatter of the banquet ! ) , and then overheard her whispering the very same delicious phrases to old Surdus in thc drawingroom ? The sun shines for every body ; the flowers smell sweet for all noses ; and the nightingale and Lalage warble for all ears-not your long ones only , good Brother ! regulated persons divine such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that a woman of noble birth , of ancient family , of mature experience  --  a woman whom we have seen exceedingly in love only a score of months ago-should so far forget herself as ( Oh , my very finger-tips blush as I write the sentence ! ) , as not only to fall in love with a person of low origin , and very many years her junior , but actually to marry him in the face of the world ? That is , not exactly , in the face , but behind the back of the world , so to speak ; for Parson Sampson privily tied the indissoluble knot for the pair at his chapel in May Fair . Now stop before you condemn her utterly . Because Lady Maria had had , and overcome , a foolish partiality for her young cousin , was that any reason why she should never fall in love with any body else ? Are men to have the sole privilege of change , and are women to be rebuked for availing themselves now and again of their little chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross , and unphilosophical than , for instance , Hamlet 's to his mother about her second marriage . The truth , very likely , is , that that tender , parasitic creature wanted a something to cling to , and , Hamlet senior out of the way , twined herself round Claudius . Nay , we have known females so bent on attaching themselves that they can twine round two gentlemen at once . Why , forsooth , shall there not be marriage-tables after funeral baked-meats ?

We are served fl la Russe , and gobbled up a dish at a time , like the folks in Polyphemus 's cave . T is kodie mild , cras tibi : there are some Anthropophagi who devour dozens of us  --  the old , the young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean , the ugly , the beautiful : there 's no escape , and one after another , as our fate is , we disappear down their omnivorous maws . Look at Lady Ogresham ! We all remember , last year , how she served poor Tom Kydd : seized upon him , devoured him , picked his bones , and flung them away . Now it is Ned Suckling she has got into her den . He lies under her great eyes , quivering and fascinated . Look at the poor little trepid creature , panting and helpless under the great eyes ! She trails toward him nearer and nearer ; he draws to her , closer and closer . Presently there will be one or two feeble squeaks for pity , and-hobblegobble-he will disappear ! Ah me ! it is pity , too . I knew , for instance , that Maria Esmond had lost her heart ever so many times before Harry Warrington found it ; but I liked to fancy that he was going to keep it ; that , bewailing mischance and times out of joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondled it in decorous celibacy . If , in some paroxysm of senile folly , I should fall in love to-morrow , I shall still try and think I have acquired the fee-simple of my charmer 's heart , not that I am only a senant , on a short lease , of an old battered furnished apartment , where the dingy old wine-glasses have been clouded by scores of pairs of lips , and the tumbled old sofas are muddy with the last lodger 's boots . Dear , dear nymph ! Being beloved and beautiful ! Suppose I had a little passing passion for Glycera ( and her complexion really was as pure as splendent Parian marble ) ; suppose you had a fancy for Telephus , and his low collars and absurd neck : those follies are all over now , are n't they ? We love each other for good now , do n't we ? Yes , forever ; and Glycera may go to Bath , and Telephus take his cercicem roseam to Jack Ketch , n'est-ce pus ? No . We never think of changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies , or spoons stir , our potage , which is now so piping hot , will never get cold . Passing fancies we may have allowed ourselves in former days ; and really your infatuation for Telephus ( do n't frown so , my darling creature ! and make the wrinkles in your forehead worse ) -I say , really it was the talk of the whole town ; and as for Glycera , she behaved confoundedly ill to me . Well , well , now that we understand each other , it is forever that our hearts are united , and we can look at Sir Cresswell Cresswell , and snap our fingers at his wig . But this Maria of the last century was a woman of an ill-regulated mind . You , my love , who know the world , know that in the course of this lady 's career a great deal must have passed that would not bear the light , or edify in the telling . You know ( not , my dear creature , that I mean you have any experience ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that an old flirt , when she has done playing the fool with one passion , will play the fool with another ; that flirting is like drinking ; and the brandy being drunk up , you-no , not you-Glycera  --  the brandy being drunk up , Glycera , who has taken to drinking , will fall upon the gin . So , if Maria Esmond has found a successor for Harry Warrington , and set up a new sultan in the precious empire of her heart , what , after all , could you expect from her ? That territory was like the Low Countries , accustomed to being conquered , and forever open to invasion . And Maria 's present enslaver was no other that Mr. Geoghegan or Hagan , the young actor who had performed in George 's Tragedy . His tones were so thrilling , his eye so bright , his mien so noble , he looked so beautiful in his gilt leather armor and large buckled periwig , giving utterance to the poet 's glowing verses , that the lady 's heart was yielded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her affair with Theseus was over . The young Irishman was not a littTh touched and elated by the high-born damsel 's paitiality for him . He might have preferred a Lady Maria Hagan more tender in vears , but one more tender in disposition it were difficult to discover . She clung to him closely , indeed . She retired to his humble lodgings in Westminster with him , when it became necessary to disclose their marriage , and when her furious relative disowned her . General Lambert brought the news home from his office in Whitehall one day , and made merry over it with his family . In those homely times a joke was none the worse for being a little broad ; and a fine lady would laugh at a jolly page of Fielding , and weep over a letter of Clarissa , which would make your present ladyship 's eyes start out of your head with horror . He uttered all sorts of waggeries , did the merry General , upon the subject of this marriage ; upon George 's share in bringing it about ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He vowed it was cruel that Cousin Hagan had not selected George as groomsman ; that the first child should be called Carpezan or Sybilla , after the Tragedy , and so forth . They would not quite be able to keep a coach , but they might get a chariot and pasteboard dragons from Mr. Rich 's theatre . The baby might be christened in Macbeth 's caidron : and Harry and Harlequin ought certainly to be godfathers . " Why should n't she marry him if she likes him ? " asked little Hetty . " Why should he not love her because she is a little old ? Mamma is a little old , and you love her none the worse . When you married my Mamma , Sir , I have heard you say you were very poor ; and yet you were very happy , and nobody laughed at you ! " Thus this impudent little person spoke by reason of her tender age , not being aware of Lady Maria Esmond 's previous follies . So her family has deserted her ? George described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONTAGUE HOUSE . Castlewood had gone into mourning ; how Mr. Will swore he would have the rascal 's ears ; how furious Madame de Bernstein was , the most angry of all . " It is an insult to the family , " says haughty little Miss Hett ; " and I can fancy how ladies of that rank must be indignant at their relative 's marriage with a person of Mr. Hagan 's condition : but to desert her is a very different matter . " " Indeed , m* ' dear child , " cries Mamma , " you are talking of what you do n't understand . After my Lady Maria 's conduct , no respectable person can go to see her . " " What conduct , Mamma ? " " Never mind , " cries Mamma . " Little girls ca n't be expected to know , and onght not to be too cnrions to inquire , what Lady Maria 's conduct has been ! Suffice it , miss , that I am shocked her ladyship should ever have been here ; and I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then , Aunt Lambert , I must be whipped and sent to bed , " says George , with mock gravity . " I own to you ( though I did not confess sooner , seeing that the affair was not mine ) that I have been to see my cousin the player , and her ladyship his wife . I found them in very dirty lodgings in Westminster , where the wretch has 1 - I '  --  / - * - -  -   --  * // the shabbiness to keep not only his wife , but his old mother , and a little brother , whom he puts to school . I found IVr . Hagan , and came away with a liking , and almost a respect for him , although I own he has made a very improvident marriage . But how improvident some folks are about marriage , are n't they , Theo ? " " Improvident , if they marry such spendthrifts as you , " says the General . " Master George found his relations , and I 'll be bound to say he left his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse , Sir , " says George , smiling very tenderly . " Theo made that . But I am bound to own it came empty away . Mr. Rich is in great dudgeon . He says he hardly dares have Hagan on his stage , and is afraid of a riot , such as Mr. Garrick had about the foreign dancers . This is to be a fine gentleman 's riot . The Macaronis are furious , and vow they will pelt Mr. Hagan , and have him cudgeled afterward . My cousin Will , at Arthur 's , has taken his oath he will have the actor 's ears . Meanwhile , as the poor man does not play , they have cut off his salary ; and without his salary , this luckless pair of lovers have no means to buy bread and cheese . " " And you took it to them , Sir ? It was like you , George ! " says Theo , worshiping him with her eyes . " It was your purse took it , dear Theo , " replies George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to-morrow ! " prays Theo . " If she does n't , I shall get a divorce , my dear ! " cries Papa . " Come and kiss me , you little wench-that is , avec la bonne permission de Jfonsieur mon bean-fils . " " Monsieur mon beau fiddlestick , papa ! " says Miss Lambert , and I have no doubt complies with the paternal orders . And this was the first time George Esmond Warrington , Esquire , was ever called a fiddlestick . Any man , even in our time , who makes an imprudent marriage , knows how he has to run the gauntlet of the family , and undergo the abuse , the scorn , the wrath , the pity of his relations . If your respectable family cry out because you marry the curate 's daughter , one in ten , let us say , of his charming children ; or because you engage yourself to the young barrister whose only present pecuniary resources come from the court which he reports , and who will have to pay his Oxford bills out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for making such engagements as these , fancy the feelings of Lady Maria Hagan 's friends , and even those of Mr. Hagan 's , on the announcement of this marriage . There is old Mrs. Hagan , in the first instance . Her son has kept her dutifully and in tolerable comfort , ever since he left Trinity College at his father 's death , and appeared as Romeo at Crow Street Theatre . His salary has sufficed of late years to keep the brother at school , to help the sister who has gone out as companion , and to provide fire , clothing , tea , dinner , and comfort for the old clergyman 's widow . And now , forsooth , a fine lady , with all sorts of extravagant habits , must come and take possession of the humble home , and share the scanty loaf and mutton ! Were Hagan not a high-spirited fellow , and the old mother very much afraid of him , I doubt whether my lady 's life at the Westminster lodgings would be very comfortable . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in poor Hagan 's narrow bed . But Love , in some passionate and romantic dispositions , never regards consequences or measures accommodation . Who has not experienced that frame of mind ? what thrifty wife has not seen and lamented her husband in that condition , when , with rather a heightened color and a deuce-may-care smile on his face , he comes home and announces that he has asked twenty people to dinner next Saturday ? He does n't know whom exactly ; and he does know the diningroom will only hold sixteen . Never mind ! Two of the prettiest girls can sit upon young gentlemen 's knees ; others wo n't come ; there 's sure to be plenty ! In the intoxication of love people venture upon this dangerous sort of house-keeping ; they do n't calculate the resources of their dining-table , or those inevitable butchers ' and fishmongers ' bills , which will be brought to the ghastly housekeeper at the beginning of the month . Yes . It was rather selfish of my Lady Maria to seat herself at Hagan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wings of the chickens , and the best half of every thing where there was only enough before ; and no wonder the poor old mamma-in-law was disposed to grumble . But what was her outcry compared to the clamor at Kensington among Lady Maria 's noble family ? Think of the talk and scandal all over the town ! Think of the titters and whispers of the ladies in attendance at the Princess 's court , where Lady Fanny had a place ; of the jokes of Mr. Will 's brother officers at the usher 's table ; of the waggeries in the daily prints and magazines ; of the comments of outraged prudes ; of the laughter of the clubs , and the sneers of the ungodly ! At the receipt of the news Madame Bernstein had fits , and ran off to the solitude of her dear rocks at Tunbridge Wells , where she did not see above forty people of a night at cards . My lord refused to see his sister ; and the Countess in mourning , as we have said , waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was pleased to condole with her upon the disgrace and calamity which had befallen her house . For one , two , three whole days the town was excited and amused by th' scandal ; then there came other news  --  a victory in Germany ; doubtful accounts from America ; a general officer coming home to take his trial ; an exquisite new soprano singer from Italy ; and the public forgot Lady Maria in her garret , eating the hard-earned meal of the actor 's family . This is an extract from Mr. George Warrington 's letter to his brother , in which he describes other personal matters , as well as a visit he had paid to the newly-married pair : // hi " My dearest little Theo , " he writes , " was eager to accompany her Mamma upon this errand of charity ; but I thought Aunt Lambert 's visit would be best under the circumstances , and without the attendance of her little spinster aidde-cainp Cousin Hagan was out when we called ; we found her ladyship in a loose undress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at cribbage with a neighbor from the second floor , while good Mrs. Hagan sate on the other side of the fire with a glass of punch , and the Whole Duty of Man . " Maria , your Maria once , cried a little when she saw us ; and Aunt Lambert , you may be sure , was ready with her sympathy . While she bestowed it on Lady Maria , I paid the best coinpliments I could invent to the old lady . When the conversation between Aunt L. and the bride began to flag , I turned to the latter , and between us we did our best to make a dreary interview pleasant . Our talk was about you , about Wolfe , about war ; you must he engaged face to face with the Frenchmen by this time , and God send my dearest brother safe and victorious out of the battle ! Be sure we follow your steps anxiously - we fancy you at Cape Breton . We have plans of Quebec and charts of the St. Lawrence . Shall I ever forget your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sound from the little combat with the // little Frenchman ? So will my Harry , I know , return from his battle . I feel quite assured of it ; elated somehow with the prospect of your certain success and safety . And I have made all here share my cheerfulness . We talk of the campain as over , and Captain Warrington 's promotion as secure . Pray Heaven , all our hopes may be fulfilled one day ere long ! " How strange it is that you who are the mettlesome fellow ( you know you are ) should escape quarrels hitherto , and I , who am a peaceful youth , wishing no harm to any body , should have battles thrust upon me ! What do you think actually of my having had another affair upon my wicked hands , and with whom , think you ? With no less a personage than your old enemy our kinsman , Mr. Will . " What or who set him to quarrel with me , I can not think . Spencer ( who acted as second for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - do n't be frightened ; it is all over , and nobody is a scratch the worse ) thinks some one set Will on me ; but who , I say ?

Oh , dear mother ! did you know that the little thing was to be such a causa beili , and to cause swords to be drawn , and precious lives to be menaced ? But so it has been . To show his own spirit , I suppose , or having some reasonable doubt about mine , whenever Will and I have met at Mynheer 's house  --  and he is forever going there-he has shown such downright rudeness to me , that I have required more than ordinary patience to keep my temper .

Was Will rascal enough to fancy that I would give up my Theo for a million of guineas , and negroes , and Venus to boot ? Could the thought of such baseness enter into the man 's mind ? I do n't know that he has accused me of stealing Van den Bosch 's spoons and tankards when we dine there , or of robbing on the highway . But for one reason or the other he has chosen to be jealous of me , and as I have parried his impertinences with little sarcastic speeches ( though perfectly civil before company ) , perhaps I have once or twice made him angry .

He is very well , thank you ; that is- ' I could n't finieh the sentence , for I was in such a rage that I scarce could contain myself " From the Captain , as you call him , Miss Lyddy , ' says Will . He 'll distinguish himself as he did at Saint Cas ! Ho , ho ! ' " So I apprehend he did , Sir , ' says Will 's brother . " Did he ? ' says our dear cousin ; always thought he ran away ; took to his legs ; got a ducking , and ran away as if a bailiff was after him . ' " La ! ' says miss , did the Captain ever have a bailiff after him ? ' " Did n't he ! Ho , ho ! ' laughs Mr. Will . " I suppose I must have looked very savage . for Spencer , who was dining with us , trod on my foot under the table . Do n't laugh so loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may wake good old Mr. Van den Bosch . ' The good old gentleman was asleep in his arm-chair , to which he commonly retires for a nap after dinner . " Oh , indeed ! cousin , ' says Will , and he turned and winks at a friend of his , Captain Deuceace , whose own and whose wife 's reputation I dare say you heard of when you frequented the clubs , and whom Will has introduced into this simple family as a man of the highest fashion . Do n't be afraid , miss , ' says Mr. Will , nor my cousin need n't be . ' " Oh what , a comfort ! ' cries Miss Lyddy . Keep quite quiet , gentlemen , and do n't quarrel , and come up to me when I send to say the tea is ready . ' And with this she makes a sweet little courtesy , and disappears . " Hang it , Jack , pass the bottle , and do n't wake the old gentleman ! ' continues Mr. Will . Wo n't you help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tone of that word cousin . " I am going to help myself , ' I said , but I am not going to drink the glass ; and I 'll tell you what I am going to do with it if you will be quite quiet , cousin ! ' ( Desperate kicks from Spencer all the time . ) " And what the deuce do I care what you are going to do with it ? ' asks Will , looking rather white . " I am going to fling it into your face , cousin , ' says I , very rapidly performing that feat . " By Jove , and no mistake ! ' cries Mr. Deuceace ; and as he and William roared out an oath // together , good old Van den Bosch woke up , and , taking the pocket-handkerchief off his face , asked what was the matter . " I remarked it was only a glass of wine gone the wrong way , and the old man said : Well , well , there is more where that came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young gentlemen ! ' and he sank back in his great chair , and began to sleep again . " From the back of Montagu house Gardens there is a beautiful view of Hampstead at six o'clock in the morning ; and the statue of the King on St. George 's Church is reckoned elegant , cousin ! ' says I , resuming the conversation . " D- the statue ! ' begins Will : but I said , Do n't , cousin ! or you will wake up tbe old gentleman . Had we not best go up stairs to Miss Lyddy 's tea-table ? ' " We arranged a little meeting for the next morning ; and a coroner might have been sitting upon one or other , or both , of our bodies this afternoon ; but , would you believe it ? just as our engagement was about to ta.ke place , we were interrupted by three of Sir John Fielding 's men , and carried to Bow Street , and ignominiously bound over to keep the peace . " Who gave the information ? Not I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own I was pleased when the constables came running to us , bludgeon in hand : for I had no wish to take Will 's blood , or sacrifice my own to such a rascal . Now , Sir , have you such a battle as this to describe to me ?  --  a battle of powder and no shot ?  --  a battle of swords as bloody as any on the stage ? I have filled my paper , without finishing the story of Maria and her Hagan . You must have it by the next ship . You see , the ( luarrel with Will took place yesterday , very soon after I had written the first sentence or two of my letter . I had been dawdling till dinner-time ( I looked at the paper last night , when I was grimly making certain little accounts up , and wondered shall I ever finish this letter ? ) , and now the quarrel has been so much more interesting to me than poor Molly 's love advenhires , that behold my paper is full to the brim ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a heart full of love for " His loving brother , " G. E. W. " CHAPTER LXXI . WHITE FAVOES . Tnu little quarrel between George and his cousin caused the former to discontinue his visits to Bloomsbury in a great measure ; for Mr. Will was more than ever assiduous in his attentions ; and , now that both were bound over to peace , so outrageous in his behavior , that George found the greatest difficulty in keeping his hands from his cousin . The artless little Lydia had certainly a queer way of receiving her friends . But six wacks before madly jealous of George 's preference for another , she now took occasion repeatedly to compliment Theo in her conversation . Miss Theo was such a quiet , gentle creature , Lyddy was sure George was just the husband for her . How fortunate that horrible quarrel had been prevented ! The constables had conic up just in time ; and it was quite ridiculous to hear Mr. Esmond cursing and swearing , and the rage he was in at being disappointed of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your valuable life , dear Mr. George , and I am sure Miss Theo ought to bless them forever , " says Lyddy , with a soft smile . " You wo n't stop and meet Mr. Esmond at dinner today ? You do n't like being in his company ? He ca n't do you any harm ; and I am sure you will do him none . " Kind speeches ike these , addressed by a little girl to a gentleman , and spoken by a strange inadvertency in company , and when other gentlemen and ladies were present , were not likely to render Mr. Warrington very eager for the society of the young American lady . George 's meeting with Mr. Will was not known for some days in Dean Street , for he did not wish to disturb those kind folks with his quarrel ; but when the ladies were made aware of it , you may be sure there was a great flurry and to do . " You were actually going to take a fellow-creature 's life , and you came to see us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was shocking ! " said Theo . " My dear , he had insulted me and my brother , " pleaded George . " Could I let him call us both cowards , and sit by and say , Thank you ? ' " The General sate by , and looked very grave . " You know you think , Papa , it is a wicked and un-Christian practice ; and have often said you wished gentlemen would have the courage to refuse ! " Ii I Il // " To refuse ? Yes , " says Mr. Lambert , still very glum . " It must require a prodigious strength of mind to refuse , " says Jack Lambert , looking as gloomy as his father ; " and I think if any man were to call me a coward I should be apt to forget my orders . " " You see brother Jack is with me ! " cries George . " I must not be against you , Mr. Warrington , " says Jack Lambert . " Mr. Warrington ! " cries George , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have George break the Commandments , and commit murder , John ? " asks Theo , aghast . " I am a soldier 's son , sister , " says the young divine , dryly . " Besides , Mr. Warrington has committed no murder at all . We must soon be hearing from Canada , father . The great question of the supremacy of the two races must be tried there ere long ! " He turned his back on George as he spoke , and the latter eyed him with wonder . Hetty , looking rather pale at this original remark of brother Jack , is called out of the room by some artful pretext of her sister . George started up and followed the retreating girls to the door . " Great powers , gentlemen ! " says he , coming back , " I believe , on my honor , you are giving me the credit of shirking this affair with Mr. E*mond ! " The clergyman and his father looked at one another . " A man 's nearest and dearest are always the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean to say , Not guilty ? ' God bless thee , my boy ! " cries the General . " I told thee so , Jack . " And he rubbed his hand across his eyes , and blushed , and wrung George 's hand with all his might . " Not guilty of what , in I-leaven 's name ? " asks Mr. Warrington . " Nay , " said the General , " Mr. Jack , here , brought the story . Let him tell it . I believe t is a - lie , with all my heart . " And uttering this wicked expression , the General fairly walked out of the room . The Rev. J. Lambert looked uncommonly foolish . " And what is this-this d-d lie , Sir , that somebody has been telling of me ? " asked George , grinning at the young clergyman . " To question the courage of any man is always an offense to him , " says Mr. Lambert , " and I rejoice that yours has been belied . " " Who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bawls out Mr. Warrington . " I insist on the man 's name ! " " You forget you are bound over to keep the peace , " says Jack . " Curse the peace , Sir ! We can go and fight in Holland . Tell me the man 's name , I say " Fair and softly , Mr. Warrington ! " cries the young parson ; " my hearing is perfectly good . It was not a man who told me the story which , I confess , I imparted to my father . " " What ? " asks George , the truth suddenly occurring . " Was it that artful , wicked little vixen in Bloomsbury Square ? " " Vixen is not the word to apply to any young lady , George Warrington ! " exclaims Lambert , " much less to the charming Miss Lydia . She artful  --  the most innocent of Heaven 's creatures ! She wickcd-that angel ! With unfeigned delight that the quarrel should be over-with devout gratitude to think that blood consanguineous should not be shed-she spoke in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the deepest sympathy with you for taking the painful but only method of averting it . " " What method ? " demands George , stamping his foot . " Why , of laying an information , to be sure ! " says Mr. Jack ; on which George burst forth into language much too violent for us to repeat here , and highly uncomplimentary to Miss Lydia . " Do n't utter such words , Sir ! " cried the parson , who , as it seemed , now took his turn to be angry . " Do not insult , in my hearing , the most charming , the most innocent of her sex ! If she has been mistaken in her information regarding you , and doubted your willingness to commit what , after all , is a crime-for a crime homicide is , and of the most awful descriptionyou , Sir , have no right to blacken that angel 's character with foul words : and , innocent yourself , should respect the most innocent as she is the most lovely of women ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I hope to have that honor , " answered George , smiling , lie began to perceive the other 's drift . " What , then , what-though t is too much bliss to be hoped for by sinful man-what , if she should one day be your sister ? Who could see her charms without being subjugated by them ? I own that I am a slave . I own that those Latin Sapphics in the September number of the Gentleman 's Magazine , beginning Lydim quondam cecinit venustu ( with an English version by my friend Hickson of Corpus ) were mine . I have told my mother what bath passed between us , and Mrs.** Lambert also thinks that the most lovely of her sex has deigned to look favorably on me . I have composed a letter-she another . She proposes to wait on Miss Lydia ' * grandpapa this very day , and to bring me the answer , which shall make , me the happiest or the most wretched of men ! It was in the unrestrained intercourse of family conversation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear girl had uttered . Perhaps I spoke slightingly of your courage , which I do n't doubt-by Heaven , I do n't doubt : it may be she has erred too , regarding you . It may be that the fiend jealousy has been gnawing at my bosom and-horrible suspicion ! - that I thought my sister 's lover found too much favor with her I would have all my own . Ab , dear George , who knows his faults ? I am as one distrnct*d with passion . Confound it , Sir ! // What right have you to laugh at me ? I would have you to know that risu inepto . . . " What , have you two boys made it up ? " cries the General , eutering at this moment , iu the midst of a roar of laughter from George . " I was giving my opinion to Mr. Warringtou upon laughter , and npou his laughter in particular , " says Jack Lambert , iu a fume . " George is bound over to keep the peace , Jack ! Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then , let us trust you will have made up your quarrel . Here is dinner , boys ! We will drink absent friends , and an end to the war , and no fighting out of the profession ! " George pleaded an engagement as a reason for running away early from his dinner ; and Jack must have speedily followed him , for when the former , after transacting some brief business at his own lodgings , came to Mr. Van den Bosch 's door , in Bloomsbury Square , he found the young parson already in parley with a servant there . " His master and mistress had left town yesterday , " the servant said . " Poor Jack ! And you had the decisive letter in your pocket ? " George asked of his future brother-in-law . " Well , yes " - Jack owned he had the document- " and my mother has ordered a chair , and was coming to wait on Miss Lyddy , " he whispered , piteously , as the young men lingered on the steps . George had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lady , which he had not cared to mention to Jack . In truth , his business at home had been to write a smart note to Miss Lyddy , with a message for the gentleman who had brought her that funny story of his giving information regarding the duel ! The family being absent , George , too , did not choose to leave his note . " If Cousin Will has been the slander-bearer , I will go and make him recant , " thought George . " Will the family soon be back ? " he blandly asked . " They are gone to visit the quality , " the servant replied . " Here is the address on this paper ; " and George read , in Miss Lydia 's hand , " The box from Madam Hocquet 's to be sent by the Farnham Flying Coach ; addressed to Miss Van den Bosch , at the Right Honorable the Earl of Castlewood 's , Castlewood , Hants . " " Where ? " cried poor Jack , aghast . " His lordship and their ladyships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much importance . " The families is quite intimate . " This was very strange ; for , in the course of their conversation , Lyddy had owned but to one single visit from Lady Castlewood . " And they must be a-going to stay there some time , for Miss have took a ' power of boxes and gowns with her ! " the man added . And the young men walked away , each crumpling his letter in his pocket . " What was that remark you made ? " *asks George of Jack , at some exclamation of the latter . " I think you said- " " Distraction ! I am beside myself , George ! I-I scarce know what I am saying , " groans the clergyman . " She is gone to Hampshire , and Mr. Esmond is gone with her ! " " Othello could not have spoken better ! and she has a pretty scoundrel in her company ! " says Mr. George . " Ha ! here is your mother 's chair ! " Indeed , at this moment poor Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her footman . 5 T is no use going farther , Aunt Lambert ! " cries George . " Our little bird has flown . " " What little bird ? " " The bird Jack wished to pair with  --  the Lyddy-bird , Aunt . Why , Jack , I protest you are swearing again ! This morning t was the Sixth Commandment you wanted to break ; and now- " " Confound it ! leave me alone , Mr. Warrington , do you hear ? " growls Jack , looking very savage ; and away he strides far out of the reach of his mother 's bearers . " What is the matter , George ? " asks the lady . George , who has not been very well pleased with brother Jack 's behavior all day , says : " Brother Jack has not a fine temper , Aun.t Lambert . He informs you all that I am a coward , and remonstrates with me for being angry . He finds his mistress gone to the country , and he bawls , and stamps , and swears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jealousy ! Did the quarrel ever make you jealous ? " " You will make me very angry , if you speak to me in this way , " says poor Aunt Lambert , from her chair . " I am respectfully dumb . I make my bow . I withdraw , " says George , with a low bow , and turns toward Holborn . His soul was wrath within him . He was bent on quarreling with somebody . Had he met Cousin Will that night it had gone ill with his sureties . He sought Will at all his haunts , at Arthur 's , at his own house . There Lady Castlewood 's servants informed him that they believed Mr. Esmond had gone to join the family in Hants . He wrote a letter to his cousin : " My dear , kind cousin William , " he said , " you know Jam bound over , and would not quarrel with any one , much less with a dear , truthtelling , affectionate kinsman , whom my brother insulted by caning . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the other day by giving information , will you tell your informant that ii think it is not I but somebody else is the coward ? And I write to Mr. Van den Bosch by the same post , to inform him and Miss Lyddy that I find some rascal has been telling them lies to my discredit , and to beg them to have a care of such persons . " And , these neat letters being dispatched , Mr. Warrington dressed himself , showed himself at the play , and took supper cheerfully at the Bedford . In a few days George found a letter on his breakfast-table franked " Castlewood , " and , indeed , written by that nobleman . " Dear Cousin , " my lord wrote , " there has been so much annoyance in our family of late , // that I am sure t is time our quarrels should cease . Two days since my brother William brought me a very angry letter , signed G. Warrington , and at the same time , to my great grief and pain , acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which , to say the least , your conduct was violent . T is an ill use to put good wine to-that to which you applied good Mr. Van den Bosch 's . Sure , before an old man young ones should be more respectful . I do not deny that Win . s language and behavior are often irritating . I know he has often tried my temper , and that within the 24 hours . " Ah ! Why should we not all live happily together ? You know , cousin , I have ever professed a sincere regard for you-that I am a sincere admirer of the admirable young lady to whom you are engaged , and to whom I offer my most cordial compliments and remembrances . I would live in harmony with all my family where t is possible  --  the more because I hope to introduce to it a Countess of Castlewood . " At my mature age , t is not uncommon for a man to choose a young wife . My Lydia ( you will divine that I am happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosch ) will naturally survive me . After soothing my declining years , I shall not be jealous if at their close she should select some happy man to succeed me ; though I shall envy him the possession of so much perfection and beauty . Though of a noble Dutch family , her rank , the dear girl declares , is not equal to mine , which she confesses that she is pleased to share . I , on the other hand , shall not be sorry to see descendants to my house , and to have it , through my Lady Castlewood 's means , restored to something of the splendor which it knew before two or three improvident predecessors impaired it . My Lydia , who is by my side , sends you and the charming Lambert family her warmest remembrances . " The marriage will take place very speedily here . May I hope to see you at church ? My brother will not be present to quarrel with you . When I and dear Lydia announced the match to him yesterday , he took the intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will one day regret , and is at present on a visit to some neighbors . The Dowager Lady Castlewood retains the house at Kensington ; we having our own establishment , where you will ever be welcomed , dear cousin , by your affectionate humble servant , CAsTLEwooD.
