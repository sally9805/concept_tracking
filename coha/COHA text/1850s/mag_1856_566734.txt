ART . IV. - NATIONAL SINS AND THEIR RETRIBUTION . WHAT an outcry ! On all sides there is dismay-in one direction and another there are yells and shrieks-at the portentous collision between the deepest and most earnest convictions of religious men on the one hand , and the administration and tendency of our public affairs on the other hand . " Politics in the Pulpit ! " " Church and State ! " " iligher Law Fanaticism ! " Such are the exclamations by which the Devil and his emissaries would scare religious men away from the serious consideration of questions that have become political , because political men and political parties have sold themselves to do iniquity . The loudness and discordant terror of the outcry show that the collision is real . Our national policy , under the influences which have gradually obtained a complete ascendency in political affairs , is at last manifestly-as it has long been stealthily and with little suspicion of its actual tendency and quality-in conflict with the most elementary ideas of duty and religion , as they exist in the consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times is not a question of political economy merely , nor merely of the balance of powers in government . It is at once far deeper than all such questions , and more within the reach and grasp of ordinary minds . It is whether there is any such thing as moral right or wrong in politicswhether there is a God to whom nations are responsible , and who visits their crimes with retribution-whether injustice , ordained and guarded by national power , and incorporated into a nation 's life , loses its essential quality , escapes from the universal and inexorable law of retribution , and becomes a holy thing . Thus it is that the Church of God in this land trembles , through all its living members , with unwonted agitation . Thus it is that the pulpit has become so terribly obnoxious to politicians . In 1850 , Daniel Webster and his associates , in the crime and folly of the hour , deliberately undertook to demoralize the American Church and pulpit , or , perhaps , to use for their political purposes a Church and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The experiment was partly successful ; as reams of sermons against the higher law , and of clerical speeches at political meetings for the safety of the Union , sufficiently attested . But four years afterwards , when men of baser quality undertook to finish what // Webster had began , and when the pretended Union-savino ' of 1850 brought forth fruit after its kind ii* the Nebraska bifi of 1854 : , the moral and religious sensibilities of the American people began to awake . Men be an to see , with their eyes half opened , that the Bible , New *est ament and Old Testament alike , is in conflict with the course of politics . Preaching became political . It could not be otherwise , for politics had invaded the sphere of religion , and the abomination of desolation was standing in the holy place . Politics had undertaken to dethrone God , to abrogate his immutable laws , and to crucify Jesus Christ afresh . The preaching which , at such a crisis , could be otherwise than political in its felt bearings and applications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the timid disciples who forsook their Lord and fled in the hour of his betrayal , and even he who denied him , grew bold when Christ had been crucified ; so the preachers of the Gospel in this land , when political godlessness thought itself victorious and secure , found that their holy text*book had a voice of guidance for political duty , and a voice of commination for political crimes . The function of the Christian Ministry in a free and Christian country is not wholly unlike the prophetic function in the ancient Hebrew State . And in the present crisis of American history , keeping within its proper province of religion and of the exposition of God 's law , it has been as real a terror to knavish and godless politicians , in high places and in low places , as Elijah was to Ahab . A compilation of texts and themes , that have been handled in sermons complained of as political , would be a curious and instructive sight . What is political preaching ? And what preaching is there which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery is of course political preaching ; but to preach for it , with President Lord and with the host of southern preachers , is what such Christians as the New York Journal of Commerce and its allies call preaching the Gospel . To expound any commandment of the decalogue , after the old Puritan fashion , with " all the requirements and forbidments , " showing all its applications to actual human duty , will almost certainly be preaching against the institution of slavery , which puts the whole decalogue to scorn ; and inasmuch as the great political question of the day is , whether slavery shall be a national institution , upheld and extended by the national power , such preaching is of course political , and will be denounced accordingly by all who hold that religion and the pulpit have nothing to do with politics . If ministers of religion must preach nothing which the Atchisons and Stringfellows , and // 529 their confederates in Washington and elsewhere , will feel to be political , they must have some other text-book than the Bible ; they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fathers by the prophets ; they must have some other Christ than him who said , " Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees ; " who bade his followers " beware of the leaven of Herod ; " and who beheld the city and wept over it , with the lamentation of a patriot heart , " 0 Jerusalem , Jerusalem , " " if thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! " What , for example , can a pastor do , who has watched the progress of the measures for enslaving Kansas , with a heart that can feel for humanity , and that lives in fellowship with Christ ; who , being himself a Southern man by birth , and blood , and early training , knows what the institution is which wicked men , controlling the national government , are striving to fasten upon the helplessness of a dependent people ; and who has just heard of the bloody violence committed in the Senate chamber by a ruffian representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text of the sermon which he must preach , on the ensuing sabbath , to an assembly of citizens who share in the responsibilities of the sovereign people ? Opening his Bible , he lights upon this passage " Then He said unto me , Hast thou seen this , 0 son of man ? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah , that they commit the abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence , and have ventured to provoke me to anger . Therefore will I also deal in fury ; mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud cry , yet will I not hear them . He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand ; and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate , which lieth toward the north , and every man a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was clothed with linen , with a writer 's inkhorn by his side , and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar . And he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer 's inkhorn by his side , and the Lord said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the men that sigh and that cry , for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof . And to the others he said , in my hearing , Go ye after him through the cit and smite ; let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity : slay utterly , ol an young , both maids and little children and women ; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark ; and begin at my sanctuary . " - Ezek. viii , 17 , 18 , and ix , 1-6 . Ts he forbidden to preach from such a text as this-so opportune to the passing crisis ? And if while preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Devil will cry out " Politics , " will not his conscience condemn him ? and YOL . XIX. 35 // will not even the Postmaster , if there happens to be one in the congregation , feel that he is afraid to speak God 's truth ? We have before us the manuscript of a sermon prepared and preached , from this text , in the circumstances which we have described . We give the substance of it to the public as an illustration of the inevitable duty of preaching politics whenever political agitation thrusts itself into the legitimate sphere of preaching . No portion of the history of mankind is more instructive than that which we find recorded in the word of God , respecting ancient Israel ; because no history so illustrates by examples the principles of God 's government over nations . Of the events recorded in that history , it is explicitly affirmed by an inspired writer ,  --  " All these things happened unto them for ensamples , and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is more worthy of thorough and earnest study , than this of the ancient Jews . I do not mean a merely superficial perusal , which is intent chiefly on picturesque incidents and striking characters , but rather that deep philosophical study , which traces effects to their causes , and follows causes into their consequences , and which by a wise generalization , attains to the discovery and distinct conception of principles , applicable everywhere and at all times , under the sovereignty of a God who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will , and who is the same , yesterday and to-day and forever . It is one of the sublime facts brought to our knowledge , through this recorded history of Israel , and intimated in this passage from one of Israel 's most eminent prophets , that principalities and powers in heavenly places , intelligences far higher in the scale of being than ourselves , are interested spectors of the events which are transpiring in this world . Those ethereal minds need not be imagined as confining their attention to individuals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudinous array of events which are ever crowding into the field of history , may lie , as it were , ever spread out in one expanded scene , before their earnest observation . And not alone or chiefly , as passing events , filled with excitement , and calling into intense but transitory exercise , the passions and the varied powers of busy and earnest actors , are the events of the world 's history regarded by those celestial minds ; but the events and deeds of earth are estimated in heaven by their moral characteristics , by their rectitude or wrongfulness in comparison with the standard of eternal truth , and by their in- // 531 destructible influences and their ever expanding consequences . Yea , God himseli the Judge of all and the Father of all , as he walketli in the circuit of the heavens , surveying his universal kingdom , looks down with Divine intensity of judicial and paternal interest , upon the issues which are in the process of their evolution on the theatre of this world , while the race of man is undergoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Individuals , communities , and empires are alike perpetually under His scrutiny , as the moral governor of the universe . All this stands intimated to us , in the word of God , and by such facts , and such examples , we should be moved to look beyond the narrow bounds of the sphere in which we may chance to have an individual position and performance , out into the wider world around us ; to expand our observation , until it embraces the acts and the moral characteristics of nations as well as of individuals ; to protract our scrutiny , until it discerns consequences as well as acts ; to rectify and elevate our standard of discrimination , until rejecting all the postulates of mere worldly expediency or human popularity , *t embraces the principles which God propoupds , and has respect to the ends for which his governuient is administered . Another sublime fact , brought to our knowledge through the recorded history of Israel , and suggested by this passage from the prophet , is that God is administering his moral government perpetually over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , as the nations proceed in their career of expanding possession and dominion , in their commerce and influence in the development of their wealth , in their legislation and their putting forth of power and prowess , for weal or woe , within their own bounds , and out upon the wider world , his eye is ever upon them ; and he is perpetually bringing their doings and their deserts before the adjudication of his righteous tribunal ; and he is taking counsel with himself , what approval shall be given to this or that aim or act of righteousness , and what reprobation shall be pronounced against this or that act or aim of wickedness-how he shall here stimulate their virtue or re strain their selfishness , and here make their wrath to praise him . And all that they do , and all that they effect as nations , whether of weal or woe to humanity , whether ' of furtherance or hindrance to the kingdom of the Redeemer , he observes and records , and lays np in store , as the ground of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which they do aright , tending to the welfare of his creatures , and the honor of his name , he will visit them with providen // tial indications of his approval ; and for that which they do in violation of his laws , evolving mischief among men and the counteraction of his beneficence , he will sooner or later visit them with the evidences of his displeasure . He will so visit each nation for its national crimes that there shall be borne on all the stream of succeeding history , in the recorded experience of that nation , a practical testimony , witnessing to men and to angels that the Judge of all the earth will do right , that iniquity shall not go unpunished , that righteousness exalteth a nation , that the nation and kingdom that will not fear the King of kings and Lord of lords shall perish . The government of God over nations as such , does not , and apparently can not , involve the principle of atonement , which so greatly modifies by its gracious provisions and influences the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seems to arise an inevitable necessity of righteous retribution on a guilty nation . It would seem that due and obvious punishment , with no possibility of escape , must follow in the train of national iniquity . Thus , even if the fathers , who have committed the iniquity , have passed away before the full time for the manifestation of vindicative justice has arrived , and even if the men of that later generation have ceased from the particular iniquity of their fathers , from con* siderations of policy , or in the progress of civilization , yet the nation as such , with its organic identity in the sight of men and angels , and with a continuous life running through the succession of its generations , must bear its inevitable responsibility . The iniquity , before posterity , and before principalities and powers in heaven , appertains to the nation as such , and being ineradicable from its history , those who are the nation , when the set time of vengeance comes , whether guilty or not in their individual agency , must bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass the fulfillment of that which is announced in the decalogue- " I am a jealous God , visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me , " - au announcement which sometimes strikes us as a mystery in the doings of God , but which when analyzed , assumes the shape of a necessary result from national constituency and responsibility . And this is perhaps the most convincing illustration of what that awful declaration means . From the history of the Jews , many instances might be a& duced to illustrate this principle of retributive procedure on the part of God ; and with this principle in mind , as a torch with which to investigate the arcana in the history of nations , // many things in their experience , both of prosperity and adversity , become perfectly explicable and even lucid , which , not thus illuminated , seem utterly inexplicable , and indeed almost like indefensible anomalies under the government of an infinitely wise and righteous God . A period of national prosperity , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospered has lost the virtues by which that prosperity was secured , and may be the reward of some virtue on the part of their ancestors , which God , so to speak , has recorded to their credit as a nation . " Beloved for the fathers ' sake , " was said of the Jews , even in their degeneracy . On the other hand , special calamities may come down upon a nation , when , so far as appears , the generation which the calamity overwhelms is not specially guilty ; and the explanation may be because the time of vengeance has come at last , and God is punishing the nation as such , for the national iniquity which was committed long ago , " visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation . " " Our fathers have sinned and are not , and we have borne their iniquities , " said the prophet , lamenting the desolation that had swept his , native land . The dilemma which obtains more or less , in all cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's iniquity . That iniquity , that legalized iniquity , incorporated into the nation 's polity , and identified with its life , can not be continued without involving fearful and perhaps fatal consequences ; and , on the other hand , it can not be put away , or be got rid of , without involving consequences , if not equally perilous , at least so fearful as to evince that God has bound by indissoluble ties the punitive evil to the iniquity which merits it . It is not thus , as universally and as palpably , in the case of individuals as in the case of nations , and yet we have striking illustrations of the same thing in the case of individuals . The man who has formed dissolute habits , for instance , can not continue in those habits without self*destruction , and he can not abandon them without terrible struggles with himself , with his very nature ; struggles which the Scripture describes as cutting off a right hand , or plucking out a right eye . But it is not so universally and palpably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former case , the blood of the Son of God , which is the propitiation for sin , comes in with a transcendant power , and dissolves the otherwise indissoluble bond between sin and its deserved and natural consequences . But in the case of a nation , the dilemma holds with inexorable rigor ; and it is , in many of its aspects , a most formidable one . It is one of the terrible things in righteousness , with which God answers the // supplications of those who pray , " Thy kingdom come . " A striking illustration of this dilemma may be seen in onr own national experience . Our fathers , of venerated memory , fell into the snare of the devil , and introduced African slavery upon the soil of the new world ; and by a strange compromise with evil our later fathers of the revolutionary period , when their watchword , in the right of their struggle against civil oppression , and the animating war-cry with which they rushed to conflict and to victory , was , " Give me liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurighteous system to remain as one of the organic institutions of many of the States which came together to constitute the National Confederation . They even consented to throw the mantle of national forbearancenay , can it be denied that they consented to put the shield of national defense over the monstrous inconsistency and evil . Thus the iniquity of legalized , and , in some sense , nationalized slavery has stood for three-fourths of a century , registered against our nation in the book of God . Can this wickedness be perpetuated without ensuring national overthrow ? Who can think so , if he believes that God is just ? Can such a wickedness be removed , eradicated from its organic relations , without involving agitations and fearful throes of the body politic , which will seem like unmistakable indications of dissolution itself ? He that hath eyes to see , let him see . And let this teach the men who seek to reduce the institutions and nsages of communities and nations , as well as the hearts and habits of individuals , into conformity to the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incorporated , as it seems , into the system of God 's moral government , teach them that organic errors and crimes are not to be lett until they can be eradicated without detriment , and it shall appear that there will be no risk and no danger in their attempted removal . As well talk of leaving a cancer on the physical system until it can be got rid of without suffering and danger . The evil would go on increasing in virulence , and would lead inevitably to death , if such policy were pursued in the case of the human body . And not less surely will overthrow and dissolution ensue iu the body politic , if you act on the principle of perpetuating organic iniquity until it can be got rid of easily , without damage and danger , and , as it were , by spontaneous sloughing off . Nay , things do not work so . God does not intend that they shall . Iniquity once constructed into an organic national reality , incorporated into the body politic , involves inevitably the dread dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be got rid of without enough of suffering and // conflict in the process to bear witness for God that he abhors that which is evil , and has so constructed nature and man that iniquity shall not go unpunished . And the only wise deduction , in regard to national iniquities , is , that they should be grappled with at the earliest possible period after the discovery of their existence , and the hand of reform be never withdrawn until they are utterly extirpated . And he is no wise patriot , and no reliable philanthropist , who acts on any other principle . This passage from the prophet more than intimates , that the evil which comes upon nations , in the Almighty 's process of punishing their iniq**ities , results not simply from the operation of physical causes , or even of human forces ; but that it is efficiently brought about through the interposition of higher and unseen agencies , going forth with superhuman power to execute the will of the Supreme . " Cause them that have charge over the city to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , " says the passage . " The stars in their courses fought against Sisera , " says the Word , in reference to one of the most signal overthrows of the enemies of the Lord and of Israel . And this surely gives a more august significance to the facts of national history , as they are transpiring under the providence of God . We will not dwell upon this thuught , yet how apposite is the suggestion ! How does it place the most powerful nation on a level with the weakest , in regard to the facility and the suddenness with which it may be stripped of its boasted power , and thrown defenseless into inextricable difficulty ! The third lesson which the passage before us inculcates , is suggested in these words : - " And the Lord said unto him , Go through the midst of the city , and set a mark upon the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof . " In one of the most degenerate periods in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he every day saw and heard of inhumanity and impiety , through all the ranks of his countrymen , " made supplication to God , against Israel , saying , Lord , they have slain thy prophets , and digged down thine altars , and I only ani left alive , and they seek my life But what saith the answer of God unto him-I have reserved unto niyself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal . " " Even so , then , " said an Apostle of the New Testament dispensation , as he contemplated the widely prevailing degeneracy of Israel in his day , " unto this present time , there remaineth a remnant according to the election of grace . " And every servant of God , in every age , and in every land in // 536 Nov. , which the mediatorial King has commenced his work of building a kingdom to his praise , may echo the sustaining and encouraging conclusion , " Even so unto this present time , there remaineth a remnant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkest , and degeneracy most conspicuous , there is a people who maintain their allegiance to the King of kings , and whose hearts are in sympathy with the purposes of beneficence and holiness , for which the God of heaven administers his government in the earth . To these in particular , as well as to the nation at large , the wakeful observation of the Supreme is directed ; and what he expects to find in them , as the spontaneous dictate of their renovated natures , his prophet has defined in the language which speaks of " them that sigh and that cry , for all the abominations that are done in the midst " of the community in which they are constituent members . In times of national iniquity and growing degeneracy , there is a natural tendency on the part of those who themselves live soberly , and righteously , and godly , to shut their eyes from seeing and their ears from hearing that which is going on , which they know to be contrary to the will of God , and which is distasteful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the quiet sphere of their own retired and unpretending life . They argue , it may be , with themselves , Why take notice of the things which are wrong , which are ruinous indeed , but which we , alas ! can not prevent ? Why burthen our souls with the thought of evils which , in their aggregated potency , are ready to sweep away all the barriers of prevention or reformation that individual patriotism or probity can erect against them . Or , if they can not evade the remembrance of what is going on around them , then , perhaps , by a bewildering philosophy , they come to think , that dismal and disastrous as things may appear to human view , yet being each in its place and time an incident in the foreordained course of events , known from the beginning by Him who planned the universe , it is in the wisdom of God , that things are just as they are ; and therefore they conclude , that these dismal and disastrous occurrences , however painful to the human mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to be regarded as demanding resolute and earnest human effort for their suppression . Or , wluit is more probable and even more lamentable , they become accustomed to that which is wicked and woeful , and , by degrees , indifferent to its prevalence . According to the well known law of human nature , // " Vice is a monster of so frightful mein , That to be hated , needs but to be seenBut seen too oft , familiar with her face , We first endure , then pity , then embrace . " And so , they quiet down the emotion which is wont to rise , and steel the soul against the arrows of grief which would penetrate it , and grow irresolute , inactive , and of course ineffective of good in the world . They hold , it may be , the godly resolution , " As for me and my house , we will serve the Lord ; " but they spoil it , as a sentiment , by mixing with it the misanthropic feeling , if the nation will press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , let it , and let it endure in righteous vengeance the retribution which will follow the everlasting overthrow , which it thus incurs and deserves ; ' and they spoil it also , as a practical principle , by not remembering that the service of God includes earnest and unceasing effort to remove iniquity from the earth , and to make the kingdoms of this world the kingdom of our God and of his Christ . God looking on a guilty nation , looks for " them that sigh and that cry for all the abominations , which are done in the midst thereof . " In the ordinary course of his providence , he waits to hear the sighing and the crying of devout and holy souls , before he interposes with his arm to break the power of reigning evil , and to remove the abominations from their sight . Those , therefore , who are in sympathy with God , and who are on the side of truth , and righteousness , and virtue , should ever look with loathing and with grief on the iniquities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own land and nation . They should look on the world , and especially on their own land , with burdened hearts that sigh for the iniquity which is perpetrated and the sorrow it produces , and for the ungodliness which thus offends the heavens  --  and with bursting hearts that cry out , conscious of incapacity in themselves to remedy or to stay the evil over which they groan- " IMlen and brethren , what shall we do ? " - yea , cry unto the Infinite Deliver - " How long , 0 Lord , Holy and True , dost not thou avenge ? " Surely , if there be patriotism which desires the welfare of one 's native land ; if there be rectitude of heart which abhors iniquity ; if there be sympathy with God in his beneficent and holy desires ; if there be forethought respecting the condition and experience of those who are to succeed us , our offspring , who are to enter not only into our places in the body politic , but into the responsibilities and liabilities involved in national identity-surely they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have place and influence , can not be unmoved at the sight of prevailing iniquity . If they believe in God-if they recognize his government-if they credit the testimony of his word in regard to the invisible and eternal relations of the events which are taking place on the earth-if they believe that the penalty , though peradventure it may not go hand in hand with the iniquity of a nation , must yet inevitably follow in the sequel of that nation 's history-if they believe that whatever may be the power and prowess and pride of a nation , yet , when the time of vengeance shall arrive , the Holy One , the Infinite arbiter of destiny , will send forth the invisible ministers of vengeance , each with his destroying weapon in his hand , to execute the long delayed but never slumbering judgmentsurely they can not but sigh and cry over the abominations which are done in the land . Such are the lessons suggested by the passage before us . Let us now briefly consider their application to the present aspect of our public affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and ominous as now ; never , since we became a nation , has the spirit of iniquity so revealed itself , and so reveled in the assurance and the assertion of its ascendancy in the high places of our land , as it is doing at this moment . To the national metropolis , to the halls of Congress , to the Presidential *ansion , the eyes of the many millions of our citizens are directed with an almost undeviating gaze , and the ears of these millions are excitedly expectant , every day , to hear the report of some new and more astounding occurrence , in those high places of trust and influence . Ever since the commencement of the present session of Congress , in both the Senate and the House of Representatives , it has been most painfully evident that the spirit of sectionalism , of strife , of growing hate and gathering revenge , has been manithsting not in words only , but in deeds of desperate violence , its fierce determination , and its despotic temper and purpose . Three most glaring acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during its present session . First , there was in the streets of the federal city an assault and battery by a member of the House from Arkansas , on an editor of one of the leading journals of the country , for the reason that the caustic pen of that editor was employed , from day to day , to fire . the hearts of his countrymen with indignation against the wrongs which are perpetrated by men in places of power , and with zeal for the cause of humanity and freedom , which these men are treading into the dust . Next , there was in one of the hotels of Washington , the murder of a poor man , whose // only dignity was that of honest labor in a lowly station , and whose offense was that he spoke like a freeman the words which his duty to his employer required of him . The murderer was a member of the House from California ; and that mnrderer , with the blood of his fellow man scarcely yet washed from his foul hand , went the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat among the representatives of the nation , and there to act the part of a " legislator " for this civilized and Christian country-as we call it ; the House not only refusing to institute an investigation , but not even prohibiting the presence of the blood-stained member till a legal tribunal might pronounce on the question of his guilt . And now , one of the ablest and most patriotic members of the Senate , an embodiment as it were , of logical force and literary accomplishment , and of moral courage and devotion to freedom , sitting at his own desk in the Senate chamber , and engrossed at the moment with the duties of his place , has been assaulted with evident attempt to assassinate , and has been beaten to unconsciousness and almost to death by a member of the House from South Carolina , whose base and bloody deed proclaims him an embodiment of passion and brute force , and of fierce antagonism to genuine Liberty . And when , in what might be considered the season of sober second thought , an investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their places , as the representatives of the people and of sovereign States , and declare before the country , and before the world , that they approve the brutal , murderous , and cowardly attack . The aggressors , in all these instances , let it be noted , were men trained under the influence of slavery , and fired by the spirit which that system generates . The men who stood up to defend the ruffians , or by their tame silence , countenanced and shielded them , were men from the slave states , and such as act in concert with them to shape the acts and the whole policy of our national government . These deeds of violence upon individuals , give alarming and humiliating evidence of the spirit which prevails at the legislative and executive center of the IRepublic . The same spirit , which instigates and which countenances these individual acts of violent aggression upon individuals at the metropolis , has been at the same time manifesting itself , in most intense and active hostility to the interests , and even to the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ; upon our Western frontier , into one of the free states of this Union . Kansas has excited the sympathy of all who have generous hearts , in view of the evident and fierce determination on the part of men in high places , the highest legisla // tors and rulers of the land , to hinder the actual inhabitants of that territory from incorporating into its primary and determinative institutions , such principles of natural justice as will make it , in all time , what our nation , in its origin , was proclaimed to be , an asylum for the oppressed of all nations , and a home of civil and religious liberty . We have been astonnded at the sentiments affirmed in the halls of Congress in regard to Kansas , at the deeds done within that territory and along its Eastern border , by men whose wickedness is evidently connived at and encouraged in high places ; and ( must we not say it ? ) at the proclamations sent forth , and the military orders issued by him , who occupies the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hostile and aggressive action against the chartered rights of the people of Kansas need not be mentioned ; they are too numerous and too potent to require specification . None can question that it is the spirit of liberty , in the free-state men of Kansas , who are evidently the majority of the actual inhabitants there-their determination to provide for themselves and their descendants the institutions of freedom , which is " the head and front of their offending . " As little can it be doubted that the determination , on the contrary , to establish slavery in that great central state which is to be , is the one governing motive which instigates those in the territory , and those in the adjoining state of Missouri and in all the South , and those in the halls of Congress , and in the Cabinet of the Government , who are accomplices in treachery , opposition , detraction , and relentless and bloody persecution against lhe free-state men of Kansas . But these aggressions on individuals , and on the people of Kansas , violent as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are more portentous when regarde d as the product of a tree which is prolific in perennial crops of the same poisonous fruits , and which has this most manifest property , that the farther it advances in age , and the wider it spreads its roots in the soil , the more concentrated and the deadlier becomes the poison which it yields . I speak of slavery ; and the third and final specification which I make in presenting the evidence of our national iniquity is , that , not for the past winter only , but now for many years , it has been most glaringly evident , that the interest of slavery is the predominant and controlling force in the policy of our National Government . How many of our statesmenhow many of those who control the movements of political parties-how many who occupy high places in every department of our Government , are forward to humiliate themselves to // the service of that dominant interest , and prom pt to subordinate all the principles of our constitution and all the power of the nation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of planting and protecting where hitherto it has not existed , the system of African slavery . I do not stop to depict slavery as it exists , or its effects , as it is ever evolving itself in the slaveholding States . As child and youth , and since then as l ) reacher and teacher , I have spent twenty-six years of my life in a slave state ; and I know from close observation , what slavery is , in its essential elements , and what its bitter fruit is , first in its degrading influence on the colored race , and then in its dreadful reaction on the whites , particularly on the male portion of them . Yet pleasant memories of my youthful associations not unfrequently come over me ; I am mindful that the garnered dust of three generations of my maternal ancestors rest in quiet and safe repose in Southern soil ; and II know that I am not disposed to feel unkindly or to speak harshly of the South or of Southern people . But I do not hesitate to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of aggression upon Kansas , and of fierce determination and despotism in regard to the maintenance and extension of slavery , to which reference has been made , as the legitimate fruit of the system of slavery ; and that such results are to be expected as a matter of course , whenever that system may acquire an ascendant and protracted prevalence . And I do not hesitate further to affirm my conviction that the most enormous organic , legalized , national iniquity , which the sun of the nineteenth century looks down upon in any Christian land , is African slavery in these United States . And now if it shall come to pass , that the government and the power of this great nation must be finally committed and devoted to the work of defending and diffusing slavery , and of making it an unrestricted and perpetual institution upon our soil , that , I hesitate not to say , will be the climax of abominations in the land . Israel of old was brought out of Egypt , and established as a separate and conspicuous nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example and by inculcation , maintain the recognition and worship of the one living and true God , against all idolatry . When , as a nation , she fell into idolatry , that was a culmination of iniquity , which could not be overlooked by the God of Heaven . The terrible destruction referred to in that passage of the prophet , which we have been examining , came as the consequence and penalty of that defection. // Not less designedly on the part of our fathers , and with providential indications of the will of God to that effect , scarcely less marked than those which attended the nationalizing of Israel , did this iRepublic acquire its civil existence , for the leading purpose , that as a nation , she might promote justice , establish freedom , maintain the rights of man , and be the home of civil and religious liberty ; and should she prove recreant to her high mission , betray this trust for humanity , and commit herself with the position and the power which God has given her , to the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national defection second only to Israel*s defection from the living God , and can not fail to bring down upon her a no less fearful overthrow than that in which the vengeance of God was executed against his ancient covenant people . And now these acts of violence which have been spoken of , these manifestations of the spirit of domination and despotism , these fearful strides which we , as a nation , are taking , this dread approximation to the position of being committed and devoted to the work of defending and diffusing slavery-all are before God . They are going upon the record of our nation 's deeds and influence , which stands ever in his sight , and which he looks to in determining our desert and destiny as a nation . They are appealing to his justice for retribution , and are hastening the day of his consuminr yen time for sighing and * geance . Verily then , it is a crying over the abominations which are done in the land , and for the doing by every man , of whatever it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its iniquities , and to avert the indignation of the God of heaven .
