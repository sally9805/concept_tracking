TIlE LIFE-CAR. qwq tacle as this , without a feeling of strong emotion-and a new and deeper interest in the superior excellency and nobleness of efforts made by man for saving life , and diminishing suffering , in comparison with the deeds of havoc and destruction which have been so much gloried in , in ages that are past . The Life-Boat rests in its retreat , not like a ferocious beast of prey , crouching in its covert to seize and destroy its hapless victims , but like an angel of mercy , reposing upon her wings , and watching for danger , that she may spring forth , on the first warning , to rescue and save . The Life-Car is a sort of boat , formed of copper or iron , and closed over , above , by a convex deck with a sort of door or hatchway through it , by which the passengers to be con- veyed in it to the shore , are admitted . The car will hold from four to five persons . When these passengers are put in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bolted to its place ; and the car is then drawn to the land , suspended by rings from a hawser which has previously been stretched from the ship to the shore . To be shut up in this manner in so dark and 0loomy a receptacle , for the purpose of being drawn , perhaps at midnight , through a surf of such terrific violence that no boat can live in it , can not be a very agreeable alternative but the emergencies in which the use of the life-car is called for , are such as do not admit of hesitation or delay . There is no light within the car , and there are no openings for the admission of air. * It is subject , too , in its passage to the shore , to the most frightful shocks and concussions from the force of the breakers . The car as first made , too , was of such a form as required the passengers within it to lie at length , in a recumbent position , which rendered them almost utterly helpless . The form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends , where the heads of the passengers would come , when placed in a sitting posture within , being made higher than the middle ; and the opening or door is placed in the depressed part , in the centre . This arrangement is found to be much better than the former one , as it greatly facilitates the putting in of the passengers , who always require a greater or less degree of aid , and are often entirely insensible and helpless from the effects of fear , or of exposure to cold and hunger . Besides , by this arrangement those who have any strength remaining can take much more con* and safer positions within the car , in thesr progress to the shore , than was nossible under the old construction . The car , as will be seen by the foregoing drawings , is suspended from the hawser b means of short chains attached to the ends of it . These chains terminate in rings above : which rings ride upon the hawser , thus allowing the car to traverse to and fro , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , in making these passages , by means of lines attached te the two ends of it , one of which passes to the ship and the other to the shore . By means of these lines the empty car is first drawn out to the wreck by the passengers and crew , and then : when loaded , it is drawn back to the land by the people assembled there , as represented in the engraving at the head of this article . Perhaps the most important and difficult part of the operation of saving the passengers and crew in such cases , is the getting the hawser out in the first instance , so as to form a connection between the ship and the land . In fact . whenever a ship is stranded upon a coast , and people are assembled on the beach to assist the sufferers , the first thing to be done , is always to " get a line ashore . " On the success of the attempts made to accomplish this , all the hopes of the sufferers depend . Various methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , in order to attain this end , where there are no means at hand on the shore , for effecting it . Perhaps the most common mode is to attach a small line to a cask , or to some other light and bulky substance which the surf can easily throw up upon the shore . The cask , or float , whatever it may be when attached to the line , is thrown into the water , and after being rolled and tossed : hither and thither , by the tumultuous waves . now advancing , now receding , and now sweeping * None guch are in fact required , for the car itself contains air enough for the use of its passengers for a quarter of an hour , and there is rarely occnpied more than a period of two or three minutes to pass it through the surf to the shore . // qwq the apparatus , and for practice in the use of it . A large company assembled on the bank to witness the experiments . A boat was stationed on the calm surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to represent the wreck . The ball was thrown , the line fell across the boat , the car was drawn out , and then certain amateur performers , representing wrecked and perishing men , were put into the car and drawn safely through the gentle evening surf to the shore . A case occurred a little more than a year ago on the Jersey shore not very far from Long Branch , in which this apparatus was used in serious earnest . It was in the middle of January and duriug a severe snow storm . The ship Ayrshire , with about two hundred passengers , had been driven upon the shore by the storm , and lay there stranded , the sea beating over her , and a surf so heavy rolling in , as made it impossible for any boat to reach her . It happened that one of the stations which we have described was near . The people on the shore assembled and brought out the apparatus . They fired the shot , taking aim so well that the line fell directly across the wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hawser was hauled off . The car was then attached , and in a short time , every one of the two hundred passengers , men , women , children , and even infants in their mothers ' arms , were brought safely through the foaming surges , and landed at the station . The car which performed this service was considered as thenceforth fully entitled to an honorable discharge from active duty , and it now rests , in retirement and repose , though unconscious of its honors , in the Metallic Life-Boat Factory of Mr. Francis , at the Novelty Iron Works . In many cases of distress and disaster befalling ships on the coast , it is not necessary to use the car , the state of the sea being such that it is possible to go out in a boat , to furnish the necessary succor . The boats , however , which are destined to this service must be of a peculiar construction , for no ordinary boat can live a moment in the surf which rolls in , in storms , upon shelving or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted for the construction of surf-boats , each liable to its own peculiar objections . The principle on which Mr. Francis relies in his life and surf boats , is to give them an extreme lightness and buoyancy , so as to keep them always upon the top of the sea . Formerly it was expected that a boat in such a service , must necessarily take in great quantities of water , and the object of all the contrivances for securing its safety , was to expel the water after it was admitted . In the plan now adopted the design is to exclude the water altogether , by making the structure so light and forming it on such a model that it shall always rise above the wave , and thus glide safely over it . This result is obtained partly by means of the model of the boat , and partly by the lightness of the material of which it is composed . The reader may perhaps be surprised to hear , after this , that the material is iron . Iron  --  or copper , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than wood , is , in fact , much lighter as a material for the construction of receptacles of all kinds , on account of its great strength and tenacity , which allows of its being used in plates so thin that the quantity of the material employed is diminished much more than the specific gravity is increased by using the metal . There has been , however , hitherto a great practical difficulty in the way of using iron for such a purpose , namely that of giving to these metal plates a sufficient stiffness . A sheet of tin , for example , though stronger than a board , that is , requiring a greater force te break or rupture it , is still very flexible , whils the board is stiff . In other words , in the cas of a thin plate of metal , the parts yield readil* // to any slight force , so far as to bend under the pressure , but it req ires a very great force to separate them entirely ; whereas in the case of wood , the slight force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the structure breaks down altogether . The great thing to be desired therefore in a material for the construction of boats is to secure the stiffness of wood in conjunction w'ith the thinness and tenacity of iron . This object is attained in the manufacture of Mr. Francis 's boats by plaicing or corrugating the sheets of metal of which the sides of the boat are to be made . A familiar illustration of the principle on which this stiffening is effected is furnished by the common table waiter , which is made , usually , of a thin plate of tinned iron , stiffened by being turned up at the edges all around  --  the upturned part serving also at the same time the purpose of forming a margin . The plaitings or corrugations of the metal in these iron boats pass along the sheets , in lines , instead of being , as in the case of the waiter confined to the maigin The lines which they The machinery referred to will be easily understood by the above engraving . On the left are the pumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , though four or more are often required . By alternately raising and depressing the break or handle , they work two small but very solid pistons which play within S cylinders of corresponding bore , in the manner of any common forcing pump . By means of these pistons the water is driven , in small quantities but with prodigious force , along through the horizontal tube seen passing across , in the middle of the picture , from the forcing-pump to the great cylinders on the right hand . Here the water presses upward upon the under surfaces of pistons working within the form can be seen in the drawing of the surf-boat , given on a subsequent page . The idea of thus corrugating or plaiting the metal was a very simple one ; the main difficulty in the invention came , after getting the idea , in devising the ways and means by which such a corrugation could be made . It is a curious circumstance in the history of modern inventions that it often requires much more ingenuity and effort to contrive a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invent the article itself . It was , for instance , much easier , doubtless , to in vent pins , than to invent the machinery for making pins . The machine for making the corrugations in the sides of these metallic boats consists of a hydraulic press and a set of enormous dies These dies are grooved to fit each other , and shut together ; and the plate of iron which is to be corrugated being placed between them , is pressed into the requisite form , with all the force of the hydraulic piston  --  the greatest force , aivgether , that is ever employed in the service of man . great cylinders , with a force proportioned to the ratio of the area of those pistons compared with that of one of the pistons in the pump . Now the piston in the force-pump is about one inch in diameter . Those in the great cylinders are about twelve inches in diameter , and as there are four of the great cylinders the ratio is as 1 to 576. ** This is a great multiplication , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert upon the piston within the small cylinder , by the aid of the long lever with which they work it , is so great , that when multiplied by 576 , as it is by being expanded over the * Areas being as the squares of homologous lines , the ratio would he , mathematically expressed , is 4 X 122 = 1 4 X 144 = 1 : 576. vuz SSYORAIJLIC PRESS . // surface of the large pistons , an upward pressure results of about eight hundred tons . This is a force ten times as great in intensity as that exerted by steam in the most powerful sea-going engines . It would be sufficient to lift a block of granite five or six feet square at the base , and as high as the Bunker Hill Monument . Superior , however , as this force is , in one point of view , to that of steam , it is very inferior to it in other respects . It is great , so to speak , in intensity , but it is very small in extent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great weight , but it can raise it only an exceedingly little way . Were the force of such an engine to be brought into action beneath such a block of granite as we have described , the enormous burden would , rise , but it would rise by a motion almost inconceivably slow , and after going up perhaps as high as the thickness of a sheet of paper , the force would be spent , and no further effect would be produced without a new exertion of the motive power . In other words , the whole amount of the force of a hydraulic engine , vastly concentrated as it is , and irresistible , within the narrow limits within which it works , is but the force of four or five men after all ; while the power of the engines of a Collins ' steamer is equal to that of four or five thousand men . The steam-engine can do an abundance of great work ; while , on the other hand , what the hydraulic press can do is very little in amo t , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hydraulic presses are consequently very often used , in such cases and for such purposes as require a great force within very narrow limits . The indentations made by the type in printing the pages of this magazine , are taken out , and the sheet rendered smooth again , by hydraulic presses exerting a force of twelve hundred . tons . This would make it necessary for us to carry up our imaginary block of granite a h dred feet higher than the Bunker Hill Monument to get a load for them. * In Mr. Francis 's presses , the dies between which the sheets of iron or copper are pressed ; are directly above the four cylinders which we have described* as will be seen by referring once more to the drawing . The upper die is fixedbeing firmly attached to the top of the frame , and held securely down by the rows of iron pillars on the two sides , and by the massive iron caps , called platens , which may be seen passing across at the top , from pillar to pillar . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over the ends of the pillars above . The lower die is movpble . It is attached by massive iron work to the ends of the * There are nine of these presses in the printing-rooms of Harper and Brothers , all constantlyemployed in smoothing sheets ef paper after the printing . The sheets of paper to he pressed are placed between sheets of very smooth and thin , hut hard pastehoard , until a pile is made several feet high , and containing sometimes two thousand sheets of paper , and then the hydraulic pressure is applied . These presses cost , each , from twelve to fifteen hundred dollars . piston-rods , . and of course it rises when the pistons are driven upward by the pressure of the water . The plate of metal , when the dies approach each other , is bent and drawn into the intended shape by the force of the pressure , receiving not only the corrugations which are designed to stiffen it , but also the general shaping necessary , in respect to swell and curvature , to give it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side , of a boat . It is obviously necessary that these dies should fit each other in a very accurate manner , so as to compress the iron equally in every part . To make them fit thus exactly , massive as they are in magnitude , and irregular in form , is a work of immense labor . They are first casi as nearly as possible to the form intended , but as such castings always warp more or less in cooling , there is a great deal of fitting afterward required , to make them come rightly together . This could easily be done by machinery if the surfaces were square , or cylindrical , or of any other mathematical form to which the working of machinery could be adapted . But the curved and winding surfaces which form the hull of a boat or vessel , smooth and flowing as they are , and controlled , too , by established and wellknown laws , bid defiance to all the attempts of mere mechanical motion to follow them . The superfluous iron , therefore , of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hammer held in the hand ; and so great is the labor required to fit and smooth and polish them , that a pair of them costs several thousand dollars before they are completed and feady to fulfill their function . The superiority of metallic boats , whether of copper or iron , made in the manner above described , over those of any other construction , is growing every year more and more apparent . They are more light and more easily managed , they require far less repair from year to year , and are very much longer lived . When iron is used for this purpose , a preparation is eni , ployed that is called galvanized iron . This manufacture consists of plates of iron of the requisite thickne*s , coated on each side , first with tin , and then with zinc ; the tin being used simply as a solder , to unite the other metals . The plate pruients , therefore , to the water , only a surface of zinc , which resists all action , so that the boats thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be injured or destroyed only by violence , and even violence acts at a very great disadvantage in attacking there The stroke of a shot , or a concussion of and kinds that would split or shiver a wooden boat so as to damage it past repair , would only indent , or at most perforate , an iron one . And a perforation even , when made , is very easily repaired , even by the navigators themselves , undes circumstances however unfavorable . With s smooth and heavy stone placed upon the outside for an anvil , and another used on the inside as a hammer , the protrusion is easily beaten down , the opening is closed , the continuity of // surface is restored , and the damaged boat becomes , excepting , perhaps , in the imagination of the navigator , as good once more as ever . Metallic boats of this character were employed by the party under Lieut . Lynch* in making , some years ago , their celebrated voyage down the river Jordan to the Dead Sea . The naviation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boats were subject to the severest possible tests and trials . They were impelled against rocks , they were dragged over shoals , they were swept down cataracts and cascades . There was one wooden boat in the little squadron ; but this was soon so strained and battered that It could no longer be kept afloat , and it was abandoned . The metallic boats , however , lived through the whole , and finally floated in peace on the heavy waters of the Dead Sea , in nearly as good a condition as when they first came from Mr. Francis 's dies . The seams of a metallic boat will never open by exposure to the sun and rain , when lying long upon the deck of a ship , or hauled up upon a shore . Nor will such boats burn . If a ship takes fire at sea , the boats , if of iron , can never be injured by the conflagration . Nor can they be sunk . For they are provided with air chambers in various parts , each separate from the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by violent concussions , up to her utmost capacity of receiving injury , the shapeless mass would still float upon the sea , and hold up with unconquerable buoyancy as many as could cling to her. * A curious instance occurred during the late war with Mexico which illustrates the almost indestructible character of these metallic boats . The reader is probably aware that the city of Vera Cruz is situated upon a low and sandy coast , and that the only port which exists there is formed by a small island which lies at a little distance from the shore , and a mole or pier built out from it into the water . The island is almost wholly covered by the celebrated fortress of St. Juan de Ulloa . Ships obtain something like shelter nuder the lee of this island and mole , riding sometimes at anchor behind the mole , and sometimes moored to iron rings set in the castle walls . At one time while the American forces were in possession of the city , an officer of the army had occasion to use a boat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He applied to the naval authorities in order to procure one . He was informed that there was no boat on the station that could be * The principle on which these life-boats are made is found equally advantageous in its application to boats intended for other purposes . For a gentleman 's pleasuregrounds , for example , how great the convenience of having a boat which is always stanch and tight-which no exposure to the sun can make leaky , which no wet can rot , and no neglect , impair . And so in all other cases where boats are required for situations or used where they will be exposed to hard usage of any kind , whether from natural causes or the neglect or inattention of thnse in charge of them , this material seems far superior to any other . spared for such a purpose . In this dilemma the officer accidentally learned that there was an old copper life-boat , lying in the water near the castle landing , dismantled , sunk , and useless . The officer resolved , as a last resort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might possibly be raised and repaired . He found that the boat was lying in the water and half filled with rocks , sand , and masses of old iron , which had been thrown into her to sink and destroy her . Among the masses of iron there was a heavy bar which had been used apparently in the attempt to punch holes in the boat by those who had undertaken to sink her . These attempts had been generally fruitless , the blows having only made indentations in the copper , on account of the yielding nature of the metal . In one place , however , in the bottom of the boat , the work had been done effectually ; for five large holes were discovered there , at a place where the bottom of the boat rested upon the rocks so as to furnish such points of resist. - ance below as prevented the copper from yielding to the blows . The officer set his men at work to attempt to repair this damage . They first took out the sand and stones and iron with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they dragged her up out of the water to the landing . Here the men lifted her up upon her side , and began to beat back the indentations which had been made in the metal , by holding a heavy sledge hammer on the inside , to serve as an anvil , and then striking with a hand-hammer upon the protuberances on the outside . In the same manner they beat back the burrs or protrusions formed where the holes had been punched through the bottom of the boat , and they found , much to their satisfaction , that when the metal was thus brought back into its place the holes were closed again , and the boat became whole and tight as before . When this work was done the men put the boat back again in her proper position , replaced and fastened the seats , and then launched her into the water . They found her stanch and tight , and seemingly as good as new . The whole work of repairing her did not occupy more than one hour-much less time , the officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy her . The boat thus restored was immediately put to service and she performed the work required of her , admirably well . She was often out on the open sea in very rough weather , but always rode over the billows in safety , and in the end proved to be the strongest , swiftest , and safest boat in the gulf squadron . The surf-boats , made in this way , will ride safely in any sea  --  and though sometimes after protracted storms , the surges roll in upon shelvlug or rocky shores with such terrific violence that it is impossible to get the boats off from the land , yet once off , they are safe , however wild the commotion . In fact there is a certain charm in the graceful and life-like buoyancy // THE SURF-BOAT. qwq lently at every rising and falling of the surge , and in danger every moment of going to pieces . She was covered with human beings , who were seen clinging to her in every part-each separate group forming a separate and frightful spectacle of distress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near to the ship on the windward side as to hail the crew and he directed them to let down a line from the end of the main yard , to leeward . The main yard is a spar which lies horizontally at the head of the main mast and as the vessel was careened over to leeward , the end of the yard on that side would of course be depressed , and a line from it would hang down ever the water , entirely clear of the vessel . The brew heard this order and let down the line . Mr. Holmes then ordered the surf-boat to be 1 ) ulied away from the ship again , intending to drop to leeward once more , and there to get on board of it by means of the line . in doing this , bowever , the boat was assailed by the winds arid waves with greater fury than ever , as if CLIMBING TIlE ROPE they now first began to understand that it had come to rescue their victims from their power . The boat was swept so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the oarsmen could get her back so as to approach the line . It seemed then extremely dangerous to approach it , as the end of it was flying hither and thither , whipping the surges which boiled beneath it , or whirling and curling in the air , as it was swung to and fro by the impulse of the wind , or by the swaying of the yard-arm from which it was suspended . The boat however approached the line . Mr. Holmes , when he saw it within reach , sprang forward to the bows , and after a moment 's contest between an instinctive shrinking from the gigantic lash which was brandished so furiously over his head , and his efforts to reach it , he at length succeeded in seizing it . He grasped it by both hands with all his force , and the next instant the boat was swept away from beneath him by the retreating billows , and he was left safely dannli% in the air . // We say safely , for , whenever any one of these indomitable sea-kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a rope that is well secured at its point of suspinsion , fairly within his iron gripe , we may at once dismiss all concern about his personal safety . In this case the intrepid adventurer , when he found that the boat had surged away from beneath him , and left him suspended in the air ov3r the raging and foaming billows , felt that aL danger was over . To mount the rope , band over hand , till he gained the yard-arm , to clamber up the yard to the mast , and then to descend to the deck by the shrouds , required only an ordinary exercise of nautical strength and courage . All this was done in a moment and Mr. Holmes stood upon the deck , speechless , and entirely overcome by the appalling spectacle of terror and distress that met his view . The crew gathered around the stranger , whom *hey looked upon at once as their deliverer and listened to hear what he had to say . He informed them that the ship was grounded on a narrow reef or bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper water between them and the shore . He counseled them to cut loose from the anchor , in which case he presumed that the shocks of the seas would drive the ship over the bar , and that then she would drift rapidly in upon the shore ; where , when she should strike upon the beach , they could probably find means to get the passengers to the land . This plan was decided upon . The cable was cut away by means of such instruments as came to hand . The ship was beaten over the bar awakening , as she was dashed along , new shrieks from the terrified passengers , at the violence of the concussions . Once in deep water she moved on more smoothly , but was still driven at a fearful rate directly toward the land . The surf boat accompanied her , hovering as near to he all the way as was consistent with safety . During their progress the boat was watched by the passengers on board the ship , with anxione eyes , as in her were centred all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of the coast , a in many other places along the shores of the United States , presents a range of low , sandy islands , lying at a little distance from the land and separated from it by a channel of sheltered water . These islands are long and narrow , and separated from each other by inlets or openings here and there , formed apparently by the breaking through of the sea . The crew of our ship would have been glad to have seen some possibility of their entering through one of these inlets . The ship could not , how ever , he guided . but must go wherever the winds and waves chose to impel her . This was to the oute ' shore of one of the long , narrow islands , where at length she struck again , and was again overwhelmed with breakers and spray . After much difficulty the seamen succeeded . with the help of the surf-boat , in getting a line from the ship to the shore , by means of which one party on the land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fro . In this way the passengers and crew were all safely landed . When the lives were thus all safe , sails and spars were brought on shore , and then , under Mr. Holmes 's directions , a great tent was constructed on the sand , which , though rude in form , was sufficient in size to shelter all the company . When all wore assembled the num THE TENT . // ber of passengers saved was found to be one hundred and twenty-one . They were German emigrants of the better class , and they gathered around their intrepid deliverer , when all was over , with such overwhelming manifestations of their admiration and gratitude , as wholly unmanned him . They had saved money , and jewels , and such other valuables as could be carried about the person , to a large amount ; and they brought every thing to him , pressing him most earnestly , and with many tears , to take it all , for having saved them from such imminent and certain destruction . He was deeply moved by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the tent was completed and the whole company were comfortably established under the shelter of it , the boat was passed to and fro again through the surf , to bring provisions on shore . A party of seamen remained on board for this purpose-loading the boat at the ship , and , drawing it out again when unloaded on the shore . The company that were assembled under the tent dried their clothes by fires built for the purpose there , and then made a rude breakfast from the provisions brought for them from thc ship : and when thus in some degree rested and refreshed , they were all conveyed safely in boats to the main land .
