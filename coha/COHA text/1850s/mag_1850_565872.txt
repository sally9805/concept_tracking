ART . 11. - THE BUCKMINSTERS , FATHER AND SON . Memoirs of Rev. Joseph Buckminster , D.D. , and of his son , Rev. Joseph &amp;evens Buckminster . By ELIZA BUCjMINSTER LEE . Boston : Crosby &amp; H. P. Nichols . THIS book is , so far as we know , entirely unique . We doubt whether there is to be found in our own or any other language , another biographical work in which the same peculiar circumstances concur to awaken curiosity and to excite interest . The individuals who are here commemorated are acknowledged , on all hands , to have been among the greater lights of their time . The relation that existed between them was that of father and son . They were both consecrated to the holy ministry ; but they held different and in some respects opposite views of divine truth . The father was an honest believer and vigorous defender of the Puritan orthodoxy ; the son , without being known in the ranks of controversy , embraced some one or other of the forms of Unitarianism . Between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that seems to have suffered no diminution from the difference in their religious views ; and yet often and sadly did the heart of the father bleed at what he regarded the apostasy of his son , while the son manifested the keenest regret that his religions opinions were a source of so much grief to his father . The person who undertakes the task of exhibiting these two characters in the delicate and even painful relations which they mutually sustained , is the daughter of the one and the sister of the other ; a lady of the finest talents and accomplishments , whose filial reverence and gratitude render her tenderly jealous for her father 's reputation , while yet her religious sympathies evidently are chiefly with her brother . The work that she has produced will be read by different classes with different impressions ; and though the number may be small who will proriounce it exactly such a book as they would have asked for , we are inclined to think the number will be still smaller , who begin to read it and lay it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the notice which we propose to take of it , we shall confine ourselves almost entirely to a delineation of the two characters as here presented ; especially the character of the father , which seems to us in some of the notices of the work that has appeared , to have received quite a disproportionate share of attention and honor . Nor shall we suffer any difference of religions opinion , however serious we may view it , to prevent us from doing justice , so far as we are able , to the son ; for we regard it as both impolitic and wrong to refuse to recognize either intellectual or moral excellence , because we may find it in some respects in different // associations from what we could desire . We are aware that it would be no difficult thing to digest from this work an argument that would bear powerfully upon one of the great religious controversies of the day ; and this use we perceive has actually been made of it , on the one side and on the other ; but we confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unitarian controversy , we prefer to say in a different connection . Our sympathies have been too much awakened in reading the work to allow us to write about it controversially ; and we shall be satisfied if we can present to our readers a faithful epitome of it , leaving to their own reflection the lessons of truth and wisdom which it suggests . Dr. I3UCKMINSTER was born at Rutland , Mass. , Oct. 3 , 1751 . He was a descendant of Thomas Buckminster , who emigrated to this country in 1640 and died at Brookline , near Boston , in 1656 . He was the son of the Rev. Joseph Buckminster of Rutland , a highly respectable clergyman who figured somewhat in some of the religious controversies of his time . His mother was a daughter of Rev. Win . Williams of Weston , a niece of Rector Williams of Yale College , a grand-daughter of Solomon Stoddard , and a cousin of Jonathan Edwards . She seems to have been in every respect worthy of her distinguished ancestry ; and in the character of both the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidelity could do , should be done , for the right development and training of the intellectual and moral faculties of their son . Happily their efforts were rewarded in his becoming everything that parental affection could desire . As he was the eldest son , his parents seem from his birth to have intended him for the ministry . His early years , however , were spent upon a farm ; and to this no doubt was owing much of that vigor of constitution , and flue development of the physical powers , for which , in after life , he was not a little distinguished . Where or by whom he was prepared to enter college is not known ; but he became a member of Yale College at the age of about fifteen . As his father had been graduated at Harvard , it is supposed to have been through the influence of his mothers relatives , the Williamses and Stoddards , that he was sent to New Haven . He sustained himself in every part of his collegiate course with great credit , though he was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin , in which his attainments were very uncommon . He graduated in 1770 ; and after that , continued three years at college upon the Berkeley foundation , pursuing such studies as his taste and inclination dictated . The whole period of his connection with the college , as a student , a resident graduate , and subsequently as a tutor , was signalized by one of the brightest constellations of genius that Yale can boast in any part of her history ; and it was no doubt owing in a measure to the peculiarly favorable intellectual atmosphere he was privi // leged to breathe , that his own mind became so vigorous , elkstic and symmetrical . His tutorship commenced in 1774 and continued till 1778 ; so that the whole period of his residence at the college was eleven years . During this period he formed friendships with many individuals who afterwards attained to great eminence and usefulness , which he most gratefully cherished to the close of life . His attachment to the college also was exceedingly strong ; and one of the greatest luxuries with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional visit . Sometime during his residence at New Haven , his mind was so intensely directed to the subject of religion as a matter of personal concern , that for a while , it had well nigh lost its balance . That he had an uncommonly nervous temperament there is no doubt , nor can it reasonably be questioned that such a temperament modifies the religious as well as other exercises of the mind ; and yet we see nothing to indicate that his sense of the evil of sin or of the depth of his own corruption , was greater than we suppose to be often experienced by individuals who are not chargeable with any tendeiicy to enthusiasm . He seems to have regarded this as the period of his conversion to God ; and accordingly he drew up for his own satisfaction a somewhat minute confession of faith , together with a form of self-consecration to God and his service . His confession of faith is an epitome of the Assembly 's Shorter Catechism ; and to this system of doctrine he held with unyielding tenacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he lived . Having gone through a course of study at Ne*v Haven , preparatory to the ministry , arid commenced his labors as a preacher with great acceptance , he received a unanimous invitation from the North Church in Portsmouth , Ne*v Hampshire , to become its pastor . this invitation he accepted , and was ordained January 27 , 1779 . It was a circumstance of some interest that lie should have succeeded two men of so much note in the literary and theological world , as President Langdon and President Stiles ; and yet he has little to fear from a comparison with either of them ; for in the graces of oratory , in fervent and pathetic appeals , in almost every thing that gives one power over an audience , he cast them both greatly into the shade . By his settlement at Portsmouth , Dr. L3uckminster was introduced not only to a highly important field of ministerial labor , but to one of the most opulent , fashionable and highly cultivated circles in New England . But whatever temptations to lower the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relations to the surrounding world , lie seems Iiever in the least degree to have relaxed his high sense of obli2ation as a Christian minister . While he did not hesitate to avail himself of the legitimate // benefits of mingling freely in the most refined and elegant society , he never made himself all things to all men in any sense that implied the least dereliction of duty . While he always stood firm to his honest convictions , and never even seemed to look comr.lacently on what he deemed an undue conformity to the world , while he always sho*ved himself the spiritually-minded Christian as well as the faithful and dignified Christian pastor , he was not wanting in those innocent and graceful amenities which at once recommend religion and constitute much of the charm of social life . Between three and four years after his settlement , he was married to a daughter of Dr. Stevens , of Kittery Point , a man of great dignity of character , and so much distinguished in his profession that he was at one time chosen President of Harvard College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckminster , was a lady of the rarest endowments and graces both intellectual and moral , and had been educated entirely by her father , and with all that vigilance and care which the most fervent parental devotion towards an only child could inspire . By this marriage he had four children , the first of which died in infancy , the second was Joseph , of whom we shall presently speak more particularly , the third was afterwards the wife of Professor Farrar , of Harvard College1 and the fourth was Mrs. Lee , the gifted biographer of her father and brother . Mrs. Buckminster died in 1790 , when Joseph , her only son , was six years old . The widowed husband was well nigh overwhelmed by the shock occasioned by this bereavement , and for a time , owing no doubt to a constitutional mental malady , he sank into the deepest spiritual gloom . About this time , ( 1790 , ) he was chosen Professor of Theology of Phillips Academy at Exeter , but his attachment to his parish and to the duties of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the invitation . In due time he emerged from the cloud which had temporarily settled over him , and for many years held on , without interruption , in a course of cheerful and successful devotion to his work . In the year 1793 he became connected in marriage with a daughter of the Rev. Isaac Lyman of York , and sister of the late Theodore Lyman , Esq. , of Boston . This connection proved an eminently happy one , not only as it gave to him a companion every way fitted to a person of his temperament and to a clergyman occupying so responsible a station , but also as it gave to his children a mother whose kind solicitude and guardian care they never ceased most gratefully to appreciate . Dr. Buckminster lived with hi-s second wife about twelve years . She was removed by death in 1805 , and this bereavement , like the preceding one , occasioned him such deep distress that serious apprehensions were entertained by his friends that it might in VOL . VIII . 5 // volve the sacrifice of his reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckminster left several children at an age especially to require a mother 's care ; but this exigency was happily met by the mature and well-developed characters of his elder daughters , who addressed themselves to the additional duties that were thus devolved upon them in the family , in the loveliest spirit of devotion awl self-sacrifice . rp he father , in duo time , recovered his accustomed spirits , and passed along through several years , without any return of the mental malady by which he had previously been so much afflicted . He formed a third matrimonial connection in 1*1O . The lady to whom he was united was the widow of Col. Eliphalet Ladd ; and though by this marriage he came in possession of a handsome estate , he evinced his magnanimity by returning it to his wife by bequest , the very day after they were married . rpj* third Mrs. Buckminster survived her husband , and hus died within the last few years . Notwithstanding the several years of health and cheerfulness which Dr. Buckrninster now enjoyed , giving promise , as it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of the year 1811 his friends began to observe indications of the return of his old malady , and to entertain fears that his sun might go down in dire eclipse . He was now evidently the subject of deep seated physical disease ; though it manifested itself chiefly in its effect upon the nervous system . In May , 181*2 , it was proposed that he should try the effects of a journey into the western part of the state of New York ; and though he seems to have had no expectation that the result would be favorable , yet to gratify his friends he was induced to make the experiment . On the last Sabbath in May , he preached and administered the communion to his church , with great solemnity and unction , and under a strong impression that it was the last time his voice would ever he heard within those walls . The next day he left home , accompanied by his wife and one or two other friends , with a view to extend their journey only as far as Saratoga Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it soon became apparent that they had little to hope from the efli*ct of the journey . Though he occasionally conversed with great animation and interest , it was evident that his disease was doing a rapid work , and that the silver cord must quickly be loosed . On the 9th of June , they stopped at a solitary inn in the town of Readsborough , Vermont , where they were visited by a tremendous thunder-storm . During this time he sat in a chair , uttering the most tender and touching petitions , and fully aware that he was on the borders of the world unseen . Jlis tranquillity was now complete , and he scarcely uttered himself but in expressions of devout submission and grateful confidence . When his wife entered*the chamber the next morning , ( for she was not apprehen // sive that his end was so near , ) he said to her with perfect composure , " My son Joseph is dead . " Mrs. 13. assured him that it was not so , and that he had only dreamed it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept nor dreamed ; he is dead . " Shortly after this , Dr. Bnckminster gently breathed away his spirit ; and the intelli2ence was soon received from Boston , that his son had died , as the father had so confidently declared , a few hours before . Dr. Buckminster was interred at Bennington , and a sermon was preached on the occasion by the Rev. Mr. Marsh . A. discourse was subsequently addressed to the bereaved congregation at Portsmouth by the Rev. Mr. Parker , minister of the South Church , which was published . rI*he event seems to have spread the deepest gloom over not only his own immediate society but the whole town ; and many of us remember the strong sensation of grief which the intelligence excited even in distant parts of the country . Dr. Bnckminster , it is conceded on all hands , was no common man . We suppose that if for more than a quarter of a century , the half dezen most popular preachers in New England , or perhaps we might add in the whole country , had been named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is understood that he was never remarkable for profound investigation , and that his sermons were not distinguished for that high intellectual tone by which the pulpit productions of a few of our greater lights have been marked ; nevertheless they were rich in evangelical truth , brought out in a perspicuous and attractive form ; they were as far as possible from being tame or common-place ,  --  for so ready was his invention , and so fertile his imagination , that he would throw an air of novelty around the most familiar truth or the most common event ; and they were delivered with a glowing fervor and an almost matchless ease and grace , which gave them a power alike over the most intelligent and the least cultivated of his hearers . His discourses on the Sabbath were usually written , but he was never doggedly chained to his manuscript , and he could at pleasure , arid often did , leave it altogether , and expatiate with great beauty and force in some field which had suddenly opened tip to his contemplation . He was remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would often bring out the peculiarities of an occasion so strikingly in his text , that the first impression on his hearers would be that the text must have been made for the occasion . He was eminently felicitous in prayer ; indeed for copiousness , freedom , appropriateness , in his devotional exercises he was perhaps unsurpassed . As an illustration of this , we have heard the following anecdote . After he had offered a prayer in connection with some public service ,  --  if we mistake not , it was a service commemorative of Washington ,  --  Chief Justice Parsons remarked on leaving the church ,  --  " Well , I give him no credit at all for that prayer . " " Why not ? " said the // person to whom the remark was addressed . " Because , " a*nswered the other , " it must have been the effect of immediate inspiration . " Dr. Buckrninster published during his life somewhat more than twenty occasional sermons , several of which had an immediate relation to the " Father of his country , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these discourses are highly reputable , and some of them of marked excellence ; and yet we imagine that they give but an imperfect idea of their author 's power in the pulpit . There was that in him that made him a splendid as well as a highly effective and useful preacher ; but his printed sermons might have been produced by many a mind much less richly endowed than his own . Dr. l3uckminster 's theological views , as we have already had occasion to state , were strictly conformed to the standard of orthodoxy indicated by the Assembly 's Catechism ; and he looked with the most painful apprehension upon any departure from that general system . One of the greatest trials of his life , as we shall hereafter see , was the departure of his son from that system of doctrine in which he had been educated ; and the last of his published sermons was a somewhat extended exposition of those views of evangelical doctrine which he held deater than life . He however consented to preach the sermon at his son 's ordination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a Unitarian , ) and maintained *in intimate and affectionate intercourse with him to the close of life . There may be different opinions as to the entire consistency of his course in some respects , and different ways of accounting for it ; we are concerned at present only with the facts . JOSEPH STEVENS BUcKMINSTER. who is the Subject of a large part of the volume before us , was born on the 26th of May , 1784 . His early developments were remarkable , perhaps in some respects unprecedented . He began to study Latin at the age of four , and was so desirous of studying Greek also , that his father taught him to read a chapter in the Greek Testament by pronouncing the words to him . He was distinguished also for the utmost conscientiousness and purity of intention . When he was less than six years old , his father being about to leave home 01 a journey , remarked to him that he must take his place in the family , so far as he could , during his absence . Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's books , and when the hour for family prayer returned , he regularly called the family together , read a chapter in their hearing , and then knelt down and offered a prayer so fervent and touching that even the domestics of the household found it difficult to refrain from tears . // Until the *ge of ten , Joseph remained at the Grammar School at Portsmouth ; but in the year 1795 , he was sent to Phillips Academy , Exeter , which , at that time , and for nearly half a century after , was under the care of that eminent instructor , Dr. Benjamin Abbot . Here he was scarcely less under the influence of his father than while he was under the paternal roof ; for he was constantly receiving from him letters of the most judicious and affectionate counsel , descending to every minute circumstance that could have a hearing on his conduct or happiness . So rapid was his progress that , at the age of twelve , he was well prepare*t to enter college ; but his father fearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much for his extreme youth , was unwilling to risk him at so early an age , and accordingly kept him back till the next year . Meanwhile it was a matter of anxious doubt with both the father and son , whether his collegiate course should be at Harvard or Yale ; the son preferring the former on account of some a*sociations which he had already formed at Exeter , and the father inclining to the latter as his own Alma Mater , and as most likely to secure to his son the religious influence which he considered most desirable . The result , however , was that the father waived his scruples , and at the cornmencernent in 1797 , Joseph was admitted , at the age of thirteen , one year in advance , to Harvard College . His examination for admission revealed his remarkable powers and left those of the government of College who witnessed it in no doubt that if his life was spared , he was destined to become a star of no common brilliancy . His college course fully realized , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not indeed distinguished for his attainments in the abstract sciences , nor could he be said to be fond of them ; and yet he made conscience of getting each lesson well in every department . It was in the study of belles lettres and whatever pertained to the department of criticism , that he made the most marked proficiency . His college " themes " showed a richness and gracefulness of mind , and sometimes an extent of reading , that was truly remarkable ; and his reading and speaking were so inimitably beautiful and perfect , that it was very commonly regarded as a high privilege to listen to them . His oration delivered at the commencement when he took his first degree , taken in connection with his very youthful appearance and beautiful form and face , quite captivated and entranced the audience . After leaving college , he accepted the appointment of assistant teacher in Exeter Academy . His mind seems now to have taken a more decidedly serious direction , and it was about this time that he offered himself as a candidate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him a faithful and excellent letter on the occasion , reminding him of the solemnity of the // act which he was about to perform ; but seems to have had io scruples about complying with his request . It does not appear that up to this time , he had formed any definite views of Christianity different from those in which he had been educated . During his residence in Exeter as an assistant teacher , he commenced a course of study with reference to the ministry ; and it was here probably that his mind began first to diverge from the faith of his fathers . It was here also , in the autumn of 1802 , that he was visited with the first attack of that terrible malady , ( epilepsy ) which finally carried hint to his grave . The following passage which he wrote in his journal , evidently intended for no eye but his own , evinces a frame of feeling in reference to this afflictive visitation xv hich every one must approve and admire " Another fit of epilepsy . I pray God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death as for the loss of health and 1 ) erhaps of mental faculties . The repetition of these fits must at length reduce me to idiocy . Can I resign myself to the loss of memory , and of that knowledge I may have vainly prided myself upon ? o my God , enable me to bear this thought , and make it familiar to my mind , that , by thy grace , I may be willing to endure life as long as thou pleasest to lengthen it . It is not enough to be willing to leave the world when God pleases ; we should be wilhug even to live useless in it , if he in his holy providence , should send such a calamity upon us. 0 God ! save me from that hour ! " As the labors which devolved upon him as an assistant teacher at Exeter were considered an overmatch for his constitution , especially after the fearful malady above referred to had made its appearance , it was thoucrht desirable that he should occupy some place where his faculties would be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time presented itself in the family of his relative , Theodore Lyman , who was glad to put his services in requisition in preparing two of his sons to enter college . Mr. Lyman soon removed from Boston to Waltham , arid Buckminster accompanied him ; and hero he was *urrounded with all the elegance and luxuries of the most refined society . At this period he was accustomed frequently to visit Boston , and he became particularly intimate with Dr Freeman , minister of the Stone Chapel , who was his relative by marriage ; arid his father seems to have thought it owing , in a degree at least , to this intirnacy , that his mind had received a bias in favor of Unitarianism . His admiration of Dr. Freeman seems to have been well nigh unbounded ; and proposals were made to him by the Doctor , to which he seems to have been somewhat incliiied to accede , to become associated with him in the services of the Chapel . It was now that his father became fully aware of his defection from the orthodox creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a considerable time , and which evinced // the strongest parental affection and the bitterest disappointment on the one hand , and the deepest filial reverence and sensibility on the other . The father more than once advised his son to direct his attention to some other profession , not dissembling at all his conviction that he lacked the most essential qualification for the ministry ; and the soii , merely from a regard to his father 's feelings , had , at one time , nearly determined to devote himself to literary pursuits ; but as the father 's opposition seemed somewhat to relax , in the hope probably that his son 's views might change , he was finally examined and approved as a candidate for the ministry , by the Boston Association . His first sermon was preached at York , Maine , in the pulpit of his venerable relative , the Rev. Isaac Lyman . His intellectual developments had previously to this been so remarkable and so well known , that the congregation in Brattle Square , Boston , then recently rendered vacant by the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable person to fill that important vacancy . Here again , his anxious father was distressed at the idea of his occupying , at so early an age , so public and responsible a station ; but his wishes were overruled by the irn* ) ortunity of the congregation , who , from the beginning , were enral ) tured by his eloquence , and even resolved to leave no means unemployed to secure him as their minister . The result was that he was called with great unanimity to the Brattle street church , *ccepted the call , and was ordained their pastor , January 30 , 1805 , when less than twenty-one years of age . His father , though not without some reluctance , consented to preach the ordination sermon ; and it must have been , in view of all the circumstances , a severe tax upon his parental sensibilities . In the course of the sermon he addressed the pastor elect in the following significant and touching manner " My son , the day has arrived in which you are to be completely invested with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , and beneficent in its influence , of which you have been emulous from your earlier years , arid which you have always kept in view in your literary pursuits . While I have endeavored to rest.rain your ardor and check the rapidity of your course , motives of concern for the honor of God and for your reputation and comfort ) iiifluenced my conduct . But a power paramount to all human influence has cast the die and I bow submissively . God 's will be dotie ! " In the hours of parental instruction when my speech and affection distilled upon you as the dew , you have often heard me refer to the cheering satisfaction with which I presented you at the baptismal font in the name of the sacred Trinity , and enrolled you among the members of Christ 's visible family ; would to God I might now lead you with the same cheering hope to the altar // of God , and lend you to the Lord as long as you shall Jive . But the days are past in which you can depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master you stand or fall . God grant the response may be ,  --  ' He shall be holden up , for God is able to make him stand . ' " And thus he addressed the congregation in behalf of his son " The heart of a father , alive to the interests of a son and not indifferent to the honor of the gospel , recoiled from the idea of his beginning his ministerial efforts upon so public a theatre and before so enlightened an audience ; and the hope that longer delay and greater experience would render him moie equal to the duties of the ministry , and more worthy of the esteem and resl ) ect of his fellow men , induced me to yield with reluctance to your early request to hear him as a candidate . Bnt since your candor and charity have silenced my scruples , and your affection and judg .. ment have become surety for the youth , and he himself hath said , I will go with you , ' I yield him to your request . Bear him up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your devotional exercises . May God have you and your pastor within his holy keeping ! May he shed down upon you unitedly his celestial de*vs , that you may be like a watered garden , and like a spring whose waters fail not . " On the very next day after his ordination , Mr. Buckminster , owing probably to the fatigue arid excitement incident to the occasion , was seized with a severe fever by which he was kept out of his pulpit till the beginning of March ; and the first sermon which he addressed to the congregation , as their pastor , instead of having special reference to the newly constituted relation , was a sermon on the " advantages of sickness . " As soon as his health permitted him to return to his active duties , he made it his business to become acquainted with all the families and individuals of his congregation , and recorded the names of all in a manuscript book , together with such remarks in respect to various characters , as might serve to aid him in his pastoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish minister , he was connected with many of the public interests of the day , and especially was one of the most active members of a literary association known as the " Anthology Club , " which at that time concentrated much of the literary talent of Boston arid the vicinity . It was b*y this association that the " Monthly Anthology , " a well kno x*Tn periodical which was continued through a series of years , was conducted ; arid it is understood that a considerable proportion of the ablest articles contained in it were from the pen of Mr. Buckminster . Though the Anthology was chiefly a literary publication , it was not altogether silent upon theological subjects ; and the history of the Unitarian controversy for several years , is to be traced very much through its pages . It // sustained at one time an attitude of pretty decided antagonism to the Panoplist , long the accredited organ of the orthodox party , and conducted by the venerable Dr. Morse . The labors of the first year of his ministry had so far affected his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much frequency , that in the spring of 1806 , his physician , the elder Dr. Warren , recommended that he should try the effect of a voyage to Europe . This measure was finally concluded upon ; for his congregation were so much devoted to his interests , that they counted no sacrifice dear that seemed necessary to his health or comfort . Accordingly , a little before the middle of May , he embarked for Liverpool , where he arrived on the 6th of June , and proceeded thence immediately to London , where he was received as a most welcome guest in the family of Samuel Williams , Esq. , the brother of his friends , the Lymans . Early in August he was joined by his intimate friend , the Rev. Samuel Cooper Thatcher of Boston , and shortly after they embarked together for the continent , and lauded at Harlingen , on the Zuyder Zee . They passed rapidly through Holland and part of Belgium , ascended the Rhiue , and partly on foot , made the tour of Switzerland . Thel ) ce they proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , in consequence of nearly all correspondence with England being cut off by the operation of the Berlin and Milan decrees . About the middle of February , he returned from France to England , and after spending the intervening months in traveling in different parts of Great Britain , reached Boston on the 10th of September following . Mr. Buckminster 's tour in Europe , he found a source of rich and constant gratification . In the different countries which he visited , new scenes and objects were constantly passing before him , all of which he contemplated as a most careful and intelligent observer . He made the acquaintance of many of the most distinguished persons both in Great Britain and on the continent , and on some of them at least we know that he left an impression that led them to rank him among the most remarkable men of his time . One important object which he kept constantly in his eye was the selection of a library ; much of his time and money were spent in this way ; and the result was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rarest collection of books that was then to be found in any private library in Ne*v England . He was often solicited to preach in Great Britain , and finally in a few instances consented to do so ; though the reason which he gave for it was , not that he supposed his services were particn .. larly needed , but that he might not lose all familiarity with the pulpit . His health , during most of the time that he was absent , was quite vigorous , and his spirits buoyant , though the occa* sional returns of his malady , could not but fill him sometimes // with gloomy forebodings in respect to what might be its final issue . On his return to his pastoral charge , it is hardly necessary to say that he was met with the most enthusiastic demonstrations of good will and affection . He seems to have been regarded by his congregation as if he had been a son or a brother in each family which it contained ; and his first meeting with them in the church , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that occasion , ( for it could scarcely be called a sermon , ) was perhaps one of the most beautiful of all his productions . It was the simple effusion of a splendid mind , and a confiding , loving and grateful spirit . But with all the rejoicings of the occasion , there was mingled somewhat of sadness ; for it could not be concealed that however his getieral health might have been improved by a year 's rest and recreation , yet there was no evidence that that disease which had so long been acting as a mysterious canker upon his constitution was dislodged . From this period to the close of his life , there were few incidents in his history of special moment . While he gave himself laboriously to the duties of his profession , he cultivated continually his taste for literature , and was ready to lend the aid of his pen to every effort designed to promote the literary interests of the country . He became a vigorous student of the German language ; and he drew upon his accustomed hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was needed for his professional duties . He superintended the printing of Griesbach 's edition of the New Testament , and corrected several errors which had escaped in previous editions . In 1811 he was appointed first lecturer on Biblical criticism upon the foundation in Harvard College , established by the Hon. Samuel Dexter . This appointment he accepted ; but while he had yet scarcely begun his preparation for the duties of the place , death put an end to all his earthly labors . Mr. Buckminster was at last arrested suddenly in his career . There had been apparently no waning of his brilliant powers ; though he himself felt , in common with all his friends , that the seeds of early decay , perhaps even of idiocy , were germinating in his constitution . " Election week , " as it used to be called ,  - -  now the " week of the anniversaries , " - came , bringing with it to him more than the ordinary routine of duty ; for he was the l ) reacher that year before the " Society for Promoting Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he preached on that occasion , he repeated in his own pulpit on the succeeding Sabbath ; and it was the last sermon that he ever preached . On Wednesday succeeding , the 3d of June , his malady returned upon him with a crushing weight , extinguishing in an hour the last gleams of reason , and impressing on his case , the stamp of // absolute hopelessness . During the six days that intervened between the commencement and the termination of his illness , his house was continually thronged with anxious and distressed visitors ; and when he died , it seemed as if the whole town went into mourning . It may safely be said that few cases of mortality have occurred , which have proved the occasion of such universal and protracted grief ; for even now , after the lapse of nearly forty years , some who had but a transient acquaintance with him , can hardly speak of his death without manifest emotion . The sermon at his funeral was preached by the Rev. President Kirkland , a part of which has been preserved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street church . Mr. Bnckrninster 's publications during his life were not numerous . The first was a sermon published in January , 1809 , on the death of Governor Sullivan . It was one of his most splendid efforts ; though it seems to have been the subject of some animadversion at the time on account of its supposed political bearings . In July of the same year , he wrote the address of the Massachusetts Bible Society at its first formation , which was afterwards republished with high praise , in the Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society . In August succeeding , he delivered the annual address before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge , which was published in the Anthology . This address was much spoken of at the time , and illustrates at once his fine powers and his various reading , better perhaps than any other of his printed productions . In May , 1811 , was published his sermon on the death of the Rev. William Emerson . This contains splendid passages , but bears marks of haste not discoverable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he published part of a sermon on the death of Govemor Bowdoin , and was a liberal contributor to the Anthology , and an occasional contributor to some other periodicals . In describing Mr. Buckminster in some of his relations , we are permitted to draw upon our own personal recollections , though they are the recollections of early youth . His person , as we remember him , was rather below the medium size , and perfectly symmetrical in its formation . His face , which is admirably represented by Stexvart 's portrait , was a beautiful compound of intelligence and benignity . His manners were as simple as childhood : there was an openness , a gentleness , a gracefulness about them which made him quite irresistible . You felt yourself in contact with a mind of rare endowments , and yet felt nothing of the restraint which acknowledged superiority often inspires . In the intercourse of society he was as far as possible from being obtrusive , and yet sustained himself in all circumstances with freedom and dignity . In the pulpit , he had almost unparalleled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face that beamed // light and love , and a calm self-possession and winning gracefi*ilness of manner , he held his audience as if by a spell ; and though one might dissent from his opinions , he would find it difficult to resist the power of his oratory . He prayed with his eyes open , elevated at an angle of about forty-five ; and yet there was every thing in his manner to indicate the highest mental abstraction . His gesture in the delivery of his discourse was not very abundant ; and it was so natural and significant , that it seemed to have its effect almost without being noticed . He belonged to a different school of pulpit orators from that of his father , or Dr. Mason , or President Dwight ; but it may reasonably be doubted whether a more bland and attractive manner has ever been possessed by any American clergyman . In regard to Buckminster 's religious opinions , we should be inclined to say , from all the evidence b , *fore us , that on most questions which have since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed . The commonly received doctrine of the Trinity he evidently rejected ; and in regard to the person of Christ , his mind probably reposed in the Arian hypothesis . Mrs. Lee has furnished extracts from several of his discourses on other doctrines , such as regeneration , atonement , &amp;c. , which , however , rather oppose what we should regard a caricature of orthodox views , than attempt to defend any other distiuct system . in some of his discourses he speaks of the death of Christ as " the ground of the sinner 's pardon ; " - as " that which rendered it just for God to forgive sin ; " though we are inclined to think that his later sermous evince less of sympathy with the system in which he had been educated , than his early ones . The greater part of Mr. Buckminster 's preaching would not have been complained of except for its omissions by any orthodox audience . it sometimes reached a point of the most impressive and overpowering eloquence . Witness the following extract from his sermon on " Habit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering a common topic , the inefficacy of a death-bed repentance . It is to be fearcd that charity which hopeth and believeth all things , I was sometimes discovered more of generous credulity , than of well-fbunded hope , when it has laid great stress and built much consolation , on the casual expressions and faint sighs of dying men . Far be it from us to excite suspicion , or recall anxiety in the breast of surviving friendship , or to throw a new shade of terror over the valley of death ; but better , far better , were it for a thousand breasts to be pierced with temporary anguish , and a new horror to be added to the dreary passage of the grave , than that one soul be lost to heaven by the delusive expectation of effectual repentance in a dying hour . For , as we have repeatedly asked , what is effectual repentance ? Can it be supposed , that , when the vigor of life has been spent in the establishment of vicious propensities , when all the vivacity of youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old age , have been given to the service of sin , when vice has been growing with the growth // and strengthening with the strength , when it has spread out with the limbs of the stripling , and become rigid with the fibres of the aged , can it , I say , be supposed that the labors of such a life , are to be overthrown by one last exertion of a mind , impaired with disease , by the convulsive exercise of an affrighted spirit , and by the inarticulate and feeble sounds of an expiring breath ? Repentance consists not in one or more acts of contrition ; it is a permanent change of the disposition . Those dispositions and habits of mind , which you bring to your dying bed , you will carry with you to another world . These habits are the dying dress of tile soul . They are the grave-clothes in which it must come forth , at the last , to meet the sentence of an impartial judge . If they were filthy , they will be filthy still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , cleanse the spots of the soul . The confession of sins , which have never been removed , will not furnish the conscience with an answer towards God . The reception of the elements will not then infuse a principle of spiritual life , any more than unconsecrated bread and wine will infuse health into the limbs , on which the cold damps of death have already collected . S'ay not , that you have discarded such superstitious expectations . You have not discarded them while you defer any thing to that hour , while you venture to rely on any thing but the mercy of God , toward a heart , holy , sincere and sanctified , a heart which loves heaven for its purity , and God for his goodness . If , in this solemn hour , tile soul of an habitual and inveterate offender be prepared for the residence of pure and spotless spirits , it can be only by a sovereign and miraculous interposition of omnipotence. his power we pretend not to limit . He can wash the sooty Ethiop white , and cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We presume not to fathom the counsels of his will ; but this we will venture to assert , that if , at the last hour of the sinner 's life , the power of God ever interposes to snatch him from his ruin , such interposition will never be disclosed to the curiosity of man . For , if it should once be believed that the rewards of heaven can be obtained by such an instantaneous and miraculous change at the last hour of life , all our ideas of moral probation , and of the connection between the character here and condition hereafter are loose , unstable , and groundless ; the nature and the laws of God 's moral government are made , at once , inexplicable ; our exhortations are useless , our experience false ; and the whole apparatus of gospel means and motives becomes a cumbrous and unnecessary provision . " Not long after Mr. Buckminster 's death , a selection from his sermons was very carefully made and given to the public in an octavo volume . A few years later , another volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period his " works " have appeared in two volumes duodecimo , in which are included various ex* tracts from his sermons which were published through a succession of years in the " Christian Disciple . " With the first selection of his sermons was published an interesting biographical sketch of him , from the pen of his intimate friend , the Rev. Samuel Cooper Thatcher . For many years Mr. Buckininster 's remains reposed in the family vault of Mr. Lyman , at Waltham ; but they have been lately transferred to Mount Auburn Cemetery , where a fitting monument has been erected to his memory . We now take our leave of this remarkable book and of these remarkable men . We think it fortunate that Mrs. Lee had the materials for such a volume at command , and that she was induced at this late period to make such provision for perpetuating // the memory of many events in the lives of her illustrious r*latives which would otherwise have remained unknown or been forgotten . As a literary production , it is enough to say of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ; and even those who differ from her in their religious views xviii thank her for a rich entertainment , and especially for the beautiful spirit of filial reverence which she has manifested towards the memory of her orthodox father .
