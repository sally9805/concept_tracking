txt ART . VII . - The Life of HERMAN BLENNERHASSET ; comprising an Authentic Narrative of the Burr Expedition , and containing many Additional Facts not heretofore published . By WILLIAM SAFFORD . Chillicothe , Ohio . Ely , Allen , &amp; Looker. 1850 . ALONG the whole length of the Ohio river , in its endless succession of beautiful landscapes , and its many points of historical interest , Blennerhasset 's island is perhaps the only spot which is sure to arrest the attention of the voyager on the stream . In the long , narrow , flat island , covered with a few ill kept farms , with one or two mean houses and straggling trees , there certainly is nothing to attract notice ; yet not a steamer passes it but that a group collects on the hurricane deck , to ask for the " shrubbery which Shenstone might have envied , " the " music that might have charmed Calypso and her nymphs , " and the " wife who was said to be lovely even beyond her sex , and graced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Blennerhasset has invested it with a charm . Yet Blennerhasset was remarkable neither for any thing he did , nor for his ability to do any thing ; nor were his misfortunes greater than what often happen to men as worthy as he , in every mercantile community . The elegant mansion , however , which he erected , and the scholastic life which he led , in a remote wilderness , throws an air of romance over him , while his connection with the schemes of Aaron Burr gives notoriety to his name , to which his misfortunes lend a melancholy interest . Herman Blennerhasset belonged to a family of some note among the gentry of Ireland , who traced their lineage back to the reign of King John . The residence of his parents // was Castle Conway , in the county of Kerry ; but he was born in Hampshire , England , in the year 1767 , while they were inakin0 a visit to some relative . He was educated carefully at Westminster school , and afterwards at Trinity College , Dublin , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to read law at the King 's Inns , in company with his relation and college friend , Thomas Addis Emmet , with whom he was admitted to the bar in the year 1790 . Before attempting the practice of the law , he spent some time in travelling over France and the Neth*rlands . He saw France suffering with the throes of the Revolution , and returning to Ireland , he found it rent with factions . His means were too ample to require him to submit to the drudgery of practising law . He was averse to taking part in the political warfare of the country . All his tastes inclined to a life of retirement and repose , which was impossible in Ireland at that time . The death of his father , in 1796 , leaving him in possession of a large fortune , he resolved to emigrate to the United States , where he could pursue his favorite studies in quiet , at the same time that he could gratify his wish to live in a republic . Selling his estate to his relative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voyage . He met there Miss Margaret Agnew , daughter of the lieutenant-governor of the Isle of Man , and granddaughter of General Agnew , who fell at the battle of Germantown . This lady is said to have been remarkably beautiful . She was tall and graceful ; she had a very clear complexion , re* , ular features , deep blue eyes , and dark brown hair . She was an accomplished French and Italian scholar , and thoroughly acquainted with English literature . Her manners fascinated all who conversed with her . She was , withal , an accomplished housewife , instructed by two maiden aunts in all the mysteries of pastry and needlework . Blennerhasset met , saw , and conquered . They were marned ; a large library , together with an excellent set of philosophical apparatus , was bought , and , in 1797 , they arrived in New York . After spending some months in New York , they crossed the Alleghany mountains , and reached Marietta in the fall of the same year . Before the winter was over , Blennerhasset // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fourteen miles below Marietta . The Mississippi valley was then almost an unbroken wilderness . The forty thousand settlers in what is now the State of Ohio only dotted the shores of some rivers with scattered germs of civilization . Pittsburg , the great mart of the valley of the Ohio , had scarcely fourteen hundred inhabitants . Marietta was a mere village ; Cincinnati counted a population of six hundred ; Louisville was still smaller ; and Chillicothe had not been surveyed two years . In this great wilderness , Blennerhasset chose the spot perhaps the most agreeable to his tastes . The island secured solitude whenever it was wished ; while the village of Belpre on the Ohio shore , settled by retired officers of the army of the Revolution , Marietta , colonized by a company of highly educated New Englanders , and some of the families of Wood county , the adjoining county on the Virginia shore , - afforded sufficient society . The island is long , and , about the middle , quite narrow . Blennerhasset bought the upper portion , containing about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tradition and oratory have invested with the interest of romance . The traveller sailing down the river , when some miles distant , saw the white walls of the house gleaming through an opening which had been cut through the trees on the head of the island . Except this white speck , all looked as wild as nature had made it . But on landing , a gateway was seen , ornamented with large stone pillars . Beyond , a well graded road with a gentle slope led through the forest trees to the general level of the island . There spread a lawn of several acres , from which every stump and root had been removed , and where clumps of shrubbery variegated the smooth-shaven green . Facing the lawn was a spacious mansion , presenting , with its wings , a front of one hundred and four feet . Beyond the house was a garden as large as the lawn , where devious paths , amid arbors covered with trailing vines , and the mingled hues of native flowers and exotics , together with choice wall fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its heavy boughs upon its borders . Beyond was an orchard and a kitchen garden , together with a farm of a hundred acres . The house was furnished in a style which then had no parallel beyond the mountains . The hall was a noble apartment , // constructed on acoustic principles , that Blennerhasset ' s excellent playing on the violincello should be marred by no echo ; the walls , painted with a dark tint , the gilded cornice , and massive furniture gave this room quite a stately air . To this , the rich curtains , gay carpet , elegant furniture , and large mirrors of the drawing-room presented a pleasing contrast . In the dining-room , the sideboards were magnificent with plate . The chief peculiarity of the mansion , however , was the wing which contained the study . There , the ancient classics , the standard works of modern literature , a full collection of the recent French and German philosophers , a good telescope , a solar microscope , and a good collection of chemical and electrical apparatus , formed the implements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion was tall and slender in person , and stooped slightly . He had a marked though not a handsome face , which generally wore a grave expression . He was not a man of strong will or firm purpose , but was honest , kind , and confiding . Many of his generous acts are still remembered in the neighborhood . His unsuspecting honesty laid him open to frequent impositions . From a dread of earthquakes , he built the house of wood , instead of the fine stone which abounds near the island . And so great was his fear of lightning , that he closed the house and lay on a feather bed whenever there was a thunder storm . He studied for amusement , without ever becoming an adept in any branch of science . His knowledge of medicine was enough to enable him to administer doses to all his poor neighbors , and to fancy constantly that he was suffering from some dangerous illness . His only recorded experiment in chemistry was unfortunate ; conceiving that beeg if kept a sufficient time in running water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tried the experiment . But the fish of the river had so little respect for his science as to nibble the meat away before the experiment was finished . His music was more admired than his experiments in science ; some pieces of his composition are still remembered in Marietta . He was most at home with the old classic writers ; and it is said that he could repeat a considerable portion of the Iliad from memory . He was excessively fond of such sport as the island afforded , shooting at quails and other small birds . His // sporting , however , was almost a practical bull ; for being very near-sighted , he only fired the gun after his wife or servant had pointed it . Mrs. Blennerhasset was a very different person . Her remarkable beauty was heightened by every charm of grace , dignity , intelligence , and high breeding . Ladies who knew her well say they have not seen in America or Europe a by her woman or a more accomplished lady . Always dressed with taste , often brilliantly , surpassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , and soothing distress wherever it appeared , she was regarded with a passionate admiration . A young farmer rented a cornfield on the island , simply in order to catch a glimpse of her in her daily ride or walk . In all disputes between her husband and a guest upon a point in history , she was made arbitrator . Sometimes she would delight a favored party with her reading of Shakspeare . At the same time , she did all the shopping for the large household , cut out clothes for her husband and the servants , and often went into the kitchen to make cake or pastry . Her habits were well suited to the region . She was not only a fearless rider , but could walk with ease from the island to Marietta ; and , says her biographer , ( Mr. Hildreth , of Marietta , ) " she could vault with the ease of a young fawn over a five-rail fence , with the mere aid of one hand placed on the top rail , and was often seen to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of her progress . It was performed with such graceful movement and so little effort , as to call forth the wonder and admiration of the beholder . " Their life on the island passed very quietly . Blennerhasset found all the repose that he had longed for , and his wife urged him in vain to practise in the neighboring courts of law . Superintending his improvements , reading , experimenting in the laboratory , and firing his gun when some one had aimed it , formed his only occupation . This mode of life was varied with balls at Marietta and his own house , visiting , still more with receiving visits from his neighbors , together with an occasional visit from a cultivated emigrant , who , weary with floating down the river hundreds of miles between its uninhabited banks , was rejoiced to find this western Eden . They had lived here eight years , and two children were added to // their other blessings , when they saw Aaron Burr the first time . What the plans of Burr were , it is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he intended to colonize so much of the tract of land on the Washita , called Bastrop 's Grant , as he had purchased . The grant was to be void unless the tract should be occupied by settlers within a specified time , which had nearly elapsed . A more important part of his plan was the conquest of Mexico . The dismemberment of the Union was alleged at the time to be the main end of his design . But no proof has been brought to establish it as a fact ; such a project was so hopeless that we can not believe even Aaron Burr should have entertained it ; and , moreover , on his death-bed , he solemnly and with great emphasis denied it . The invasion of Mexico had been suggested by Miranda , on his visit to the United States during the administration of John Adams . The most prominent men in the country approved it ; nothing was wanted but the sanction of the government to carry it into execution . Under the presidency of Jefferson , when war with Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the West took part in it ; the partisans of the administration throughout the West favored it . Nothing was wanted but a declaration of war against Spain to set an invading army in motion . When it became known that there would be no war , most of Burr 's adherents abandoned the scheme ; not a few , however , continued firm , partly through his persuasion , partly from a belief that the president secretly approved it . In the spring of 1805 , before the plot was ripe , Burr sailed down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans to perfect it . He landed at Blennerhasset 's island , and strolled over the grounds without approaching the house . A servant being sent to invite the stranger in , he spent the evening with the family . The visit was only such a casual visit as Mr. Blennerhasset commonly received from men of education who passed down the river ; no allusion was made to the matter with which Burr was already busy . On his return in October , he again called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Blennerhasset spent the winter in New York , where he went chiefly to meet his old fellow-student , Emmett , who // 158 The Life of Blennerhasset. had just left Ireland on account of the political troubles . In the beginning of December , he received a letter from Burr , regretting that they had not met on the island in the previous October . Flattered by the interest taken in him by the exvice-president , he wrote word in reply , expressing a hope that he might be honored with a share in any speculation which might , during his tour of the country , have presented itself to Burr 's judgment as worthy to engage his talents . In making this advance , not merely a commercial or land enterprise was contemplated , hut a military adventure was mentioned . He supposed the government was indignant at the aggressions of Spanish troops upon the American borders , as well as at the conduct of the Spanish minister at Washington . Under this impression , he supposed a speedy war with Spain was inevitable ; and he offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call upon Burr , to engage with him in any enterprise to he undertaken for the conquest of any of the Spanish dominions . In the following April , 1806 , Burr wrote a highly complimentary letter in reply . He stated that he had projected just such a speculation as Blennerhasset had mentioned , and which he would have suggested , had he found Blennerhasset at home in the previous autumn . He added , that it could not he begun before December , if ever ; that as it could not he explained by letter , an explanation would be deferred until an interview could be had ; and that there would be no war unless the country should be actually invaded by Spain . In August , 1806 , Burr visited the island again with his daughter , Mrs. Alston , arriving at noon , and leaving the next morning . While on the island , he had an hour 's private conversation with Blennerhasset ; and the next day , at Marietta , at snatched intervals , the conversation was renewed . Blennerbasset was assured , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated by them , or even an invasion of Mexico , would be pleasing to the administration , if it could be done without declaring war with Spain ; and that such a war would be avoided as long as possible , although existing circumstances would probably occasion its commencement before he should engage in any operation . Persuaded that the government would not be adverse to such designs , provided they should be kept secret till their execution should // be legalized by a declaration of war , he tendered his services generally to Burr . In the course of the same conversation , Burr said that the people of the Mississippi territory were so disaffected towards the government , that they would at no distant period revolt and call in foreign aid ; and when this time should arrive , the people of the Western States would be called on to determine to which section they would adhere . But he said this was a matter in which he was not at all concerned , though it was spoken of and feared at the seat of government . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that they might not be drawn unawares into a contest for which they were not prepared . Burr , before leaving , contracted at Marietta for the building of fifteen batteaux , capable of carrying five hundred men , and a large keel boat for provisions . After his departure , Blennerhasset wrote for the Marietta newspaper a short series of articles advocating the propriety of separating the West from the eastern part of the Union , and another series confuting the first . These papers , Blennerhasset tU'terwards stated , had no reference to their scheme , because their scheme had nothing to do with the United States ; his object was , partly , to prepare the minds of the people for what he considered an inevitable event ; but mainly , to divert public attention from the Mexican invasion , which he supposed the government would approve so long as it should be kept secret , though if it should become known , the administration would feel constrained to suppress it . By this time , rumors of the intended expedition began to be noised over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even alarm , which we complacently smile at in these days when such expeditions are rife . The government appointed secret agents to spy out its organization ; unusual powers were conferred upon the commanding general in the West ; the legislatures of the Western States enacted special laws to aid in suppressing it ; bands of hastily organized militia were posted along the Ohio , the Mississippi , and the rivers flowing into them ; and a bill suspending the operation of the habeas corpus act passed through one branch of Congress . In October , Blennerhasset went to Lexington in Kentucky , with Mrs. Alston , who had been his guest since August , and her husband , who had just arrived at the island . Here he // observed Burr 's popularity increasing , and no jealousy shown on the part of the government towards him . But before the month was ended , he received a special messenger from his wife , who was alarmed by the reports of three companies of militia being organized in Wood county , and of their intention to burn his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercer , and spoke to him with great sensibility of the rumors that were afloat . He said he was the last man in the world who would disturb the peace of the United States ; he had found in them an asylum the tranquillity of which he would never violate . He mentioned the plan of forming , on the Bastrop purchase , under the auspices of Burr , a colony of the most cultivated families in the Union , and strongly urged Mr. Mercer to join in it . When Mr. Mercer doubted the success of such a settlement begun under the auspices of Aaron Burr , Blennerhasset defended him with enthusiasm . Soon after he reached the island , Burr joined him , on his return from a recruiting tour through Ohio and Kentucky . The crisis of the undertaking was too near for a long friendly visit ; in a few days , Burr completed his arrangements with the boat-builders in Marietta , and Blennerhasset 's family were again left to themselves . Not many days after , they heard that Burr had been arrested in Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack the Spanish domains and thereby endanger the peace of the United States , " and discharged for want of evidence against him . Blennerhasset went for sympathy to Mr. Graham , who had lately arrived at Marietta , and who , he had understood from Burr , was one of their recruits . But learning from him that many of Burr 's representations were false , that Graham was the agent appointed by the President to baffle the expedition , and that the President was resolved to use every means to suppress it , he returned home disheartened . The menacing tone of his Virginia neighbors , and the enactments of the Ohio legislature , added to his despondency . He was ready to abandon the whole project , when , on the 6th of December , a party of recruits from New York arrived at the island . Their presence and the exhortations of his wife overcame his better reason ; he resolved to persevere , whatever might be the consequences . The President 's proclamation being received , // the Wood county militia determined to seize Blennerhasset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped down the river with the New York party . The next day , the militia found the island deserted . Mrs. Blennerhasset had gone to Marietta , to obtain the boat which had been built expressly for her , to follow her husband . Finding it was confiscated with the other boats , she returned to the island with a heavy heart . On landing , she heard an unusual sound of riot , and found her shrubbery trampled down , the lawn torn up and strewed with rubbish , and , near the house , by a fire made of her garden palings , she met a group of drunken militia . Her presence inspired them with no feeling of respect . The larder and wine cellar were emptied , the rich furniture was destroyed , and servants were beaten who presumed to serve their mistress before waiting on the invaders . In her own room up stairs , whither she withdrew with her children , she was still harassed by the tumult , and narrowly escaped a rifle ball that was shot through the drawing-room ceiling . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She took passage with her children in the rude cabin of a flat boat going down the river , and in January joined her husband again at Bayou Pierre , in the Mississippi Territory . But instead of joining him on his triumphant march to the halls of the Montezumas , as a princess of some new realm , she found him a hunted fugitive , with all his hopes blasted , brooding over the happiness that he had flung away . There was little time for revery . He and Burr were soon arrested , but were both discharged for want of sufficient evidence . Burr fled in disguise to escape another examination . A reward was offered for his capture , the whole region was on the watch for him , he was arrested the third time on a road in the almost uninhabited wilds of Alabama , and taken to Richmond , in Virbinia . There , on the 25th of June , indictments were preferred against him , Blennerhasset , and others . In June , Blennerhasset left Natchez , where he had been residing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way with his friends hi Lexington , he was arrested and held for trial on the indictment found at Richmond . Henry Clay , his counsel , made an ineffectual effort to procure his discharge . He was taken to Richmond , where , through 14 * // the long trial of Burr , he occupied himself in writing a brief statement , which he left incomplete , of his connection with the Burr scheme , in keeping a journal , and jotting down notices of men of mark who figured in the trial . Upon Burr 's acquittal , the indictments against the others were dropped . Burr and Blennerhasset were required to give bail for their appearance at Chillicothe , in Ohio , to answer to a charge of misdemeanor ; but the charge was never preferred against them . Blennerhasset returned to Mississippi , where , about a year after , he bought a cotton plantation with the remains of his fortune . Brighter days began to dawn upon him again . After two toilsome years , he again found a home . In Natchez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but choice , circle of acquaintances . He hoped , too , easily to repair his broken fortune . Cotton was sold for such exorbitant prices , that , with a well managed plantation , he might retrieve his losses in a few years . He indeed knew little about superintending a farm ; he still divided his time between his study and society . But while he was with his books , his wife was riding over the plantation , giving all needful orders for its management . The war with England broke out , cotton lost its value , and the estate yielded him a bare subsistence . Bills contracted by Burr for the expedition , which Blennerhasset had guaranteed to the amount of twenty thousand dollars , were thrust upon him . His old home , the island estate , was made over to a Virginia creditor , and the once beautiful grounds were used for a hemp patch , the house for a barn . While thus deprived of revenue and beset by creditors , the old mansion on the island , filled with hemp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these new misfortunes , a new hope was held out to him . An old schoolmate , who was then Governor of Canada , wrote to him , inviting him to come thither and accept a vacant judgeship . He sold his lands , and emigrated to Montreal only to find his friend removed from office , and his own hopes destroyed . One resource was left . He still had a reversionary claim on some Irish estates , - a claim which he had always regarded as a thing of straw , but which was now a straw clutched by a drowning man . He bade farewell to // America , spent some years in England , residing with an unmarried sister , soliciting office from the government , and endeavoring to bring under its notice an invention which he hoped was of great value . After weary years , both schemes were abandoned . He withdrew to the island of Guernsey , and in 1831 , in the sixty-third year of his age , in poverty , but solaced by the affectionate care of his one constant friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone in her old age , to support and educate three children . After eleven years of toil , she returned to the United States in the hope of obtaining from the government reparation for the injury done to her property , in the winter of 1806 , in the name of the government , by officers acting under its authority . Henry Clay presented her petition in the federal Senate . The committee appointed to examine it reported that the claim was legal and proper , and that not to allow it would be unworthy a wise or just nation . It would , doubtless , have been granted ; but while Congress were discussing it , she died in an humble abode in New York , soothed in her last hours by the charitable attentions of a society of Irish females .
