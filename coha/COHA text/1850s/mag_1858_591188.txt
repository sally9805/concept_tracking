HON. DANIEL F. TIEMANK , MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK . D EMOCIRATIC as we profess to be , it is the exception not the rule , even among us , that a man is raised to office without springing from or being adopted into the ranks of what we still regard as the privileged classes . Wealth , education , and early advantages tell , and those who devote themselves to trade , agriculture , or the productive arts , are , with few exceptions , excluded from their fair proportion of public employment and honors . Mayor Tiemaun is one of these exceptions , and is truly a representative of the practical business and productive classes of his native city . Anthony Tiemann , the father of the Mayor , was born at Carlshafen , in Cassel , Germany , where the family have resided for centuries . In order to escape the conscription , at seventeen years of age , he left his native country for England , and after staying there two years , he came to this country about the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital of just a single English pound , he at once commenced a career of industry and honesty which laid the foundation of future success for himself and his children . He married , about three years after his landing , Mary Newell , the mother of the Mayor . This lady was born in Ch*trlestown , Mass. , but came to New York when a child of three years old , with her father , Andrew Newell , who was a cooper , and carried on that business on Crane 's wharf , now the corner of Beekmnan and Front streets , and then fronting the margin of the East River . Both parents still survive , and in their old age enjoy the reverence of their children , and the eminent success which has been the result in no small degree of their own virtuous example . The father , who is a minister of the Methodist // Church , frequently fills the pulpit , and by his unaffected piety and simplicity of character , realizes the very ideal of a Christian patriarch , while the mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being a woman of devoted piety and great energy of character . Soon after their marriage they removed to Nassau , near Beekman street , where , on the 9th of January , 1805 , the present Mayor was born . It is said that his first recollections are of a madam 's school in that vicinity , where he was sent by his parents for instruction . The next school which he attended was in the old German Lutheran church , corner of Frankfort and William streets , a small stone structure of primitive style and simplicity , long one of the antiquities of our city , but which , like many other relics of its early history , has been long since swept away by the ceaseless tide of change and improvement . While attending this latter school , his father comrnenccd the business of manufacturing paints , and built for this purpose the pioneer establishment in the country , in the vicinity of the south-west corner of Twenty-third-street and Fourth avenue , then considered far out of the city . His parents having at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Rosehill school , corner of Twenty-second street and Broadway , where many incidents of school-boy days occurred , which he frequently recounts with glee . Among these were the weekly marches of the boys during the war of 1812 , with the stirring music of drum and fife , to and from the neighboring fields , where they amused themselves , as well as labored in cutting sods for the earthworks and fortifications then erecting at Harlem heights , for the defence of the city . Notwithstanding , however , the sedulous care of his parents for his education , these amusements seem to have pleased him more than his school ; and his excessive fondness for fun and practical jokes , from which even his teacher did not always escape , is said to have been the cause of bringing his academic career to a premature close . On his leaving school his inclination was fixed upon going to sea , and influenced by the opinion of his teacher , who // earnestly advised the same , his father had given a reluctant consent , but a circumstance soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire future course of his life . This was the inquiry made of his father by Mr. Henry Schiefflin , his friend , who carried on the drug business in Pearl street , then as now one of the largest establishments of they kind in the city , whether he had a boy whom he would wish to place in* his store ? The father replied that he had one , but that he was possessed with a strong desire to go to sea , but whom he should much prefer to be in his store than have him follow the roaming and hazardous life of a sailor . This was comniunicated to Daniel on the return of his father to his home that evening , and on the next day he and his father visited together the store of Mr. Schiefflin , who inquired of him if he would like the drug business ? He replied , " No , sir ; I would rather go to sea . " Mr. S. and his father then asked him if he would try it for a short time . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to consent to do so . He was accordingly immediately employed . An order was soon given him to take off his jacket and carry a lot of stick-liquorice to the floor above . This was obeyed , and the delicious*oots had been at last removed , when he discovered in an out.of-the-way corner a stray piece , which picking up he modestly inquired of his employer if he could have it ? The merchant , somewhat surprised at the honest simplicity of the request , replied , " Oh , certainly , " and at the same time he observed aside to his confidential clerk , " Mr. Willard , we must certainly keep this boy , if we can . " This simple incident speaks a volume in favor of the honest character of the boy , which his subsequent life as a man has never in the least impaired , and it also at once secured for him not only the entire confidence of Mr. Schiefilin , but of Mr. Willard , which was never lost during the entire six years he remained in the store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that during this period he was frequently *itrusted with responsibilities and duties by his employer and the principal clerk , Mr. Willard , seldom confided to persons of maturer age , under similar circum // stance* . While employed here he also made the acquaintance of many young men , clerks in other stores , some of whom are now at the head of leading houses in different parts of the Union , who still cherish their early associations with him , and rejoice at his subsequent career of integrity and honor ; and the warm and strong friendships that were then formed with his kind employer as well as devoted friend , and the several members of his family , have never been , from the first day through the long course of years since elapsed , in the least degree interrupted or impaired . He left Mr. Schiefflin 's employment in the year 1824 , for the purpose of going with his father , whose business was then carried on at the old locality on 4th Avenue and 23d street , by only four persons . Additional ones were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand was made for the colors manufactured at the establishment . This business was then conducted in a very primitive style , the firm never taking an account of stock , and only having a single book , in which were entered the receipts as well as expenses of each month , while on the first of March of every year a general settlement took place , when the pr6fits were divided among the several members of it , which consisted of his father and his two uncles . Having continued in the employment of the firm for about two years , he was in 1826 taken into business with them as one of the partners , being then just of age . He was soon after married to Miss Martha Clowes , his present wife , a lady of many virtues and estimable qualities of mind , and who is a niece of Mrs. Peter Cooper , by whom she was brought np-having been early adopted as a daughter by that lady and her distinguished husband . The Twelfth Ward , in which Mr. Tiemann then resided , was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although several wards , as the population of the city has increased , have been from time to time taken from its lower and more populous portions . It was in this ward , and about the time of his entering into business , and his marriage , that he commenced to take an active part in politics . Being elected on the Ward Coinmittees // he was generally appointed as secretary of these organizations . About this period his friend and neighbor , Hon. Isaac L. Yarian , who was subsequently elevated to the mayoralty of the city , was elected alderman of the Old Twelfth . In this election Mr. Tiemann took an active part , and it was mainly through him that Mr. Yarian , a plain and sterling old-fashioned democrat , was nominated to that position . In consequence of the rapid growth of the city the Sixteenth was formed from the lower part of the Twelfth ; and Mr. Tiemann 's residence being by this division brought within the former ward , he of course identified himself with the interests and politics of the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1839 , the people returned him as their alderman . During the greater part of the former year he was the only representative of the ward in the city Councils . While he was alderman of the 16th ward , on the 4th of July , 1839 , a dreadful accident occurred on the Harlem Railroad , in the Fourth Avenue , near Sixteenth Street , by which several persons were instantly killed and a large number of others dangerously scalded and wounded , caused by the explosion of the boiler of a locomotive . The depot of this road was then at Thirty-s*cond Street . On that day the locomotives had run down as far as Fourteenth Street , where they were attached to the trains . Alderman Tiemann himself narrowly escaped , for , as he was just on the point of leaving his house with his little son , for the train , he was recalled by his wife with a request to take a cup of coffee . He did so , and this delay , in all probability , saved his life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they had arrived within a hundred yards of the train . Alderman Tiemann proceeded at once , with that decision and determination of character which have ever marked his life , to adopt those measures necessary to preserve the peace , as well as to assist the sufferers , and calm the excitement of the bereaved friends of the dead . The position was a most critical as well as highly responsible one , especially as for several hours , and during the period of the greatest excitement , he was the only magistrate on the ground . He was , however , equal to // the emergency . His courage , energy , and humanity were alike conspicuous . The destruction of property by an infuriated mob was , by his courage , prevented , and those who were disposed to participate in it were by his decision and bearing awed or pacified , and eventually , many of them were brought to assist in the preservation of the track , and the care of the wounded . Messengers were at once despatched by him for physicians and assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when their owners refused to readily yield them , in which the wounded that could immediately be removed were placed and conveyed to their homes . His devotion sympathetically attracted others , who placed themselves cheerfully under his directions , and worked with him earnestly in this humane cause . At first his position was a most dangerous one-for a stalwart laborer , infuriated by the destruction of life and the many wounded and mangled beings that lay around the scene of destruction , approached him with a crowbar which he had just raised to fell him to the ground , if not to knock out his brains , when a friendly blow struck with an earnestness equal to the imminent danger in which he was placed , dropped the ruffian at once , and a voice in a well-known accent cried out : - " You 'll not be after knocking the Alderman down when I 'm near . " By the employment of laboring men , who refused to work for the company , but expressed their readiness to do anything that he might require of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the day , removed . A vote of thanks was afterwards passed by the company to him , with the tender of a free pass over the road , as a just appreciation of the courageous and humane part acted by him on the dreadful occasion . The bills he contracted for assistance and labor were also promptly paid by the company . This incident , thus briefly stated , as well as many others of danger that we might relate in which he was engaged , in his ward , which then contained a fair quota of desperate characters , illustrates not only the boldness and decision , but the humanity which has ever characterized the discharge of his public duties . // But not only prompt and fearless in the discharge of the responsibilities imposed on or belonging to him as a magistrate , he was also watchful of the interests placed in his charge by his constituents as one of the guardians of the pro* perty of the city . While serving as a member of the Common Council , at this period , a proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the " common lands , " then consisting of a large tract , and most eligibly situated in the central and upper parts of the city . The proj ect was , however , carried through the Common Council despite his determined opposition . He demonstrated clearly , in the debate on this question , the great ultimate value of these lands , and proposed that instead of selling them , the several streets and avenues should be regulated and graded through , and the lots leased on the condition that they should be improved at once . The lands have been , however , mostly sold , and at prices averaging about four hundred dollars a lot , while now scarcely one could be bought for less than two thousand dollars , and many even could not be had for five times the latter sum . Had this been adopted the Corporation would , at this time , have been possessed of a real estate , in addition to that owned at present by it , worth millions , and a revenue would be coming into its treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormou&amp;taxation now sustained by our citizens . It was a property more than ample to wipe out at once the entire public debt of the city . He contributed also during this term , as a member of the Finance Committee of the Board of Aldermen , by his advice and attention to his duties , materially to the early completion of that great work , the Croton Aqueduct ; and if his policy had been followed of issuing stock in shares of one hundred dollars , instead of one thousand dollars , we believe none of those embarrassments , which to some extent retarded its construction , would have occurred . It was about this period that the question of the union of the Brooklyn ferries came under consideration in the Common Council . The measure was strongly urged on by the // landowners and speculators in South Brooklyn , who conceived that their lands located would he greatly enhanced in value by the success of the project . Alderman T. , however , was proof against those arguments , and was again tine to the interests of his constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be thus attained , would be at the expense of the upper part of our own island , and also of the city treasury . The measure was nevertheless carried through , and the result was as predicted by . him , that South Brooklyn rapidly grew up , while the upper sections of New York for a long time languished , until the new system of city railroads , subsequently projected and afterwards strongly advocated by him , gave an impetus to its growth which is still continued under their beneficial influence . And after his elevation as Mayor , so impressed was he of their importance to the growth of the upper wards , that in his annual message he recommended their prompt continuation to the extent of the island . We could mention other important measures or projects which he advocated for the prosperity and improvement of the city , as well as many which be opposed because he deemed them detrimental to her interests , while holding his seat at the board as a member of the city councils , with that force and energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The above , however , will suffice to show how faithful he was to his duty , and deeply interested in the welfare of his native city . While thus devoting his time and his talents to the public interests he did not neglect his own , but was rapidly building up a business which promised him soon comparative wealth . He had bought , in 1832 , a tract of land at Manhattanville , where he established on his own account , a factory for manufacturing colors , and in the latter part of 1839 , he removed his family to the same locality . Having thus left the Sixteenth and removed to the Twelfth Ward , he , after the expiration of his term of office , devoted his entire time to his own affairs . It was while thus occupied in extending his business , that in the month of December , 1840 , a calamity occurred to him // which promised , at first , to be of the most serious pecuniary nature . This was the destruction , by fire , of one-half of his factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years were in a few short hours swept away , but he was left besides in debt to the extent of near $30,000 . A generous and noble friend , however , came to his assistance , and by his liberality he was enabled at once to commence the reconstruction of his buildings . This was his neighbor , Mr. Robert Pettigrew , who came up at the time the fire was burning , saying , by way of encouragement , " Never mind , man , build her up again . I have plenty of bricks and men , and money in bank too . " His kind friend was true to his generous offer , and kept the word of promise to the hope , for on the following morning he had placed forty men on the ground , who commenced to clear away the ruins , and in the course of the day he placed in the hands of Alderman T. a check for $6,000 . With this aid , and that extended to him by other generous friends , among whom were Benj amin H. Field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom he had had previous business connexions , he was not only encouraged but enabled again to resume his business , to which he afterwards devoted himself with the utmost assiduity , and with so much success , that he not only repaid his truly sympathizing and generous neighbors , but cancelled the legacy of debt beqneathed to him by the disaster of the fire . How sweet is the fragrance of such generous deeds as those we have just narrated . Would that we had more frequently the opportunity of relating them . Alderman T. continued thus to give his whole time to his busines* until 1860 , when having taken his brother , Julius W. , and his son , Peter C. , into partnership , he was thereby relieved , in a great measure , from the close devotion he had hitherto paid to it , and was thus enabled again to give to the public a portion of his time and attention . - His brother and his son are now the active members of the firm , andso entirely is his time devoted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited his store since entering on the duties of the mayoralty . Being thus relieved from close application to his business , // he again accepted a nomination to the Common Council , and was elected in the year 1851 as Assistant Alderman of the Twelfth Ward ; and in 1852 he was sent by the same Ward as their representative to the Board of Aldermen . During both of these terms his services were important to the interests of the city , and many measures were adopted or rejected , as he either advocated or opposed them . His good sense and sound judgment were frequently relied upon by his colleagues , and at all times the greatest deference was paid to his opinions . One measure in particular bears the impress of his keen business faculty , as well as his watchful care to accomplish the same end by the least expenditure . We allude to the project for erecting a structure for Washington Market . An expensive plan had been proposed , which would cost half a million of dollars . This was opposed by Mr. T. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another structure on the land west of West street , to be built principally of iron , which , while costing one-third of the other , would at the same time afford greater as well as superior accommodation for market purposes . The facts , figures , and arguments in this report of his were unanswerable . The costly plan was , however , adopted by the Common Council , but Mr. T. still continued to battle it , and the courts at last determined it illegal , through some informality . Whileholding his seat as Alderman in 1852 , he was called away , for business purposes , to Europe . His visit was but brief , as his public duties here hastened his return . He , however , after the lapse of his term of office , being free from the duties of public position , again renewed his visit to that continent in 1853 , and also in 1854 , where he made many important observations connected with the arts , and especially with regard to the construction , management , and ventilation of public buildings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he applied some of the knowledge he had acquired abroad , in his own establishment , and was thus occupied in the improvements suggested by the information thus obtained , when he was taken up by the Democratic party as their candidate for // Governor of the Alms-house , to which honorable and responsible position he was elected . Here also in this department of the city government he brought in good service the strict habits and thorough system of business which lad marked his career as a merchant , as well as the information which he had obtained during his travels in Europe , in regard to public buildings . To him is mainly due the introduction of the improved mode of ventilating the many hospitals and institutions under the charge of the Governors of the Alms-house . He also contributed , in no small degree , to the adoption of a system of economy in the expenditures of this important department ; and in the proper care of articles purchased for its use . By these means not only have the health and comfort of the numerous inmates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses of the department have been materially reduced . It was while holding this latter position , discharging his duty faithfully to the people , that he was nominated by a number of leaiing citizens , embracing all parties , to the present distinguished office , which he now fills with so munch honor and credit , not only to himself but the citizens of New York , and we may say of the whole country . The public found in him a firm and consistent Democrat , with an integrity of personal character beyond reproach , good sense , ' and long experience in the wants of the city government . No election ever produced a greater excitement in the city of New York than that of December , 1857 , and we believe that the vote for Daniel F. Tiemann , for mayor , was the largest , numerically , ever cast for any individual in this city . He has amply redeemed the anticipations of his friends , and in spite of all difficulties , is steadily advancing with every reform within the sphere of his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of singular excitement . Soon after dusk the vicinity of the daily papers was besieged with crowds of anxious citizens , inquiring for the result . About nine o'clock it was known with sufficient accuracy to place his election beyond a doubt . // When the news was communicated to the dense mass of people who filled the whole of Nassau street , from Ann to Fulton , and the greater part of Fulton from Broadway to William street , there arose a shout of joy and . congratulation that showed the real feelings of the citizens , and their just appreciation of the character of the man whom they had so triumphantly elected , as well as their confidence in his stern integrity . He was sworn into office a few days prior to the first of January last , by one of the Judges of the Supreme Court , and on the latter day he received the personal congratulations of thousands of his friends in the Governor 's Room of the City Hall . He met them all with that frank , modest , and truly Republican simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a merchant or a public man It is estimated that over fifteen thousand persons paid their respects and bestowed their fond wishes on this occasion on their future Mayor . On the next Monday the City Government was organized for the year . He afterwards sent to the Common Council a most able and thorough Message , evincing his clear knowledge of the various and complicated business of the city . The city press , without an exception , approved the general features of this paper , notwithstanding it was thoroughly Democratic in character on all the features of municipal policy , which had been drawn into the issues of party . And the Democratic papers throughout the State , even those associated with the friends of the opposing candidate , heartily echoed this approval . During his mayoralty he has , in his various messages and vetoes , kept steadily in view economy and the best interests of the city , as well as stated his disapproval of all measures or appropriations of money which did not come strictly within the charter and ordinances of the city . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner which he regards as essential , and the presentation of facts in them , and the reasons assigned for his disapproval or recommendation , will always be found cogent and conclusive. // During the celebration which followed the laying of the Atlantic Cable , in which enterprise the Mayor took the liveliest interest , his brief message of congratulation to the Lord Mayor of London was a model of its kind ; and on . the occasion of the presentation of the testimonial to Cyrus W. Field , Esq. , at the Crystal Palace , his address to that distinguished citizen , was admirable in its good taste and perfect keeping with the great event . Among the measures which have been recommended by the Mayor , has been the erection of substantial piers and commodious docks and basins , worthy of the important and growing commerce of the port . He has likewise approved of the policy of protecting the harbor of the city , and the rivers adjoining it , against those encroachments which selfish and speculative purposes would beget , unless restrained by a wise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce now is , these improvements and this policy are not only needed , but are absolutely necessary to that growing trade which eventually will make her the first commercial city of the world . He has besides amply vindicated municipal rights in his views of the police law , set forth in his annual message , and has also opposed the separation of matters connected with the city from the control of its local authorities , through the medium of commissioners appointed by the State . Many other suggestions and recommendations have been made by him to the Common Council for the improvement of the finances of the city , the prompt accountability of all officers having charge or intrusted with its funds , and other measures having reference to its improvement or adornment . Among these latter we may mention that made recently by him to the Common Council for the repavement of all the lower part of the city with square block or Belgian pavement , a work , in our opinion , absolutely required , not only for the increased benefit to the health of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles engaged in the transportation of the merchandise of this great commercial emporium . It is impossible to do justice in our present limits to the // various other sound and judicious suggestions which have been made during his long and intimate connexion with the municipal affairs of New York , and the improvements carried out mainly through his instrumentality . Not only is Mayor Tiemaun distinguished for his services in the councils of the city and in other official positions in the city government , but he has always taken a deep interest in the cause of education . He was long connected with the system of public instruction in this city , having been first chosen Trustee of the old Public School Society in 1830 , which responsible position he filled until the dissolution of the Society in 1840 , when he was appointed a special Trustee under the new system . On the passage of the present law he was elected one of the first School Commissioners , and served several terms in that highly responsible office , and with his colleague , Isaac Adriance , Esq. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was located in Third Avenue , near Fifty-sixth Street , having hired the room , and employed the teachers , therefor , on their own responsibility . He was also , for eleven years , connected with the Fire Department ; being for several years an active member and foreman of Engine Company , No. 2* , and on his removal to Manhattanville he aided in the organization of Engine Company , No. 43 , of which he was subsequently elected foreman . The same qualities which have made him popular in other positions attracted to him the affection and respect of his brother firemen . Daring his public life , he stands pure from even the slightest suspicion of being . influenced in his conduct by unworthy or improper motives . Fabricius himself could not boast a clearer record . We may say that he has never , during the many years he has laboriously served the citizens of New York , ever enjoyed an office of profit or emolument , for though he receives a liberal salary , it has been more than absorbed by those necessary drains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate of a great city . We deem it proper in this sketch to notice a matter of a political character which has been frequently used against Mr. 28 // Tiemann by some of his more adroit opponents , growing out of the following circumstance . In the year 1843 a feeling was prevalent that the city expenditures were excessive , and should be reduced , and that means should be taken to secure proper persons for the city delegation to Albany , as well as to the Common Council . Three persons met at Manhattanville , and concluded to call a meeting , and for this purpose sent circulars for a general meeting of all interested in a city reform movement . At this assembly Mr. Tiemann was elected chairman , and during the course of the discussion which ensued , the question came up as to the name which the organization should adopt . A well known politician in those days , proposed that it should be called the Native American Party ; it was seconded , and , after discussion , adopted by a majority then present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of this name convinced him that the objects he had in view were frustrated , and that he should have no further connexion with their organization . He left , and never met with them again . Yet a circular was got up , his name affixed as chairman , without his consent , and extensively distributed under this very party caption . At this time Mr. T. was absorbed in his business , and it then being his intention not to accept any public office , he neglected to explain the unauthorized use of his name , and it has , undoubtedly , been employed to excite a prejudice against him even in his own party . We can not accord a more just tribute to the moral integrity and high sense of honor , that has at all times governed Mr. Tiemann , than was lately paid him by a most distinguished orator , who had always opposed him in politics , but who supported him for the mayoralty . In addressing a vast assemblage of citizens in Wall street , the gentleman referred to said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to place my property in the hands of a person to administer it for the benefit of my wife and children who were to succeed me , I would place it in charge of Daniel F. Tiemaun , having no concern for its faithful and honest application to the purposes for which it was bequeathed. " // As a merchant , Mr. Tiemaun ranks in the highest class for stability , energy , and integrity . He represents both the merchant and the manufacturer . The factory which his father established , and where he and his brother and brotherin-law worked , with a single assistant , has expanded into a series of buildings , covering forty lots , and , employing one hundred and twenty men . At first only five articles were manufactured , now over a hundred different pigments and analogous preparations are made and compounded , involving the exercise of consummate practical skill in chemical science and its applications . And the business has been so extended that it now embraces customers in every part of the Union , and even remote sections of Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best of friends to his employees , and during the serious depression of trade last winter , not a single person was discharged from his employment . Mayor Tiemann would laugh at the idea of being considered an orator , but in a debate on any subject of public policy we never listened to a more effective speaker , or one who more thoroughly fixed the attention of his audience . His candor , honesty , and common sense , together with his large experience , form an assemblage of qualities that usually force conviction . Few orators , unfortunately , possess so solid a foundation for the exercise of their art , and few are so successful in carrying with them the approval of their hearers . As a politician Mayor Tiernaun is a true , practical Democrat ; he has never changed his sentiments , but still cherishes them with all the truthfulness of his nature . Simple in his tastes and nuostentatious ml his manners , he belongs to the people , and treats all in that spirit of fraternity which recognises the fundamental equality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat as Mayor , he observed to a friend , " Next to the performance of my duties as a magistrate to the city , I desire the success of democratic principles , and will use all honorable means to secure that end . " In the councils of the party he has always enjoyed the highest confidence , and // represented it as one of the delegates from this city at the last ' National Convention at Cincinnati . As a merchant , as a citizen , and as a magistrate , Mayor Tiernann has been tried and approved by the general consent of the citizens-in all his relations he has displayed solid ability , but above all , in public and private , a sublime integrity , which recalls the bright examples of ancient republican virtue . " An honest man 's the noblest work of God . "
