Cary , Phoebe , 1824-1871 : A Child 's Path .  --  from Poems , in The psalms of life ( 1857 ) Editorial note : 1Kb PHOEBE CAREY . 1 With sunshine always on his face , Fairer to us than summer flowers , How sank our trembling hearts to see His pathway turning off from ours ; 2 As one on whom we dared not look , So strange and chilling was his grasp , Took solemnly his childish hand , And pushed our fingers from his clasp ; 3 And led his half reluctant feet Along the common way for all , Down softly toward that open gate , Set in life 's farthest boundary wall ! 4 But , when we saw the portal gained , Ne'er folded back for death or sin , The shadow which had led him on Shrank back , afraid to enter in. 5 And the sweet child , no more alarmed , But turning from us smilingly , Gave trustingly his little hand To One our dim faith scarce could see . 6 And , O , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands as ours Would gently lead his feet about Over the heavenly hills of flowers ! Cary , Phoebe , 1824-1871 : Hymn of the Hopeful .  --  from Poems , in The psalms of life ( 1857 ) Editorial note : 1Kb PHOEBE CAREY . 1 Bringing pleasant hopes and visions , Comes to us another year ; And our hearts with happy promise , Are too full for any fear . 2 We will strive with each day 's closing , With each morning 's glad return , Better still to learn our duty , And to practice what we learn . 3 We will view mankind as brothers , Fellow pilgrims on the road To the great eternal city , And our common father , God . 4 We will shrink not from the sinful , Fearing that their touch may taint ; We will bear each other 's burdens , If at noontide any faint . 5 And we will , by each example , By the past which we recall , And by all we would accomplish , Live hereafter each for all . 6 So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , good and just , Answer : ' As our brother 's keeper , We are faithful to our trust .
