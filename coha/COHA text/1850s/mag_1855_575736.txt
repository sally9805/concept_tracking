txt THE LATE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA . T HE recent death of the Emperor Nicholas affords a fit occasion for placing on record some memorials of his life , with such reflections as may be suggested by aiii impartial survey of his career . Nicholas was born in the year 1796 . His birth took place at Gatshina , an Imperial country-seat about thirty miles from St. Petersburg . He was the third son of the Emperor Paul I. His elder brothers , Alexander and Constantine , were educated under the eye of the Empress-grandmother , Catharine , according to the French system in vogue during the latter part of the eighteenth century . Nicholas and his younger brother , Michael , remained in charge of their mother , a princess of Wiirtemberg . She was a woman of great purity of mind , of just and elevated sentiments , and of warm domestic affections . Both of the brothers were children at the time of the terrible catastrophe , in which the life of their father w*ts sacrificed . They could only remember him by the acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . After the accession of Alexander I. to the throne , the Empress-mother continued to devote herself , with conscientious fidelity , to the education of her children . To her example and influence , the Emperor Nicholas was doubtless greatly indebted for his strong religious convictions , his masculine sense of honor , and the prevailing earnestness of his character . Among his early instructors , the most prominent . was Storch , the celebrated writer on Political Economy , whom Nicholas was accustomed to refer to in after life with emphatic gratitude and commendation . The imperial pupil possessed a ready and tenacious memory , and uncommon quickness of perception ; but the tendency of his intellect was more in the direction of the military sciences , engineering , and fortification , than of literature . After the overthrow of Bonaparte , the two brothers traveled over Europe , visiting England and the most celebrated capitals on the Continent . One of the Imperial party on this journey , was the well-known Prince Pashkiewitch , at that time a Lieutenant-General in the Russian service . In 1817 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present king . This union proved singularly happy . His wife was a woman of admirable consistency of character , remarkable for the modesty of her deportment , her mild and affectionate disposition , and her decided domestic tastes . From the period of his marriage , Nicholas led the life of a quiet private citizen , entering , with keen zest , into the pleasures of his fireside , and devoting himself to the happiness of his family , his mother , and a few intimate friends and favorites , to whom he was greatly attached . He found employment for his time in the cultivation of his talent for drawing and painting , and in military exercises with his regiments of guards . In 1823 , his brother Constantine , the heir-apparent to the crown , resigned his claims to the succession , and Nicliolas took his seat at the cabinet councils , which were held , for the most part , under the direction of Count Araktsheff , whom Alexander , in the last years of his reign , had entrusted with almost unlimited power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent in his prejudices , repulsive in his manners , and accustomed to treat almost every one with a certain degree of contempt , not even always excepting the young Imperial councilor . The presence of Nicholas at the meetings of the cabinet was , indeed , a mere formality . At that time , he had given no promise of his future greatness , nor was the vigor of his character suspected even by his most familiar friends . He was regarded by the court , and by the public in general , as a man of ordinary stamp , without any presage of the qualities which subsequently ripened in the energetic , impulsive , and persistent Czar . Not that he ever assumed the mask of the hypocrite to conceal his natural endowments . Whatever may have been his faults , no one could justly charge him with insincerity . Both in his public and private relations , and to the latest moment of his life , his open and ingenuous disposition was free from every stain of duplicity . The germs of the eminence which he attained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were quickened // into life , and luxuriantly developed by his accession to power , and by the electric influence of mighty events . In the autumn of 1825 , Alexander went to Taganrog , a port on the sea of Azoff , for the benefit of his own declining health , and that of his wife the Empress Elizabeth . His condition was soon aggravated by an attack of the Crimean fever , and , after a short illness , he breathed his last . During the various stages of his malady-as no telegraph of any kind had then been introduced into Russia-couriers were dispatched at least once a day from Taganrog to St. Petersburg , with bulletins from the physicians , announcing the state of the Emperor 's health . About twelve hours before his death , a remarkable amelioration in his disease was apparent , and the intelligence was immediately announced to the Imperial family . As soon as it reached the capital , a thanksgiving service was ordered in the chapel of the palace , at which the Empressmother , Nicholas , the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendants on the Court , were present . On this occaMion , Nicholas , for the first time prubably , exhibited that devotion to his family and his country , and those energetic traits of character , which had hitherto . escaped even the watchful eye of his fond mother . Scarcely had the service begun , when another courier arrived with the tidings of the Emperor 's death . The dispatch , whose contents were anticipated by the ominous black seal , was handed at once to Nicholas . He stepped to the priest , and the Te Deum was interrupted . The Empress-mother , who was seated in a chair near the altar , understood the meaning of the interruption , and fainted on the spot . Restored to consciousness , she exclaimed , " Poor Russia , " probably distrusting the good faith of Constantine 's resignation , and dreading a bloody strife between the brothers , with the inevitable consequence of civil war . Nicholas instantly beckoned to the priest , and ordering him to bring the Gospel and the Cross before his mother , immediately took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residing in Warsaw . The mournful news was directly forwarded from Taganrog to Constantine . Its reception placed him in a painful dilemma . For nearly two days he hesitated to confirm his re sigaation , and to relinquish forever the hope of wearing the Russian crown . His better genius at length prevailed , and he sent his final decision to St. Petersburg , with his oath of allegiance to his brother Nicholas . Previously , however , in accordance with a senatorial ukase , the oath of allegiance to Constantine had been taken by the authorities in St. Pet*rsburg , and in other parts of the Empire . The discontented spirits in the capital , who had been seeking the opportunity for an outbreak , endeavored to take advantage of the occasion for the furtherance of their schemes . The mass of the people and of the soldiers were thrown into a state of dismal perplexity . Nicholas was represented as a usurper . Public feeling was excited against him , although the conspiracy , in fact , was directed , not against his person , but against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very day that was appointed for taking the oath of allegiance to the new Emperor . It was headed by several officers of the Guards , whose influence with the soldiery gained them over to the movement . rrhe details of this unfortunate enterprise are generally familiar to the public ; but the following incident has never before appeared in print . The rendezvous of the Guards for paying theh7 salute to Nicholas , on his accession to the Crown , was on the immense square before the Imperial Palace . It had been already rumored that some of the regiments in the barracks had determined not to take the oath . The people were roused to a high pitch of excitement in regard to the aileged usurpation , and began to gather in dark and threatening groups . The staff of the Emperor , with his aides-de-camp , many of whom commanded different regiments , went to the barracks to summon the soldiers to the rendezvous . Nicholas , accompanied only by a single person , the Baron Dellingshausen , a captain in the guards , appeared on the penstyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry tumultuously arose from the crowd- " You are not the lawful Czar ; you ought not to wrong your brother Nicholas stood calmly before the frantic multitude , and attempted to give a true explanation of the case . Different battalions , chiefly composed of the conspirators , already stood on the opposite side , shouting the name* of Constantine // and of " Constitution , " which , following the instructions of the officer , they believed to be the name of his wife . One of the generals , Baron Fredericks , who commanded a regiment of the Emperor 's body-guard , had been wounded at the barracks . The colonel commanding under him , a Swiss , named Stuerler , was killed on the spot , by a stroke of the sword in the hands of Prince ShepineRostoffsky , a captain of a company , and one of the leading conspirators . The general was brought into the palace senseless , with the gapiu* wound in his throat , and carried before the Emperor . At the same moment a company of the regiment of Preobrajensky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , halted at the distance of some thirty yards , and loaded their pieces at the command of the officer . For Nicholas , it was a moment of terrible suspense . He could not avoid the presumption that the soldiers before him were a band of armed conspirators . Turning quickly to Dellingshausen , he said , " I remain where I am . Do you go into the palace , and tell the Empress to conceal the hereditaryGrand Duke . " In the midst of personal danger , it was his principal care to preserve the life of the legitimate and direct successor to the throne . Dellingshausen went into the palace as directed , while the Czar remained alone to face the gathering tem*ipest . The company of soldiers , after loading their pieces , resumed their precipitate march , penetrated the crowd , cleared the space before the peristyle , formed in a square , and turned their bayonets against the multitude . It was only then that Nicholas became aware of the friendly intention of the soldiers , who were the first to hasten to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kyal regiments at the Palace , they drew up in line , opposite the insurgents  --  the Czar , was again surrounded by a numerous staff , including all the generals in command , and the Grand Duke Michael , galloped off to the revolted troops , to demand an explanation of their conduct . The grenadiers of the body-guard , supposed to be the most determined in their disaffection , on being asked , " What are you doing , boys ? " presented arms , saying , " We revolt , your Imperial Highness . " Such were the elements at work . The movement was soon suppressed . Injustice to Nicholas , it must be said , that , he endeavored to avoid bloodshed , to the last extremity . He first ordered the artillery to fire over the heads of the the masses . This attempt proved ineffectual and he was vehemently urged by his brother , and the generals , to hesitate no longer . A second volley was fired killing and wounding about four hundred of the insurgents . They now scattered in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making their escape . At a subsequent period , the principal leaders of the revolt , were brought to trial , before a special board of military Commissioners , and the different sentences , pronounced by them , were not set aside by the Emperor . The accession of Nicholas to powet , was , accordingly , by a thorny and bloodstained path . But from the very commencement of his reign , he resolved to present an example of governing the country by absolute will , without the ceremony of a constitution . His faith in the principle of autocracy , was boundless . He aimed at once to efface from the memory of . his people , the tragic circumstance which inaugurated his reign . Every branch of the government was burdened with colossal abuses . Some of these abuses were inherent in the principle of despotism , but the greater number of them were the effect of maladministration . The youthful Czar engaged in the work of reform , with energy and self-devotion . For months he labored with such intensity , as to impair his eye-sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were distinguished in public opinion , as well as at court , for their talents and integrity . The various branches of the administration , were entrusted to such persons . He wished to employ them in the higher departments of the Government , replacing the men of mere routine and tradition , with younger and more gifted individuals . But his judgment of character was far from infallible-ia fact , he had little insight into human nature , and hence , though sometimes successful in the choice of his servants , he was often deceived by bold and ambitious pretenders . From this defect of perception , he never wholly recovered . He was obliged to make his selection from a comparatively limited number of // persons . In Russia , the administration is exclusively in the hands of the nobility , who , in respect of social and official position , are divided into fourteen classes . As a general rule , each class corresponds with a certain office , which can not be filled by a person belonging to a higher or lower class . Promotion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of active service in each class ; and accordingly the higher offices are bestowed in proportion to age , rather than to capacity . Senility is thus made to command a premium . Nicholas perceived the disastrous effects of such an organization , and soon after his accession to the throne , attempted to make every office dependent on an examination as to character and ability . But this reform , like many others , died in embryo . Still , he subjected the machinery of State to a partial , and , of course , somewhat superficial re-organization . But on the whole , he may justly be called a reformer , and , indeed , in many respects , is entitled to the name of a creator . He eradicated many evils , or at least changed their forms and mitigated their effects . On the other hand , however , he spread the seeds of new evils , which , in some cases , were no less deleterious in their action than those which they supplanted . His intentions , it can not be denied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should regard them from his own point of view . They always proceeded from deep and conscientious convictions . He executed many judicious reforms , while he abandoned others almost the moment after their conception . This vacillation in his policy forms one of the most remarkable features of his reign . Many of his best designs were frustrated by the cold and sullen opposition of those by whom he was surrounded . His own indecision ndded to the difficulty of execution . In the beginning of his reign , he proposed to alleviate the censorship of foreign and domestic publications , and to enlarge the freedom of the press . But in the course of his administration , the censorship became more severe than before . He was deeply convinced of the paralyzing influence of serfdom upon the national welfare and development . He sincerely desired its abolition , or at least , its essential modification . Yet serfdom survives him , subject to the same conditions as when he ascended the throne . Nicholas wished to transform the serfs into owners of homesteads , on conditions not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who heretofore had enjoyed absolute possession of the soil . He issued a ukase on this subject , but its provisions were never carried into effect . Afterwards , he proposed to secure the homestead as a dependence on the landlord , submitting the relations between proprietors and laborers to stringent rules , and placing every detail under the safeguard of the law . With this view he published a ukase concerning inventories , or the labor due from the serf to the proprietor , stating the remuneration to be received by the farmer in arable land , pasturage , houses , cattle , and the like ; but this ukase also failed to be put into execution . The principal cause of this apparent unsteadiness of purpose in Nicholas was a deficiency of intellectual power . He was able to conceive and comprehend the general features of any important combination-in this respect , he was superior to all the Russian noblemen isb his councils , as well as to all contem-* porary sovereigns-hut he had not the capacity to disentangle and master the details of a project , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . was ebliged to depend almost entirely upon his ministers and other official functionaries . But they were usually opposed to his plans , and would lend n* aid to their accomplishment . The nar* rowness of their mental vision , their long-cherisl ? ed prejudices , their dread of innovation , and their attachment to . the ancient , musty routine , forbade them to sympathize with his purposes , and ' arrayed them in hostility to his sugges* tions . No one , not even the most bitter* enemy of NicholAs , can cafl in question his good intentions , or deny that h& aimed at the highest good of his Em-* pire . He wished to develop the intek lectual powers of the nation , as well as to expand its immeasurable resources a material character . But he attempted an impossibility in exeluding from the motive powers , by which he would act on mind and matter , the most inspiring principle of human action-the love of liberty . In his opinion , Russia was never to throw off the swaddlingclothes of infancy . He committed numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // defects of his intellect ; but they are chiefly to be ascribed to the impossibility of combining progressive civilization with the principle of authority , or worse still , with the exercise of privilege . It is beyond the scope of this article to unfold the successive acts and events of his reign , or to trace the steps by which his character became tempered to the hardness of steel . Everything tended to inspire Nicholas with a sense of his own infallibility . He became dogmatic in judgment and arbitrary in will . His capacities gained new strength by exercise , his devotion to business increased his knowledge of affairs , and all his resources were conscientiously devoted to the adujinistration of the government . Still he often proved unequal to the task . In the early portion of his reign , he consulted freely with his ministers and favorites , relying , in a great degree , on their opinions , and permitting himself to be guided by their superior information and experience . But , subsequently , he grasped the reins of empire with a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish his plans . In this respect , he followed the example of Louis XIV . in his advanced age . Among the most important acts of his government , was the formation of a systematic legal code , together with the melioration of the criminal law , including the abolition of the knout as a mode of punishment . In his principles of political economy , he was a decided protectionist . The prosperity of Russia was greatly promoted under this system , and to its early adoption she is now indebted for her power to resist the combined resources of the coalition . He organized the army , and in fact , created the navy . His time was principally occupied with the details of the military organization and the foreign policy of the government . He wished to reduce the whole nation to the strictness of military rule , believing that this would be the most effectual check to the progress of a free spirit among the younger portions of the population . rrhus , he ordered the pupils in the gymnasiums and universities to wear uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The medical and surgical schools in St. Petersburg were entirely under the control of the Minister of War . The department of civil engineering , the construction of roads and canals of every description , the working of the mines , and the charge of public buildings , were all subjected to military regulations . Nicholas , himself , planned and directed the construction of various fortresses in person . He also cherished a strong predilection for architecture . He built several magnificent edifices ; for example , the Church of St. Isaac . He restored and embellished the Kremlin , and various other palaces , in St. Petersburg and Moscow , and in other towns of the Empire . Nearly all the architectural plans of public edifices , especially in the cities which were the seats of any administrative departments , were submitted to his inspection and approval . The first trial of his autocratic principles , in relation to the general policy of Europe , was occasioned by the revolution of 1830 , and the insurrection of Poland . Nicholas was crowned as King of Poland , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional oath , and accepted the position conscientiously ; but , doubtless , not very willingly . He decided to give a faithful adherence to the Constitution , as it had been transmitted to him by his predecessor . Its main guaranties , such as the liberty of the press , personal freedom , the publicity of the deliberations of the Diet , and many others , had been successively violated since 1819 , by the Emperor Alexander , and his obsequious agent in Poland , the Grand Duke Constantine . To all these encroachments , the nation submitted silently , though sullenly . The conspiracy , discovered in the year 1825 , was not caused by the violation of the Constitution , but aimed at the restoration of ancient Poland . The nation at large , accordingly , did not utter any protest against the arbitrary changes in the Constitution . The immediate functionaries who introduced these violations , were Poles ; men high in office , and most of them belonging to families of the highest distinction in the kingdom . Their influence produced a strong effect on public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if state , and every minister , down to the lowest official , were all Poles , as not a single Russian , at that time , could have been employed . Nicholas took this mutilated Constitution as he found it . He opened the Diet in person , strictly enjoining on the Polish ministers-who had , heretofore , // tasted the delights of exercising arbitrary power  --  a severe observance of the law . He attempted , as far as possible , to mitigate the rage of his elder brother Constantine , who had been the real , if not the official ruler of Poland . As a compensation for his resigning the Imperial crown , Constantine claimed the uncontrolled sovereignty of that country . Upon the breaking out of the insurrection in 1830 , Nicholas did not hesitate , for a moment , to exercise all the power at his command for its suppression . The protracted issue of the struggle , which at one time , really menaced the position of Russia in Europe , aroused the wrath of Nicholas against the Constitution . Victorious in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged the declaration of independence by the Poles as the cause of its suppression . He determined to incorporate this ill-fated nation with the Russian Empire , absorbing its existence in that vast political body . He , however , made a distinction , between the Polish insurrection , and the Russian revolt of 1825 . The Russians he considered as his born subjects , and accordingly punished them with greater severity . But as the Poles were brought under the Imperial scepter by political events , their offense was visited with a comparatively lenient retribution . Of the principal Russian conspirators five were hung in St. Petersburg , while not a single Pole was put to death for the insurrection of 1830 . It is true that most of the leaders had time to escape to other countries , and two hundred and sixty-seven were condemned to death for " contumacy ; " but still several of the chiefs were captured , and among them , Lieutenant Wysocky , the originator and head of the whole conspiracy . His sentence was commuted by Nicholas to transportation for life ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of China , where he owns large tracts of land , and has established a very lucrative manufacture of soap and candles . In the course of years , several small outbreaks of a guerilla character , followed the great insurrection . A few Russians were killed unawares ; and on account of the treacherous and sanguinary nature of these outrages , their perpetrators were instantly shot . It must be said , in justice to Nicholas , that during his whole reign , not more than 400 voi*. v.-38 Poles , at the utmost , were transported to Siberia-some of them for life , and others for a limited time . Although this number is considerable , it still falls short of the current representations in regard to the enormous masses of the transported . These unhappy victims were scattered over the portions of Siberia , that were capable of being cultivated , and now form agricultural and manufacturing colonies . Among all the Russian ministers and statesmen , Nicholas alone cherished no hatred or animosity toward the Poles . He , indeed , regarded the restoration of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession ; but , in every other respect , he always placed the Poles on an equal footing with the native Russians . The departments of public service were all freely opened to them-he cheerfully consulted their wants and promoted their interests-in spite of the opposition and ill-will of his Russian counselors . He had not the slightest tincture of the Know Nothing sentiment in regard to the Poles or their country . He was no less solicitous for the material prosperity of Poland than of Russia . In this respect even more was done for the former than for his own nation . It was a common remark with him , " that he should allow Poland fifty years to become accustomed to her new political position . " After the convulsions of 1830 , Nicholas grew more and more decided in his autocratic convictions . He adopted the belief that he was destined by Providence to be the defender of legitimacy in Europe . He carried out this belief to its logical conclusions , with his usual stern adherence to an idea . In spite of his antipathy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than to permit the violation of the direct rights of a reigning dynasty . He , accordingly promptly recognized the Constitutional Government of Donna Maria of Portugal , considering Don Miguel as a lawless conspirator . Btit he never assented to the changes which took place in Spain , after the death of Ferdinand VII. , as Don Carlos , in his opinion , was the rightful sovereign ; and as yet no diplomatic intercourse exists between Madrid and St. Petersburg . For the same reason , he was never reconciled to Louis Philippe , and would even have preferred a // republic , provided it made no attempt at propagandism . From his heart lie despised the Orleans dynasty . The celebrated caricature of the pearwhich , as a likeness of Louis Philippe , for years covered the walls of Pariswas universally popular in St. Petersburg , and could even be found in all possible shapes in the Imperial palace . The fatal infatuation with which he cherished the principles of legitimacy , prevented him from taking a comprehensive view of European events , and exerted a mischievous influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way , towards the close of his reign . On all questions of whatever character concerning the rights of Russia , foreign courts and foreign diplomats . found him intractable . In the year 1837 , an English vessel called the Vixen , was detected in carrying gunpowder , a contz*iband of war , to the Circassians , who were in arms against Russia . The vessel was seized , brought into the port of Odessa , and confiscated , and the crew thrown into prison . The act produced a terrible excitement in the British Parliament . The well-known Lord Durham was sent to St. Petersburg , to demand satisfaction . But his mission was not successful . On one occasion , at a ball of the court , while conversing with Lord Durham , the Emperor raised his voice , so as to be heard by those around him , and said , " I am right in confiscating a contraband of war , whatever be the flag which covers it ; and I shall give no satisfaction . Go to war if you like . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burn some of my harbors and cities ; but , pray , make a descent upon Russia , and I can . promise you a warm reception . " The turn of affairs in 1848-when monarchs , aristocrats , conservatives , and money-kings of all countries , fell at his feet , appealing to him as their savior-when the unskillfull revolution- ists receded before him in terror-and he seemed to hold the destinies of Europe in his hands-actually intoxtcated Nicholas with a sense of the importance of his position . He believed that the indestructible spirit of liberty was chained , at least , for a long time , if not for ever . He regarded himself as the great pacificator of nations-the only bulwark against the torrent of revolution and popular violence . After the first blast of the tornado had passed away , defeated absolute sovereigns gained encouragement from his councils , if not from his arms . He thus revived the drooping spirits of the King of Naples ; and , in a short time , the liberals were overpowered by the royal troops . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only with advice but with money , especially after the flight of the latter to Gaeta. lie at once espoused the cause of DemTmnark against Schleswig-Holstein and the German Diet , opposing the effort for emancipation from what was*called a foreign dominion , according to the detested revolutionary principle that had been proclaimed in Germany . lie supported the interests of legitimacy and of the royal house of Denmark , while at the same time he protected the rights of his own dynasty , which , in a remote future , might have some claims to the Danish crown . When the partisans of a German Imperial unity proffered the crown of the empire to the King of Prussia , Nicholas strenuously persuaded him not to accept the proposal . But his greatest mistake as a Russian Emperor , was his hearty espousal of the cause of the Hapsburgs , saving them from ruin by his timely intervention . Cherishing friendly relations for years with the court of Turin , and always treated with the most deferential homage by Charles Albert , he suspended all diplomatic relations , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From that moment he treated the Court of Turin with profound contempt , and even to the last day of his life , refused to recognize the new order of things or the present sovereign . The campaign in hungary was neither a brilliant feat of arms , nor a sagacious stroke of policy . The Magyars were attacked on all sides by overwhelming numbers , and could not long maintain a successful resistance . The expedition against them was contrary to the national sympathies of Russia . Her people regarded Austria with hereditary dislike . Pashkiewitch and the Russian generals would rather have burned down Vienna than capture G*irgey . The protection of Austria was pernicious to the Russian interests . A small Magyar state on the confines of Russia could never be so dangerous a neighbor as an Empire , numbering thirty-five millions of inhabitants , in // a highly centralized condition . Had not Nicholas interfered in their domestic quarrel , the Magyars would have chefished no grudge against him . With the dissolution of Austria , the Slavic nationalities would have been emancipated . Unable to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them separately , the Southern Slavi would have sought the protection of Russia against the hated Magyar rule . The Hapsburgs , as well as Kossuth , threatened to destroy their nationality , and even their native language ; and Russia alone could have preserved them from this fate . In case of the dissolution of the Austrian empire , Grallicia would have naturally fallen to Russia , and thus , without any effort on her part , she would have extended her dominion and consummated the Slavic unity . The interference of Nicholas in European affairs was injurious to himself , and unfavorable to the interests of Russia . It excited a general antagonism against him , which still continues , as there is a strong conflict between the aims of England , and France , and the future destinies of Russia . But no justice can be done to the character of Nicholas , unless he is regarded exclusively as a Russian sovereign . As such , with all his faults and mistakes , he has secured to Russia a prominent position among the nations of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationality , raising it to a degree of intensity which it could not easily have reached in any other way . With the concentrated power of the government , he devoted himself to the development of the inexhaustible material resources of Russia-resources which , for the most part , had remained hidden until his reign , and not subjected to intelligent human activity . It is , indeed , true , that a long season of peace , and the energy of the national spirit , contributed greatly towards the result ; but the impulse came from his zeal , and the direction , from his sagacity . With a wise interest in the education of his people , he enlarged the number of elementary schools , as well as that , of the gymnasiums and universities . The attendance on these seminaries was small , to be sure , compared with the bulk of the population ; but it surpassed the number of pupils that received public instruction under his predecessor . It is to be regretted , that , in the opinion of Nicholas , the nation was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done without endangering the interests of the autocracy - to the promotion of which all other considerations were to be postponed . Thus he aimed to produce intellectual machines of limited activity , rather than men of liberal accomplishments and independent thought , so that he might absorb the national spirit in his own individuality . He did not perceive that , even for an autocracy , it is better to blend the population in an equal mass , than to separate it into a variety of privileged classes , and only favoring them with light in proportion to privilege . His reign is not without indications that he saw the need of a more general fusion ; but , notwithstanding the military decision of his character , he had not sufficient energy to break down the barriers of distinction , to open broadly to the whole nation the sources of education , admitting nobles , burghers , and peasant5 indiscriminately to its advantages . The creative powers of Russia would have thus increased to colossal proportions , while the autocracy would not have held a more anomalous position than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Poland have enlarged their material prosperity ; and even the solitudes of Northern Asia have received a new light , in the development of public ordcr , and of the first rudiments of a progressive social system . But if Nicholas failed to achieve everything he wished for the advancement of Russia , it is , nevertheless , true , that she is indebted to him for the degree of prosperity which she now enjoys . He certainly fostered , developed , and gave to the nation , a complete military education . This was partly because the profession of arms was his ruling passion , and partly because he foresaw that the expansive force and greatness of Russia would one day excite the jealousy of the older European states , and give rise to questions which could only be settled by an appeal to military force . Anticipating the inevitable developments of the futureand to which the present Crimean struggle is perhaps , merely a prelude-he organized , as far as was in his power , the national resources and means of resistance . All classes of society complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loud and bitterly . It was // said that all the forces of the nation were crushed and absorbed by the military establishment-that more than onehalf the public revenue was squandered o* *t  --  and that an immense productive power was thus diverted to useless objects . In the present juncture , a large majority of the nation does justice to the sagacious foresight of Nicholas , and many now regret that he had not done even more . Without that foresight , Russia would have been unable to face the danger with which she is now threatened , or to oppose a successful resistance to the attacks of the West . In connection with his experienced corps of engineers , the Czar planned nearly all the strongholds which bristle around the Russian borders , as Cronstadt , Sweaburg , Sebastopol , Warsaw , Modlin , Ivangorod , and several others , by which the inroads of the enemy are arrested , and the invasion of the interior of the Empire is rendered impossible . By his special care , the magazines and arsenals were filled with inexhaustible stores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia coping on equal terms with two European powers , superior to all other States in capital , in variety of resources , and in material and intellectual development . Russia contains in her soil the greatest diversity of natural wealth ; but Nicholas knew how to use the granite , converting it into a s*fe-guard of the national independence and greatness . In the history of R*issia , Nicholas will ever shine as one of her most useful sovereigns , as the efficient pioneer of her ultimate destiny . Absolute power , in his hand , like a two-edged sword , was wielded both for good and evil . He suppressed for a time , many lofty aspirations ; but the elasticity of the human mind , and the genius of liberty , are indestructible ; and it could not have been demanded of Nicholas to facilitate their expansion . Nevertheless , he unconsciously prepared the soil for other and better seed . The intelligence of the nation has received a quickening impulse . Though comparatively feeble at present , no power on earth can arrest its progress . Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neros or Ivans are no longer possible ; and sooner or later , disenthralment must come No better patriot than Nicholas could be found in Russia . Indeed , he cherished his country with fond idolatry . Both in his intellect and in his heart , the national religion , the autocracy , and the Russian nationality , formed a sacred and indissoluble trinity . With the deep earnestness of his nature , the volcanic force of his passions , he pitilessly crushed whatever stood in the way of the accomplishment of his creed . In the discharge of this duty , as he deemed it , he did not refrain from violence and cruelty ; but lie committed no act without an impregnable conviction of its justice . He was an autocrat , a Czar , to the back-bone . The saying of the celebrated De Maistre , in regard to Alexander , that " despotism poured out of his nostrils , " is still more apphcable to Nicholas . Alexander was an autocrat by temperament , and shrouded his inclinations in mystery . Nicholas was an autocrat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His character was transparont as the day . He never attempted to color his private or public actions with any false hue . He hated and despised all tricks , in politics and diplomacy . At one time , he appointed Count Pahlen  --  a man who had spent his whole life in the camp  --  to the post of ambassador at the court of Louis Philippe . The Count wished to excuse himself from accepting the office , on the ground of his ignorance of diplomatic niceties . " You are precisely the man , " answered the Emperor , " that I like . I wish to have a minister of straight-forward speech . " On the whole , Nicholas was easy of access , especially to the lower classes . He loved to come in contact with the actual people , and made frequent opportunities for this , in his repeated journeys in the interior of the empire . On his visits to Moscow , he freely mingled with the multitudes , that swarmed around his steps . The private life of Nicholas was marked by heartiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , in the largest and noblest sense of the term . No better husband and parent could be found in any social condition whatever . He daily visited the nurseries of his grand-children . Sober and moderate in his personal habits , he was fond of luxurious display in his court , in order to do honor to the position . He was scrupulously observant of all // the ceremonies of court-etiquette , surveying , arranging , and directing their execution , and easily irritated by any mistake or omission . This is hardly consistent with nobleness of character , or high intellectual endowments . But even Charlemagne did not consider the ceremonial of his court as beneath his attention . In this respect , however , Nicholas showed less pedantry than Napoleon , but more than Frederic the Great . To his last moment , he retained his passion for directing ceremonials , and , when dying , named the room in the palace in which his corpse was to be publicly exposed . His death was not without a pathetic interest , in its philosophic and Christian simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent and irritable temper . His passions were easily aroused , and were often terrible in their expression . As the military drill formed the principal part of his daily routine , nothing exasperated him more than any omission , error , or fault , during parades or other military exhibitions . On such occasions he gave way to tempestuous outbursts of anger , but they were chiefly directed against the officers of different ranks , and not against the common soldiers . Nor was his language , at such times , so remarkable for decorum , as for energy . He was aware of this tendency to excitement , and often endeavored to place a restraint upon his temper . His most confidential courtiers , as Benkendorif , Wolkousky , Adlerberg , Orloff-one of whom , at . least , was always near him-were advised to move on instantly , whenever the fit of anger broke out and passion began to master his good sense . At this prearranged movement , the Czar stopped short , and quietly followed his keepers . Once , for instance , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not worthy to carry the epaulettes of his rank . As soon as he was pacified , however , he sent to the Colonel the epaulettes and the commission of a General . Each minister , at least , once a week , had an audience with the Emperor , to decide upon the affairs belonging to his department . The subjects thus brought forward were often of an unpleasant nature , and suited to awaken the angry feelings of one less impatient than Nicholas . The cabinet , in which he received the ministers , was situated over the boudoir of the Empress . She always remained in this room during the hours of the ministerial audiences . Both the rooms were connected by an interior winding stair-case . The Empress could easily hear any noise in the room overhead , and as soon as she noticed that the voice of the Emperor rose to an angry *tone , she would call , " Nicholas ! Nicholas ! " who hearing the warning of his fair conjugal monitress , would run down stairs , and having calmed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , though exposed to all sorts of irritation , he showed a mastery of himself , which none , who were acquainted with the irascibility of his temper , could observe without astonishment . In proportion as public affairs became entangled , and apparently disastrous to his policy , he exhibited a greater degree of calmness , patience , and forbearance . In his general social , iatercourse , he could be singularly fascinating , and thus lie often captivated the hearts of those who approached him for the first time . He was very familiar with the persons , whom he admitted to a close intimacy , allowing them an almost incredible freedom of expression , even in the way of criticism , and admonition ; but he was quick and decided in his resentment at any neglect , arrogant pretension , and unseasonable levity . Nicholas exercised a lavish generosity towards his favorites ; he liberally recompensed all services , and above all , gratefully remembered those who stood by him during the insurrection of 1825 . But he seldom forgot and could not forgive an offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his character . To be really magnanimous with an offender , seemed to surpass the power of his nature . Many anecdotes have been published in illustration of this unhappy disposition , and we here give another , now printed for the first time , affording an insight into the character , both of the Emperor and his son Alexander II . Before permitting his son to make the tour of Europe , Nicholas wisely determined to give him a thorough acquaintance with his own country . The hereditary Grand Duke , therefore , traveled over Russia , visiting the principal cities and the different provinces of the interior . He daily reported his impressions and observations , to the Emperor . On his journey he reached Tobolsk , // the capital of Western Siberia . According to the prevailing custom , when a Russian Sovereign , or Prince of the blood , travels in the interior of the Empire , he alighted before the Cathedral , whexe he was met by the Bishops and Clergy , and introduced by theta into the Church . A Te Deum was sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the crowd , the Grand Duke observed a group of five persons , in the dress of common soldiers , whose features showed the remembrance of better days . On making inquiries , he was told that they had once been superior officers in the guards , and had been condemned to Siberia , for taking part in the insurrection of 1825 . One of them Baron Rosen , had nearly lost the use of his limbs . In writing his customary report to the Emperor , the Grand Duke described the incident , and urgently implored the forgiveness of the Exiles . " Allow me , father , to become the mediator between you , the offenders and the nation . " Nicholas received the letter with delight , as a proof of the benevolent disposition of his son . Still , he was unwilling to grant the pardon at once , but , distilled it , as it were , drop by drop . The condemned were sent to the army of the Caucasus , as common soldiers , but with the privilege of recovering their position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reinstated , first as off cers , then as noblemen , and finally resigning their posts in the army , returned home . Such as he was , Nicholas will not suffer by being contemplated with dispassionate judgment , at a historical distance . However eminent his reign , however admirable many of his personal characteristics , it must still he admitted that a certain incompetency often stamps his purposes and his actions . But on the whole , his existence was rich in endowments and experience , far transcending the common order of human life . His epoch , his contemporaries , and especially the Russian nation will long feel its effects , for good or evil . He simultaneously diffused light and darkness ; but light is perennial , and darkness dissolves and disappears in the abyss of Time .
