the Constitution as a system of imparted powers , and with a single eye to ascertain its real powers , and not with a view to find out how it might be evaded or violated , there will be found no complexity about it . The maxim that it is a system of imparted powers , and that all not imparted are reserved to the States or to the people , will always guide the honest inquirer after truth to a true interpretation of the legitimate powers of the federal government . The fact that the States are sovereign , and not provincial , is a conclusive argument that the general government is federal , and not national . Arguments to prove that the general government is federal* and not national , might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent ; but so often and so conclusively have they been iterated and reiterated , that it would be a work of supererogation to repeat them . If the government be federal , and of a clearly defined limited jurisdiction , it necessarily follows that the exercise of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressiOn upon the sovereign rights of the States or of the people , which ought most studiously to be avoided , as every aggression strengthens the aggressive and weakens the assaulted power , unless instantly repaired . So well aware of this were the framers of the Constitution , that , to avoid collision between the federal and State jurisdictions , and aggression upon the reserved rights and liberties of the people , the Constitution clearly defining the federal powers , was reduced to writing with peculiar caution . If the federal government , from its formation , had been administered within its legitimate jurisdiction , as prescribed by the Constitution , many of those collisions between federal and State jurisdiction , which have shaken our republican institutions to their very centre , and threatened th' inteo*rity of the Union , would have been avoided ; because the Constitution , having imparted to the federal government those powers only which were general in their character , and reserved those exclusively to the States which were local in their character , it is impossible that the operations of the federal government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with the jurisdiction of the States . Upon the minds of American statesmen and American citizens no lesson should be more deeply impressed than that to secure , protect , and perpetuate the American Union , her republican institutions , and the liberty of the people , neither the federal nor State governments , under the slightest pretext , should be permitted to exercise the powers belonging to the // 267 other ; and that every attempt of the federal government to exercise powers not clearly and directly imparted to it should be promptly resisted and decisively repelled . To wise , reflecting , and sagacious men we need not say , that aggression once tolerated will , in the end , become irresistible . The exercise of any deduced power , as primary , is dangerous , by any sort of agency , but particularly so in a government , which has no original , but merely derivative powers , and is , in substance , an agency . When once the work of interpolation has begun , it will not end until the whole Constitution is altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The statesman , who is engaged in the administration , and the citizen , who is watching over the operations of the government , should keep his eye , without the slightest intermission , upon the Constitution , and at every step inquire , first , Is the proposed measure clearly within the defined boundary of federal power ? and , second , Is it wise and expedient ? By such a course of administration by our statesmen , and such jealous and watchful vigilance by the people , the Union would be perpetual , our free institutions preserved , the rights and liberties of the people secured , and their prosperity and happiness promoted . The want of this strict adherence to the powers of the Constitution , and of this watchful vigilance on the part of the people , have been the cause of the many breaches of the Constitution , and usurpation of the State powers , that disgrace and disfigure our statute-book . In those countries where the government is absolute , and the people have no other duty than to obey , these excessive exercises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into these excesses* but in a government where the people are absolute , and the powers of the government limited by distinct boundaries , there is no apology for it . The constitutional government had run but a brief career , before the influences of ambition , cupidity , religious bigotry , and a selfish , domineering spirit , on the part of the North , began to display themselves in violations of the Constitution and aggressions upon the rights of the States and the libertie* of the people . They first broke out in the establishment of a national bank , and the enactment of those celebrated alien and sedition laws which aroused the indignant and withering r*ibuke of the distinguished republicans of that day . These were followed , in the progress of the government , by a second national bank , with increased means of corruption , the protective tariff laws , the internal improvement system , bankrupt // laws , and the various schemes for giving away , in a variety o* forms , the public lands . All these measures , adopted or proposed , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no warrant in the Constitution . All these measures , although by their combined action transferring from the South to the North , power , * commerce , and wealth , were borne with patriotic patience , until repealed by the justice of the country , and without having produced any serious prejudice to the Union . They , however , laid the foundation ofa series of measures , which were palpably without warrant from the letter or spirit of the Constitution , and which , if persisted in to consummation , will dissolve this Union , and lay the fair fabric of our liberty in ruins-an event which would consolidate the odious despotism of the old world , and establish it , in all the hideousness of its deformity , here . The measures to which we refer are the various enactments and attempted enactments against the slave States and the slaveholders of the slave States of the Union . That the subject of slavery , as it existed in a majority of the States at the formation of the Constitution , was placed , or was intended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is what no one , familiar with the history of the proceedings of the body which formed the Constitution , will pretend to deny . It would have been madness and folly in the slave States to have ratified the Constitution , had it been otherwise . That the federal government , by the Constitution , has any power to establish or abolish slavery in any of the States , or to forestall its adoption by any State that might thereafter seek admission into the Union , by a prohibitory act* is what no candid inquirer after truth can claim . That the slave States intended to impart to the federal government a power by which the institution of slavery might be crippled , restricted , , or destroyed , is what no sane or impartial man can K believe , afid what the history of the proceedings of the convention that framed the Constitution contradicts . There is no power in the federal goverumeilt , by the Constitution , to interfere with slavery in the States in any way , save for the reclamation of fugitives ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to have invested the federal government with any such power . While the convention was measuring out to the federal government , with so much jealousy and caution , its powers , it is very unreasonable that they should have conferred a power of such imminent peril to the slave States , over a subject so entirely domestic , without limitation // or restriction ; for if the federal government has power over the subject of slavery in the territories , it has it in the States , and may abolish it at pleasure . The idea that the federal government has any original power over the territories is at war with the theory of our system ; or that this power is deducible from the power of passing such laws as may be necessary for the regulation of the territories . A power which the convention refused to impart in express terms was scarcely intended to be imparted indirectly , or by remote and far-fetched deduction . The sages who framed the Constitution were too wise , too sagacious , too cautious and too jealous for that . Judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the determined purpose of the slave States to withhold from the federal government any jurisdiction over the institution of slavery , and to keep it , where the Constitution found it , under their own exclusive control , it can not be misunderstood that the Constitution would never have been adopted by the convention , or ratified by the people of the slave States , if any single particle of power over the institution of slavery had been lurking in any clause of that instrument ; and it is perfidious in the non-slaveholding States to attempt to exercise it by deduction , knowing , as they must , that it . was never intended to be imparted . Intention is the cardinal principle by which to test 11 compacts and statutes , and cotemporaneous exposition is the surest guide to that intention . By these rules we can not well misunderstand the powers of the federal government as to this subject . The compact of the Constitution , by which the federal Union was formed , is of higher and more sacred obligation than any legislative compact ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void , and of no binding obligation , and calculated to subject the Constitution to repeal , alteration , or amendment , by legislative enactment , which would ultimately subvert it . The first of that series of adopted and proposed measures which the Constitution did not authorize , and which invaded the rights of the slaveholding States , and of the citizens of the slaveholding States , and of the States which might apply for admission into the Union formed out of the territories , was the so-called Missouri restriction , established by act of Congress in 1820-21 . This restriction was , that , as a condition of the admission of Missouri into the Union as a slave State , slavery hould be for ever prohibited in all the then territory north of issouri , and of the latitude 3*0 30 ' from the western boundary // of Missouri , due west . This restriction was a violation of the Constitution , because Congress had no power to impose it ; of the rights of the States , because it imposed a condition of inequality upon the slaveholding States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the territories that the free States had of the citizens of the slaveholding States , because it abolished a species of property in the territories which they lawfully held , in case they emigrated with it to the territories ; and of the people of the territories , who , when they apply for admission , have the right of admission under the Constitution and the Louisiana treaty , upon terms of perfect equality with the original States , which can not be with this restriction upon them , not voluntarily imposed by themselves , but by federal authority , which deprived them of any choice . This restriction , which was continued in force until the me morable compromise of 1850-51 and its direct repeal in 1853 , has been followed up by a series of attempts to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia ; to prohibit slavery in all the territories , and to confine slavery , by impassable barriers , within its present limits , abolish the slave-trade between the slaveholding States , and by some to abolish it in the slaveholding States themselves , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressions upon the rights of the slaveholding States and their citizens , and calculated to alienate the South from the North by engendering a spirit of resentment and bitter hatred in the feelings of the Southern against the Northern people . The pertinacity and recklessness with which these measures have been pursued disclose the alarming fact , that the Constitution has neither moral nor legal force at the North , and that they are prepared to trample it under foot to accomplish the purpose of mad ambition , reckless fanaticism , and cold-hearted cupidity . To such an extremity have they pressed their madness and folly , that already we sensibly feel this magnificent and glorious Union shaking to its very foundation-an event which , ifconsununated , will cast shadows ofgloom over the brightest prospects of the fri*nds of freedom throughout the world . Slavery being sectional , every contest about it must be sectional , and we now se* the North putting forth all her energies , and preparing all her means , to make her aggression upon the South successful ; a success which , if accomplished , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sectional excitement risen , that the fugitive-slave law , passed by the express requisition of the Constitution , has been resisted , nullified , and defied ; and // the demand now is that it be repealed , and that the slave , whether abducted , a runaway , or stolen , is to be sheltered and protected by the Northern States ; and if the owner pursue him , he is to be insulted , fined , imprisoned , or assassinated . By the compact of the Constitution the free States undertook , and in good faith were bound to restore fugitive slaves ; this they failed to do ; and now that the federal government has undertaken , through its own officers , to perform this obligation , its authority is not only resisted , but nullified and openly defied ; and the life and liberty of the Southern master jeoparded if he dare pursue his rights . That such a course of things would necessarily throw the South upon defensive measures , and engender feelings of the strongest resentment and bitterest hatred , none could be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude imposed upon the South by these demonstrations , and the sectional strife which they necessarily produce , would end in the formation of sectional parties , and that sectional partyism will precipitate the dissolution of the Union , and the overthrow of the free institutions of the country , all must see and know . But with this all-absorbing and exciting question of slavery , in itself sufficient to produce the most disastrous results , and which now so fiercely , and with such threatening aspect , agitates this Union from centre to circumference , are combined those fierce and fiery elements , proscription for religious opinion , and the disfranchisement of our adopted citizens , and an inhibition to the immigration of foreigners-measures , if adopted , at war with the very genius of our institutions , subversive of every principle of human liberty , and palpably violative of the Constitutional guarantees against religious tests . These two elements have been artfully combined with the slavery question to give color and strength to it . If the Constitution and the Union can withstand the earthquake shocks of these powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the South , they are stronger than we had taken them to be , and the Southern people tamer under insult and injury than we supposed . These engines of disorganization and disunion are all now battering against the Union and the free institutions of the country , and have all been put into action by the North . Their authors-masters of their work-knew well what passions of the human heart to play upon , in order to accomplish their scheme of ambition , disunion , and ruin . With slavery as a domestic institution , no State has any thing to do beyond its own borders , and the federal government was // not permitted , and was not intended to be permitted , by the Constitution , to have any jurisdiction over it . Every attempt , therefore , of a State , beyond its own boundary , or of the federal government anywhere , to legislate upon the subject of slavery , is an aggression upon the rights of the people , whether of a State or territory , where the interference is attempted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another State or territory is an act of war ; and every interference by the federal governn*ient , a wanton and inexcusable usurpation of power , which would well justify the slave States in dissolving the compact of union , and resuming their entire original sovereignty . If the Puritans of the North in by-gone days had been so conscientiously sensitive upon the subject of slavery as they now pretend to be , their ships , their ships ' crews , and their slave-dealers might have avoided the present sectional controversy , by staying their rapacious plunder of the African race , and transporting them to these shores . They would not have protracted the slave-trade for twenty years after the adoption of the Constitution . This protraction of the slave-trade was procured by the vote of South-Carolina and Georgia and the five New-England States in the convention , all the Middle States and Virginia and North-Carolina voting against it . The moral and religious sentiment of the North seems to be graduated by the scale of pecuniary profit and loss , as that may rise or fall . They established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their adventurous speculators and traders and their navigation ; but as soon as the trade ceased , and with it this source of profit , they denounce , execrate , and seek to extirpate it , by the most sudden and violent means , and utterly regardless of the ruin and desolation which it will bring upon those among whom they established it . As a political system the federal government has no jurisdiction over slavery ; as a moral or religious system it has nothing to do with it . As a domestic institution , the States in which it does not exist have no jurisdiction over it where it does exist . As a moral or religious institution , the free States have no moral or religious responsibility for it . If they believe it a great moral evil , as they pretend to do , there is but one way to correct it , and that is by the force of reason and the power of truth . This is God 's mode of correcting religious error or moral evil . When they attempt to correct this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " by force and violence , they make of themselves ruthless Goths and unprincipled Vandals . When they claim the " higher law " authority // to do these things , they profane Almighty God and his holy religion , and perjure their souls . Often , often has it been in the progress of the world 's history , that the progress of religion and high morality has been obstructed and retarded by such violent aggressions-it will be so again . For these professed Christians and philanthropists , who , to achieve temporal freedom for the negro race in our country , would sacrifice the lives and hurl into eternal perdition the souls of double the number of their own race , we have no other feelings than those of abhorrence and contempt . Notwithstanding the want of jurisdiction over the subject of slavery in the federal government , the obtrusiveness of the action of any State upon the subject out of its own limits , and the solemn pledge by the constitution of every State in the Union to restore fugitive slaves escaping from one State into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions upon the territories , but she has been vexed , insulted , harassed , annoyed , and endangered , from the very beginning of the government , by associations , petitions , legislative resolutions , pulpit incendiarism , and every means which hellish malice could invent to destroy this institution now so necessary to her , and which she could not safely abrogate if she would ; and now the whole North seems to be marshalling all its disorganizing and revolutionary strength to prostrate this institution , and with it every vestige of Southern independence and Southern power and prosperity . ilitherto the South , from ardent attachment to the Union , and an unwillingness to destroy* that bright prospect of power , wealth , prosperity , and . happiness which its perpetuity has in store for our people , has receded from and borne these aggressions ; but she recedes no farther . She has planted herself upon the Constitution , and there she will stand at all hazards , and to the last extremity , ) or fall beneath its ruins . The question is now with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be perpetual . Whatever may be the choice , however disastrous the result , the North takes the responsibility . The Northern people not content with positive aggressions upon the constitutional rights of the South and her people so repeatedly inflicted and attempted , refuse obedience to , and in some States have nullified the laws of that very government , passed for the protection of slave-owners , the usurped power of which , they are attempting to use against the South . The fugitive-slave law of 1793 , making it the duty of the States to return fugitive slaves to their rightful owners , // the Northern States refused to execute . The fugitive-slave law of 1850-51 , made necessary by that refusal , and part of that compromise of which they prate so vehemently , they not only resist , but nullify . This is not all-they protect not only the fugitive , but his abductor ; and murder and imprison the owner who dares to reclaim his property ; and this , too , by a people who talk grandiloquently about the " faith " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the South might reasonably expect justice , seems affected also with this disorganizing mania , and declares the fugitive slave law unconstitutional , although declared constitutional by the Supreme Court and their most eminent statesmen , and refuses to punish those who violate it . To all these injuries , insults , aggressions , and grievances , the South is expected quietly and tamely to submit , until every vestige of her constitutional rights are torn away . Awfully lamentable is the mis-take ! Had not the Southern States supposed that , by the federal constitution , every avenue of attack upon slavery , in every form , had been barricaded and protected , the federal constitution had never been formed . Had the South , in the slightest degree suspected that after she had stripped herself of some of the most effective attributes of State sovereignty and imparted them to the federal government , that her Northern sisters would have turned these very powers upon her reserved rights to destroy them , the Constitution would never have been adopted . The attempt is perfidious and faithless , and the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the federal government for their protection . She must look to her own resources and her own strong arm for the protection of her rights and the vindication of her honor . She can no longer be deluded by the hackneyed cry of " the Union , " when she receives from that Union nothing but aggression , insult , injury , and oppression as the rewards of her fidelity . To such an extremity has this spirit of aggression upon the South been pressed by the North , that a Southern slave-owner can not pass with his servant through a free State , without being insulted and assaulted and his slave " rescued " from him . This is not onl a violation of the constitutional rights of the slaveowner as a citizen of the United States , but a denial of the common civilities of civilized society and neighborhood . This kind of outrage , so repeatedly perpetrated , must lead the South to retaliating measures which will finally cut off all intercommunication , social , civil , and commercial , between // the South and the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter the hatred , that reconciliation will be impossible . In the whole progress of the federal government , the South has committed no aggression upon , or invaded any right of the North . She has asked nothing-she has sought nothing but protection to her rights and tbe equality of the Constitution . Her intercourse with the North , social and commercial , has been fair , liberal , fraternal , and just , and to the Union she has been faithful and devoted , in peace and in war-all this , while aggression , insult , and injury have been heaped upon her by the North , in the utmost profusion . The pretext for the excitement and agitation at the North , which is so threatening to the rights of the South and the perpetuity of the Union , are the repeal of the Missouri restriction and the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill , in neither of which is to be found the slightest apology for it . The Missouri restriction , so called , was simply this  --  a prohibition to the States thereafter to be formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north parallel of latitude , as a condition of the admission of the State of Missouri into the Union without a slaveryprohibition clause in her constitution  --  a restriction not imposed upon the State of Missouri , but upon the people of the territories and the States thereafter to be formed , over which the State of Missouri had no earthly power or one scintilla of jurisdiction . To state the case is to condemn it as unconstitutional , unjust , and iniquitous . The repeal of this restriction did no more than leave the people of the territories , when they formed themselves into States , and sought admission into the Union , to determine the question of slavery for themselves , as every other State in the Union did and had the right to do : not only by the Constitution but by the Louisiana treaty . If the new States could be thus forestalled upon this question , by federal authority , how could they come into the Union upon terms of equality with the original States ? This question , the most able , the most learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , and never can satisfactorily answer . So ably , and so conclusively was this position sustained , in the debate upon the Kansas-Nebraska bill in Congress , by both Northern and Southern statesmen , that it would be idle for us to enlarge upon it . The Missouri restriction has been called by the ecclesiastical incendiaries and political demagogues of the North , engaged in the very holy and very patriotic work of hunting down the South , " a compromise , " and its repeal " perfidious " and " faithless . " The charge is false , and those who // make it , know it to be false , if they understand the Constitution of their country , and interpret it with reasonable fairness . Who authorized Congress , or any portion of it , to compromise away the constitutional rights of either the existing or forthcoming States ? The restriction itself was a violation of the great and paramount compromise of the Constitution , and was itself " perfidious " and " faithless . " It was tyrannically imposed by a Northern majority , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than dissolve the Union ; such was their appreciation of its great value and their attachment to it . But , if it had been voted for by every Northern and Southern representative in both Houses of Congress , the case would not be altered , because it imposed restrictions upon States not yet formed , invaded that right to determine the question of slavery for themselves , secured to them by the Constitution ; and placed their rights upon a footing of inequality with the existing States . If these views be sound , then justice , equality , and a violated Constitution demanded a repeal of the Missouri restrictiou and a reYnstatement of the Constitution as it was . The Kansas-Nebraska bill in every other respect is like all other territorial bills . ( That the North never did regard the Missouri restriction as a final compromise of the slavery question is disproved by their whole course in relation to it , in and out of Congress . N* State , that did not come with a slavery prohibition clause in her constitution , was ever admitted without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the territories , of which there were many , was in violation of this pretended compromise . In their political associations and State legislative resolutions this idea has been constantly repudiated , and on the floor of Congress , their representatives , many of them , have denied it over and over again . It should be enough for statesmen and patriots to know that it violated the Constitution to insure its repeal . No free people should , or can safely tolerate a violation of the Constitution , in the least particular ; if they do , the Constitution becomes impotent and worthless . Already the Constitution is greatly weakened by the frequent and violent assaults made upon it from this quarter , and the legislative interpolations incorporated into it . At th' North , with mad fanaticism and unscrupulous ambition , the Constitution is powerless . The people of the slave States would certainly be highly gratified if their brethren of the free States entertained more just and more charitable opinions of slavery and slaveholders , as they exist in the South , than they profess to // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a moral or religious question , we neither complain nor desire to dissolve our political relations with them , however unjust and uncharitabe we may feel those opinions to be . With their abstract opinions upon the subject of slavery , the people of the slave States have nothing to do ; all they ask of them is , to let it alone-to leave the subject of slavery where the Constitution placed it , and not to invade their rights of property , cut off their equality of privilege , and endanger their lives and those of their wives and children , by their officious intermeddling with it . This they have to do , or disunion , with all its lamentable consequences , must ensue . Upon this subject of slavery in all its aspects , the South has determined her course , come what may . She demands her rights , and those of her citizens , and from that position she will never recede . As much as she values the Union , and as heavy as are the sacrifices which she has made , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflexibly determined to concede nothing on this point . It is for the North , then , to solve the momentous question , whether the Union shall be preserved by ceasing her systematic aggressions , her contiunous insults , and her incendiary attempts , and by according to the South those rights guaranteed to her by the Constitution . Upon the solution of this question , by the North , hang the most important and interesting results , hangs the destiny of this nation for weal or for woe . If she determines to adhere to the Constitution and preserve the Union , the greatest , the most magnificent and beneficent empire which the sun ever shone upon , or the imagination of man ever conceived awaits our progress ; an empire replete with power , prosperity , and happiness , unequalled in the annals of time . If they determine to break it to pieces , they will produce an Iliad of woes and disasters which the heart of the patriot and the philanthropist sickens to contemplate . It will solve in the negative , the great question , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gloom of despotism the freedom of our people . On the great convulsive and bloody struggle which it will produce we shall not stop to speculate . Whether the North or the South will be the conqueror , they will both be vanquished . In the conflict , liberty , power , free institutions , p prosperity , and happiness will all be struck down and each State will become the province of some foreign conqueror or ambitious tyrant . When in the conflict , hundreds and thousands of our citizens shall have been slain , our resources exhausted , our towns burned , and our fields devastated , neither side will have accom // pushed any thing for its power , its liberty , its wealth , its hap. piness , or its prosperity , and even then , slavery will not have been abolished . That scheme which is to abolish slavery , if ever it is abolished , must be devised by the wisdom of God , and accomplished by the power of his will . There is no Moses in the North , commissioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bondage . To Northern statesmen and patriots-men who justly appreciate the value of free institutions and the Union , and who desire to transmit them unbroken , unimpaired , and in full vigor to posterity , we would say , nay entreat , to pause and reflect , before they permit the fanatics , the traitors , and madmen in their midst , to bring about this sad catastrophe , this most melancholy of all the direful calamities that ever afflicted humanity . To break down the Union will be easy , but to reconstruct it will be impossible . If there is not public virtue , intelligence , love of country , a sufficient harmony of interest , and fraternity of feeling to keep the Union together , there will not be enough to reconstruct it , if once broken down . A mutual want of confidence in each other , by the two sections , and a burning hatred , would prevent it . Let the conservatives of the North , we care not what may r be their party names , take up the Constitution and calmly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and determine from thence , and not from the howlings of fanatics , the teachings of ecclesiastical hypocrites , the slang of demagogues , or the perversions of unscrupulous aspirants , whether in this angry and threatening controversy , now entirely sectional , the North is not in the wrong . Let them contemplate what this Union cost , what it is , and what it may be , in power , in freedom , in prosperity , and in happiness , if it be preserved , and what of wretchedness , misery , weakness , and calamity it will produce if dissolved , and then determine whether the chances of abolishing slavery are more valuable even to them , than the perpetuity of the Union . It is an awful question , and awful are the consequences hanging upon its solution . Hitherto the Union has increased in wealth , power , happiness , greatness , and freedom , notwithstanding the evils of slavery . Why will it not continue to do so ? We make no appeal to fanatics , madmen , or demagogues ; we would treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiger : we appeal to the friends of human liberty and free institutions  --  to patriots , to sages , and to statesmen , those who know and feel , that the same harmony of interest , concord of feeling , and mutual concessions which produced the Constitution are essentially necessary to preserve it ; those who know // and feel that one section of the Union can not tyrannize over the other with safety . The American people ought to know that , by the perpetuity of the Union , American principles , free institutions , and human liberty will predominate over this entire continent , but that its dissolution will be to lay the foundation of that despotism and tyranny under which the people of Europe now groan so heavily . The spirit of religious intolerance , proscription , and persecution which has been recently gotten up in the United States , and which constitutes a prominent feature in the creed of the new so-called " American party , " formed out of the discontented . factions and fragments of old parties , is not , of itself dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its very exciting , and vindictive and tyrannous character , dangerous to liberty and free institutions themselves . It is the beginning of that unholy connection between Church and State which so long cursed and blighted Europe , and which can not fail to corrupt the Church , overthrow free institutions , and establish the domination of a tyrannical and unprincipled priesthood , one as odious as political popedom itself It strikes from our social and political edifice one of the fundamental principles of liberty , the ) freedom of conscience . We have no idea of elaborating an argument to prove , what every man in this community ought to know and must know , that God is the author of our religion , and that to him alone is every human being responsible for his religious opinions and conduct ; and that every attempt by government or secret organization to control those opinions by disfranchisement , proscription , or penalties , is a daring attempt to assume a power which belongs to God alone , and is the very essence of tyranny . This excitement , so artfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is calculated to do great mischief and precipitate a catastrophe already sufficiently near at hand ; one which may deluge our plains with the blood of brethren , shed by the hands of brethren , by adding fuel to the already burning flame . One of the most melancholy exhibitions in this furor against Roman Catholics is , that it is stimulated and led on by many who , professing to be the ministers of the meek and lowly Saviour , are but the emissaries of hell , and doing most successfully the works of the devil . They pro-* fess to be promoting the cause of religion , by exciting sectional hatred , persecution , disorganization , treason , and revolution . What heaven-daring impudence ! This new-born zeal against foreigners ; their proscription and disfranchisement ; this buried hobgoblin of the Adams administration and the Hartford Convention ; this great flourish that // " Americans must govern America , " is another exciting element , artfully thrown into this already boiling cauldron , to unite with the anti-slavery factions those who could not be attached to them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prominent article in the creed of this " American ( piebald ) party , " and which has been most successfully used in aid of the various classes of abolitionists , and that too by Southern men . Will not the reader be singularly struck with the insincerity and depravity of this attempt , when they look into the governments of the Union , and of each State , and find , whether in the cxc cutive , legislative , or judicial departments , none but Americans , native-born too , govern America , and that a foreign-born citizen has scarcely ever filled any of them , and fewer now than ever ? But this is an exciting subject , gotten up by the secret friends of abolitionism to aid the cause of open abolitionism and treason . This formidable combination of traitors , factionists , and disunionists , who have seized the all-exciting and alldangerous weapons of anti-slavery , religious persecution , and prejudice against foreigners , as the weapons of their warfare to dissolve the Union , overthrow our free institutions , and establish the reign of brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , woeful will be the consequences : the reign of terror in France was mildness , calmness , and mercy to what this will be . We have thus thrown out these views , not to the demagogue , not to the factionist , not to the traitor , not to the canting , hypocritical , incendiary priest , but to the American statesman and patriot ; he who loves the Union , her free institutions , and the rights of man , to invoke them , if they can be invoked , to lay aside for a time their party differences and party prejudices , and , by a united and vigorous assault upon these disorganizers , factionists , and traitors , save the Union , liberty , and our free institutions from their unholy , tyrannical , and despotic grasp ; from that ruin which no human power or wisdom can retrieve , if success attend this incendiary combination . Our work i8 done , our labor is performed , and , in conclusion , we most humbly and sincerely pray that the storm , which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averted , and that this Union , freighted with our own and the world 's liberty , may be preserved and perpetuated , in all the fullness and expanse of its beneficence , and that , like the dews of heaven , its blessings may descend equally and copiously upon all , without distinction of North , South , East or West , and that it may not be dissolved until the lapse of time shall dissolve and destroy all animate and inanimate nature . *iwh1*urg , Va* J. G. // 1*EVOLUTION AND REACTION . TUE French Revolution of the last century resulted in Na* poleon the Great . The French Revolution of yesterday has given us " Napoleon le Petit , " and a parody of the Empire . The first revolution , like Saturn , devoured its own offspring . The last defeated demigods with puppets , and swallowed up revolution in reijetion . The pigmies have defeated the giants . Barbaric unity has crushed , in detail , divided civilization . France and Germany have accepted , with apparent willingness , monarchical proscription in the pktce of republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of " repression . " The ancient " status " is resumed . The melancholy tragedy of imperial butchery , and the divine right of kings.to govern wrong , " mounted , " with renewed and added splendor upon the Continental . stage . The rascal rabble ; the plebeians ; " the stubborn people whose unawed rebellions " threatened , for a little , to reduce kings to cobblers , and diplomatic shams to shadows of forgotten things , have sunk quietly enough back into the old fashion of suffering and non-resistance . They seem to obey the precept literally , and turn both checks to the smiter . Reaction rules supreme . Will it continue to rule ? Is its rule stable ? Is it victory a fact or a phantasm ? Are kings divinely appointed ? Has God abandoned the earth to injustice , and sold the Many for ever to the Few ? These are the questions put by Revolution , and answered by Reaction , haughtily and bitterly after its own nature . But we Americans believe in God and in Republicanism . We believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and a gospel of equality . We believe the mission upon which it is sent to be prc*minently democratic ; and " let God be true , but every man a liar .
