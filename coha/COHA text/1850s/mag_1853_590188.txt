BRITISH POLITICAL ECONOMY . THE vast debt , and consequent additional burdens imposed on the people of England , have given birth to a system of Political Economy exclusively adapted to her present condition . Finding a great and incurable evil on their hands , the Political Economists have exercised all their talents and ingenuity to persuade the good people of that country , and the world at large , that this enormous debt , and these overwhelming burdens , are the great sources of the wealth , prosperity , and power of England . For this purpose , they only exhibit one side of the picture , and but a small portion of that . They 4op where they ought to begin , with effects on the condition of the people , and their individual prosperity . They consider it simply as a question of dollars and cents applicable to the revenues of the state , without following it out to its ultimate consequences with respect to the morals and happiness of the nation at large . The precepts and example of that country operate with dcctric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their statesmen , who , for the most part , refer to them in lieu of all argument . If they can quote Engish precedents , the matter *s settled , and there is nothing more to be said on the subject . Now , though we are not disposed to deny that nations may learn much from each other that is good , it is equally certain they may learn much that is bad , and we greatly doubt the wisdom or the policy of borrowing the maxims and practice of old decayed and corrupt monarchies for the government of young and vigorous republics . It is too much like administering the stimulants , necessary to revive the waning energies of old age , to a young patient whose constitution is unimpaired and his health perfect . Precedents are dangerous weapons to handle , for there a great many more bad than good ones ; and in the whole history of the world , there is not a single example of two nations being placed in a situation precisely and in all respects the same . For these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers a brief analysis of the British system of Political Economy , which is becoming the pole-star of that of the United States ; and for this purpose shall proceed to quote passages from the creed of a writer who stands // high among his contemporaries , and who is one of the most strenuous advocates of the system adopted by the British Government . We refer to this authority for another special reason . The work whence we quote the doctrines on which it is our intention to animadvert , has been republished and extensively circulated in the United States , and the title-page announces that it has been " adapted to the present condition of the country and the wants of its citizens , " by a late president of the University of Vermont . Of the merits of this work as containing a vast mass of useful and accurate information , ave desire to speak with the highest respect . It is only to the Principles of Political Economy embodied i1 the article " British Empire , " that we take exception . In stating the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England for the payment of interest and the support of government , the writer proceeds to say : " These additional burdens , which to a superficial observer mIght appear to be a heavy drawback on our exertions , have really been the means of adding to their efficiency . Had they been oppressive , their operation would have been , no doubt , very different ; but it was seen that they might be met by increased exertions , and these have been made . They have , in fact , operated on the public like an increase in the necessary expenses of his family , or a private individual , and occasioned efforts of industry , economy and invention , that more than counterbalanced their influence , and which we should have in vain attempted to produce by less powerful means . " * Regarding this passage as containing nearly all th at can be said in favor of a great national debt , and heavy national burdens , and believing such doctrines of most pernicious tendency in the United States , we shall endeavor to l ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of common sense and experience as applicable to the general affairs of mankind . The most revered maxims of our forefathers have been jostled aside by new dogmas of what is called political science ; and by an ingenious perversion of common sense and experience , that very system of borrowing which would inevitably end in the ruin of an individual , is converted into the great constituent of national prosperity . Previously , however , to entering on an analysis of the preceding extract , we shall take occasion to make a few remarks on a very fashionable science which seems to involve all the mysteries of modern governeminent . We allude to Political Economy , which has been invested with the honors of a science , although few of its professors agree in its principles , and still fewer in their practical application . * McCullocli 's Geographical Dictionary . Art . Britieli Empire . // Political Economy and statistics are the two great crutches on which modern statesmen hobble along in their l*borious vocation . If they can only talk glibly about productive labor , supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler principles which mankind have been practically exemplifying without knowing it , ever since they had any social intercourse with each other , they imagine themselves qualified to govern th' world . Government is , with them , the science of arithmetic applied on a great scale , and statistical tables constitute the political decalogue . It is not whether all men are born free and equal , but to tax them all equally ; and the grand desideratum is not to confer on them as much happiness , but to get as much labor and money from the people as possible . With a statistical table and the five rules of arithmetic , every pains-taking politician becomes a profound statesman , provided he can add up a column of figures , and subtract two from four . Cocker 's arithmetic is worth to them a dozen Lockes and Calhouns , and the universal cant is , that figures never lie , although they are perpetually leading to false conclusions when made the sole basis of our reasonings . If by consulting an official report , or statistical table , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high or low duties , revenues , tonnage , and commerce increased or diminished , he at once makes one the direct result of the other , though nine times in ten the real cause will be found in some great dispensation of Providence over which legislation has no control . Men fancy themselves competent to govern great nations because they have learned from Political Economy those simple and obvious truths which before the advent of that so-called science , were never thought necessary to be embodied in books , because they were already sufficiently obvious to the common sense and experience of mankind . These had long since taught them their invariable application to the ordinary affairs of life , which furnish the basis of all that is true in Political Economy . Every laboring man , however ignorant , knows that his industry constitutes the source of his gains ; that what he can save contributes to his wealth ; that labor can procure him food , raiment , and lodging ; that labor , which brings in no profit , is unproductive ; that the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his own labor is the source of his private means , so the combined labor of a whole people constitutes the wealth of a nation. * Little does the honest See Elementary Leeturei on Political Economy . // laborer , plodding in his daily round , dream that he is working out problems for Political Economists , and laying . the fonudations of an abstruse science ; or that the most acute and profound genius that ever existed , could never have discovered in his closet what the most unlettered peasant learns in his fields . The happiness of the people has been lost sight of as the great end of government , in the more interesting inquiry as to the most infallible means of increasing the public revenues , the amount of which is now the sole criterion of national prosperity . A great public income is estimated solely b* the standard of dollars and cents . The statesman instead of reasoning begins to cipher ; and if it can be found by this new system of logic that government will derive a profit by its adoption , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity and permanency of our republican institutions , or its effects on the morals , manners , and habits of the people on which those institutions mainly depend , is placed entirely out of view , or only urged by some old-fashioned pedant a hundred years behind the spirit of the age . If *ou.can only fasten this imputation on him , it finishes him at once , for the artful application of a cant phrase is better than all the arguments in the world . It has been deqided by unquestionable authority , that the present age travels faster and gets the news quicker than all that preceded it , consequently is far in advance of them ; and that the human mind never goes backward , though there are scores of examples of nations having declined from their ancient preeminence , and from the height of civilization , science , and knowledge , fall en into the depths of ignorance and barbarism . The truth is , that though the world may not go backwaiAs , it is perpetually moving in a circle , and ever and anon comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our subject . Next to the inquiry as to the number of two-legged beasts of burden , our economical statesman proceeds to matters cqually important to the exercise of his functions . The number of horses , oxen , cows , sheep , donkeys , swine , hens , ducks , geese , and goslings ; the quantity of corn , oats , buckwheat , potatoes , hay , cotton , hemp , flax , cheese , bacon , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c. ; and when he has got all this before him in a well-arranged table , he is fully competent to make all sorts of laws , recoinmen ( l all sorts of measures , meddle with every man 's private business , govern the nation according to Cocker 's arithmetic , and take his stand among the " Heaven-born Statesmen . " Every crude mass of naked facts having only a mere acci // dental connection as to time ; every long-drawn wiry inference that can be forcibly enlisted in support of * theory , and every idle vagary of a stultified brain , is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dictates of reason , all the conclusions of experience , and all the established laws of matter and mind . Even witchcraft has revived again under the hallowed names of the " Science of Mesmerism , " and " Spiritual Knockings . " At the hazard of being denounced as " outer barbarians , " we will confess ourselves greatly inclined to doubt the infallibilitv of Political Economy as a political creed or a political teacher , most especially as we have invariably observed that though governments may prosper accordingly under its fostering influence , the people are always the worse off , the more the great dogmas of this science are brought to bear on them . The truth is , that the welfare of mankind never depends on scientific principles or abstract propositions . The basis of national happiness is freedom , the highest of all sublunary blessings , because it can neither be acquired or procured but by a people well grounded in the practice and principle of reason and justice . The United States would be just what they are , had there never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness , instead of being accelerated , will only be continually embarrassed and retarded by the adoption of principles only applicable , if applicable at all , to nations whose position is entirely different from theirs . They are in the hey-day of life ; they are growing and expanding under an inflexible law of nature ; advancing with steps as sure as those from youth to manhood ; and require no political doctors to do what , if left alone , the people will themselves perform . Every attempt to accelerate their progress by artificial excitements , will only embarrass their career , just as too high a wind buries the bow of the vessel in the waves , and either diminishes her speed , or throws her up in the wind 's eye . Political Economy , as now applied to the affairs of nations , has , we can not help thinking , had a very injurious effect on the general welfare of Europe and America . It has furnished governments with a plausible pretext for meddling with the proper business of individuals , directing their private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adroitly to get as much of its fruits as possible . It has seduced them into fostering one branch of industry in preference to another , which can not be done without injustice to all the rest ; and , in short , // drawn them from the exercise of their proper fi*nctions-the equal protection of person and property . Nothing is now left to that easy and harmonious adjustment of the general affairs of the world , which is invariably prodnced by acquiescing in the decrees of Nature and Providence , which keeps the Universe in harmony , and if not contracted by the short-sighted presumption of man , will quietly do their work without the interference of legislation . They never wait till the fruit is ripened by the sun , but resort to the forcing system , and imagine they have wrought a miracle in producing a sickly plant , which if left to itself would a little later have grown to a vigorous maturity . Nothing permanently good can ever arise from such a system applied to the affairs of nations , and nothing but evil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great universal causes that constitute the instruments of providence in governing the Universe . The balance of the conflicting interests of different communities or classes is too delicate for the hands of mortal man , and should be left to Him who sees all things , knows all things , and can do all things much more effectually than the Political Economist or the " Heaven-born 8tatesman " Legislativ* interference is now substituted for individual exertion ; and when the good people of England begin to feel the pressure of any of those reactions and revulsions which are the invariable results of a complicated system of legislative expedients , instead of depending on themselves to get the cart out of the mire , they call on Hercules oovernments to come to their relief . The landlord , the tenant , the merchant , the manufacturer , the peasant and the pauper , all equally look up to Parliament for succor , and instead of bracing themselves manfully to meet the exigency , meanly solicit alms from their rulers . Tn this way modern scientific government has degen* crated into a vexatious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even in the United State* , which are always following where they ought to lead , and imitating where they should set the example , the people are in a fair way of becoming as much fettered by laws of their own making , as other nations . are by the capricious will of a despotic tyrant . If they do n't take care , the public welfare will swallow up that of individuals . The British government , under the specious disguise of Political Economy , has become a cumbrous , unwieldy , complicated machine , laden with all sorts of legislative trumpery , rolling along like the car of Juggernaut , and crushing everybody in // its way . Statesmen , like quacks , are **25;483;TOOLONG some infallible specific for some real or imaginary disease , and communities are the patients on whom they try their experiments . The Body Politic is first brought to death 's door by one patent medicii*e , then raised by some temporary galvanic excitement , until finally it ceases to rely on healthful exercise or wholesome exertion , and seeks a remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation . The universal necessity of individual exertion , the laws of Nature and of Divine Providence , which , after all , shape the destinies of men , are placed in abeyance before the consummate wisdom of legislators , who seem to have forgotten that though man may pull the oar the pilot sits aloft . England is the Paradise of Political Economy , and the infallible oracle of American Statesmen . It is there that its principles have been most practically applied , and its effects most brilliantly illustrated in a splendid government , and an impoverished people ; a bloated system of outward prosperity and inward decay , forming altogether a combinati6n of inextricable difficulties which baffle even the omnipotence of Parliament aided by the omniscience of the Political Economists . Having indulged ourselves in these preliminary okservations , we will now proceed more methodically . The author of the Geographical Dictionary does not stand alone in ascribing the glory and prosperity of England to her eight hundred millions sterling of debt , and her fifty millions of taxes . lie belongs to a school of Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few in the United States . It is therefore but fair that those who differ from them should give their reasons for so doing , and we shall now proceed with the performance of that courtesy . The assertion of this acute and laborious writer-for such he is beyond question-that the burdens entailed on the people of England have stimulated them to additional exertions of industry , economy and invention , is unquestionably true as to the fact ; and if we stop here , it follows that as industry and economy are great virtues , and invention a most useful faculty , the national debt and taxes have been highly advantageous to England . But it seems proper to probe the subject somewhat deeper in order to see how far this industry , economy and invention may be carried without sacrificing the people to the welfare of the government , by obliging them to work incessantly without relaxation , reducing them to the necessity of foregoing the most ordinary comforts of life , and // stimulating their inventive powers to the production of machinery whose inevitable operation is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the mere benefits the government may have derived from these additional exertions of industry , economy and invention , is the important part of the question to be considered . Some of our readers may suppose the people and the government one and indivisible , and their interests inseperable . But this is not the case , at least in England . Political Economy , or some other powerful agent , has converted them into separate , if not opposite interests , and the interest of both is to prey on each other . Government first robs the people of the means of helping themselves , and they naturally call on government to keep them in turn . Let us first consider the case of the individual cited by the author whose words we have quoted , " who finding the necessary expenses of his family suddenly increased , makes corresponding efforts to meet them , " premising , however , that nothing leads to greater fallacies in than confounding nations with individuals , and making them synonymous . It may be illustration , but it is not argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common case ; but the question is whether it is conducive to this same individual 's happiness to be thus suddenly celled on to practice new lessons of industry , economy and invention . So far from this , we confidently believe there is not one among our readers who will assent to the proposition . All know , and feel , that to labor hard and practice perpetual abstinence , requires a succession of painful efforts and sacrifices ; and that when labor and economy are carried to the extent of exhaustion on one hand and extreme privation on the other , life becomes rather a burden than a blessing . Such is the case when men labor for the support of themselves and their families , and receive the full benefit of their exertions . But it is still worse when the government comes in and takes a considerable portion to itself . In the former case , he gets something palpable ; something that directly administers to his wants and desires , in return for his labors ; in the latter he receives nothing that contributes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel , or taste ; and the only equivalent is in laws he perhaps deems oppressive , in the protection of property of which he has none , or in the glory of his country to which he contributes his full share , but in the division of which his portion isexceedingly small . Supporting oneself and family is very different from supporting the State , most especially when one Interferes with the other . In one , the // **e1fish , in the other , the social principle governs ; and , with rare exceptions , the former is by far the most powerful . Men can not feed on the glory of their country , and no government has a right to sacrifice their happiness at its shrine , except in cases in which their own welfare , and that of their posterity , is at stake , and the State in imminent danger . The case cited by Mr. MeCulloch is not in point , and does not sustain his position . Let us now proceed to consider his general proposition , that the national debt and consequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling for new *xertions of industry , economy and invention on the part of the l ) eople . This involves the inquiry whether it is not possible to have too much of a good thing . That a reasonable portion of industry-by which , we mean that which allows of occasional relaxation and amusement ; which invigorates the physical powers without crushing the mpral and intellectual faculties under its weight-is highly conducive to human happiness , not only by supplying our wants , but as a preventive from the temptations of idleness , no one , it is presumed , will deny . But when the necessities of men compel them , in order to support themselves , their wives and families , or worst of all , when the exactions of the government produce this result ; when they are compelled as the only refuge from cold , hunger and destitution of every kind , to " work and freeze , work and starve , work and die working " - as an English writer expresses it  --  and when this incessant toil is entailed on them from generation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no blessing . Instead of being its own reward , it is its own curse . It brings with it physical , moral and intellectual degradation ; it severs the ties of nature and kindred ; and it drives men , women , even children , by droves to the gin-shops to seek a temporary oblivion or a momentary excitement in sensuality and drunkenness . In illustration of this position , we quote the following passage from a very able and eloquent British writer on the condition of the laboring classes in England. * It is an answer to a benevolent philanthropist who was lecturing the poor men for indulging in gin-drinking . Sir , " said a Spitalfields weaver to his friendly adviser , " all you say is true . The more gin we drink , the more we want ; but the less gin we drink , the more we feel the want of something else . Gin is bread , meat , beer , and fire ; then we should feel worse without gin . I am not begging ; we are all ready * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I work , God knows , morning , noon , and nightwork ; work , work , we have plenty of that . Ii* we did not work , we should starve . But what does our work bring ? Work and hunger , work and cold , work and sorrow . I get fourteen shillings a week , out of which there is rent to paywe ca n't lie in the street  --  and clothes to find , for we must be covered . What remains for fire and food among six of usfour children , their mother , and me ? Enough to starve upon , that is all . The children cry for bread ; they must Wait ; their mother cries because they cry ; she is sick with crying and what not , and wants some tea . She must want . In cold weather we all shiver for want of fire ; the children and their mother can lie in bed to keep themselves warm , but I , hungry and cold , must work on . I do work , and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I allow it ; my wife drinks gin sometimes , and the children too , poor things , to pacify them . If you were as poor as we are , and had to work as hard as I have without hope , you would be apt to learn that gin is bread , meat , and fire , and hope , all in one . Without gin I should not have the heart to work , and we must all go to the Poor House  --  to die ; for the Poor House is chock full , and the rates are not paid . We say cold in the stomach ; but we mean hunger in the belly , and despair in the heart . Gin cures both for a time ; but it kills , you say . Well , we can but die with gin or without , and life , such as ours , without gin , is worse than death . " Such are the feelings and language of those who labor in vain without present reward or hope in the future . People in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy their pressing wants ; and when men are reduced to that extremity , the present is all , the future nothing , for experience has taught them they have no hope . Like the poor Spitalfields weaver , they will seek in temporary excitements oblivion from their cares ; gradually undergo a process of deterioration , moral , physicab and intellectual , and die like beasts , because they can not live like men . The necessity for increased industry , thus entailed on the people of England by those great blessings  --  a national debt and heavy taxes , therefore , in our opinion , so far from being an argument in favor of the policy of running in debt , operates directly the contrary . The poor Spitalfields weaver , or the manufacturing operative , is certainly neither better , wiser , or happier for being compelled to labor incessantly without being able to earn the most homely necessaries of life , and driven to // drown his cares in gin . Nothing can render excessive , unremitting labor tolerable , except the present fruition %it brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wanting , labor is only an involuntary effort of despair , and so far from being the auxiliary of virtue , is the parent of more vices than idleness itself . That the national debt , and the national burdens , are the great sources of their evils , must be evident when we revert to the fact which is perfectly notorious , that the prices of every necessary of life in England is more than doubled by the import and excise duties. * The second beneficial result of these great national blessings , according to the theory of the Political Economists , is , that they have called for the exercise of a greater degree of economy in the people of England . We presume no one will deny that economy as opposed to wasteful prodigality is a praiseworthy quality , and of course a favorable national characteristic . But in order to arrive at the dignity of a virtue it must be volun tary . Still less should it consist in the absolute necessity of foregoing those ordinary comforts indispensable to the decent existence of civilized men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the operatives in manufactories , and by the paupbr peasantry of England , Scotland , and Ireland , is , in pur opinion , no great blessing either to the individual or the nation ; and if no better argument can be brought forward in behalf of national burdens than that they have made it necessary for millions of these industrious , economical people , to practice economy to the very verge of starvation , it seems to us they must stand without any justification whatever . If , as Mr. MeCullogh asserts , these additional burdens have made such sacrifices of that species of happiuess which arises from sources alike common to high and low , rich and poor , wise and ignorant , absolutely necessary , we shall not hesitate to denounce such reasoning as altogether fallacious . The third and last great blessing adduced by this class of Political Economists as the offspring of great national burdens , is , that they have stimulated the inventive faculties of the good people of England to new exertions . We presume reference is here had to the increased application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , to the construction of canals and railroads , and generally to those ingenious expedients which have becn reverted to , for the purpose of superseding the labor of the hands , and cheapening its rewards . Necessity is proverbially the mother of invention , and invention * See the case of William Gladstone laid before Parliament not long since . // is an exceedingly useful faculty . Yet , in countries where there exists a superabundance of population , and the J*aborers are too numerous for the harvest , it seems obvious to us , notwithstanding all arguments and theories to the contrary , that in proportion as manual labor is superseded by machinery , is the value of that labor diminished . It is when this substitution of machinery for man is carried to excess , that the latter becomes by degrees useless to themselves and a burden to others ; that the standard of human nature is reversed ; that men are deprived of their proper value ; that a pointer dog is worth more than a Christian man ; and that children are so far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterling to any one who will accept their services as house-drudges and apprentices. * Thus it becomes obviously the interest of the purchaser to get rid of his bargain as soon as possible by ill treatment , over-working , and underfeeding , since if it dies or runs away , he can get another slave and ten pounds sterling into the bargain . The infant child of a Southern slave is worth twice or thrice as much as the offspring of a free-born Englishman , and a steamengine or spinning-jenny of more value than a whole community of two-legged beasts of burden . Yet the whole world rings with British howlings on the subject of African slavery . We are well aware that by reasoning in a circle , and occasionally a*suming a fact , or a principle , it may be made to appear that the introduction of machinery as a substitute for human labor has increased the demand for it by giving employment to women and children in manufactories . But reasoning in a circle , like working in a circle , is not the best or shortest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of our journey . We , at least , prefer the straightforward course , and would not barter one single deduction of plain , honest , common sense , lying directly on the surface , for all the round-about rigmarole obscurities of all the Political Economists . Truth is represented without covering , as if to indicate that she has no concealment , and can be seen by the naked eye much clearer than through the dim spectacles of philosophical abstractions . It is an article for every-day use ; and what is practically necessary to a decision on the ordinary affairs of life , is never found so deep as the bottom of a well . It is equally essential to all classes of mankind , the ignorant as well as the wise , and it would seem a strange dispensation if it were confined only to a few . We are , therefore , greatly inclined to a belief that the general conclusions of common sense , which are the result of reason and * See England and America . p. 62. // experience combined , are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most belabo*ed deductions of the most profound speculators . But let that pass , while we inquire briefly into the nature and consequences of those exertions of the inventive faculty , with a view to ascertain , as far as possible , in what degree they have contributed to the prosperity and happiness of the people of England , by furnishing facilities for men to earn their daily bread by labor done without the aid of capital . In the first place , so far from a poor man , or one in ordinary circumstances , being able to avail himself of the complicated results of the increased exercise of those boasted inventive powers , he is completely debarred from participating in their advantages . The machinery now required for successful manufacturing , demands a great concentration of capital . The poor man can have no share in the profits ; he is not the partner , but the slave of the concern ; all the clear profits gained go to the capitalist . In the second place , unless the demand for any manufactured article is increased indefinitely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows as a necessary consequence-it appears perfectly self-evident that the substitution of machinery in place of human labor must of necessity diminish the demand fo* the latter , and of course the rate of wages . This result we conceive can not be evaded except by assuming as an inflexible principle that the supply can not exceed the demand , an absurdity every day exemplified in England , which is continually forced to obtain new consumers for her manufactures , by new acquisitions and new aggressions in all quarters of the globe . At brief intervals , a considerable portion of the manufactories of that country are out of employment , owing to causes beyond the control of the government , and the operatives consequently in a state of deplorable destitution . They are set adrift , to float into the Parish Poor House , or employed only half the time , at less than half-days ' wages , and the deficiency is sparingly contributed by the poor-rates . Assuredly such a state of things , which may be in a great degree traced to those exertions of the inventive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare of the people . Accordingly , we find the operatives in the manufactories only deterred by military force , or an armed police , from destroying machinery wherever they can do it with safety . Ignorant as they may be , they know where the shoe pinches . They can not reason logically , but they can feel . In the third place , it can not escape the notice of travelers // in England , that none of these exertions of the inventive faculty have for their object the benefit of the laboring classes who are without property . On the contrary , they are for the most part only calculated to foster monopolies on a great scale , and thus take the bread out of their mouths . They do not increase the production of food , and so far from cheapening the necessaries of life , their sole object is to furnish people abroad with cheap clothing , which they are enabled to do partly by increasing , partly by reducing the wages of labor to the minimum of starving by inches . They administer exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the comforts of those who , toiling without capital , are consequently forever precluded from sharing the profits of that machinery which can only be procured and put in operation at an immense expense . What advantage is it to the poor man who is tied to one spot , and who can scarcely earn his daily bread by incessant toil , that others are enabled to travel at the rate of fifty miles an hour at an expense he can not afford. , or get the news in the hundredth part of the time they did in the dark ages of post riders and stage coaches ? All these great improvements may have enabled England to pay the 50,000,000 , sterling , of these beneficial public burdens , but it has been by the sacrifiep of " The ox that treadeth out the corn . " So far , then , from coinciding with the British Politic*l Economists , we conclude this portion of our discussion with confidently asserting that the present poverty and depression of so large a portion of the people of England may be traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their legiti mate progeny the paper system , alt acting on a surplus population . This is the grand trio which has produced the strange phenomenon , which Mr. Carlyle ascribes to witchcraft , of a government possessing all the attributes of almost incalculable wealth , contrasted with a people , industrious , economical and ingenious , crying out for bread , in the midst of boundless plenty . Neither earthquakes , nor famine , nor pestilence , nor any of those scourges which Providence sometimes lets loose on nations for inscrutable purposes , can compare in their ravages with the lingering , hopeless , interminable grievances inflicted by that great . stimulant to industry , economy and invention ,  --  a vast national debt , and its inevitable consequences . It is the bloodsucker of nations ; and it might be asserted with equal truth , that this insatiable reptile gives back the tide of life he extracts from his victim , as that governments return to their subjects the money they screw from them by taxations . It can never // return to the same pockets whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one man can infuse life and vigor into the veins of another . It is only once in a great while that the avenging dispensations of Providence fall on communities and nations , or that a whole people become victims to war , pestilence , or famine . But the leaden burden of hopeless toil , the long-protracted miseries of cold and hunger , only alleviated by plunging into drunkenness and sensuality , and knowing no intermission as they descend from father to son , accumulating by the waythese constitute the disease of the heart of natiQns , " the worm that never dies ,  --  the fire which is never quenched . " Is any degree of power , any eminence of glory , an adequate compensation for the sufferings of millions of our fellow creatures ? In vain may we tell these poor victims of " industry , economy and invention , " of the vast extent of the British Empire ; the glory of the nation ; the magnitude of its commerce ; the perfection of its arts ; the refinement of a small part of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the United Kingdom by this accumula .. tion of grandeur . All other considerations are superseded by the absence of the necessaries of life , and he who wants bread wants everything . As this article has already extended to an inconvenient length , without the subject being exhausted , we propose to resume , and conclude it in our next number .
