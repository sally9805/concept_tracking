Hitherto it had been up-hill work , and hence slow . But now they had reached the summit , and the roiling country that stretched away before them gave full scope to the drivers to show their Jehu propensities . Without stopping , the rider of the extra horse , which had been fastened to the birlocha to assist in the ascent , unhooked him , and throwing the trace over the dash-board , rushed off like a Bedonin to assist in driving the spare animals . The birlochas also dashed off on a wild gallop , which made it difficult for the occupants to retain their seats . Up and down the gentle ascents , and away across the level stretches , they swept on at a rate that prevented any study of the country . Arriving at Casa Bianca about four o'clock they determined , as it contained a good hotel kept by an Englishman , to spend the night there . To this arrangement , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to a village farther ahead . After arguing the matter for half an hour , Strain cut it short by threatening to knock the capitaz down . The chief driver then demanded money to feed his horses . This Strain refused to give , and dismissed the whole with what the sailors call a left-handed blessing , declaring he would not give them a single cuartillo . After they were gone the landlord told him that his course was impolitic , for if the rascally drivers find they are to receive nothing as a present to themselves , they are very apt , in some awkward place , to let the birlochas capsize , much to the detriment of the occupants . So he called back the drivers and gave to them what he had refused to the cupitaz , hinting that he was pleased with their conduct , and offended only with the former . Having thus harmonized matters , all went to supThe next morning they were early en route , and as the birlochas dashed at a gallop out into the open country , a cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the travelers , though wrapped in heavy cloaks , shrink and cower into the corners of their vehicles . A long ascent was before them , but the temperature was low and the horses fresh , and they pushed up it on a brisk trot until the summit was reached , when they again struck into a sharp gallop , and went rattling down the slope . The road was cut in zigzags , and in making the sharp turns the vehicles would come round with a jerk that made the inmates often start with anxiety . It was dark , and they did not know but some of these acute angles were made on the brink of a precipice . At length the long-wished-for dawn broke over the cold and strange landscape , and after a gallop of a few miles they entered , through a long avenue of Lombardy poplars , the straggling village of Curucubi . The chickens running around in the yard of the hotel were soon on the table , and after a hasty breakfast they again took the road , and , having fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful valley on which the morning sunlight lay like a blessing . It was Sunday , and the road was thronged with neatly-dressed peasants going to make their holiday visits . Most of them were on horseback , and both men and women being beautiful riders they presented a gay and graceful appearance . Many of the peasant girls were exceedingly pretty , and using a side-saddle instead of riding astride , as they do in Brazil , seemed farther advanced in civilization than one was led to expect . A little after ten they arrived at the steep ascent of the Cuesta del Prado , the summit of which is reached by some ninety zigzags . Up this , with the sun nearly at meridian , they slowly toiled , while the heat , predicted by the driver , together with the suffocating dust , made the journey a difficult and painful one . But when the ascent was at last gained , the view from it amply repaid the labor . Rising two thousand three hundred and ninety-four feet in the heavens , its top commanded the surrounding region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fertile valley they had just left , studded with groves and neat farm-houses , dropped , apparently at random , in the centre of richly-cultivated fields , the yellow grain of which contrasted pleasantly with the bright green of the poplars that lined the road and the avenues to the dwellings of the inhabitants . Before them was spread the immense basin of the valley of the Santiago , inciosed on all sides but one with high hills rising abruptly , like artificial elevations from the plain , or islands from the sea . Far away to the east stretched the colossal range of the Andes , presenting an almost impassable barrier to the adventurous traveler . Grand , mysterious , and awful , its white and silent peaks rose one above another till they pierced twenty-three thousand feet into the dim heavens . Clothed to the waist in perpetual snow , their immense masses and almost terrific outlines overawe the beholder and fill the soul with new and strange sensations . The valley that lay between them and the Andes , with its green groves and meadows and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furnished a strange contrast to this majesty and grandeur . But a short time , however , was given to the enjoyment of this magnificent and soul-stirring panorama ; for the shrill cry of the drivers and strokes of their whips carried them to the descent , down which the horses that drew Strain ' birlocha plunged with a recklessness that threatened the lives of all . They turned the first zigzag successfully ; but the shaft horse becoming fractious he soon grew unmanageable , and at the second angle kept straight on to the // brink of the precipice , on the very edge of which the driver , by the aid of a powerful hit , succeeded in arresting him . Turning the horses back into the middle of the road they again started oft and were brought up at the next zigzag in the same perilous position . Again guided back into the road they started off anew , but instead of making the angle in obedience to the bit the vicious shaft-horse kept straight on as before , and , unable to stop him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel of the carriage within a foot of the brink of the precipice , which here dropped nine hundred feet into the chasm below . The affair was now becoming serious , and Strain jumped out , advising his friend to do the same . The latter , with a rueful countenance , looked at his patent-leather boots , with which he was to walk the capital of Santiago , and confessed that , although in great bodily fear , he could not think of soiling them . Strain was not sorry he had acted on the hint of the landlord at Casa Bianca and propitiated the drivers , for nothing was easier than for them to save themselves and yet , at the same time , tip the occupants of the birlocna to Hades below . Raving arrived at the foot of the hill , the remaining distance to Santiago was over a level road and through a highly-cultivated champagne country . One of the most striking features of Santiago is the Alameda , or Cafiada , which signifies a glen  --  a name not inappropriately given , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This avenue is about one hundred and forty feet wide , and stretches for more than a mile directly through the heart of the city . It is thickly lined with tall poplars , while , on either side , run two other avenues , also bordered with poplars . Outside of the whole , one on each side , run two rapid streams , fresh from the snow peaks of the Andes . When this splendid promenade is crowded with the beauty of the capital , it presents a most picturesque appearance . From the centre of the city arises a rocky eminence , surmounted by a fort , which at all times can command the place . The view from this height , embracing the city below , the distant and highly-cultivated fields , dotted with farmhouses and sprinkled with lowing herds , the sparkling streams , and , fifteen miles distant , the majestic Cordilleras , is one of surpassing beauty and grandeur . The commander of this fortress had a novel way of announcing to the inhabitants the hour of noon . A convex lens was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder connected with the fuse of a gun , and thus fired it . The sun was made to serve the double purpose of artillerist and town-clock . If the climate was like that of England noon would seldom be announced . The Yankee clock has not yet reached Santiago . * This city has long been regarded , and justly so , as the most beautiful SouthAmerican capital . This is owing more to its position and the surrounding scenery than to the city itself . The As a branch of our N tional Observatory has been recently established in Santiago , the announcements of the gnu will not be regarded as so infallible , and the people will have to bother their beads over the difference between apparent and mean time . CHILIAN OX-cAnT. // churches are well enough , with a great deal of wealth lavished on the interior . The cathedral is built of porphyry , and is an immense and imposing edifice . The streets are well laid out and commodious , and paved with mere pebbles instead of large round stones . The houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height , as in other South American cities , on account of the frequency of earthquakes . There are few public ornaments , and few public buildings that possess much interest . The inhabitants have a bad character for morality , and Sir Francis Head said ( referring to women of ill repute ) , " The lower rooms of the most respectable houses are let to them ; and it is really shocking beyond description to see them sitting at their doors , with a candle in the back part of the room , burning before sacred pictures and images . " This is overdrawn . Besides , it must be remembered that this class of women are far more respectable in Southern countries than with us . In Italy , for instance , not one is allowed in the street as such , nor permitted to remain in the city , unless she follows some other vocation . This makes them more respectable , and keeps them from those terrible vices and excesses which hurry the frail women of our own land to such a fearful doom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense exhibited both in England and the United States in their efforts to reform this class ; and , we might add , a vast amount of hypocrisy . Many who , like Sir Francis Head , would be shocked to have one of these frail ones occupy the basement of a respectable house , would prefer to occupy a hotel at which a notorious prima donna was stopping , and think it an honor to have their daughters introduced to Madame Rachel , who openly flaunted in the face of the public the fruits of her dissolute life . From the notorious Empress Catharine down through the highest to the lowest ranks , the moral community are horrified and disgusted just in proportion to the position of the one sinning . Still Santiago , it must be confessed , is a very immoral place ; and when one is told it is full of priests , it is evident it can not be otherwise . The streets are crowded with these bloated and lazy monks and priests loitering along , and with unblushing effrontery strolling into houses of ill repute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chairs of dissolute women , and in intimate conversation . Still the people , from ancient custom , touch their hats respectfully to them , and still believe in their teaching . There is , however , very little real respect felt for their character ; for almost all of them have families , and take no pains to conceal their disreputable conduct . The people laugh at their immoralities , and send their wives and daughters to confess to them , and outwardly exhibit all the forms of reverence . It was now mid-summer , and the fashionable portion of the inhabitants were away at the various watering-places or on the sea-shore . The few who could not afford to leave shut themselves up in their houses , as they do in more cultivated cities , feigning themselves absent . An excursion into the suburbs revealed in detail the extreme beauty of the country , which they had admired in the panoramic view from the fortress . You ride along , mile after mile through a beautiful avenue of poplars , from which , at short intervals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that are set back some distance from the main road . These , unlike the houses of the town , are mossly frame buildings , painted white , and so completely embedded in foliage that you catch only partial glimpses of them through the branches . There was a quiet , home-like look in these residences that one did not expect to see in South America . Santiago , being the capital of Chili , has borne an important part in those revolutions that have rocked the South American continent . It was here , in 1814 , that the young Carrera made the last stand for the patriots , and , when Rancagna fell , abandoned all hope , and the passes of the Andes became crowded with the rebel chiefs and men of distinction . Beyond those impenetrable barriers the scattered forces were reunited , and , three years after , re-entered this city with waving banners and shouts of exultation . The decisive battle had been fought fifty miles off on the twelfth , and yet the victorious troops trod the streets of the capital on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Strain turned his thoughts toward the Andes , while his comrades prepared to return to the ship Lexington . Looking around for some good opportunity for continuing his journey , he met an Englishman , whose son , a resident *of Mendoza , was about to return to that place , and the proposition was made that they should travel in company . The 27th was fixed upon for their departure , as also that of the return of his friends to their vessel . Mutual regrets at parting kept them up conversing until the arrival of the birlocha , which was to return to Valparaiso . With affectionate adiens and mutual good wishes for each other 's welfare , the friends parted . Thus was severed the last link that bound Strain to the Lexington , and he sat and smoked with Captain L till morning . At six he and his companion mounted and rode out of the city . A bright sun , a smiling landscape , the cool , fresh breeze of morning , and a rapid pace , soon dispelled the sadness caused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long in daily and pleasant intercourse . The company consisted of Don Frederico , who was mounted on a mule ; his peon , Bertoldo , who rode a large black , raw-boned horse , his lank , uncouth form set off by flea-bitten ears and the stump of a tail grown bald with age ; and a small Chilian boy mounted on a mule , and leading a vicious colt that kicked at every object that came within reach . This Frederico , who was to be his companion in the long and // 581 desolate journey , proved to be a plausible scamp , who had inherited from his father-originally a horse-jockey-all the trickery and deception by which such a character manages to sell worthless animals at a high price . He knew just enough English to swear with great fluency , but not enough for any other purpose under heaven . Indeed , in the vocabulary of profanity he was perfect ; and by his liberal use of it , made up for his deficiency in farther knowledge of the language . Bertoldo was an excellent horseman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a little distance ofi ; appear to be precisely in the centre of his body . To him the " whole duty of man " consisted in getting drunk on every opportunity , and no man ever stuck to his creed closer , or obeyed it more faithfully . The Chilian boy was evidently an offspring of Somnus , for night and day , standing , sitting , or riding , he would drop asleep , and thus often take the wrong road and have to retrace his footsteps . As for Strain , he was mounted on a miserable mule which Frederico had sold to him for about double his value . But though his companions were uninteresting , the country through which they were now traveling was beautiful . Wheat fields stretched away on either side of the road , interspersed with farm-houses embedded in shrubbery. ; rural churches , surrounded with neat cottages , rose up from among the poplars , under the branches of which gleamed forth smoothly-shaven grassplats , while far away rose , stern . and majestic , the lofty Cordilleras . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , and priests-all on horseback , and all on a gallop . Here a fat priest would lumber along , followed by two laughing girls on one horse-these in turn , perhaps , by a little boy with an old woman behind him . Some were carrying water-melons , others milk , chickens , eggs , and fish , but every thing on a canter . Some of the peasant-girls were better dressed than others , and rode beautifully . As they swept by on a free gallop they would greet the travelers with a nod and smile , while the merry laugh of the various groups rung out on every side . The peasantry , whether traveling or at work , invariably lifted their hats to the strangers-a custom peculiarly grateful to a traveler in a distant land . At half past nine the company rode into the little village of Colinas , where , with an appetite whetted by a ride of twenty-one miles in the morning breeze , they partook of a frugal breakfast . Mounting egain , they rode on through the same delightful country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts and laughter of the peasantry treading out the grain of the wealthier proprietors of the land . Their own little farms were given them on condition that they should assist in harvest-time . Instead of regarding this as a tax or a burden , they seemed to look upon it as a pastime . Males and females joined in the merriment , and such romping , and shouting , and tumbling , and flying of straw , and uproarions laughter , Strain never before witnessed in any country . League after league they passed through the same loisterous mirth , till it seemed like a great holiday ; while in the distance , as far as the eye could DEPARTURE FROM SANTIACO. // reach over the open plains , could be seen little white clouds suspended here and there in the atmosphere , showing where they were winnowing the grain under the steady breeze that came down from the heights of the Cordilleras . The road was in excellent condition , the air clear and bracing , and all combined made the morning ride charming and delightful . At half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having accomplished forty-two miles since daylight . The day now had become warm , and Strain resolved to halt till evening . It was his purpose to start at two o'clock in the morning , but by some mistake they got ronsed at midnight , and by one were on the road . Having retired at nine , he had but three hours ' rest , and not sleeping any the night before , he became drowsy , and frequently fell asleep in his saddle , which several times nearly pitched him into the road . Shortly after leaving the posada they struck from the main road into the original mule-path , in order to make one of those " short cuts " which travelers amidst mountains learn to avoid . This path leading up the height was so filled with stones as to render it almost impassable , while running , as it frequently did , along the dizzy edge of a precipice , made the traveling it very dangerous , especially at night . It was moonlight , or they could not hare passed in safety . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but just sufficient to reveal the dark spaces over which they hung . On the summit of the Cuesta of Chacabuco the path again joined the main road , and they found , in their case at least , that the " longest way round is " not only the " nearest " but the safest " way home . " From the top there is said to be a magnificent view ; but darkness lay on mountain and valley , and all around was uncertain , wild , find mysterious . Here the patriot , San Martin , after having led his army , one by one , through the gorges of the Andes , met the Spanish forces , and , after a desperate fight , drove them down the mountain . From the foot of this mountain to San Felipe , a distance of ten miles , the road is level , leading across a cultivated plain , abounding in wheat , hemp , and broom-corn . The sides are bordered with cottages , standing so closely together that , for the whole ten miles , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the city the road lay along the Aconcagna River , which , winding backward and forward through the plain , compelled them to cross it frequently . There were no bridges except little rustic foot-bridges , which , spanning the stream frequently from high , abrupt banks , composed pleasing and tasteful features in the landscape . The water , flesh from the Andes , was icy cold , and its volume , increased by a turbulent tributary near the city , made the fording of it difficult and dangerous . Having arrived in the suburbs of the town , Don Frederico sent the peons and baggage to the hotel , designing to take Strain directly to the house of his uncle to rest till evening . But , to Strain 's surprise , his mule refused to stir . lie had formed a strong attachment to the thin , raw-boned , flea-bitten , stub-tailed black horse . This affection had been coming on gradually , but heretofore had not interfered with their movements . Now , however , it had reached that point of intensity that could not endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he planted his fore-feet firmly on the ground and refused to stir in the opposite direction . It was not till after repeated and heavy strokes of the spur that he was induced to move , and when he did , he gave vent to his wounded feelings in such an extraordinary bray that it brought all the inhabitants in the neighborhood to the door . As he moved lugubriously along he , at short intervals , gave other equally extraordinary specimens of his vocal powers . At length he came to the public square , where were the barracks , in which a military band was practicing . The music seemed to deepen the grief of the love-sick creature , and stopping abruptly , and flinging his nose pathetically into the air , he lifted up his voice in a still more astounding manner . The band stopped instanter , and the players , flinging down their instruments , with the soldiers , rushed to the doors , while all the residents near flocked out of their houses , till a crowd stood in the street . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted the poor traveler . Between the ex* hibition Strain made jerking the reins and striking with his heels , and the poor mule giving forth those lamentable sounds , the scene was inconceivably ludicrous , and the crowd enjoyed it keenly . Every fresh explosion was followed by a peal of laughter , and " Suoni la tromba ! " " Suoni la tromba P ( " Sound the trumpet I " ) was shouted on every side . The disconsolate beast at last consented to move on , but when it reached the house where they were to stop , it gave forth one more parting wail . Don Frederico 's uncle being absent , they were received by two cousins of his , a male and female . The latter was married , though extremely young . She had been pretty , but was now pale and thin , and evidently in the last stages of consumption . There was an air of resigned melancholy about her that made her deeply interesting , while her look and conversation appeared as if her thoughts were not in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fast hastening . It evidently wearied her to talk , not merely from physical weakness , but she took no interes , t in the common topics they were discussing , and after a short time left for her own apartment . Strain , drowsy and fatigued , soon fell asleep in his chair , and was finally awakened at hearing his name pronounced by Frederico . As he slowly opened his eyes he saw standing before him a creature of rare and wondrous beauty . She was another of Frederico 's cousins , whom he had brought in to introduce . Thoroughly aroused by this // lovely apparition , Strain sprung to his feet to make his salutations , when his spur caught in his poncho , and he fell back in his seat , while Sefiorita Delfina smiled at his awkward predicament . In the next attempt he was more successful , and a kindly shake of the hand and a frank , cordial welcome quickly drove away his embarrassment . He had been warned of her charms at Santiago , but had no conception that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had an air of self-possession , almost of hauteur , that would have become a queen . Having understood that Strain was an Englishman , she inquired if tEs was his first visit to Chili . Being set right on this point , she congratulated him on the valuable acquisitions his countrymen had made on the Pacific coast in the possession of California . The conversation becoming general , she exhibited an astonishing knowledge of history and geography , such as is seldom witnessed in the most select and cultivated society ; and a knowledge , too , of all the important political events that had transpired in Europe , which took him completely by surprise . She put question after question , with an expression of deep interest ; and when she came to more recent events , he was compelled to confess that she was . better informed respecting them than himself ; as he had been for the last year on the coasts of Mexico and California , and hence out of the way of periodicals . Turning to a table , he found a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of civilization . Volumes lay scattered around nowadays seldom found on a lady 's table . There was Coriune , the French Ency clopedists in the original , and other works , which showed . that , while she took a deep interest in. passing . political events , her mind was also enriched with the stores of literature . He asked , with some surprise , if she read the encyclopedists . Her half-negative , and the blush which mantled ' her cheek , left no doubt as to the truth , while she could not converse on any topic without showing that her mind had taken a wide range . Their interesting elegance that made her as charming there as she had been in conversation . Up to this time Strain had been perfectly contented ' with his traveling apparel , and his personal . appearance generally ; but such is the influence of female beauty on the manners of gentlemen , that no sooner was breakfast over than he stole away to the barber 's , where , after being shaved and having his hair dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he operated , and his own limited wardrobe , would permit . At mid-day Se*orita Delfina , acting the part of hostess , invited him to take a siesta , which he declined , on the ground that he was not sleepy-hoping , instead , to enjoy her presence and conversation . But she remembered the nap in the chair in the morning , and insisted on his going to bed . He was put into a room with a bed whose snow-white linen he could not consent to soil with his dusty clothing ; so , using it only for a pillow , he lay down on the tiled floor , and was soon in profound slumber , from which he did not awaken till four o'clock , when he SOUKD THE TRUMPET . // was called to dinner . This was elegantly got up ; and a pleasant journey across the mountains and his future happiness was drunk in Champagne  --  a wine unusual in any part of this country . During dinner she spoke of Lago Encantada and the Puente del Inca , the two most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him excellent advice as to his traveling arrangements . After dinner , and when alone with Strain , she informed him that her father was a refugee from Mendoza , in the Argentine Republic , whence he had been driven for his political opinions . She was thoroughly conversant with all the political history and events that had transpired in those distracted provinces on the Atlantic coast , and gave him more insight into the various movements than he ever before had . She expressed her opinions fearlessly ; and , when she came to denounce the petty tyrants who ruled her native country , that hitherto dreamy eye flashed fire , and the delicate mouth became rigid as iron . The transformation was complete ; and as she dilated on the wrongs of her country , and pointed out the course that ought to be pursued , Strain gazed at her in undisguised admiration . There was an independence of thought in what she said , and a high , noble courage , which spoke in every lineament of her glorious face , that made her entrancing . With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the same spirit which burned in Joan of Arc and the Maid of Saragossa ; and it needed only to change her sex to make a hero of her . Strain a*sked her why she did not raise a regiment herself ; he , for one , would be glad to fight under her banner . She would by no means be a contemptible opponent . She is a daring , skillful rider , and four times has crossed the Andes to Mendoza. ra those fearful passes , along the beetling precipices , on paths so narrow that the skirts of her robe floated out over abysses nearly a thousand feet deep , she would ride with the same ease and fearlessness as when she was sweeping in a wild gallop along the plain . She would sit a mere speck on the face of the cliff and look calmly down on chasms that made the nerves of the strongest man quiver . Twice she had made the entire journey , two hundred miles , in four days-or , fifty miles a day  --  a distance which took Strain over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this could have been done , ; and nothing but the most urgent necessity could justify it . It can not be performed in this time merely by making greater speed on those portions of the route where a mule can go faster than on a walk , for they are too few and limited , but by traveling night and day . This , however , requires a power of endurance , and a hardihood of daring , rarely found in men . As he looked upon thatbeautiful form , and those delicate hands and feet , he could hardly believe that she had , night after night , camped among the rocks in those high , cold regions , or skirted those fearful precipices and plunged into those gloomy , frightful abysses at midnight . But there was that about her that convinced one that she was equal to any emergency ; and , at the head of a column of cavalry , would , with a curling lip and a flashing eye , charge full on a blazing battery , and not a pulse beat quicker except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that , born and brought up as she was at the foot of the Andes ( she was born at Mendoza ) , on the outskirts of civilization , with no apparent inducement to obtain those extensive acquirements she possessed , and no apparent use for them when obtained , would alone point her out as a most remarkable woman . It was plain that her spirit chafed , and herwholebeing rebelled against the limited and inappropriate sphere in which she found herself placed . It needed no confession on her part to prove this ; for when Strain referred to it , the sudden gleam that shot from her eye , and the almost fierce look that followed , showed how deeply she felt it . It was really painful to see this magnificent creature , both in person and mind , shut up here for life . In figure , she was full without being stout , and her whole form rounded with exquisite grace . Her hair was black as the raven 's wing , and folded back from a brow shaded with thought . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but capable of great and varied expression . When they kindled with excitement the rich blood under her brown cheek always responded . Her mouth , in regularity and beauty , matched the other almost faultless lineaments of her face ; but it was not its beauty that arrested one-it was its cx. traordinary flexibility and power of expression . It seemed as if every ripple of thought or wave of feeling , as it floated over her lips , shaped them to its own character and meaning . Her voice , in common conversation , was soft and musical ; but when she grew excited over the wrongs of her country , it increased both in volume and tone , yet it became neither shrill nor piercing , but sounded like a distant bugle-note . So youthful , and yet so mature-so exceedingly beautiful , and yet thinking more of the intellect that is unprized and practically inactive than of her beauty-she can arrive at but one goal-disappointment . She will either take some rash and desperate measure , and get out into that world for which she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry one of the halfcivilized beings around her , only to feel herself , like Pegasus , chained to a dray . A little before six Frederico came to the door with the mules , announcing that every thing was ready for departure . Strain begged that he would stay overnight , but he refused . Lingering till the last moment , he at length bade her adieu , though with the expectation of seeing her again , for she informed him that within a week she expected to be in Mendoza . The sudden illness of her invalid sister , who was attacked with violent hemorrhage of the lungs , which was doubtless followed soon after by death , prevented the journey . // Strain left San Felipe with profonnd regret . He had become deeply interested in Sefiorita Delfina , and sympathized sincerely with her in her complete isolation from that society which could appreciate her , and which she seemed made to adorn . The chief beauty of San Felipe is its public promenades , which inclose the town on two sides , and furnish a cool retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset when the company rode out of the place and commenced their journey to Santa Rosa , fifteen miles distant  --  the last village east of the Andes , and from which the ascent proper of the mountains commences . The brother of Sefiorita Delfina accompanied Strain out of the city  --  a compliment frequently paid to strangers in various parts of South America . For a mile after they had forded the river the country was rough and rocky , when they struck a rich and fertile valley . The road was good , while its sides were so thickly studded with houses that , for more than thirteen miles , it seemed like passing through a straggling village . Cottages and gardens and rural churches , with the cheerful peasants sitting in front of their neat dwellings , enjoying the evening and chatting with their neighbors , filled up the whole distance . With the roads good , the evening cool , the animals fresh , and such pleasing objects to beguile the way , time passed swiftly , and , very much to his surprise , Strain suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Andes . There being no hotel , it was some time before they could find a place to pass the night in . They at length found a vacant apartment , and taking a drink of brandy and water in place of supper , of which none was to be had , with their saddles for pillows , lay down on the damp earthen floor to sleep ; the last act of Strain being an angry growl at Frederico for bringing him to such a place as this instead of remaining in San Felipe , where were comfortable beds , and where he could have enjoyed for a few more hours the pleasant society of Sefiorita Delfina . The next morning was the first day of March . The travelers rose early and managed to obtain a very slim breakfast . Strain then called on the governor of the department to obtain some local information ; but this important functionary refused bluntly to communicate any , evidently suspecting his motives . From an intelligent merchant , however , be learned that the department of Santa Rosa was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat and other agricultural products , as well as containing silver and copper mines . The country is healthy , subject to no endemic or epidemic diseases . There are a few cases of goitre , and this disease seems to be slightly on the increase . It is stated by those most worthy of confidence , that the goitre was unknown in Chili till about twenty years ago , when itmadeits appearance simultaneouslywith the introduction of poplars from Mendoza . This being a frontier town , duties are collected on all goods coming over the mountains from the Argentine provinces , and here Frederico exhibited his Jewish propensities . Indeed Strain had a touch of it the day before at San Felipe . On going to take out his passport for leaving the country , Frederico suggested that he should pass for his clerk , and thus he could save three dollars and a half , as in that case the charge would be but four reals . A few weeks before , when he came from Mendoza , he brought with him several horses and mules , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take back with him , and so , instead of paying duties on them , he gave security that they should be paid in the event that he sold them in Chili . Two of these Strain had bought , and two had been exchanged for the two miserable wornout hacks upon which Bertoldo and the boy were mounted . The colt had taken the place of another . To avoid paying duties , he had Strain 's mules recorded as his own , which be averred he had loaned him for the journey . He was a shrewd financier , and evinced his sharpness still farther by borrowing of Strain the same day twenty-five dollars , which the latter could not well refuse , and which he knew he would never see again . Here they encountered a young man by the name of Astorga , who was also on his way to Mendoza , and who proposed to join company , which was readily agreed to . He gave the house where he was stopping , and said he would be ready at any hour they would call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till toward evening , Strain strolled around the town to pass away the time as he best could . It did not put him in the pleasantest humor to think how much more agreeably he could have passed these twenty hours with Sefiorita Delfina in San Fehipe . The town proper contains about 4000 inhabitants , and is laid out with great regularity , with a large square in the centre . The streets are well paved , while through nearly every one runs a small mountain stream , pure as crystal and cold as iced water . These streams come from the snow-capped Andes , and , sparkling and rippling as they do through the various streets , impart a refreshing coolness in the summer , and present a no*'el and pretty aspect . A beautiful and shaded promenade encircles the entire town , while over all , and above all , towers , in awful majesty , the snow-capped summits of the Andes . Altogether , it is one of the prettiest towns in the region , though seldom visited by the traveler . Far away from the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the feet of the Cordilleras-its inhabitants knowing or caring little of what is going on in the great world about them . Simple and contented , they are seldom troubled except when the rumblings of an earthquake are heard in the distance . Toward evening they set out for the mountains , and Strain observing that Frederico was leavingwithout calling.for Astorga , as he promised , // reminded him of it . The latter replied , perhaps he had already gone ; or if not , and they chanced to meet him , they could say that they went for him but could not find him . Strain saw at once that there was a motive in his conduct-that he wanted none but those who would do his bidding in the party . This made him still more anxious for another traveling companion through the mountains , where he would be completely at the mercy of this man , who had already shown himself to be thoroughly unscrupulous . There was , however , no help for it , and , leaving the town behind them , they entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cordilleras . Passing near a mill by the roadside , they met a party of travelers , one of whom was from Mendoza and an acquaintance of Frederico . Learning that Strain was an American , he accosted him in English , and informed him that he had been educated in Philadelphia , and at parting , desired him to inform Mr. Somebody there , whose name Strain forgot , that he was well , and had just been married . His bride , to whom he had been married by proxy , resided in Valparaiso , whither he was now going to reclaim her . The road now commenced to ascend gradually , leading over a substantial stone bridge to the pass , or guard , where their passports were examined . The solitary old fellow stationed here was jolly and sociable . Though cut off from society he had not lost his interest in it ; and he would not take No for an answer , but insisted that they should sit down and smoke a cigar and have a little chat with him . They humored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pushed on . Strain 's saddle , being intended for a horse , was too large for the mule , and having lost the sweat-cloth from under it , and the crbpper never being used in this country , the first steep pitch he descended he came very near going over the animal 's head . Added to this , the boy who had the led-horse , and was put in charge of his cloak , fell asleep and lost both . This caused a long delay ; for Bertoldo had to return some distance before he found them , and it was nine o'clock when they caught the glimmer of the light in a miserable hut where they intended to pass the night . Having reached this forlorn hovel , they dismounted and unsaddled for the night . In a short time Strain found himself seated before a fire kindled in the centre of the room , over which two quite pretty girls were cooking a supper of eggs , soup , and jerked beef . The prettier of the two was a black-eyed , coquettish girl eighteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original bashfulness , if she possessed any , and she and Strain became at once capital friends . Her sister had coquetted some six years longer with passing travelers , and hence was less sprightly and attractive . The entire supper was put into one earthen bowl , and each , furnished with a spoon , helped himself . They had just commenced when another traveler was announced , who proved to be Astorga . Having ascertained that the party had started without him , he pushed on in pursuit . His peon , Jacinto , was a finelooking , intelligent Guacho , who displayed his pride of country by wearing , even in Chili , a pair of fanciful , loose , white drawers , and a piece of red flannel singularly secured about the loins and thighs . He inquired why they had come off without him . Frederico , with his ready coined lie , replied that they were unable to find him . He did not refer to Strain , who , feeling more independent with Astorga in company , was half-inclined to volunteer a denial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have peace over ' the mountains . The supper , though fit only for an ostrich , they speedily dispatched , and the three companions lay down in the open air in front of the cottage and soon fell into a sound sleep . Soon after daylight they were in the saddle , and , without waiting for breakfast , started off . The ascent had now commenced , the road following the side of the mountain , whose summits were lost in the clouds . Occasionally they would catch a glimpse of the peaks of the principal range standing far away against the cold , blue sky . As they pursued their devious , toilsome way toward these , the snow and ice that gleamed in the first sunlight reminded them that before night they would be in a vastly different temperature . The road was a mere shelf along the mountain , hanging over a mad torrent that rushed and roared far below . Compressed between two mountains , it tore along with such power as to carry with it not only heavy d ( bris but huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place the rocky mountains approach - to within fifteen or twenty feet of each other , giving a terrific aspect to the maddened waters . This is called the Soldier 's Leap , from a tradition which asserts that once a soldier , hotly pursued by his foes , cleared the frightful chasm at a bound and escaped . Toiling slowly onward and upward they reached , at ten o'clock , Guardia Vieja , or Old Guard , a ruined hut which is occupied only in summer . They breakfasted here on some beef , roasted on a stick . While it was getting ready Strain washed himself in the cold mountain torrent , notwithstanding the earnest expostulations of his companions , who declared that to wash on a journey inevitably brought ill-luck . They neither washed their hands nor faces during the whole route . This superstition is general throughout South America , though no one seems acquainted with its origin or can assign any reason for the belief in it . Here San Martin , who overturned the Royalists in Chili , fought his first battle with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the gorges of the Andes , and a fierce conflict took place . The patriots were weary with their long and fatiguing march , while the Royalists were fresh , and had chosen their position ; but the enthusiasm of the patriots bore down all oppo // sition ; and the Spaniards , driven back over the narrow way , were hurled into the chasms and torrents below . As they advanced the ascent became more precipitous and laborious . At mid-day they came to a large rivulet , whose water was clear as the atmosphere , and as it rippled over tbe white smooth stones it looked in the sunlight like a chain of brilliants . They were now on the verge of perpetual snow , and in the very heart of the mountains , that rose in a confused mass of savage peaks all around . On the banks of this beautiful stream stands a casecka , a strong structure built for the protection of travelers in spring and autumn . O'lliggins , the Irish dictator of Chili , had several of these erected , and placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores to the couriers who conducted travelers over the mountains . This was very important , for the transit between Chili and the Argentine provinces was constant . Since then , however , they have been neglected , and now contain neither stores nor fuel . Without any chimney or door , they are damp and cheerless ; still they are a great protection to the traveler against the piercing winds , and have preserved many lives . Strain 's courier over the pampas had once been shut up in one of these eighteen days in a snow-storm . Some merchants finding it a matter of vital importance , very late in autumn , to send a message to Buenos Ayres , offered him twenty ounces of gold to carry it across the mountains . Tempted by the large bribe he set out , but here , in the heart of the mountains , he was overtaken by one of those snow-storms-te*nporales as they are called  --  the terror and strength of which the dweller on the plains has no conception of . Groping his way to the casucha , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the door , chasm and cliff were obliterated-naught could be seen but the driving snow , as , whirled by the tortured and imprisoned winds , it drove through the gorges or leaped madly upward into the murky heavens . The muffled sound of torrents in the abysses below could be heard only in the pause of the storm . The uproar was deafening , and the reflections of the solitary man , as he listened to it , locked up there in those savage solitudes , were heart-sickening . Day after day , and night after night , the storm howled on , mocking the hopes of the shivering wretch as he looked out in vain for some signs of change . At length his . provisions began to fail , and he ekedi them out to the farthest limit . He would sit and gain on his scanty stores , beating back the . pangs of hunger , and with a strong will dole out to himself his miserable rations . This slow and steady approach to starvation was infinitely worse than death . At length the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Knowing it was certain death to remain where he was , without the possibility of obtaining food , he crept out and started on his journey . Unable to see but a few feet in advance , sometimes compelled to lay his face against the cliff , and hold on with both hands , to keep from being swept by the blast into abysses below , he slowly felt his way forward . In lulls of the storm hc would be startled by the muffled roar of a torrent right beneath his feet , and rising , apparently , from unfathomable depths . Sometimes slipping on the very brink of the precipice-once saving himself only by catching on the edge with his hands and with great difficulty crawling back , now floundering through heavy snowdrifts , and now picking his way over concealed torrents , hungry , cold , benumbed , weary , and affrighted , the poor man , after numberless narrow escapes , at length emerged into the valley beyond . His account of this horrible journey , related in all its details in his simple language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not given to devotion , he never alluded to this passage in his adventurous life without raising his hat and crossing himself , while a perceptible shudder shook his frame . Passing up they soon came to another casucha standing at the foot of a steep bill , on the top of which was perched a third . The path , thus far , had been up a sharp ascent , but it was nothing compared to the one before them . The bill appeared to stand almost perpendicular , up which the path led in dizzy zigzags , looking as if one had been cutting a countless number of letter Z 's on its breast . At the foot of it , and at the head of a gorge , there burst forth an immense spring , issuing from the mouth of a cavern . Strain at once suspected this was the outlet to the " Lago Encantada "  --  the enchanted lake-so long a mystery to the natives , and also to scientific travelers , who had heard in Chili of its existence . He was therefore not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out before him a beautiful mountain lake , about a mile wide and three miles long . The great mystery to the natives was what became of the water that from niunberless torrents , born amidst the snow-peaks , was constantly poured into it , and how , in spring and summer , it retained the same level . The outlet being a mile from the lake itself it never occurred to them that this was one end of a. subterranean passage , but had always regarded it as a mountain spring . The gorge through which its surplus waters originally passed has evidently , at some remote period , been closed up by a convulsion of nature , which threw an immense hill into its bed . The pressure of the water , as it rose to surmount this new barrier , forced a passage beneath . The mystery was thus easily solved ; but it was natural that the ignorant and superstitious natives , awed by the grandeur and sublimity of this uninhabitable region , should seek for an explanation in the power of enchantment . Still continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astorga 's peon said it must be snowing on the mountain , which they afterward found to be true . Proceeding slowly upward , absorbed in the emotions awakened by the sublimity with which // he was invested , Strain was aroused by the voice of Frederico , who said , in the most business-like way , " Come , let us take a drink of brandy and tighten our girths , for we have now got to climb the mountain . " " Climb the mountain ! " exclaimed Strain , " what else have we been doing all day , and a steep one at that ? " Frederico pointed to a lofty and regularly formed mountain in the distance , presenting an imposing appearance as it stood out in a gorge against the sky . Regarding it a second time , Strain observed a zigzag line running up the face of it , as if drawn by a pencil . Indeed it looked more like a streak of forked lightning , pinned to the breast of the mountain , than a path for a living thing to tread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves , yet even the inclined plane of the path lies at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees . Here the mules began to labor ! and every few minutes would stop and take breath , and then of their own accord start on . It is in such cases as this that man comes to admire the patience and sagacity of this stubborn animal . There was no whipping , or spurring , or abusive words ; mAn and mule hadboth changednatures-one had become docile and reliable , and the other kind . The natives are exceedingly cruel to their animals , and although the Chilians are the best riders in the world , they have no affection for the horse like the Arab . Strain therefore turned with surprise to Frederico , as if he expected a transformation in his physical appearance . He was unfeeling toward his animals , and used only coarse and abusive language to them ; but now his voice was kind and encouraging , and he coaxed and praised by turns . The poor creatures strained faithfully up the steep acclivity ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now high , and the fatigue combined , told heavily upon them , and it was painful to witness their sufferings . Their breath came quick and fast , and was ejected from their nostrils with a loud sound , showing with what force it was expelled from the lungs . But apparently conscious that they had a definite task to perform , they needed neither whip nor spur , but , after stopping to breathe a few minutes , would patiently recommence their painful task . The scenery now grew wilder and more sublime . As they approached the summit the sea of peaks , which before had been shut out by the nearer mountains , began to unroll itself , and reveal to the startled traveler the terrific place into which he had pushed himself . At length they stood on the top , more than two miles high , and lo ! there spread out a scene around , below , and beyond them , that language has no words to describe or to express the emotions it awakens . Standing in the centre of this vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in width , and lost north and south in the distance , one seems to have been transported to a hitherto undiscovered world . It is a wilderness of snow-capped mountain masses . The sky was clear , and the sun , in all his evening glory , hung just above the snowy peaks in the west , flooding them with a strange splendor . Between lay the deep , dark valley , from which the eye turned with a shudder ; while before them rose the enormous white column of Tnpungati twenty thousand feet into the heavens , its everlasting robe of white dazzling the eye as it stood bathed in the full glories of the setting sun . How still , how serene , slept that ocean of glittering peaks ! how still , how mysterious , spread the darkness through those unfathomable abysses ! Not a sound broke the impressive silence there , save the low wail of the wind . Not an animate object relieved the utter desohtion , save the black form of a solitary condor wheeling slowly round a savage peak , as if by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is on a vast scale , as if God had exulted in the exertion of power when he had heaved these mighty masses together , and the soul is stunned and stupefied , and stands and trembles and staggers under the majesty and power it can not comprehend . The tremendous chasms and precipices , or frightful abysses , which are peculiar to the Andes , inspire feelings of terror as well as sublimity . Strain , who is peculiarly unimpressible to natural scenery , declared that this one view amply repaid him for all the discomforts and fatigues of the whole journey . In his diary he says : " Had I been blasts , I should decidedly have received an impression . I have heard and read much of natural scenery whose grandeur and sublimity had produced in observers a feeling of awe , and yet afterward viewed it myself without surprise , almost with indifference . The storm at sea , in all imaginable phases , I have witnessed without a profound impression . Neither have I been much impressed by the thunder-storm in the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which so many highly-wrought pages have been lavished . Two views only , of which I have heard and read much , did not fail to realize my expectations . The first was the Andes , as seen from Valparaiso in winter ; and the next , the view from the summit of the mountain pass of Uspallata. " * The slope by which they descended lay at an angle of about forty-five degrees , and was inclosed by lofty mountains , whose dazzling whito and sun-tipped summits contrasted stronglywith the dark depths into which they were plunging , and made one think of the Valley of the Shadow of Death . The wind was piercing , and they became so thoroughly chilled that they were compelled to dismount and walk to keep from being benumbed . Rattling down the narrow way , often in danger of tripping and rolling over , they at length , at half past eight , reached the * There is a good anecdote told of Sir Francis Head when he stood on t*is summit . His remark was not quite so bad as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How nice I " hut approximated it . Surveying the wondrous spectacle , he exclaimed , " What can he more beautiful ! " to which his attendant , a Cornish miner , replied , " Them things , Sir , that do wear caps and aprons . There is not much to choose between them . // valley , and , mounting , pushed on to find a resting-place for the night . After about an hour 's ride they halted , and began to look out for a spot to pitch their camp . They finally selected a huge porphyritic rock , because Astorga 's peon had concealed under it two sticks of wood on his way over . It was a bleak and cheerless place ; all around was black volcanic rock-not , a sign of vegetation-nothing to relieve the eye but the snowy summits that stood , " Like Earth 's gigantic sentinels , Diecoureing in the sky , " far , far above them . It was a relief to turn from the darkness that lay in vast , dense masses in the gorges and chasms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear atmosphere of those high regions . Contrasted with the great motionless forms that lifted themselves on every side , and the profound silence and deadness around , they , with their sparkii 7 - I // hag , flashing beams , seemed like living , sentient beings moving in a joyous world by themselves . The travelers , who seemed mere insects amidst these gigantic forms , sat around their little fire smoking cigars until ten o'clock , when they prepared to turn in . On examining the stock of blankets , cloaks , ponchos , etc. , on hand , it was found that Strain and Astorga alone were provided with any . An unlined poncho , which could furnish no protection against the bleak mountain wind , was all that Frederico had . The selfishness and cupidity of this fellow had displayed themselves more and more ever since they started . In the first place , Strain had given him a third more for the two mules than they were worth ; in the second place , he had paid all the expenses of the journey , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him money he was sure never to see again . He had also bought a large supply of horse feed , of which his mules never got a taste , although Frederico used one of them in place of his old black horse , which had broken down . The coh got the whole , which put him in fine condition for sale when they should reach Mendoza . But his coolness and impudence reached their climax this night , when he deliberately placed himself between Astorga and Strain , thus getting the threefold benefit of the blankets , of being protected from the wind , and having the warmth of two bodies around his own . Strain had the windward side , and tried to get a little sleep . The covering , however , was too narrow , and , lifting with every flaw of wind , kept one side shivering all night . When the cold became insufferable he would turn on the other side , and so kept shifting from side to side till morning . To compose him still more , Frederico lay snoring in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found his quarters . Strain 's only consolation was in vowing a terrible revenge at some future time . Fortune helped him in this ; for the colt that devoured all his feed became so frisky that , when Frederico mounted him in the streets of Mendoza , the vicious beast threw him over his head . He dared not again mount his pet horse ; so his mortification was greater than if he had lost a dozen animals . To be an inhabitant of Mendoza and not be able to mount any horse , is not to be a gentleman . In fact , not to be able to ride is the next door to crime . They rose at daylight , *nd the poor mules , which had passed the night without any food , were glad to leave so inhospitable a region . The temperature may be judged from the fact that the entire margin of the mountain torrent whose course they followed was firmly frozen . As they were slowly passing down this valley , bounded on either side by enormous masses of porphyritic rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came wellnigh being his last . The descent having become more gradual , he relaxed his vigilance over his large English saddle , which had hitherto , by shoving forward on the mule 's neck , caused him no little inconvenience and anxiety . He was gazing up and around on the savage scenery , and did not notice that they had come to a sharp hill . Going down this the saddle slipped forward , when the mule gave two violent kicks in the air , which threw Strain , in a complete somersault , flat on his back on a rock twenty feet below . Not satisfied with this performance , the mule rushed forward and attempted to plant his fore-feet on Strain 's breast . Though stunned by his fall , he bad sufficient presence of mind to detect the object of the brute , and avoid the blow , by suddenly rolling down the hill . The mule concluded not to follow , and dashed off in another direction till he became entangled by the saddle , which had turned , and was brought back by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef at the camp of an old muleteer , and then proceeded on to the Puenta del Inca , one of the objects of interest in this pass . It is a natural bridge , formed of conglomerate , about one hundred and twenty feet long and ninety wide . This bridge is an object of greater curiosity to the scientific man than to the traveler . Here is a valley , a mile wide and of great depth , which has been scooped out , for miles above and below , by the terrific torrents that are formed by the melting of the snows on the surrounding mountains . There is no other outlet for the vast accumulation of water on their sides and summits . Now this bridge is not a boulder , or section of a mountain , which has been heaved by some convulsion of nature from its bed , and hurled into the ravine , damming up the stream , but is a part of the mountain itself . It seems impossible , however , that the torrent should have scooped out this tremendous gorge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a rock only ninety feet thick , leaving a comparatively fragile structure standing amidst the monuments and traces of its power and fury . In contemplating it , the mind goes back for an explanation to that period in the history of the world when the climate was mild , and there was no snow on these mountains , and but a rivulet flowed here , or so cold that the snow never melted . As the climate changed , and the snow bec , an to accumulate and to melt on these mountains , the stream formed and gradually increased in size , and in the progress of ages bored this tunnel , which widened and deepened with the steady increase of water , till now under its arch flows a frightful torrent . Within a few yards of the bridge there is a spring of hot water ; and directly under , in a shelf of the rock , and only a few inches distant , are two other copious springs of an entirely different temperature . About one o'clock they reached scanty vegetation , where they unsaddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a siesta . Awaking about four in the afternoon , Strain saw , on the opposite side of the valley , a series // of zigzags on an almost perpendicular mountain , fifteen hundred feet high . They looked like mere lines drawn backward and forward on the steep slope . From their regularity he thought they must be made by animals , though he could hardly conceive of the boldness that would induce them to venture on such a fearful elevation with so narrow a foothold . But vrhile he lay wondering six guanacos marched , in a stately and dignified manner , over the crest of the mountain . As they came on in single file , each form was distinctly drawn against the clear blue sky , far up in the heavens . Without the Ic st hesitation , and apparently as easy and confident as they would walk the valley beneath , they began their perilous descent . Saddling up , they forded the deep and rocky torrent along whose margin they had been traycling ; and , a little after dark , reached a cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found eight or ten muleteers encamped , who were on their way to Valparaiso after merchandise . Around the mouth were heaped , in confusion , pack-saddles , cargas , and so on ; while in the centre burned a fire , throwing a red glare on the otherwise smoky , black walls of the cavern . Around it were grouped the peons , in various attitudes and fantastic costumes , their features assuming a strange wildness in the light of the fire  --  the whole resembling a bandit encampment in the fastnesses of the mountains . These were , however , harmless men , who greeted the strangers as they entered hospitably , the owner of the troupe rising from the seat of honor alwnys assigned to him , and conducting Mr. Strain to it , who , as a foreigner , was peculiarly his guest . He then invited them to partake of the supper , which was nearly ready . They declining , he produced cigars , and Strain , in thanking him , incidentally remarked that they were peculiarly acceptable to him , as his had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Strain to do him the honor to accept a bundle for the rest of his journey , assuring him that he had an ample supply , and even if he had not , he could resort to ciga*ettos , to which gentlemen from foreign parts were not accustomed . Courtesy forbade a refusal ; and Strain thought that-although the day before his wrath was kindled at the whole race of Mendozans by the conduct of Frederico-there might be some true gentlemen among them after all . And so it is ; a man may he made to sleep at night exposed to a chilling wind , by the selfishness of one man , and yet be repaid the next day by the courtesy and kindness of another . In a short time the cheerful cries of their peons , sounding nearly overhead as they encouraged their mules up the steep ascent , hastened their departure , and our travelers , after expressing many thanks , mounted and pushed on to the Penon Rajada , or River Stone , where they had determined to pass the night . This rock had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , and rolled down LO the roadside , where it stopped , with its summit so far overhanging its base that it furnished comfortable shelter for three persons . It looked for all the world like a huge man-trap , balanced there on purpose to fall upon and crush the too trusting traveler . Astorga , Frederico , and Strain stretched themselves under this , Frederico , of course , in the middle , leaving a rough stone for Strain to find the soft side of . His two companions , enjoying the mildness of the night as compared with the preceding one , lay and sang national songs till a late hour , making the rocks around ring with their music . Coiled up under a beetling rock , buried , as it were , in the heart of the mountains , their merry songs seemed strangely out of place . One of these , designed to ridicule the priesthood-called the Franciscan Friar ( " Padre Francisco " ) - was full of wit and humor . The people have no reverence for the priesthood , who are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very liberal to strangers . Roused up at four o'clock in the morning they pushed on , and after traveling about three miles , came upon a large troop of mules bivouacked . Among the travelers were several women , who were just rising from their mattresses , which were spread upon the ground , and making their toilet preparatory to setting out . Some had children too young to trust on the back of a mule , and these were placed in baskets and slung across the animal . Whenever a pair could not be had to adjust the balance , a stone , or some weight , was put in the other basket , and thus they were carried over thesedangerous passes . Those in the camp*kindly invited them to take coffee , and when they were about to proceed the women presented them with a pound cake . It is strange how these little kindnesses in a desolate , dreary country take hold of one 's heart , and make him think better of his kind . With a " God bless the ladies ! " our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laderas , " as these three fearful passes of the Andes are called . A ladera is a narrow path cut along the side of the mountain , which is perpendicular on one side , and nearly so on the other . In making the one hundred and thirty miles , the width of the Andes here , the traveler surmounts the obsta ' - des in various ways . Sometimes the bed of a torrent furnishes them comparatively easy traveling ; again the gorge turns off in the wrong direction among the mountains , and they come abruptly upon a steep mountain , up which they are compelled to toil in laborious zigzags , and descend in the same way to another valley , which stretchestoward the point they desire to reach . At another time the mountain comes down in a sheer precipice to the torrent along whose bed they wish to journey . A rocky margin has hitherto furnished them foothold ; but it now presents nothing but a fearful abyss , through which the foaming waters go with a loud and angry roar . The mountain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zigzags , and so the path is cut along the face of the precipice , di- // rectly above the stream . In some places it is not more than three feet wide , and cumbered with loose stones . The mountain side between the path and the torrent below , in some places , lies at a slight angle , in others it is a perpendicular cliff so that a man on a mule can reach out his arm and drop a stone nearly a thousand feet into the shuddering abyss below . Neither is this narrow shelf level , but you ascend and descend the path , necessarily keeping just above the point where the sheer face of the precipice begins , for it would be next to impossible to cut a way along the smooth face of the cliff . In making the first descent Strain said , " I can compare my own feelings , as my mule smelled his way along the narrow descent with his nose almost between his legs , while his short neck and the path were entirely invisible , only to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a disagreeable state of uncertainty as to whether the gutter or trough at the eaves will sustain his weight when he reaches there . " It seems impossible that men should ever get accustomed to this perilous mode of traveling ; yet the women of this region will sit composedly on their mules , and look down hundreds of feet , and see naught but a dark abyss through which the torrent is raving . A single false step , a slight stroke of the load against the rock , the least start , and animal and rider would disappear like a flitting shadow into the gulf beneath . The last , the Ladera de las Vacas , is the worst of all . The mountain here comes to a point , presenting nothing but asharp profile . Around this profile , or edge of the mountain , the path bends in an acute angle . In approaching this point , and doubling it , the narrow track passes directly along the edge of a precipice that descends in a straight line to the gorge below . Neither does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , but ascends sharply to it , at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees , and descends abruptly the other side . At this point it is solid rock , which has been perforated by the feet of mules , each succeeding year wearing them deeper . Into these holes the cautions , sagacious animals now trod with great care and precision . The slightest mistake here would prove fatal , and our travelers held their breath as they crawled along toward the dangerous point . Even the muleteers who cross the Andes the most frequently never get so accustomed to its danger as to pass it without great anxiety . Pricking his ears , his nose to the rock as if smelling the track , the leading mule slowly felt his way along the narrow shelf . In approaching the edge of the mountain where the path turns it seems to the eye to end entirely , the narrow gash it makes showing clear and distinct like a human feature against the sky beyond . Above was the almost perpendicular and savage mountain ; below , the dizzy precipice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had they met other travelers here , one or the other party must have perished . Indeed , in many places along this pass , it would have been impossible for a mule to have turned round , and frequently the path was so narrow that a man could not dismount to save himself , and must have gone over the cliff with his animal . One can well imagine that to such dangers the traveler can never become indifferent , and one unaccustomed to dizzy heights and dangerous paths must never trust his eyes over the precipice , or look upon the savage scenery around him . At length they reached the point where the path bent around the edge of the cliff and then all the sagacity of the mules were put in requisition . The angle is so acute that the animal has to bend its body almost double to get around , and each foot is lifted and planted with a care that shows he is aware of his danger . Every one felt relieved when this last and most dangerous of the laderas was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description on his passage of this pass . It is well that the accident mentioned occnrred at the commencement of the pass , and not in its more elevated and more dangerous portions : " As soon as the leading mule came to the commencement of the pass , he stopped , evidently unwilling to proceed , and , of course , all the rest stopped also . " He was the finest mule we had , and on that account had twice as much to carry as any of the others ; his load had never been relieved , and it consisted of four portmanteaus , two of which belonged to me , and contained not only a very heavy bag of dollars , but also papers , which were of such consequence that I could hardly have continued my journey without them . The peons now redoubled their cries , and leaning over the sides of their mules , and picking up stones , they threw them at the leading mule , who now commenced his journey over the path . With his nose to the ground , literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing the position of his feet , if he found the ground would not bear , until he came to the bad part of the pass , when he again stopped ; and I then certainly began to look with great anxiety at my portmanteaus ; but the peons again threw stones at him , and he continued his path , and reached me in safety : several others followed . At last a young mule carrying a portmanteau , with two large sacks of provisions , and many other things , in passing the bad point struck his load against the rock , which knocked his two hind legs over the precipice , and the loose stones immediately began to roll away from under them ; however , his fore-legs were still upon the narrow path ; he had no room to put his head there , but he placed his nose on the path on his left , and appeared to hold on by his mouth . His perilous fate was soon decided by a loose mule who came up , and in walking along after him , knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is balance , and head over heels the poor creature instantly commenced a fall which // was really quite terrific . With all his haggage firmly lashed to him , he rolled down the steep slope until he came to the part which was perpendicular , and there he seemed to hound off , and turning round in the air fell into a deep torrent on his back and upon his baggage , and instantly disappeared . I thonght , of course , that he was killed ; hut up he rose , looking wild and scared , and immediately endeavored to stem the torrent which was foaming about him . It was a noble effort , and for a moment he seemed to succeed , but the eddy suddenly caught the great load which was upon his back , and turned him completely over ; down went his head with all the baggage , and as he was carried down the stream , all I saw were his hind-quarters , and his long , thin , wet tail lashing the , water . As suddenly , however , np @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went down the stream , turned round and round by the eddy , until passing the corner of the rock I lost sight of him . I saw , however , the peons with lassos in their hands , run down the side of the torrent for some little distance ; but they soon stopped , and after looking toward the poor mule for some seconds , their earnest attitude gradually relaxed , and when they walked toward me I concluded that all was over . I walked np to the peons , and was just going to speak to them when I saw at a distance a solitary mule walking toward us . " We instantly perceived that he was the Phaeton whose fall we had just witnessed , and in a few moments he came up to us to join his comrades . He was , of course , dripping wet ; his eye looked dull , and his whole countenance was dejected ; however , none of his bones were broken , he was very little cut , and the bulletin of his ' health was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules all have to join the troop , or rather the leading mule which carries the bell , he continued his course , and actually walked over the pass without compulsion , though certainly with great caution . " The great danger and difficulties of the journey were now over , and they trotted gayly down the valley , the slope of which every moment grew more gradual . About noon they halted on the margin of a stream , where they breakfasted on the cakes given them by the warm-hearted Mendozinos . Soon after leaving the turbid stream along which they had been traveling they struck across a shingly , barren plain , and at twelve o'clock burst into the beautiful and fertile valley of the Uspallata , whose green fields , luxuriant foliage , and limpid stream was a pleasant relief after three days ' journeying amidst the terrific scenery , barren rocks , snow-peaks , and mad torrents of the Andes . The valley is six miles long and two miles wide , and contains but one settlement , composed of a few small houses . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard , with his buxom wife , received the travelers very kindly . A hut was VOL . XVII. - No. 101. -P x* assigned them , and Strain , in the evening , having nothing else to do , counted the dogs in the court-yard . In one group there were twenty , looking gaunt and ferocious as half- starved wolves . It needed not the caution of the hostess not to venture out , for he must be a bold man indeed who would expose himself to such an array of beasts . The Guacho of the plain delights to surround himself with formidable dogs , and is seldom seen away from his habitation without a pack of six or seven at his heels . Bertoldo , the peon , having an idle afternoon on his hands , celebrated his safe passage of the Cordilleras by getting " gloriously drunk . " Like most men in this condition he became exceedingly affectionate , and after expressing his attachment to Strain in the strongest terms , at last approached him with a would-be grave and serious but in reality a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , his mind was fully made up-that he never would leave him until he had seen him safely in Buenos Ayres . Rum is a sad leveler , a thorough Red Republican , and produces the same effects the world over . The beds were made on the floor , and just as Strain and Astorga had begun to undress for the night the Captain and his wife came in to have a quiet game of cards with Don Frederico . Finding the lady did not stand on ceremony with him , Strain thought he would return the compliment , and having finished his preparations for the night turned in , and , lighting a cigar , soon smoked himself to sleep-not before , however , he had seen the money he had given Frederico to pay expenses transferred to the Captain and his wife . The next day they proceeded down the valley , and after riding a few miles stopped at a spring , when Frederico attempted , without breaking the seal , to read the letter of the Captain of the Guard to the authorities of Mendoza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , to Strain 's astonishment , Astorga , to whom he appealed , said he could see no objection to it , as the letter related entirely to them and their baggage . At noon they arrived at an elevated table - land , from whence they had a distant view of the pampas , which lost itself in the eastern horizon like a sleeping ocean . Nature seems to have formed the Andes as a sort of compensation for the vast and almost interminable plains that stretch westward from the Atlantic . Strain thought they had now done with mountain travel ; but in leaving the table-land they descended a deep ra*ine for ten miles , which , for picturesque beauty , exceeded any thing he had seen on the route . After a farther tedious ride of forty-five miles they arrived at Villa Vicenejo , where they passed the night . Their landlady gave them their tea by candle-light , and then all began to prepare for the night . This was done by each one  --  the man , his wife , daughters , and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without paying the slightest attention to the strangers at their side , undressing and // o94 qwq her also . its being the spot where one of the Seven Churches grew in " tribulation and poverty ; " but which is now better known as the home of the plague and of all manner of Oriental abom inations . And so , by way of Chios , and Samos , and Cos , and Tubs , and a score of other isles of old fame , we came to Rhodes , where once was , but now is , not , the Colossus , and , dropping anchor close by the old ruined tower of crusading times , we left the Lotus at her anchor while we took up our quarters on shore and looked here and there at the ruins of the city . For Rhodes is a mass of ruin . When I was there some years ago it was one of the finest cities of the Levant , and the old street of the knights was worth           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
