txt ART . IX . - Life Pictures : from a Pastor 's Note-Book . By ROBERT TURNBULL . New York : Sheldon , Blakeman , &amp; Co. 1857. l2mo. pp. 342 . WE have not taken this book as our text , because it is in every , or even in any , respect its author 's most noteworthy book . But it is his latest , and he has been so long and so usefully before the literary world , that we should do ourselves injustice in not availing ourselves of the opportunity he now offers us of rendering him justice , though tardy . His " Christ in History , " which we characterized in a " critical notice " of half a dozen lines , might have afforded an easier theme for a journal precluded , equally by our own sense of fitness and the just expectations of our public , from discussions which trench upon the grounds of controversial theology . In that work there was not a leading view or pervading sentiment , and hardly a subsidiary thought , which could fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the work now in hand // the author 's own creed and ritual , though not obtrusively urged , are necessarily made somewhat prominent . The first thought that suggests itself concerning Dr. Turnbull 's style is , that it eludes criticism . Apart from the ideas and sentiments which it expresses , it has no striking traits that demand either praise or censure ; unless this negative statement be in itself the highest praise . His diction is never inflated , or ambitious , or redundant ; for he evidently never writes for the sake of airing his vocabulary , or with the purpose of attracting notice or acquiring reputation merely as a writer . On the other hand , there are no marks of negligence and no sins against good taste ; for these can not be even in the rapid composition of a man whose native powers and liberal culture conspire to give him free command of language . In fine , Dr. Turnbull 's sole aim evidently is the direct and intelligible expression of his thought , - the transfer by the simplest means possible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reader . In the singleness of this aim , he perhaps sometimes omits legitimate and graceful modes of persuasion and impression , glances from a topic before he has exhausted its wealth of argument or motive , and makes less than he easily might of openings for appeal to the fancy and the emotional nature . We are occasionally annoyed by the brevity of a strain which we would gladly have prolonged , and especially by the very cursory treatment of scenes or events in themselves deeply pathetic ; and yet we are inclined to think it the more manly part for the author to leave his readers to do their own weeping , instead of playing Melpomene at every hand 's turn . Dr. Turubull is a strong and earnest worker in the highest department of thought and effort . He has faith in Christianity , not only as the Gospel of redemption to the isolated soul , but as a regenerating force , whose development has given and will give the key-note to all history , and whose workings , whether traced in the great heart of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual , are the surest evidence of its Divine source and mission . He is earnestly solicitous to exalt this force to its due place in the esteem of influential minds , and to imbue with its spirit those // whose action is to mould the nearer , and thus the more distant , future of our country and our common Christendom . This aim , so broad and high , is of course incompatible with sectarianism , or with other than the most comprehensive views and the most catholic sympathies . His books are thus adapted to win the interest , sustain the faith , and stimulate the courage , of Christians of every denomination , and can in no sense be deemed the exclusive concern or property of those appertaining to his own section of the Church . And here we ought to explain what we said with reference to the incidentally denominational character of the book now under review . It is a record of facts and conversations that have fallen within his own knowledge and experience ; and , as he is a Calvinistic Baptist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for the most part either lain within or led to the fold to which his own pastorate belongs . His specific purpose in this work we can best define by quoting a portion of his Preface . " The object of the following Life Pictures , ' including narratives , conversations , letters , and so forth , is to bring out , in concrete form , the true idea of the inner or divine life . " It is designed especially for inquiring minds , haunted , perhaps , by the prevalent scepticism , or by other forms of doubt . " The spiritual life is ever a struggle with opposing elements ; and in almost every mind there comes a period of doubt and conflict , always painful , sometimes appalling . This is the case especially with strong , contemplative natures , who revolve the problem of life in its deeper significance . " Such are to be found in all spheres , whether of professional or of business life ; and often , when we least suspect it , in the bosom of our families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitive , restless age . It is the price we pay for our advanced intelligence and civilization . It is the dim night of our resplendent day . But as the most beautiful light is born of darkness , so the faith which springs from conflict is often the strongest and best . " From an intimate acquaintance , during a pastorate of a quarter of a century , with a great variety of minds , many of them reclaimed from scepticism , the author supposed he might prepare a work which would be useful in this direction . The experience of some of these reclaimed sceptics is given in this volume . // " Other sketches and illustrations are added , to bring out , as vividly as possible , the various phases of Christian experience , from its beginning in regeneration to its consummation in glory . The author believes that it is our privilege and duty , as Christians , to rise into a higher plane of life than is generally hoped for in the present day . He is persuaded , also , that the true idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best antidote to infidelity . To aid in the attainment of that perfect love , ' which casteth out ' both doubt and fear , is one aim of this work ; for in this consists the essence of the true life , which is ever a vital divine force or germ , the invariable tendency of which must be to beauty , fruitfulness , and joy . As it comes from God , it ascends to God . Hence it is fitly described as a life in God , ' ever blessed and immortal . " - pp. iii . - v. In pursuance of this design , the author has evidently kept himself within the limits of fact , not only as regards the main outlines of each sketch , but as to the details in which fancy might often have striven to usurp the place of memory . The characters are not idealized , but are such as we have all met with , some of them commonplace characters , except as brought out in strong individuality by peculiar religious experiences , - others of them persons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we have known , and not like the saints of fiction whom we never wish to know . The conversations in which the writer professes to have borne part are such as we can have no doubt took place ; and so far are they from being compressed into the prim , artificial moulds in which book-dialogues are often cast , that we can hardly conceive of such talks being written down except from memory . Objections and difficulties are met in these colloquies with great skill indeed , but in the off-hand way in which a man of the author 's large resources might have met them without specific preparation , not with the elaborate and exhausting treatment which they would have received in his study . The book would have been more exciting , had Dr. Turubull drawn upon his imagination for characters and incidents ; but to us it is immeasurably more interesting and valuable , as a transcript of fact and experience , than had it been merely his own opinions and speculations dramatized . We are thankful to Dr. Turubull for not having given us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // this kind to be injurious in precise proportion to their reputed excellence , that is , to their vividness of character-painting , their minuteness of detail , and their religiousness of tone . When skilfully written , they present ideals of attainment and experience , which either can not be reached by frail humanity , or which are ill adapted to the condition and needs of the world as it is ; and in the former case they dishearten , in the latter they mislead , aspirants for goodness , while in both they tend to make the working-day piety of the current age seem low and vapid . We have read , we can not say how often , and with an interest that never wanes , " The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain ' * but we should hardly like to put the story into the hands of the class of persons for whom it was specially designed . We have known not a few very devout persons in humble and obscure conditions , and are sure that the best of them could not for his life talk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to cast reproach on their plain and simple way of acting out their Christian principle , by holding forth his grandiloquent discourse as a model for them . If we are to have religions fiction , let it , like Bunyan 's great prose epic , appropriate to itself realms of fancy not occupied by actual life . Vision and allegory are legitimate vehicles of instruction and impression ; for they may inspire and invigorate the reader without creating false expectations . They may fill the soul with noble and holy thought , without offering unattainable models , or pouring contempt on the simple , unpretending forms in which true religion incarnates itself in the walks of common life . They are penitence , duty , prayer , and praise personified , not men travestied . Above all , for argumentative purposes , religious fiction is worse than worthless ; for there is no power of conviction or persuasion in deeds which we know not that men have ever wrought , in utterances the like of which may never have proceeded from mortal lips , in experiences which may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may be demonstration . What man has been , represents actual causes and forces in the moral universe . What man has attained , is attainable by others . What men have found true , they have proved true . Temptations , doubts , difficulties , which a single individual // has encountered and overcome , lie , no doubt , in the path of many , and it behooves such to know the modes and the weapons by which they have been met and vanquished . And as for what seem peculiar experiences , the probability is that they are not so . There are few or no moral idiosyncrasies . The religious teacher , who has studied and probed what seems to him a case entirely unprecedented , may feel sure , if he so shapes his discourse as to meet that one case , that he is giving utterance to what a score or a hundred of his congregation need to have said ; and by a homily , which is adapted , so far as he knows , to the demands of but a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obligation on a large class of his hearers . We deem it , then , a crowning merit of the book before us , that it is biography , not fiction . Yet it is biography , not cold and unimpassioned , but cast into vivid , glowing forms by profound appreciation and intense sympathy ; and as it often approaches the confines of the unseen world , it borrows thence much of its fervent rhetoric and brilliant imagery , and expatiates with firm tread and clear vision in " the country of Beulah . " We have seldom met with anything more beautiful than the following description of the renewed life of a haughty and selfish woman , a queenly wife , a passionately fond mother , whose heart is won for heaven by the death of the children who had been her idols . " Heaven began to open upon Aurelia . God was just ; God also was wise and merciful . Deat.h as well as life was his . Through his love and power , death , the curse , was transformed into a blessing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer death . Life is the preparation for heaven ; death , the dawn of an immortal day . Her children were not lost , not even to her . Ah ! how radiant and beautiful they appeared in the new spiritual world into which , by faith , she had come ! Their green graves , and the flowers blooming there , were the lowly but significant emblems of the supernal glory ; as , indeed , all the forms of the outward world are but the image and emblem of the heavenly state . " Well , then , Aurelia must live , not for herself , but for others ; not for time , but for eternity . The long , long summer is dawning yonder upon the hills of God . A few more years , and she will pass to the heavenly home . This life is transient , and yet , as the pledge and preparation // of the eternal life , how significant and beautiful ! How glorious even death , transfigured by the light of heaven , just as yon thunderclouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thus Aurelia walked in the light of God . Heaven was in her heart , including Christ and the holy angels , the spirits of the just , and all the glorified children , who wander on the marge of the river of life , crowning themselves with unfading lilies " And as the light in an alabaster vase renders it luminous as well as beautiful , so the light in her soul shone from her face , and shed soft radiance around her . She was lovelier than ever ; she was beautiful , especially to the wretched . She was happy , too , - happier far than in the days of her vanity . Indeed , she told a friend she was happy because she loved , - that she had never , till now , known true joy . The past was a splendid but deceitful masquerade , behind whose glancing forms lurked sin and death . But now she looked upon things as they were , and found that all was full of God , full of blessing . Earth and heaven were really one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the springtime , was the pledge and preparation for the other . " And thus Aurelia walked softly in the opening dawn of an eternal day . " - pp. 288 , 289 . We have also been impressed equally with the simplicity , the rationalness , and the beauty of the author 's own views of the heavenly state , in his reported conversation with one , the days of whose slow and peaceful decline were passed " within sight of the city she was going to , " and in near and happy communion with " the inhabitants thereof . " " She asked me , one day , what I thought of heaven , - whether it was a place , or simply a state or sphere . " I replied , both ; for while its essential felicity must consist in the flowering of our spiritual perfection , and must bear the same relation to our present state as summer to spring , or the white lily ' to its stem and root , our finite natures demand locality and form , and must ever conceive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , it so seemed to her . She wanted to be at home there . " But will not the place , ' she added , be very different from the one we now occupy ? ' " Of course , just as the risen body will be very different from the present . Yet they will each of them sustain an intimate relation to the other . " Flesh and blood , " we are told , " can not inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption . " This gross , // changeable , and mortal frame will give place to one ethereal and perfect , or , as the Apostle Paul terms it , " spiritual " and " incorruptible . " The old heavens and the old earth will pass away , but there will be " new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness . " Of course we can not well conceive this new order of things now , just as a chrysalis , supposing it ( for the sake of illustration ) conscious and rational , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation through which it is to pass , could form no conception of the new world of sunshine and flowers in which , as a winged , ethereal creature , it will expatiate . ' " But do you think , ' she added , with animation , we shall know one anqther there ? ' " I see no reason to doubt it , ' was my reply ; for we shall certainly lose none of our essential faculties in heaven ; nay , they will be greatly refined and exalted , - how far , of course , we can not tell . But we are expressly assured that we shall know even as we are known . Besides , however ethereal or spiritual the glorified body may be , it will yet possess form ; and , for my part , I see no reason to doubt that the old expression , the old familiar smile , which , after all , is more of the soul than of the body , will remain , and be recognized in that happy home . ' " That is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be so . At any rate , we shall love one another there , as deeply and as tenderly as on earth , nay , more so , and that implies that we shall know each other . ' " Of course ; for heaven is diverse from earth only in this respect , that it is an advance in the order of things ; and since we find , both in the processes of nature and of grace , the one state or form always presupposing the next , - nay , preparing for it , as the spring for the sumruer , the root the flower , the child the man , - so we must believe that heaven is but the " flower of this world 's bud , " - the perfect , resplendent day of this morning dawn . " There shall be no night there. *** " Ab , then I shall be at home there , I am sure . ' " Yes ; the place , the sphere , the home , whatever you choose to call it , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Will it be one of repose or activity ? ' " Of both , in my humble opinion ; for both exist in God ; a fact symbolized in the stars , sweeping with inconceivable velocity through boundless space , but in such order as to secure the most perfect repose . We are creatures of activity and progress , and , even here , are never so happy as when bounding along in the full and orderly play of all our powers . But we are sadly clogged , and often wearied , with our work on earth ; and so rest is grateful and refreshing . Night covers the // care-worn and weary with its dewy wings ; and thus we often conceive of heaven as a place of rest for weary , wandering feet ; and so it is , - how complete and blessed , those who have fallen asleep in Jesus only know . But as there is no night there , of course we shall suffer no bodily imperfection or painful toil . In the unclouded day , with minds clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it in purity and splendor , we shall revolve joyfully , like the stars around our central sun , ascending and descending on wings of fire , or sweeping far off in some magnificent orbit of duty and of joy . ' " Ali ! it seems to me , ' said Mrs. , after all , it will be pleasanter to wander , as angels , with those we love , on the banks of the river of life , or to sit under the branches of the trees , or , lying on the sides of some sunny hill , to look far over the heavenly landscape , or the great crystal sea , with its ever-living , ever-musical waves . ' " But you forget , ' said I , with a smile , that we are both speaking , in figures derived from earth , of what , while we believe and anticipate as something unspeakably delightful , can not be adequately conceived . see through a glass darkly . " " We know in part , and we prophesy in part . " But one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be , after all , we shall be ourselves there ; and so the place , the sphere , will be home to us . Our heaven will be made up of divine thoughts , tender affections , bright fancies , high aims , generous impulses , sweet activities , and glorious hopes , perfect in their character , and boundless in their variety . " ' - pp. 336 - 340 . The longest sketch in this volume is the story of the Student-Sceptic , ' ' - the narrative of the lapse into unbelief and the conversion , of one whose pride of intellect had driven him to that vague pantheism which is little else than an alias for atheism . In its downward steps , the course is precisely that measured by very many young men of brilliant promise and commanding influence ; its return-path , we fear , is not so often trodden , yet would be oftener , were not the union of religious zeal with gentleness and calm discretion so rare in the endeavor to win back those in error , - were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of those who enter the lists with infidelity . We apprehend that a very large amount of unbelief grows out of the conceit of knowledge and wisdom , which was never so rife as at the present day , and which characterizes equally the self-consciousness of individuals and their esti21 * // mate of the age . When mystery clung close to every object and event in the out *ard universe , before sweeping generalizations had enabled ignorance to put on the show of knowledge , while men still felt that they were strangers in an Unknoxvn world , the mind readily sought the repose of faith , and the idea of a positive revelation was congenial , as compensating for the doubt and darkness that rested upon nature by assurance and certainty in the domain of morals and the realm of spiritual being . But now the order of proximate causes is traced with a good degree of precision ; phenomena are classified , and thus seem to be accounted for ; and general terms , which are neither defined nor understood , - such as gravitation , affinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the belief that they have laid bare the springs of universal nature and the causes of events . The veil of mystery is lifted a little way ; the dense fog that hid even the nearest objects has risen from the ground , and hangs in clouds over our heads ; and because we can for short distances see , and calculate , and predict , we imagine ourselves competent to solve all questions , and to attain ultimate truth , by our own unaided powers . We therefore apply our infinitesimal calculus to cosmogony , to ethics , to religion , and to the very source of being . It is as if the child who has just come into possession of a two-foot rule , and had ascertained by it the dimensions of his nursery , should forthwith start with it to measure the earth 's circumference . What has been said in scorn is profoundly true , - Ignorance is the mother of Faith ; and intellectual humility can alone bring us to that craving for and trust in revelation which are essential characteristics of the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any child of man otherxvise than profoundly ignorant . We are no more capable than the unlettered savage of determining ultimate causes . Our own being , and all being , are enigmas , which defy our attempts at solution . When we go back in our cosmogony to the commencement of the present cycle of events , and thence still backward to the beginning of each antecedent cycle of the geological epochs , we are arrested by miracle at every stage ; and the more numerous the succes // sive creations we are able to trace by infallible tokens , the more utterly impossible does it become for us to apply any known laws of causation , - the more imperatively are we constrained to the hypothesis of Omnipotent Wisdom as the sole fountain of life and of being . Then , too , as regards our relations to the external world , and to our fellow-citizens in it , while certain primal duties are engraved as with the point of a sunbeam , there are numerous questions of interest and obligation , which the more diligently we ponder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - the more urgent becomes our need of a law based on adequate authority , - the more cordially do we welcome the revelation which disentangles the blended threads of our destiny , and puts into our hands the clew to our true happiness and good . In like manner , when we look into the future , we are incapable alike of acquiescing in annihilation , and of determining the certainty and the mode of our continued life after the dissolution of the body . Our physics fail when we attempt to dissect , out of the earth-born and earth-doomed fabric , the germ of immortality . Our metaphysics , if they reach the idea of immaterial existence , have reached only a negative term , and are wholly unable to invest it with positive attributes . Thus baffled ontology attains its only possible terminus when it prepares us to accept the sublime disclosure of revelation , - " Eternal life is the gift of God through Christ . " As our author , in his colloquies with the " student-sceptic , " conclusively shows , the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an effect , and implies a cause ; every event is a transfer of force with a change of form , and implies an equal antecedent force in some preexisting form . Whatever is in the effect must have resided in and emanated from the cause . But an infinite series of finite causes is inconceivable and absurd . We are necessarily led back in the series of causes to an intelligent First Cause , in whose being are comprehended all the attributes , all the forces , which have developed themselves in the entire universe . This argument , we conceive , has the demonstrative certainty of a reductio ad absurdum in mathematics . No third hypothesis is possible . The law of causation , which is a fundamen // tal law of belief , of which we can no more divest ourselves than of the consciousness of our own being , excludes equally the spontaneous origin of the universe , and the spontanheous development of its higher and more perfect forms from lower and ruder . To the development theory , ( leaving spontaneity aside , ) science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantiated or made probable , it would only add intense vividness to the demonstration of the Divine existence and attributes . It supposes , at every stage of development , effects which their material causes were not adequate to produce , - effects whose contents , that is , whose elements and efficient forces , did not reside in their causes ; and it thus would constrain the belief in an intelligent and Supreme Cause , whose agency alone could supply for each new order of effects the elements and forces that were not in their apparent and reputed causes . The alternative then lies between the infinite series of finite causes and the infinite First Cause ; and the former is not one whit more rational than the pagan fiction of " the globe upon the elephant , the elephant upon the tortoise , the tortoise upon we know not what . " In recapitulating the members of this old scholastic argument , we do not apprehend that there are among our readers any who need to be convinced of the being of God . But it is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and revelation offer the least hold for scepticism and the strongest grounds of intrinsic probability . There are a large class of minds that seem to regard the Deity as the mere impersonation of general laws , inferior to them , bound by them , and incapable of transcending them , - a " constitutional monarch " of the universe . These laws have never been superseded within their experience , and from the paltry premises thus afforded they leap to the conclusion that they never have been and never can be superseded . God , they think , somehow owes allegiance to the established order of nature ; and his sole place in the creation is as its conservator and administrator . But when we consider the Deity as the Primal Cause of all things , and perceive that at marked epochs of the material universe he has supplemented the inadequacy of proximate causes , it then becomes in the highest degree prob // able that he has done the same in the realm , and for the benefit , of spiritual being ; and all that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place , proof of the urgent need of mankind ; and , in the second , the same kind and degree of historical evidence on which we believe facts in accordance with the common order of nature . The urgent need is created by human ignorance , infirmity , and guilt . The evidence that this need was met in the Mo . saic and Christian revelations is , to say the least , no less strong , we believe it much stronger , than exists with relation to events of equal antiquity which no one calls in question . The growth of scepticism is , we think , often aided to a very great degree by lax notions as regards our responsibleness for belief . Men suffer their faith to be stolen from them without an effort to retain it , in the easy , indolent feeling that belief is involuntary , and that opinions actually entertained can therefore be in no sense blameworthy . But , as Dr. Turubull shows conclusively in one of his papers , this line of argument proves too much . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It denotes our being wrought upon by a force which we can not control . Our passions are our masters , not we theirs . Let them be strong , it is wholly beyond our power to resist them ; they have their will , and do their work , in defiance of principle . Cain could not help being angry with his brother . The fatal blow was a spontaneous , involuntary act . Feeling as he did , to strike was as inevitable as to breathe . Judas was overmastered by his avarice . When the money belonging to the apostolic college was in his hands , they closed upon it , not from cold , calculating dishonesty , but involuntarily . And when for the treachery of an hour he could get the wages of two months ' honest industry , it was impossible for him to resist the temptation . In fine , the condition of the emotional nature is as little under our immediate control as the condition of our belief is . The same course of reasoning , therefore , which denies our accountability for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our passions and their consequences . The fallacy lies here . We are accountable for our passions and their consequences , because there are modes of seif-disci // pline by which their growth may be prevented or their excesses subduied . Cain , being virtually a maniac in his anger , could not help killing Abel ; but his irascible temper in its earlier stages might have been restrained , and brought under the control of reason and principle . Judas , being intensely avaricious , could not help betraying his Master ; but his avarice was made supreme by a series of frauds and pilferings , the earlier of which were strictly voluntary , and might have been omitted . In like manner , the youth , who hears and reads every specious argument against Christianity , and omits all investigation of its claims and evidences , can not help being an infidel . But he knew at the outset the unequalled importance of the interests involved in his religious belief . He had it in his power to give serious heed to the Christian side of the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtuous habits , the devotional sentiments , which would have been the most effectual counterpoise to the sophistry which has victimized him . His involuntary unbelief may therefore have been the result of a series of voluntary omissions and conipliances . And if so , he may be in the eye of a righteous God guiltily accountable for his unbelief , and for whatever he does or neglects to do in consequence of that unbelief . There is then nothing intrinsically unjust , gratuitously harsh , or inconsistent with the mild and loving character of the Founder of Christianity , in the sentence of condemnation which fell from his lips on " him that believeth not . " To pass to another topic involved in the record of experience under review , Christian faith implies a belief , not only in the external facts of the life of Christ , and in the doctrines taught by him , but also in the reality of the Divine influence upon the human soul . There are multitudes , who have no intellectual doubt of the facts or doctrines of Christianity , who yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct are in opposition each to the other . They do what their faith condemns ; they neglect what it requires . There is no point of contact between the contents of the intellect and the motive forces of the life . A connection needs to be established between these mutually repellent polarities ; // and in the Christian consciousness it is the Divine Spirit that completes this connection . But at this point there is a prevalent scepticism among those who , in general terms , would call themselves Christian believers . They can trace no avenue by which God can enter into direct communion with the human soul . But do we know how our fellow-men speak to our souls , how Nature addresses our souls , how the knowledge of events reaches our souls ? We can trace voices , objects , and occurrences from their impulse upon the organs of sense , through the nerves , to the brain , but no farther ; and the throbbings of the nerves and the vibrations of the brain no more account for the ideas that reach the soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drumhead . The passage from the brain to the soul is for our philosophy as broad a chasm , as inexplicable a mystery , as that from God to the soul , - a chasm too which can be overleaped , a mystery which can be approximately solved , only by assuming the Divine presence and agency as the medium of intercourse between brain and soul , - by assuming that in God our souls , as well as our bodies , literally " live , and move , and have their being . " But if we are compelled to believe that God is our medium of communication with the outward world , we admit the existence , and the perpetual openness to him , of avenues of intercourse , along which he is surely as competent to transmit his own voice , as the voice of Nature or of man . In this argument , we indeed presuppose the existence of the soul as an independent , immaterial essence ; though we admit that the word immaterial - a negative term - conveys no clearly defined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature which is not material , we know , if from nothing else , from the phenomena of memory . If the unnumbered words , dates , facts , and experiences that lie in our memory have each made some permanent notch , furrow , or mark , of whatever kind , or however minute , in the brain , the brain would have been too full in very infancy for another entry . It is , physically , as impossible for a life-record to be kept within the compass of a human brain , as it would be to keep a year 's accounts of the United States treasury on a // sheet of note-paper . There is then for each of us an immaterial centre of conscious life , - a soul , whose existence we can demonstrate , but whose mode of action , though within our perpetual experience , is so entirely beyond our comprehension , as to compel our belief in the Divine agency in and upon it at all times . The exertion of that agency for our highest good presents itself , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intrinsically probable , inseparable , and most congenial part of the great mystery of our existence . The grounds of scepticism to which we have referred are speculative . We apprehend that a condition of mind ranging from indifference to utter unbelief is , also , often produced by defective manifestations of Christian character . Christianity suffers in the esteem of those beyond its pale , because it does so little for its disciples . But so far as its work is imperfectly wrought , Christians in fact are chargeable only with a portion of the blame . While it is their duty to exert , it is their necessity to receive , influence . While they are bound to elevate the general standard of character , they are in part drawn down by it . Yet , with all the abatement to be made on this score , it seems a mere truism to say that Christianity has produced more and better specimens of moral excellence than any or all other modes of religions culture . Were we to classify the men of the last eighteen centuries according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammedans , Pagans , Infidels , and were we to select from each catalogue any number of names of the eminently good , we should find on the Christian list a series from St. Paul downward , every one of whom would confessedly hold a higher rank on the scale of moral excellence than the noblest exemplars of virtue on either of the other lists ; and on analyzing their characters and interrogating their self-consciousness , we should ascertain that they derived from , and ascribed to , the faith and ordinances of Christianity whatever of good there was in them . The most perfect blossoming and fruitage of humanity have been on scions grafted upon the Christian stock . Admit that these greatly good have been but few , still the argument derived from their excellence is not invalidated by their fewness . A single watch shows as much // skill as a thousand would . One world is as clear an evidence of the Divine attributes as myriads of worlds . One Christian , if he be the most perfect of the sons of men , and if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of the unparalleled worth and power of Christianity as a regenerated universe would be . We would go even fnrther . Were not pre-eminent excellence to be found in the Christian camp , - did the Author of our religion stand alone and unapproached , as he stands alone and unequalled , - still did ve perceive in Christianity doctrines which , if heartily embraced , motives which , if made supreme , influences which , if cordially welcomed , could not fail to create perfect characters , and were there in no other ethical or religious system an array of doctrines , motives , and influences adapted to produce a like result , we should be constrained to accept Christianity for what it is capable of effecting . This is our mode and ground of preference in all other departments of thought . Did we demand to see the perfect embodiment of principles before adopting them , there would not be a republican in the world . Political principles and institutions which , in the only country that has made trial of them under favorable auspices , leave three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which permit a vast amount of official corruption , which not unfrequently elevate unfit men and bad men to higher places of trust and power than they could reach under a less popular administration , and which every year disgrace some one or more of our great cities by the excesses and atrocities of mob-law , might have a very strong case established against them , did we reason concerning them as we are too prone to reason about religion . We are republicans , not because the world has yet beheld the perfect working of republican principles , but because , as we look into their working power , we see in them that which , if embodied in its entireness and its purity , would constitute a model nation , a perfect commonwealth . The same course of argument , applied to Christianity , negatives whatever unfavorable inferences might be drawn from the imperfections of its disciples , and throws us back upon the intrinsic merits of // the system for the sole ground of our decision with reference to its divine origin and its claims on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian excellence to refute our scepticism , the exhibition of such examples is of the very highest value as subsidiary to our faith , and as enlisting our affection and our sympathy in the conclusions to which we are led by our logical judgment . In the volume before us , designed as it is to furnish an antidote to scepticism , iDr . Turnb nil has done well to give us a choice selection of somewhat detailed Christian biographies . We have the life of William Bentley , one of the uneducated pioneer Baptist ministers of New England , a convert of the venerable Dr. Stiliman , who from early manhood to a late old age labored with signal success and perpetual self-sacrifice for the salvation of souls , and whose courage , zeal , fidelity , and tenderness attested his close kindred of spirit with the equally plain and unlettered men who first went forth from Galilee with the message of the crucified Redeemer . We have next a sketch of Hai*vey Miller , a man whose extensive learning , ready wit , racy colloquial powers , eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the service of the Gospel , and whose death-chamber could hardly have been dome radiant with the light and peace of heaven , had it been one of the " many mansions " behind the veil and beyond the shadow of death . Then we have a vivid portraiture of Daniel J. Glazier , called to his reward just as he was girding on his armor as a Christian minister , whose novitiate presented the ripe maturity of all evangelic graces , and whose perpetual aspiration for heaven , clear insight , and ardent love seemed prophetic of his early translation . We have given but an imperfect outline of a book of a very high order of merit and usefulness . It is a precious contribution to religious literature and to the Christian evidences . Its narrative style and its variety of character and scene can not but conciliate the interest of readers of every class ; its reasonings , incidental and conversational as they are , are profound and cogent ; and its devout spirit must insure for it an enviable mission among those who need such helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
