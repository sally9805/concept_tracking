txt ART . YIII. - PIIYSIOLOGY IN SCHOOLS . Human Physiology , designed for Colleges and the iligher Classes in Schook , and frr general reading . By WORTHINGTON IIOOKER* M. D. , Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in Yale College ; Author of " Physician and Patient . " Illustrated by nearly 200 Engravings . New York : Farmer , Brace , &amp; Co . IT is a cheering sign of the times that men distinguished as scholars and savants are beginning to acknowledge the claims of the common school upon their learning and their pens . The discovery has been made and extensively announced , that it actually requires more thorough scholarship , a higher tact , and a heavier weight of intellectual metal , to lay the battlements of science level to the step of a child , than to open them to the entrance of the matured and disciplined student . The most distinguished teachers are coming to regard the primary // school as the post of ' honor in their profession . Professors in college may be superficial , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull , and their dullness be regarded an attendant upon profundity ; they may be common-place , and be supposed to exhibit only the simplicity of true wisdom . But he who undertakes to communicate with the mind of a child must understand what he is saying , or unmistakable indications of youthful ennui , will apprise him that his ignorance is fit , if it is not perceived . He must be animated also ; the fervor of feeling , the force of strong conception , the glow of rapid and precise mental action , must lend warmth to his language and life to his manner , or the urchins before him will find a more congenial occupation in illustrating the nursery dogma , For Satan finds some mischief still , For idle hands to do . Now this combination of vigor with clearness , of accuracy with enthusiasm , of logic with poetry , is a gift bestowed only upon men of the highest order of mind . Such may find their appropriate sphere of action , where their genius will have full scope in adapting the truths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Dr. Hooker , on Human Physiology , appears to us a remarkably successful effort of this kind . It is true , the title page declares that it is designed for " Colleges and Higher Schools ; " but the author has command of that felicitous style which is pleasing alike to the old and the young . The clearness of his language , and the precision of his thoughts , remind the reader of 711 ' aley , to whose work on Natural Theology this treatise bears a strmkmn* resemblance . A good specimen of the charming simplicit*y of the style may be found in the explanation given of the difference between organized and unorganized substances , at the opening of the first c a er ' " The crystal and the plant are both wonderful growths . As you look at them , you think of the crystal as having been formed , and of the plant as having grown . But in one sense they have both grown to be what they are . The crystal was once a minute nucleus , and the plant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are alike in their growth-both have increased from particles taken from things around them . But the processes by which this is done are different in the two cases . The crystal has increased or grown by layer after layer of particles . There are no spaces or passages by which particles of matter can be introduced inside of it . Any part of it , when once formed , is not altered . It can receive additions // upon the outside alone . But it is not so with the plant . This enlarges by particles which are introduced into passages and interstices . It grows , as it is expressed , by alsorption or by intussusception . " How , now , is this absorption effected ? It is done by certain vessels or organs , constructed in the root of the plant for this purpose . These take up or absorb fluid matter from the earth . There are other organs which circulate this fluid through all the plant ; and others still which use it for the purpose of growth or formation . There are no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . The plant is therefore said to be an organized substance or being , and the crystal is an unorganized substance . And so we speak of the organic structure , or the organization of plants . " This simplicity of language and precision of statement will be found to characterize the entire volume . The author has given an additional freshness to his style by adopting the familiar mode of address which belongs to the lecture room . He keeps up a perpetual conversation with his readers . The free use of the pronouns " I " and " you " constantly remind the student of the author 's existence as a living speaking personality , to whose words he is bound to give at least a polite attention . The ease and fullness of expression which pervade the treatise are worthy of all praise . But if these could have been combined in some instances with more concentration and force both in the language and thought , we think the volume would have been more attractive to the mass of readers . One sometimes feels that the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences . There is nothing like carelessness visible , yet the thought would often have been made more vivid and impressive by a compression within narrower boundaries of expression . We should add as another peculiar excellence of the style of this work , technical terms are almost entirely omitted . The object of such a treatise should be to give a statement of the great facts in Physiology , not a list of hard names from the terminology of Anatomy , which the student will master by dint of exemplary labor to-day , only to forget them to-morrow . In this respect iDr . Hooker 's book differs from most other works of its class . The respectable physicians who have prepared school books on Physiology , seem to have fancied themselves addressing a class of medical students . Indeed , one can hardly help suspecting that whole pages of these treatises were taken from notes penciled down in the lecture room of the Medical College . Opening at random the work of Cutler , for example , which is very extensively // used in our schools , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , beside many other words , which no young pupil would be able to comprehend . In looking through an entire chapter in Dr. Hooker 's book on the same subject , occupying twenty closely printed pages , each containing nearly double the matter of one in Cutler , we have been able to find but three anatomical terms and these are introdilced for the purpose of receiving a full and lucid explanation . We believe that every experienced teacher will agree with us in the opinion that this characteristic of Dr. Hooker 's hook is one of vital consequence . We are confident that the use of text-books , which are so overloaded with names , will have no other result than to create a disgust for the whole subject of which they treat . We notice also with pleasure that Dr. Hooker confines himself strictly to the science of Physiology . Some other works , as that of Jarvis , are occupied quite as much with Hygiene as with Physiology . It is better to have but one at a time . We hope that Dr. H. will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , based upon the principles elucidated in his present work . But the feature of Dr. Hooker 's work , which will especially commend it to the intelligent educator , is its originality . By this we mean that the science has been fully mastered by the author , and its facts reproduced in such a manner as to bear the stamp of his own individuality . The thoughts are made his own before they are given to the reader . His volume is not a mere conduit , conveying to us the tricklings from some larger reservoir . His own mind is full of the theme , and his work , though necessarily brief , resembles the free gushing fountain , which has a reserved force behind it . We are sure that the author did not exhaust his resources in preparing this book . We are quite sure that he is not the retailer of other men 's resources . On the contrary , most of the class books which we have been able to examine on the subject of physiology seem to be mere compilations of larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have taken the trouble to give even a logical arrangement to the materials which they have plundered . The boldness with which this plagiarism has been practised in some instances is astonishing . We have before us a juarto volume of 110 pages , entitled " Principles of Physiology . ' Of the eighty-eight pages devoted especially to Physiology , some thirty-eight are taken bodily from Carpenter 's Animal Physiology , large portions being copied verl'atini et literatim . II*stimating all the stray paragraphs and sentences copied in like // May , manner , it would be fair to set down one half the work as beiilg a cop*y of Carpenter 's . It should be called an abridgment or compilation from Carpenter . Yet the only acknowledgment we have discovered of all this indebtedness is a remark in the preface , to the effect that the reader will observe " that many of the engravings , and also parts of several chapters have been copied from the admirable Animal Physiology of Dr. Carpen - ter . " When the author comes to prepare his " Class Book ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another abridgment , based upon his former work , without any reference to Carpenter , save the mention of his name in the p reface , in connection with those of a dozen other authorities . To say nothing of the morality of such a proceeding , it is evident that a mere compilation can never answer a good purpose , when used in the instruction of children . They , even more than adults , need the freshness , the clearness , and the point which an original writer alone can give to the elucidation of the subject . We have dwelt on these particulars because they are of great importance in the selection of a school book . Our object has been to touch upon those points of which teachers and school committees will be especially desirous of obtaining information . The work is arranged in a very natural and logical manner . It comprises three parts . The first is occupied with preliminary topics , such as the distinction between organized and unorganized substances , between animals and plants , closing with an admirable discussion of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pointing out the fallacy of those analogies by which some sceptical naturalists have endeavored to make man first-cousin to the baboon and the ourang-outang . The second p art treats of the human frame , " simply as a structure , showing how it is constructed and kept in repair . " The particular topics are-General Views of Physiology , Digestion , Circulation , Respiration , Formation and Repair , and Cell Life . The discussion of the subject of " Cell Life " is one of the most intensely interesting character . The following paragraphs are taken from the beginning of the chapter on that subject : " In previous chapters , in treating of the construction of the body , I have spoken of the formative vessels in accordance with the common language of physiologists . The common idea had been hitherto , that the work of construction is performed by vessels appended to the capillaries . The capillaries were considered as the repositories of the blood , they receiving it from the arteries , and holding it in readiness for the use to which it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was supposed , exercised in some way a power of // selection in regard to the constituents of the blood and also a power of uniting the constituents thus chosen into particular forms . In this way physiologists accounted for the formation of all the different structures in the body . What shape these formative vessels had , or how they were arranged , no one pretended to know . But of their existence no one had a doubt , for there seemed to be an absolute necessity for supposing some apparatus of vessels appended to the capillaries or the performance of this function . " But the miscroscope has of late years revealed phenomena which have changed onr ideas on this subject , and which must to some extent change our modes of expression in relation to it also . It has showed us agencies which differ from those which we had supposed to exist . The subject is an interesting one , and I propose in this chapter to give you some glimpses of this interior life , as it may be terined , of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscope , that all the minute operations of the system are performed by the agency of cells . They are not such cells as I described in 64 as existing in the cellular tissue , which are mere interstices , communicating together . But they are bladders or sacs , and are filled either with a fluid alone , or with a fluid containing some grains of solid substance , termed molecules . The usual form of the cell when it first appears is globular or spheroidal . It is seldom , however , seen in this form ; for besides the change of form from the pressure of neighboring cells , the cells themselves often change into various shapes , as you will see in another part of this chapter . " The various offices of these cells are those pointed out in their action as absorbants and secreting vessels , chemist and scavengers , constructers and colorers , in various p arts of the system . I t is shown that muscles are made up of cells , that hoofs , horns , nails and teeth are only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes made from cells , that the chick in the egg is formed by the reduplication of two twin cells , and that the perfected bird is only an intricate and wonderful combination of cells . This interesting chapter thus concludes : " From the view which I have presented in this chapter it is manifest that the grand distinction between organized and unorganized substances is to be found in this cell - life of the organized . In unorganized substances particles or molecules are the only things which we know of as being concerned in their formation . But in the construction of organized substances or beings , every thing is done by the agency of cells . And in this cell-life of the living world we have another beautiful // example of the divers and almost numberless results , whi3h the Creator works out by simple and single means . As gravitation holds atoms together in masses of every size , from the minutest to the largest , and keeps the mighty orbs in their appointed circuits , so the cell-organization constructs and moves all living things , however small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we examine the various workings of this cell-life , we can not but perceive the truth of the old adage , Naturct in minim&amp;* macvima e8t-nature is greatest in its smallest things . The power of mere bulk or mere force we can comprehend by mental addition , however great that power may be . We can imagine a power which we see , to be indefinitely multiplied , and thus can form the idea of immense power . But when with the microscope we see minute cells working out such results as we have contemplated in this chapter , and inquire how it is done , we see that there is a hidden power here that utterly defies our conception . The mechanics and the chemistry of the cell , who can understand them ? From the inscrutable movements of this hidden power , at work wherever life is , in the cells , its laboratories , we get a higher idea of Omnipotence than we get from the grandest and most terrific exhibitions of mere force . We get from them the idea of an allpervading , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality , but at every point of the universe . And the revelations which the microscope makes to us seemim to draw us very near to the Infinite . As we gaze with wonder and delight at the secret operations of his power thus opened to us , we seem **31;0;TOOLONG ; andevenourawakened curiosity , amid the wonders now brought into our field of vision , does not suffice to remove the awe which almost oppresses us . " How great is the inner beauty of the living world around us ! We admire the symmetrical forms , and the beautiful colors which nature presents to us in such variety ; but there is an inner world of beauties throughout nature , still more perfect and resplendent , which is hidden from the naked eye of man , though it is all open to the Omniscient . If you would get some idea of the beauty of this inner world , take the most delicately beautiful of all the specimens of man 's workmanship , and examine it with a microscope ; and then compare it with some living texture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most perfect painting of a flower with the flower itself . The painting loses all its beauty as it is magnified ; but in the bosom of the flower the microscope develops to you // beauties far transcending those which are seen by the unassisted eye . Even such living structures as are unattractive to the naked eye , present under the microscope wonderful beauty in the delicate lines of their textures . It is true of every one who has used this instrument in his observation of nature , that he is impressed with the fact , that great as is the beauty of nature , as we look out upon it , it is vastly inferior both in kind and in amount to that inner beauty seen so completely by the allseeing Eye , and now developed to us in part by the skill and ingenuity of man . And it suggests to Li5 the hope , that in a new state of being , and with higher faculties , we shall be able to look further into these inner beauties of the universe , than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devise. ** The third part treats of the u&amp;* for which the human structure is designed , and occupies nearly two-thirds of the entire volume . The subjects discussed are " those which relate to the nervous system , and its connections or dependencies . They are the nervous system itself ; the organs of locomotion , the muscles , and the bones ; the voice ; the expression of the countenance , and the language of the muscles generally ; the senses with their organs ; instinct , thought , reason . " We close our special notice of this work with a few extracts from the concluding chapter on Life and Death . After defining what we know and what we do not know in regard to life or the vital force , and pointing out certain characteristics which distinguish it from other forces in nature , the author thus remarks on the connection between the vital force and the soul : " The most mysterious of all the circumstances in regard to the vital force , is its connection in man with the immortal soul . The life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered them to be the same . But they are two distinct forces . They are in some measure indeed antagonistic to each other . For the soul , in using the machinery of the nerves and *uuscles occasions a wear and tear of the structure , which it is the office of life with its numberless cell-laboratories to repair . The soul and the vital principle are both p resent in all parts of the system , but not in the same sense . he vi al principle is seen equally at work everywhere . It has no great central organ from which it sends forth its influence . But the soul is especially connected with the brain , and by means of the complicated nervous connections of this organ , it affects and is affected by all parts of the system . Its influence is thus an all pervading one . Every point of the living organization // has thus a sort of telegraphic communication with the imm*iterial soul . " But there is another view of this connection of the soul and the vital principle . The soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not created by itself and put into the body as a tenant . Its powers are developed while the vital force develops the powers of the physical organization . The two processes go on together . Nay more , the development of the soul is in a measure dependent upon the development of the body . The vital force exerts a manifest influence upon the soul 's growth . As it prepares the organs for the use of the soul-those organs by which it acquires knowledge from without , and thus procures the stimulus and even the material for its growth-whenever the vital force fails to construct these organs properly , the powers of the soul are not well developed . This we see exemplified in the idiot . In this intimate connection of the soul with life we find a great mystery . Life , a force belonging to mere matter , an endowment of it , or a compound of its endowments-life , that builds up all organized substances , the humblest and simplest vegetable growth , as well as that most complex of all living structures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works that is likened to the dissolving vapor-is made by the Creator an agent in developing an immaterial principle or being , that is to survive the dissolution of the structure in which it is generated , and is to live forever . Strange that the immortal should be thus produced in the mortal-that the unchangeable and imperishable soul should be thus developed in such intimate connection with the changeable and perishable body . It is a mystery which we can not fathom . " We copy the following remarks on death : " The death of the body is not ordinarijy complete at the moment when what we term death occurs . Though as a whole , as a system of organs , the operations of life are at an end , yet there is some degree of life in some parts , and there may be in all parts of the body . The beard and sails even , may grow . Some of the organs may secrete their fluids  --  the liver its bile , and the stomac*h its gastric juice . Some of the properties of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscles , which is strictly a vital property , as it never belongs to common dead matter , still it appears on the application of excitants . It was the contraction of the muscles in the leg of a dead frog on the accidental application of a stimulus , that led Galvani to his grand discovery . And it is through this vital property that the culprit who has been hung can be galvanized // 285 into apparent life . Death then may be said to be of two kindssystematw , that is , the death of the body as a whole , a system of organs  --  and nwlecular , that is , the death of the individual molecules or particles which compose the body . Death can be said to be complete only when the laws of life have resigned their power over these molecules , and the law of purely chemi .. cal action have *taken their place . When this change occurs , the process of decay , which is a strictly chemical process , begins . " On the signs of death , the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that there is , with very few exceptions , no mistake in regard to the occurrence of the event . The stories that are related about burying alive are most of them unfounded . The apprehension created by them in the minds of some persons have led them to insist , that no body ought to be committed to the grave , till the most infallible sign of death , putrefaction , has appeared . That we should wait for the appearance of this sign in all cases in which there is a shadow of doubt , I will allow . But the cases are exceedingly rare in which we can not determine the reality of death long before this sign shows itself . Our decision is not made up , it must be observed , merely from the signs of death . All the circumstances of the case are taken into view  --  the disease , its progress , its symptoms , and the events of the last hours of the patient . With this evidence before us , we absolutely know , in all ordinary cases , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased . And in the exceedingly few cases in which there is any reason to doubt on that point , there is always some thing which will attract the attention and excite the curiosity of some one , unless there be stolid indifference and the most absolute lack of intelligence . In such cases there is always something strange  --  the circumstances attending the cessation of the respiration and circulation are singular , and the signs of death are not complete and in their proper order of succession . Whenever there is for these reasons any doubt as to the reality of the apparent death , the strictest watch should be maintained till the signs of commencing putrefaction appear . With this simple rule of prevention burying alive need never to occur . " The concluding paragraph of this chapter of the book is this : " The investigations of physiology , as you have seen , end with the death of the body . It can give us no light on the question as to what may be beyond this life . Although the physiologist studies the human structure not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also as the worderful machinety through which a reasoning soul acts and is acted upon in this state of being , yet as a physiologist , he knows not that the soul survives the death of the body . He knows not but that it is a mere endowment of matter , as life probably is , and so perishes in the hour of dissolution , He may indeed conjecture that such exalted faculties which are in this world susceptible of such high cultivation , instead of being destroyed with the body , are destined to still further development in another state of existence . But what is mere conjecture to him as a Physiologist , is made fact to him as a Christian . The eye of his faith sees an immortal spirit rise from the dying body , and he realizes the truth of the sublime declaration , that " death is swallowed up of victory . " It is possible that some persons , even those who have had experience in teaching , may doubt the expediency of introducing the study of Physiology , at least into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " higher studies , " or to give them a more expressive appellation , those fancy studies , which are usually postponed to some indefinite future of the child 's education , and are consequently seldom attended to at all . The departments of Grammar , Arithmetic and Geography seem to have acquired a prescriptive right to the first p lace in the curriculum of school instruction , while Histor a ural Phi losophy and Astronomy have usually , with some homogeneous sciences , successfully contended for the second rank . Now without questioning the pr&amp;5minent claims of the " art of speaking and writing the English language correctly , " we may well inquire whether there is any problem in fractions , or the square root , any summary of aA'airs in Senegambia or Kamscatka , any details of the butcheries of Canna* or Boridino , any principles of the lever or screw , any information respectin a urn and his rings , or Jupiter and his moons , which is more worthy the attention of the youthful pupil than the structure of the body he inhabits and the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge to be diligently sought , except that of which he is to make daily and hourly use during his life ? Will you instruct the railroad engineer in navigation and horsemanship , but keep them in profound i*norance as to the construction and management of a locomotive ? Will you teach the physician theology only , and give him no information as to the body to whose ills he is to minister ? Will you train the clergyman in medicine , but deny him access to information respecting the sublime science he is to teach ? We do not object to the introduction of Grammar , // Arithmetic , and Geography , nor to the place which they occupy . But we do object to the exclusion of a study which is equally important and even more practical than these . We claim that it is the right of every child to receive from its parents and teachers some clear and reliable instruction in regard to the physical mechanism which he is to control , and which , in many important particulars , is to react upon his own mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fbrth the child upon the voyage of life without this knowledge , as it would be to sit him in a frail boat in mid-ocean , with no idea of the nature or use of rudder , sail , or compass . If the children of the past century had been as familiar with the laws of Physiology , as they have been with the " rule of three , " though our national reputation for driving close bargains might have been somewhat less , our fame as a robust and vigorous people would have been greatly enhanced . And this suggests another consideration which strongly substantiates our position that Physiology should be made a prominent branch of study even in our common District Schools . As a nation we are rapidly deteriorating ! No other people in the family of nations is to-day made up of so large a proportion of puny , feeble , nervous men and women , united with so small a per percentage of those whose robust health makes their animal existence a source of positive enjoyment . The causes of this alarmino* state of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . *hey can be traced directly to the violation of the simplest physiological laws . Thorough instruction only in the elements of the science of life would open the eyes of the multitudes to the nature of habits , now freely practised throughout the community , which are absolutely murderous in their effects : Tight lacing ; thin shoes ; high living among the poor as well as the rich* e constant occupancy of close , heated rooms , without an outlet or an inlet for the great supporter of life ; an unceasingwhirl of excitement , drawing within its sweep the hours of business , of pleasure , and even of devotion ; a constant forcing of all the mental and physical powers to the highest exertion , with no interval of refreshing rest and recreation ; a consuming ambition for position , or wealth , or achievement in some other form , fostered by our democratic organization of society ; the free use of tea , coffee , and tobacco , and until very recently , of intoxicatin* liquors drugged with the vilest poisons , for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and numberless other kindred practices are eating out the stamina of the American people , with a rapidity which awakens the most serious apprehensions as to our future existence // as a nation . Foreigners who come to our shores notice *t once the wan , debilitated appearance of the crowds that throng the streets of our cities . Nervous complaints in all their various forms have multiplied to an almost incredible extent during the last twenty-five years . These are becoming hereditary among us . The children of the present generation are receiving an inheritance of weak backs , and aching heads , and trembling nerves , which in turn they will transmit to their posterity with a fearful accumulation drawn from the original source of supply . Such a state of public health in other nations is confined to the inhabitants of large towns and cities . But with us the evil has extended through the rural population of our agricultural districts . This is especially true of females in the country  --  the wives and daughters of our farmers . We have cultivated a holy horror of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hoe and the sickle . But it would be a mercy to multitudes , if such toil were substituted for the indoor services they are now obliged to perform . In the first place , the labor very generally required of women in agricultural communities is very severe . No small part of the productive industry of the farm is connected with the kitchen and the dairy . The cash articles are produced there . There the final result of the labors of the field are secured . There old mortgages are paid off . There the pennies are slowly accumulated which are to purchase new acres . These savings are carefully accumulated , which fhid their way to the storekeeper 's till in exchange for cloth , and sugar and tea . The merchant and the mechanic expect to maintain their families by their own efforts and their wives are only required to expend economically and judiciously what they provide . But the farmer 's wife sustains a much higher responsibility . She is to provide as well as expend . If any progress is made in accumulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy day , " she is to perform an essential part in the achievement . Now all this might not be objectionable , if the labor required could be performed in obedience to physiological laws . If , like her husband , she could be surrounded during the long day of toil by the pure air of heaven , and receive all those invigorating influences which exhale from the freshly turned earth and float down the channels of the sunlight , she might , like her European sister , grow hearty and strong under her burdens , although such a result would furnish no apology for the outrage . But though called to perform an amount of labor scarcely inferior to that required in the field , she is compelled to toil over a hot fire , in a close apartment , where she breathes // in an atmosphere surcharged with steam and redolent of fumes from the frying pan and gridiron . Here day after day she toils on , with no respite or recreation . When the additional duty of bearing and nursing her children is imposed upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family circle or out of it , which demands that aught of her daily tasks shall be for any long period diminished . Whenever she is able to " keep about , " as the phrase is , she feels bound to labor , and bound to waste no time upon the means which natural instinct and physiological science alike prescribe for the refreshment and invigoration of the wearied powers . Rest , according to the philosophy which she has been taught , is idleness . Cheerfulness is frivolity . Recreation is a folly and a sin . But it is no sin to bring into the world a numerous progeny of feeble , puny , nervous children , who must pay through life the penalty of their excessive and unhealthy toil . Thus the agricultural class , from which other nations are recruited as they become deteriorated by the mingled destitution and luxury of civil life , is with us even more exposed to the causes of disease and decay than any other . The habits of the female population of our cities , notwithstanding all the injurious influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conducive to health than those of the same class in the country . They take more exercise in the open air . They are not subjected to excessive toil . They are far more secure from hazardous exposure . Said a distinguished physician , now at the head of one of our New England Asylums for the Insane , " after a long and careful observation , I am fully prepared to say that as a general rule , the health of the female population of our cities is far better than that of those residing in the country . " It will be observed that the same causes are in operation , though not to so great an extent in the families of laboring men and mechanics . Where one woman is forced from her proper business of taking care of her family to share in her husband 's business of supporting the family , then she suffers , and the whole community , sooner or later , suffer with her . In corroboration of the views here advanced , we quote from the Twenty-Fourth Annual Report of Ph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hartford : " Of the one hundred and eighty-seven female patients admitted during the past three years , 34 per cent . it will be seen , were the wives of farmers or mechanics . It must be that this is an undue proportion of the comparative number of that class in the community . Many of these are young women , who leave nursing , or quite young children at home . The frequency // of this occurrence , and its obvious causes , require more than a passing remark . A few brief suggestions may lead , hereafter , to a better understanding of these causes , and consequently to their avoidance . Many of this class present themselves at the Institution , either in the high excitement of acute mania , or in the deep and oftentimes suicidal depression of melancholia ; in all cases greatly exhausted , and most evidently worn down by hard work and anxiety , undue mental and physical effort , as classed in the table ; though sometimes , other and more obvious causes , ( though less real , ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having received in early life a judicious physical or moral training for her new and arduous station , the young wife , impelled by aif*ction and an honest pride to her utmost efforts , soon finds that , with her increasing family , the burden of care and duties increases ; while her plziysical strength and capacity of endurance diminish even in a greater ratio . " An economy sometimes deemed necessary , more often illjudged and cruel , leads the husband to refrain from supplying the necessary domestic assistance ; the nurse is discharged too soon , and sometimes , no suitable one is provided . In addition to their own proper household , an eagerness for gain leads him to take boarders from the operatives in the neighboring factories , for whom the wife must cook , and otherwise provide , and often the day proves too short for the accomplishment of the necessary duties , and her labors are protracted to a late hour of the night , and the broken slumbers of the remainder of its hours of rest , give little refreshment . Thus it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the accumulation of ' household duties and drudgery , the poor heart-broken and disappointed wife loses in turn her appetite , her rest , and her strenoth* her nervous is prostrated , smn*ing under b system and .1*- her burden , she seeks refuge in a Lunatic Hospital . this process of inducing insanity is by no means limited to the abovementioned classes the same thing , differing more in degree than in manner , is too often seen elsewhere . " The most furious maniac we have ever admitted here , was the mother of a numerous family . The older daughters of which were , at the earliest practicable age , sent into a factory , to work , and she left with the care of an infant and the young children at home . After repeated efforts to murder her own children , and desperate efforts here at homicide and suicide , she ultimately recovered . " Happily , these cases very generally get well ; they soon become calm and cheerful under the use of suitable medical and moral means , gain flesh and strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they have known for years . " It would be easy to add other evidence of the total disregard of physiological laws which prevail among our people . We will only briefly allude to one practice which stands primus inter pares in the bad companionship . We refer to the custom of occupying close rooms , with no adequate provision for ventilation . A blind ignorance or a stupid indifference has prevailed on this subject , which is as unaccountable as it is calamitous . Everybody knows that carbonic acid gas is a deadly poison when breathed into the lungs . Everybody knows also that with every expiration , air charged with this poison is thrown off from the lungs . It would seem to be a plain corollary from these propositions , that provision should be made in every apartment , public and private , for the admission and ejection of an amount of air , precisely equal to that used by those who occupy it . That is , the hoase should breathe just as fast as those who oceupy it breathe . The violation of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied to the lungs , is the cause of an immeasurable amount of feebleness and disease . Aud yet , since the abolition of the ancient lire places , which contributed so materially to the health and longevity of our forefathers , our chief concern has been to shut out as much as possible , the pure air which God has given in plenteous abundance , for the wants of every living thing . N ow the difficulty is not that we do not know how to secure this necessary ventilation , for the laws which govern the movements of hot and cold air are very simple , and may be readily understood by any one who feels their importance . The trouble is , that we do not feel the importance of attention to the subject . Architects and builders seem to have an invincible repugnance to houses that are not air tight . Church Building Committees will waste thousands upon tawdry ornaments and puerile imitation , but grudge every cent that is devoted to ventiducts and ventilators and heated flues . School Committees , thanks to the earnest efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake to the importance of ventilation , and make at least a seeming effort to secure it . But these attempts are often laughably inadequate , and their whole mode of procedure indicates only a very feeble and inoperative faith . They act as if they were experimenting with a humbug , and were afraid that they should be caught in the act and laughed at for their folly . We have recently seen a model school Ii ouse with all the necessary flues arranged for a complete winter ventilation , while the necessary registers // May , were omitted . When the Committee were interrogated on the subject , they said , that they thought it better to plaster them up until they should be called for . The same thing was done in one of the largest churches in Connecticut , because the builder , in the plenitude of his wisdom , thought that ventilating flues were not needed . In a large school house , perhaps the finest in this state , recently erected at a cost of some $40,000 , all the rooms are well ventilated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need fresh air , to breathe ! Indeed , no one conversant with the subject will question for a moment the fact that the public mind needs to be thoroughly aroused and instructed upon this whole subject . Our churches , our school rooms , our sleeping apartments , as things are now , are repositories of poison , where deleterious gases are carefully collected and retained as if they were laden with the costliest perfumes , and concealed among tIm cir partides the seeds of perennial youth and an immortal life . Now we are prepared to ask any one who doubts the expediency of placing Physiology among the studies of our elementary schools to look at such facts as these , and tell us if ignorance of the great laws of life and health is not to be depricated quite as earnestly as the inability to name the states of Germany , or explain the mysteries of the cube root . How shall we create a public sentiment which shall remove these causes of national decay , except by imparting an accurate knowledge of the rudiments at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thoronghy mastered or so generally diffused as in the various elementary schools , public an 4 private , throughout the land . In this connection we are happy to state that a more elementary work on Physiology , designed for use in our common sch ? ols , has been prepared by the author of the volume under review , and will soon be issued from the press . We hope that the attention of teachers and school committees will be turned , in connection with the issue of this work , to the imp&amp;rtance of giving this study a p prominent place in our schools . There is still anotiher aspect of this subject which no believer in Revelation can fail to regard with interest . The study of Natural Science , under the direction of competent instructors , and with the use of suitable text-books , is the best possible security against the inroads of infidelity . The God of a ure is the God of the Bible . Hence it is only necessary to have an accurate and thorough knowledge of Nature , to find strong confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only the " oppositions of science , fal8ely so called , " which Christianity // has to fear . There is a vast deal of infidelity , few are aware how much , in our Christian communities , which is the offspring of limited and perverted notions of natural science . It is a " little learning " which , in this case , as in many others , is " a dangerous thing . " Let our children be thoroughly indoctrinated into the true principles of natural science , and let the relations of this to moral science be clearly pointed out , by one who can not only lay claim to the authority of a savant , but who daily drinks of " Siloa 's brook that flowed Fast by the oracle of God , " and they are secure against ninety-nine hundredths of the upstart infidelities of the day . In this connection we can not too highly commend the volume before us . Every page gives evidence that the author has contemplated his subject from a Christian point of view . The fallacy of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would refer the reader to the conclusion of the chapter on the " Connection of the Mind with the Body , " as a specimen of the quiet but conclusive manner in which the author deals with the dogmas of infidelity . The following paragraphs form the conclusion of a very able argument , showing the inevitable tendency of natural science , unmodified by a higher faith in spiritual truth , to the grossest materialism . " I have thus spoken of three sources of evidence in regard to the connection of the mind and the body , and have mdicated the character of the evidence furnished by each . I have shown particularly that if the attention be confined to that which is furnished by physiology , the mind is apt to be led into materialism . But the attention should not thus be confined . All three kinds of evidence should be employed and should be brought to bear upon each other . If this be done , the discrepancies in the evidence from physiology are cleared up by the evidence afforded by consciousness and revelation , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the specific mental difference between man and animals is not attended with a corresponding structural difference . Though this fact operates merely as conflicting evidence , when taken simply in connection with the rest of the facts developed by physiology ; when we come , on the other hand , to take the whole range of evidence from the three sources spoken of , it is exceeding satisfactory as concurring with the testimony of consciousness and revelation . At the same time , those physiological phenomena , which taken by themselves seem to show so strongly that the mind is wholly dependent upon organizations // May , are so interpreted by the evidence from the other sources , that the dependence is seen to be for the most part a dependence of connection only , the brain being the instrument of the mind . " The evidence from consciousness and revelation is of the most positive character , and can not be set aside by evidence from any other source . Other evidence may serve to interpret it , but can not nullify it . The attempt is sometimes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology , as if it were absolute proof . But most physiologists engage in no such futile and unchristian efforts , but give due weight to the testimony of consciousness and revelation in all their investi*ations of the mysterious connection of the mind and the body . e influence of Carpenter , an English physiolocrist , whose works are more extensively used by students than those of any other physiologist , is especially to be commended in this respect . And although scepticism occasionally utters its plausible falsities , deceiving the superficial and the speculative , we have no fears from present indications that the votaries of physiological science will , as a body , be arrayed in opposition to Christianity . " Before leaving the subject , we wish to suggest to ministers of the gospel the importance to them of a familiar acquaintance with the principles of physiology . The reciprocal influence of the body and the mind upon each other , must be thoroughly understood by one who would be wise in winning souls . To distinguish the influences of disease from those that come down from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to discern the characteristics of the intoxication of animal excitement as distinct from the joy of him whose sins are forgiven , is often the delicate and difficult duty of the man who has undertaken the " cure of souls . " It is a sad mistake to send one to the confessional who should be borne to the hospital , and a still sadder one to stifle convictions of sin by prescribing recreation and diversion . Pastors and preachers will find much in the work of Dr. looker , which they will peruse with deep interest , and much , we are persuaded , which will be of essential service in the difficult duties of their profession .
