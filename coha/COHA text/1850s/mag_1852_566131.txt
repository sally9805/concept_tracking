txt ART . V.-TIIE MAINE TEMPERANCE LAW . An Act for the suppression of Drinking Houses and Tippling Shops , passed by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Maine , in Legislature assembled , and approved , June , 1851 . IT has been apparent now for some years past , that the great desideratum for the prevention of the calamities and burdens which drunkenness brings upon individuals and communities , is an efficient law for the suppression of the traffic in intoxicating liquors , especially that traffic as carried on in drinking houses and tippling shops . It is true , indeed , that much has been done , and much may yet be done , towards preventing and reforming the evil habits of the drinker , and even of the vender , by what is called " moral suasion " - by reason and argument , by appeals to conscience , humanity and enlightened self-interest . Yet it has been evident to the understanding of many always , and is now proved by experiment to all , that moral suasion alone can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light which has been shed on the pernicious and immoral character of the traffic , there are men who do sell intoxicating liquors ; and sell them by the dram ; and will , so long as they can make money by it : which they can do very rapidly because of the very immorality of the business , since that gives a monopoly of it to the unscrupulous and wicl*ed . The remonstrances of the friends of society , the appeals of the suffering wives and children of drunkards , the entreaties and tears of widowed mothers whose sons they are ruining , the sight of the // moral destruction and the premature death of those who drink from their hand-all do not restrain them ; and the community have become convinced that they , who against all such influences will continue such a traffic , are invincible by any form or amount of argument or persuasion-that nothing but the strong arm of the law will reach them . Not more effectually had the avarice and revenge of Shylo*k steeled his heart against all persuasion . Indeed , to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be reached by moral suasion , we might properly speak in the words of the great dramatist : " You may as well go stand upon the beach , And bid the main flood bate his usual height ; You may as well use question with the wolf* Why he bath made the ewe bleat for the lamb ; You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops , and to make no noise , When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven ; You may as well do anything most hard , As seek to soften that ( than which what s harder ) ( A dramseller 's ) heart . " We set it down thus as a fixed and unchangeable truth , that intoxicating drinks will be freely sold unless the power of law prevents . But , so long as intoxicating liquor is sold as a common beverage , especially so long as it is sold in eating houses and places of resort , there will be those who will drink . The inebriate who desires and attempts to reform finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips what is continually before his eyes . He drinks and drinks again till be perishes . And many of our youth , even those educated in the doctrines of total abstinence and well convinced of their truth , in the fondness for excitement and the heedlessness pertaining to that period of life , will begin to drink in a convivial or social way , and continue the evil custom , till ere they are aware the habit of dissipation and drunkenness is formed . For these and like reasons , a conviction has been increasing in extent and depth in the public mind of the importance and necessity of thorough legislation against the traffic in alcoholic liquors : The subject has often been brought before the Legislatures of various States . Old laws have been amended . New laws have been framed . In many localities , these laws have been admini*ered with beneficial effect , breaking up or seriously diminishing the traffic , and conserving the public welfare . But in many other localities , it has been found exceedingly difficult to enforce the laws , even where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been // manifest that the wisdom to frame an efficient law against the acknowledged and pernicious evil of trafficking in alcoholic drinks , has not been attained . But , at length , a law has been enacted by the Legislature of Maine , which disposes all the friends of what has been called temperance legislation , who have examined its nature and its working , to cry out Eureka . It has been in operation now about six months , and , according to abundant testimony , has completely destroyed the manufacture of alcoholic drinks throughout the State ; has put an end to their open sale in all taverns , dram shops , eating houses , stores and places of public resort ; indeed , has suppressed the open sale of them altogether , and prevents any considerable secret sale ; and so reduces taxes , and works for the public welfare so decidedly and palpably , that the vast majority of the people of the State are rejoicing in its existence and are resolved on its continuance . This law is entitled " An Act for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It consists of eighteen sections . The first section ordains that no person shall manufacture or sell any intoxicating liquors except as hereafter provided . The second section authorizes the selectmen of any town , and the mayor and aldermen of any city , to appoint annually an agent to sell intoxicating liquors , to be used for medicinal and manufacturing purposes and no other , who shall receive such compensation , and conform to such rules , as they shall prescribe , and shall be removed at their pleasure . The third section prescribes that a certificate of his appointment as such agent shall be given to him by the selectmen , or mayor and aldermen ; but not till he shall have given to them a bond with two good and sufficient sureties , in the sum of six hundred dollars , that he will conform to the rules which they shall establish and to the provisions of the law . The fourth section provides as penalties for violation of the law at any time , by any person or his agent , ( the principal and agent both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten dollars and the costs of prosecution ; on the second conviction , twenty dollars and the costs of prosecution ; and on the third and every subsequent conviction , twenty dollars and the costs of prosecution , and imprisonment in the common jail not less than three nor more than six months . Moreover , on the first and second convictions , the violator of the law is to stand committed jintil the fines prescribed and the costs are paid , and in default of such payment must not be released from prison until the expiration of two months , and , in default of payment of fines and costs after the third and every subsequent conviction , shall not be released from prison till the expiration of four // rFeb. months . The fifth section prescribes the mode of applying the law to offenders . Any forfeiture or fine may be recovered by an action of debt , or by complaint before any justice of the peace , or judge of any municipal or police court in the county where the offense was committed . All fines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the poor ; the prosecutor or complainant may be a witness ; the defendant can in no case recover costs if any one of the board of selectmen , or mayor and aldermen , shall have endorsed his name on the writ of prosecution ; and the selectmen , or mayor and aldermen , are bound to commence an action against any violator of the law , on being informed , and furnished with proof , of the fact . The sixth section treats of the conditions and consequences of an appeal . It provides , that if any person convicted shall clairp an appeal , he shall , before the appeal shall be allowed , give two bonds , with two sufficient sureties to each ; one in the sum of one hundred dollars , that he will prosecute the appeal , and will pay all costs , fines and penalties which may finally accrue against him ; and another in the sum of two hundred dollars , that he will not during the pendency of this appeal violate any of the provisions of this act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a jury the amount of fines , penalties and imprisonment , awarded on the first trial , shall be doubled . It provides , also , that no recognizance or bond shall be taken by any one except the justice or judge before whom the trial was had , that the bonds required must be given within twenty-four hours after the judgment or the appeal can not be allowed , the defendant in the meantime to stand committed ; and in every case of an appeal in an action of debt , the defendant shall be held to advance the jury fees . The seventh section treats of agents who forfeit their bonds . It provides that the board of selectmen , or mayor and aldermen , on complaint of a breach by an agent for the sale of intoxicating liquors , of the conditions of his bond , shall hear the parties , and , if the complaint is proved , shall revoke his appointment ; and if such unfaithfulness of the agent shall in any manner be brought or come to their knowledge , they , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of their city or town , cause the bond to be sued before the proper court . Section eight treats of makers and common sellers , and provides that no person shall be a manufacturer of any spirituous or intoxicating liquQr , or common seller thereof , without being appointed according to the provisions of this act , on penalty of forfeiting , on the first conviction , the sum of one hundred dollars and the costs of prosecution , and in default of the payment thereof , of being impris // oned sixty days in the common jail ; on the second conviction , of forfeiting the sum of two hundred dollars and the costs of prosecution , and in default of payment , of being imprisoned four months in the common jail ; and on the third and every subsequent conviction , of forfeiting the sum of two hundred dollars and of being imprisoned also four months in the common jail . These penalties are to be recovered before any court of competent jurisdiction by indictment , or by action of debt , in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed ; and whenever a default shall be had of any recognizance arising under this act , a scirefacias shall be issued , returnable at the next term , and the same shall not be continued , unless for good cause satisfactory to the court . The ninth section excludes persons engaged in unlawful traffic in intoxicating liquors from juries , in cases arising under this act . It provides , that when any juror is believed to be engaged in such traffic , then the court shall inquire of such juror if he is so engaged . If he declines to answer , as the law allows , he shall be discharged from the jury ; and if he answers falsely , he shall be incapable of serving on any jury in the State ; but no answer which lie shall make shall be used against him in any case arising under this act . The tenth section provides that all cases arising under this act which come before a superior court by appeal or original entry , shall take precedence in court of all other business , except those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trial ; and a nolle prose qui shall not be entered , or a continuance granted , except when the purposes of justice shall require it . The eleventh section is so peculiar and important , that we will quote it in full , without any attempt at abbreviation . " SEC. 11 . If any three persons , voters in the town or city where the complaint shall be made , shall before any justice of the peace or judge of any municipal or police court , make complaint under oath or affirmation that they have reason to believe , and do believe that spirituous or intoxicating liquors are kept or deposited , and intended for sale , by any person not authorized to sell the same in said city or town under the provisions of this act , in any store , shop , warehouse or other building or place in said city or town , said justice or judge shall issue his warrant of search to any sheriff , city marshal or deputy , or to any constable , who shall proceed to search the premises described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquors are found therein , he shall seize the same , and convey them to some proper place of security , where he shall keep them until final action is had thereon . But no dwelling house in which , or in part of which a shop is not kept , shall be searched , unless at least one of said ccmplainants shall testify to some act of sale of intoxicating liquors therein by the occupant thereof , or by his consent or permission , within at least one month of the time of making said complaint . And the owner or keeper of said liquors , seized as aforesaid , if he shall be known to the officer seizing the same , shall be summoned forthwith before the justice or judge by whose warrant the liquors were seized , and if he fails to appear , or unless he can show by positive proof , that said liquors are of foreign production , that they have been im // ported under the laws of the United States , and in accordance therewith-that they are contained in the original packages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the laws of the United States prescribe , they shall be declared forfeited , an 1 shall be destroyed by authority of the written order to that effect , of said justice or judge and in his presence , or in the presence of some person appointed by him to witness the destruction thereof , and who shall join with the officer by whom they shall have been destroyed , in attesting thitt fact upon the back of the order , by authority of which it was done ; and the owner or keeper of such liquors shall pay a fine of twenty dollars and costs , or stand committed for thirty days , in default of payment , if in the opinion of the court said liquors shall have been kept or deposited for the purposes of sale And if the owner or possessor of any liquors seized in pursuance of this section , shall set up the claim that they have been regularly imported under the laws of the United States , and that they are contained in the original packages , the custom house certificates of importation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereto , shall not be received as evidence that the liquors contained in said packages are actually imported therein. ** Section twelfth provides that when the owner , keeper or possessor of the liquors seized is unknown to the officer , they shall be described and advertised for two weeks ; and upon satisfactory proof , adduced within two weeks , that at the time of their seizure they were the property of any city or town in the State , purchased by its agent in pursuance of the provisions of this act , they shall not be destroyed , but shall be delivered up by the judge or justice authorizing the seizure , to the agent of said city or town . Section thirteenth treats of an appeal by claimants of seized liquors . The appellant must give a bond in the sum of two hundred dollars , with two sufficient sureties , to prosecute his appeal , and to pay all fines and costs which may be awarded against him ; and where the quantity of liquors so seized shall exceed five gallons , if the final decision shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shall be adjudged a common seller of intoxicating liquors , and shall be subject to the penalties provided for in section eight , and said liquors shall be destroyed as provided for in section eleven . Nothing , however , in this act shall be so construed as to prevent any chemist , artist , or manufacturer , in whose art or trade they may be necessary , from keeping such quantity of distilled liquors as he may have occasion to use in his art or trade , but not for sale . Section fourteenth provides for the seizure of intoxicating liquors in any tent , hut , shanty , or place of any kind for selling refreshments , on any public occasion or gathering . It makes it the duty of certain officers , on information given , to search such premises , and , if intoxicating drinks are found , to seize them , and to arrest the keeper or keepers of such premises , and to take them and their liquors forthwith before some judge or justice of a municipal or police court , and upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county jail for thirty days , and the liquors shall be destroyed by order of the justice or judge . Seetion // fifteenth provides that an appellant from judgment against him according to section fourteenth , shall give a bond , in the sum of one hundred dollars with two good sureties , for prosecution of the appeal and payment of all fines , costs and penalties which may be awarded against him ; and if the verdict shall be against him , he shall pay an additional fine of twenty dollars . It provides , also , for fees to the prosecuting officer of the government , ( who shall conduct all cases of appeal under this act , except where the proceeding is by action of ' debt , ) and that costs shall not be remitted or reduced . Section sixteenth provides that all payments , of whatever kind , for liquors sold in violation of law , shall be held to have been received without consideration , and against law , equity and good conscience ; and all sales , transfers and conveyances , mortgages , liens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thence accruing in whole or in part , shall be utterly null and void in law , and in any action touching them either in law or equity the purchaser of such liquors may be a witness for either party . And it further provides that no action shall be had in any court of the State for the recovery and possession of intoxicating liquors , or the value thereof , whether sold in this State or any other State or country . Section seventeenth ordains that all provisions of this act relating to towns shall be applicable to cities and plantations , and those relating to selectmen shall be applicable to the mayor and aldermen of cities and assessors of plantations . Section eighteenth repeals certain portions of a former act , and all other acts or portions of acts inconsistent with this act . It must be apparent to every reader of this law , who has been at all familiar with the attempts to execute laws against the traffic in intoxicating liquors , that it has been framed from experimental knowledge of the difficulties which have attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods devised by the unscrupulous ingenuity of liquor sellers and their attorneys to evade such laws , and with the determined design to meet all those difficulties and to guard against all those evasons . And this , as we learn from friends of the law in Maine , was been the fact . If the law has a special and admirable adaptation to the purpose of suppressing the traffic ; if it is so constructed that lawless liquor dealers can neither evade nor contend with it ; this is because the framers of the law have profited by the lessons taught them by those who have endeavored to elude or violate the plain intent of former laws . Whatever oversight in former laws rumsellers have discovered and // profited by , has been provided for in this . Whatever crevices in former laws rumsellers have been wont to squeeze through , and whatever holes they have made b* burrowing under previous prohibitory enactments , have been completely stopped in this . The framers of this law , under the direction of public sentiment , have aimed at a single object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a beverage ; and to accomplish that object effectually , and yet without infringing on constitutional or private rights , they have employed not a little inventive wisdom , and knowledge gained by long and careful observation of the past . And they have succeeded . We can not suppress our exultation as we say it . They have succeeded . They have incorporated in their law principles , never applied to such laws before , yet long applied , and with general acquiescence , to laws on some other matters , principles which make enforcement of the law easy and effectual . The almost discouraged friends of temperance everywhere hail it as a " star in the east , " ushering in a new and triumphant era in the reformation for which they give their labors and their prayers . The efficiency of the law results from the ease , certainty and celerity with which a real violator of it may be detected and convicted ; and the efficacy of the penalties if he persists in his illegal traffic . A few words on each of these features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty of convicting an off even the grossest  --  the great difficulty of ever bringing down the penal power of the law upon its transgressors . It has been almost impossible to bring evidence before courts of justice of the reality of sale , though that reality was undoubted . It must be proved that the liquor drank was intoxicating liquor , not merely that it looked like it . It must be proved also that the liquor drank was sold , not given away . Now the cases are quite rare where this can be proved by any persons , except those who have drank the liquor themselves , or their companions-by any persons except the frequenters of grog-shops . And they , it has been found on ample trial , can not be depended upon for honest testimony . They will not know anything about the sale , when brought on to the witnesses stand . It is a sad truth , but truth it is , that nei*-ther liquor dealers , nor their customers , will hesitate to perjure themselves , when called on to testify what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this law makes the liquor itself a witness , when searched for and found ; and it requires the proper officers to get out a warrant , and search for it , in any shop , or place of sale , when three citizens declare , that they have reason to believe that liquor is sold in such shop // or place . This liquor , when found in any place of sale , or in any private house where a sale has first been proved , if the occupant can not prove himself , to have been appointed town agent for the sale of liquors-this liquor thus found , is itself a witness , and a witness that can not lie or deceive , or be ignorant or dumb . Thus the production of testimony , amply sufficient for the conviction of a transgressor of the law , is a very simple and easy matter . This principle , viz , making the presence of the implements of illegal business proof of guilty intention , is perfectly familiar to us , having been incorporated for years in our laws against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the more destructive business of vending intoxicating drinks , we only wonder that it has not long since been applied to that business , when carried on contrary to law . Great difficulty also has been usually experienced , whenever a convicted liquor seller has appealed from the decision of a justice to a court and jury . Some liquor seller , in nine cases out of ten , would be on the jury , and however clear the guilt of the accused might be , the jury would not agree , and the cost of prosecution would be thrown on the community . So often has this been the case that attempts at prosecution under our present laws have been greatly discouraged . It is maintaining a legal contest against the rumseller with all the odds on his side . But this law provides that no liquor seller or suspected liquor seller shall be on a jury for the trial of a liquor case . It is true indeed that under former laws the power existed in the prosecuting officer to remove a liquor seller from the jury by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely at the discretion of the officer , was rarely exercised . It is one excellence of this law that , in this respect as in all others , it leaves as little as possible to official discretion and choice , but makes the officer 's duties specific . If any man among those who desire the enforcement of the law informs the court that any member of any panel is engaged in the traffic in alcoholic liquors , or that he believes he is so engaged , " the court shall inquire of the juryman of whom such belief is entertained . " The law allows him to decline an answer . But if he does , he shall be discharged from further attendance as juryman ; and if he answers falsely , he shall be thereafter incapable of serving on any jury in the State . So the prosecution of any suspected violator of the law is not left to the discretion of any officer ; for the law provides , that , " if any three persons , voters in the town or city where the complaint shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or judge of // any municipal or police court make complaint under oath or affirmation that they have reason to believe , and do believe that spirituous or intoxicating liquors are kept or deposited , and intended for sale , by any person not authorized to sell the same in said city or town under the provisions of this act , in any store , shop , warehouse or other building or place of sale , the said justice or judge shall issue his warrant of search to any sheriff , city marshal or deputy , or to any constable , who shall proceed to search the premises described in said warrant . " The law is so constructed that it depends for enforcement , not on the discretion and choice of official men , nor on the majority of the people in a particular locality , but simply on a few friends of the law in that locality . Three temperance men who are not afraid , one justice of the peace , and one constable , are sufficient to enforce the law in any locality . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys , to avail themselves of " the law 's delay . " In the first place , their case would have to wait its turn upon a crowded docket . And when its turn came , they would on the ground of the pretended absence of some essential witness or under some pretext or other , procure a continuance of the case . This answered two purposes . It gave an opportunity in the meantime for some of the witnesses for the prosecution to disappear , or be got out of the way ; and it gave them an opportunity , before the case should be issued , to make more than money enough , by the pursuit of the illegal traffic , to pay all fines and costs which would accrue if they should be finally convicted . This law completely blocks this game , by the provision that cases arising under it shall take precedence in a superior court of all other business in that court , except those of criminal cases in which the parties are actually under arrest , awaiting a trial ; and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nolle prose qui , or to grant a continuance , either before or after the verdict , except where the purposes of justice shall require it . Another device of illegal traffickers in alcoholic liquors has been to appeal from the decision of a justice or municipal judge to a higher court , and that in cases where the decision was manifestly correct . This gave them whatever advantage there might be in " the glorious uncertainty of the law , " especially in a jury trial , and , what was more valuable to them , it gave them the opportunity during the pendency of the appeal to pursue their lawless method of gain , which many did pursue with such profitable results that they could well afford to be sued every month . To this device also this law puts an end , by the // provision that the appellant shall give two bonds , with two sufficient sureties to each , one in the sum of one hundred dollars that he will prosecute the appeal and will pay all costs , fines and penalties which may finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred dollars that he will not during the pendency of this appeal violate any of the provisions of this act . And moreover it discourages appeals to the higher courts , not by the innocent but by the guilty , by the provision that if on the appeal they are convicted the amount of the fines and penalties shall be doubled  --  a wise and just provision : for it is not , as some have caricatured it , a punishment for seeking justice by lawful appeal , but a suitable reward to a person who knows he is guilty , for vexing the State , for putting the State to unnecessary trouble and expense . If a guilty person chooses thus to seek advantage from the glorious uncertainty of the law , let him pay for his chance by an aggravation of his risks . Such is the celerity with which this law operates on its transgressor . Indeed it takes effect instantly , as soon as it lays its hand upon him . From that moment it completely stops his illegal business . It puts an utter end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accused person , of defiance of the law by a person while he is in the hands of the law . Such is the ease , the certainty and the celerity with which this law operates on those who violate it . It harms and can harm no innocent person . But it lays its hands upon the transgressor , and he is gone ; he can not contend with it . It seizes him with a lion 's grasp , instant , infallible , inevitable . The second of the features which constitute the efficiency of this law is the efficacy of its penalties . It is not severe upon a person who violates it but once . It subjects him to a fine of ten dollars and the cost of prosecution , and holds him committed till payment is made . If he is convicted of a second violation , it subjects him to a fine of twenty dollars and the costs of prosecution , and holds him committed until payment is made . But on the third and every subsequent conviction , it subjects him to twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the common jail not less than three nor more than six months . The common or habitual seller , however , and the manufacturer , of alcoholic liquors , are punished more severely . On the first conviction they are subjected to a fine of one hundred dollars and the costs of prosecution , and in default of payment are imprisoned sixty days in the common jail ; on the second conviction they are subjected to a fine of two hundred dollars and costs of prosecution , and in default of payment are imprisoned four months in the common jail ; and // on the third and every subsequent conviction , they are both fined and imprisoned-fined two hundred dollars and imprisoned four months . Moreover , the intoxicating liquor found on their premises is at once taken from their possession , and , after decision against it by the appropriate tribunal , is destroyed ; and all contracts or claims , of whatever kind , in whole or in part , for intoxicating liquors sold contrary to this act , are outlawed and can not be enforced by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All see that it is the part of discretion and of self-interest to yield at once . The violators of former laws found their lawless business so lucrative , that they could well afford to pay their fine as often as they could be convicted , with the difficulties in the way of conviction already described . The keeper of a large hotel , or of a fashionable eating saloon , or of a well-frequented dram-shop , would return with head erect to the enormous gains which filled his pocket over and above paying his fines . But the violator of this law , after paying the fines and costs , returns from the scene of his trial and conviction , to find the material of his guilty gains , the liquor itself , to the value perhaps of hundreds of dollars , like " water spilt upon the ground that can not be gathered up again ; " and to find , also , that all the avenues by which he can renew his supply of that material are guarded by a police , who can not be evaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same fate . He finds , too , that he can not collect any bill against his customers ; and can not , as of old , when be has consumed the drunkard 's life , take away from his widow and children the remains of his estate to pay for the murderous process . And what is still more effectual , on the third and every subsequent conviction , however gentlemanly the deportment , however faultless his broadcloth , and however " respectable " his name , he is conducted to the common jail and takes his place , " his own place , " among felons . In this irresistible power of the penalties of the law , united with the ease , certainty and promptness with which it detects and convicts its trangressors , consists its efficiency-an efficiency which is now universally acknowledged ; which has suppressed entirely throughout the State the open sale of intoxicating liquors , except by the appointed town agents , who are under bonds to sell only for purposes of medicine and the arts ; and has compressed within very narrow limits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has emptied watch houses and houses of correction , diminished the police force , quieted the streets at night , almost abolished rowdyism , // and reduced taxation resulting from poverty and crime at the rate of from fifty to one hundred per cent . The objection to the law that it invades private property , is hardly worth notice . It invades the destroyer of property , and not of property only , but of health , morals , welfare , life and souls . Shall private property in this supremely destructive form be held sacred , when private property in the form of decayed vegetables , dangerous or mischievous dogs , counterfeit money , tools for counterfeiting , and implements for gambling , are destroyed by public authority without scruple ? The constitutionality of the law , which some have been inclined to question , there is no valid reason to doubt . We understand that it has been declared constitutional by the decision of the Superior Court of Maine . And its constitutionality has been virtually established by the Supreme Court of the United States , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Daniel said : " No such right ( the right to sell in violation of the police regulations of the State ) is purchased by the importer ; he can not purchase from the government that which it can not insure to him , a sale independent of the laws and policy of the State . " Chief Justice Taney said : " If any State deems the retail and internal traffic in ardent spirits injurious to its citizens , I see nothing in the Constitution to prevent it from regulating and restraining the traffic , or from prohibiting it altogether . " The following passage from Justice Grier 's opinion in the same case is very satisfactory : " It is not necessary to array the appalling statistics of misery , pauperism and crime , which have their origin in the use and abuse of ardent spirits . The police power , which is exclusively in the State , is alone competent to the correction of these great evils , and all measures of restraint or prohibition necessary to effect the purpose , are within the scope of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime , or the preservation of the public peace , health and morals , are from their very nature of primary importance , and lie at the foundation of social existence . They are for the protection of life and liberty , and necessarily compel all laws on subjects of secondary importance , which relate only to property , convenience or luxury , to recede when they come in contact or collision . Salus , populi suprema lex . The exigencies of the social compact require that such laws be executed before and above all others . it is for this reason that quarantine laws , which protect public health , compel mere commercial regulations to submit to their control . They restrain the liberty of passengers ; they operate on the ship , which is the instrument of commerce , and its officers and crew , // the agents of navigation . They seize the infected cargo and cast it overboard . All these things are done , not from any power which the State assumes to regulate commerce , or interfere with the regulations of Congress , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public welfare , must of necessity have full and free operation , according to the exigency that requires their interference . If a loss of revenue should accrue to the United States from a diminished consumption of ardent spirits , she will be the gainer a thousand fold in the wealth and happiness of the people . " We conclude by expressing the hope and the belief , that the example of Maine , in the enactment and execution of this law , will be adopted by many of her sister States . There is no measure now claiming public attention which will contribute so much to the ends of good government ; none which calls more loudly for cooperation , energy and perseverance upon all friends of the public welfare . It is greatly to be desired that all the States should adopt and execute laws which prohibit altogether the sale of alcoholic liquors as a beverage ; and we think that such laws are more easily enforced than those which allow a restricted sale on the license system , because they are seen and felt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license system , they can apply the principles of the Maine law to the unlicensed sale of intoxicating drinks , which constitutes everywhere the larger and usually the most pernicious part of the traffic ; and can thus stop the destroying flood , except in those channels where , in their folly , they authorzie it to flow .
