txt ART . V.-JOHN COTTON . The Life of Jo/tn Cotton . By A. XV . MCCLURE . Written for the Massachusetts Sabbath School Society , and revised by the Committee of Publication . Boston : Mass . Sabbath School Society . 1846. pp. 300 . THE managers of " the Massachusetts Sabbath School Society " have engaged in the laudable enterprise of getting up a series of biographical volumes , entitled " Lives of the Chief Fathers of New England . " Six volumes have been published , of which the volume now before us is the first . // The merits and advantages of such a plan are obvious . It proposes to provide for all our Sabbath School libraries a body of historical and biographical literature , which shall commend to coming ages all that was sound in the principles , and all that was good in the examples , of the heroic fathers of New England . It proposes to direct the attention of competent writers to the I ) reparation of works in this particular line , by giving them some comfortable assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It proposes to circulate and sell the volumes thus prepared , by employing for that end the various influences and agencies which can be wielded by a popular religious publishing Society . We can not doubt that the enterprise , so far as doing good is concerned , will be highly successful . Books prepared under such auspices , and " revised by the Committee of Publication , " will certainly be safe . The disadvantages of the plan are perhaps equally obvious . Books written to order , ' under the superintendence of a committee , are not quite so likely to glow with a natural inspiration , as those which are written under the excitement of an inward impulse on the mind of the author . The position , too , of the author writing to carry out the plan of such a series , got up by a religious publishing Society for the churches of one denomination exclusively , is not altogether desirable . Each biography in the series must needs be rather a panegyric than an impartial and critical history . No opinion discordant with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , bold thought that might provoke some new discussion , can find admission . And if by any accident the committee shall have permitted themselves to affix their imprirnatur to some rash utterance that gives offense , what can the author expect but that on the first indication of hostility , on the first complaint from any quarter from which the committee has any thing to hope or fear , his employers and publishers will xvithdraxv his book from the market , and will virtually stigmatize it as being at the best , of dangerous tendency ? Beside all this , the author can hardly fail to be embarrassed by the attempt to do two things at once . He is employed in writing a book for Sunday School libraries , a young people 's book , which shall be at the same time a book for general circulation . To overcome this difficulty entirely  --  to write for the great public , and yet to be betrayed into no disquisition or digression inappropriate to the design of a Sabbath School , is an achievement to which few writers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Walter Scott could have done it . But we doubt whether any such thing could have been done . by John Poster or Thomas Chalmers . Jane Taylor could have done it ; but the powers of her brother Isaac are hardly equal to such a task . // In the volume now under consideration , Mr. M'Cltire has overcome the various difficulties of his task in a manner highly creditable to his ability as a writer and to the heartiness of his sympathy with the founders of these New England commonwealths and churches . In dealing with a book so well intended , and on the whole so well adapted to its purpose , we will not indulge in any ungracious criticism . We hope it may be found ere long in every Sunday School of the Orthodox Congregational communion from Maine to California . And we can not but regret that there is so little chance of its finding entrance into Sunday Schools of any other denomination . Not only must Unitarians and Episcopalians reject it with horror ; but even our Presbyterian friends of whatever type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it , for the author 's zeal against the Presbyterian form of government burns with a clear and unrelenting flame . The age of the settlement of New England was not like the passing age , in which hardly any body that has occupied any public station can escape the honors of biography . Yet the life of John Cotton was written and published , six years after his death , by his friend and successor , John Norton . Nearly half a century afterwards he was again commemorated by his grandson Cotton Matlier in that great barathrum of Puritan pedantry , the Magnalia . John Davenport also wrote a life of Cotton , which was never published , but which Norton and Mather appear to have consulted , and which was preserved in manuscript as late as the days of Gov . Hutchinson , and may have been destroyed by the stamp-act mob in 1766 , which destroyed so many treasures of that kind in burning Hutchinson 's library . Another memoir by Samuel Whiting of Lynn , long remained unpublished , but when it was given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was seen to have been the basis not only of Mather 's narrative but also of Norton 's . The early history of Massachusetts abounds in notices of Cotton and of his influence in civil and still more in ecclesiastical affairs . In the controversial writings of that age on both sides of the Atlantic , and especially in those belonging to the controversy between Presbyterianism and Congregatio nalism , Cotton is spoken of in a tone which shows that he was felt to be a man of power . Who was John Cotton ? What service did he render in his generation ? Fifteen years before the close of that century which was signalized by the Reformation , there was living in the pleasant old town of Derby , where the I ) erwent gives its line of beauty to the picturesque scenery of Derbyshire , a grave and religious man , named Roland Cotton . He was of an honorable descent ; but his parents having been " by some injustice , " as the family // tradition reports , " deprived of great revenues , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plebeian employment , and was accordingly brought up a lawyer , in the vain hope that legal science and skill might enable him to recover the estate which had been vrongfully wrested from his family . At the date which we have indicated , the conflict between the two adverse elements of the English Reformation had not yet passed its first grand crisis . There were no known " dissenters , " in the modern English use of that word , but almost everywhere there were " non-conformists , " the spiritual descendants of Wycliffe and the Lollards , praying and waiting for a purer and more thor* ough reformation which should bring the Church of England into a full agreement with the purest churches of the continent . The petrification of the Anglican Church-system with all its contradictions was not then understood to be a completed fact ; for the system itself was new ; Qneen Elizabeth , the author of it , was still upon the throne ; her cons in Mary of Scotland , generally regarded as the heir-presumptive to the throne , had not yet fallen under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how soon the accession of another monarch , either more popish or more protestant than that last and princeliest of the Tudors , might restore the mass or reform the prayer-book ? Only twenty .. seven years had passed since the reign of " bloody Mary . " The smoke from the martyr-pyres of Oxford and Smithfield , was still1 as it were , in the eyes and nostrils of the English people . Among the children of that memorable John Rogers , the first martyr of Q*ueeu Mary 's reign , whose " wife and nine small children " fol* lowed him to the stake and stood by while he was burned , the " one at the breast , " if still livint* at the time which we have indicated , had not yet passed the noon of life . Just&gt; at that time the long religious war in the Netherlands  --  the war which estab lished the independence and liberties of the Dutch republic-was astonishing all Europe with the desperateness of its battles and the splendid succession of the victories won for freedom and for the reformed religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the new republic , was giving to the imperial power of Spain a defiance which was answered not long afterwards by the armada of 1587 ' that was to invade and conquer England and to recover the English heretics to the communion of Rome by torture and by fire . The England of those days was that which Walter Scott has attempted to portray in his romance of Kenilworth ,  --  the time of which is only nine years earlier than the time we speak of . On the fourth of December , 1585 , there was born to Roland Cotton , the puritan lawyer of Derby , a son whom he named John . And we may be sure that those l ) uritan parents did not baptize their child by such a name without repeating from their // Geneva Bible- ( " our English Bible , " that is , King James 's tran* lation , was not then in being ) the question that was asked at the circumcising of John the Baptist , " What manner of child shall this be ? " Plainly enough the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible that he might be a man of some account and figure in his generation . The name COTTON ( in French Coton )  --  a name not undistinguished in history-indicates the generous Norman rather than the churlish Saxon lineage . More properly , it shows that the family was of that middle class which was formed by the junction and fusion of the two races , and which constitutes the English people as distinguished from the clodpole peasantry on the one hand , and from the high aristocracy on the other  --  the class whose appearance in history is identified with the appearance of a people neither Saxon nor Norman , but English , with the English language for their mother tongue-the class to which almost every great and characteristic name in English history , whether of statesman or warrior , whether of merchant or artist , whether of poet or scholar , must be referred-the class of which came the fathers of New England , not AngloSaxonis , but Anglo-Normans. this is the true nobility of Eng. - land ; this the pride of our American pedigree , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring , restless7 cotistructive , imperial Norman blood . The question , " What manner of child shall this be , " was not left wholly to the chapter of accidents . It was not to parents unconscious or regardless of the grandeur of their office that the childhood of John Cotton was committed in the providence of God . The cradle of hisinfancy  --  the home in which his mind first opened to the access of knowledge as the bud unfolds itself to the light-was " sanctified by the word of God and by prayer . " His first lessons were from that Geneva Bible . Often discourse at his father 's fireside was of high religious themes or of questions in theology . May we not see him with our mind 's eye , even before he had learned to read , turning over the black-letter leaves of Fox 's Book of Martyrs , and gazing upon horrid representations of horrid cruelties indicted on the saints ? May we not see him listening to the reminiscences of some old Protestant who was born in the days when bluff king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first queen , and who had seen the reformation under Edward VI , and the persecution under Mary ? In due time , under such training as the grammar school in his native town afforded , he was fitted for the university ; and at the age of thirteen years he was admitted to Trinity College in Cambridge . Of the two ancient Universities in England , Cambridge , rather than Oxford , was the chief seed plot of Puritanism . Characterized , at least in its later history , as the university of science rather // than of authority , it offered to the reformation , even then , a congenial soil in which the principles of the new order of things might take root and grow to maturity . Cambridge was the university of Cranmer , and of Ridley and Latimer , and there , by Cranmer 's influence , Martin Bucer the reformer of Strasburg , was placed in the chair of theology . Cambridge was the university of Bacon , as it was afterwards of Milton and of Newton . A large number of the leading Puritans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university . Cotton 's standing in his college was such that according to the report of his biographers he would have obtained a fellowship on that rich foundation , had not the election been deferred on account of the great expense in which the college had been involved by the erection of its great hall . For this reason , perhaps , he removed from Trinity College to Emanuel then recently founded . In that eminently Puritan college he obtained a fellowship . For full fourteen years he resided at the university , studying , disputing , teaching , honored with various academical distinctions , and regarded in all quarters as one of the most famous men of his day . Such is the testimony of Whiting , repeated by Norton and Mather as well as by Mr. M'Clure . Yet it must be confessed that in none of the histories of that university which have fallen under our notice , *s any mention made of John Cotton either in his career as a student of r**i*p*y College , or in his honors and services at Emanuel College , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was " a diligent tutor and full of students committed to his care. ** It was at the university , that his mind was first illuminated by an evangelical experience of what Christianity is as " the power of God to salvation . " His childhood and youth had been unstained . He had been carefully trained in the discipline of a Puritan household . While yet a boy he had been placed amid the Puritan influences of Cambridge , charged , no doubt , to attend diligently upon the preaching of the famous William Perkinsone of the most learned and acute among the theologians of that age , an author whose works were translated into foreign languages and were spoken of with admiration throughout Protestant Christendom , and at the same time one of the most earnest and fervent of preachers , whose sermons and counsels were equally appreciated by the learned and the ignorant . It was not without habitual uneasiness that Cotton listened to those homely , pungent sermons , under which it was difficult for man or boy to be drowsy . But , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations after knowledge , he was unwilling to recognize the paramount claims of religion as a personal concern . An influence that had brooded over his cradle and had mingled itself with all the nurture and discipline of his // childhood , was pressing upon his reluctant mind . While he was thus , at the age of seventeen , resisting the consciousness of duty and the inward monitions of God , the preacher whose sermons had so often made him uneasy , was struck down in his glorious " activity of love and power , " and lay upon his death-bed . Cotton was walking in the field when the slow stroke of the tolling bell announced that the godly soul of William Perkins was passing away from earth . At that moment he detected in himself a feeling of relief , a sort of secret gladness , as he himself described it , that the preacher who had so " laid siege to and beleaguered his heart , " would now no more annoy him with those severe and searching sermons . This alarmed him : it made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the nature of sin and of his own sinfulness . Afterwards , under the preaching of Dr. Sibbes  --  a name once greatly reverenced in its connection with the history of Puritanism-he obtained some new sense of the necessity of a spiritual renovation , and of the nature of that change without which no man shall see the kingdom of God . Yet for a long time after this , he saw no way of hope open for him . Assured that in his experience thus far there was nothing of the effectual grace of God , " he lay a long time in an uncomfortable , despairing way ; and of all things this was his heaviest burthen , that he had willingly withstood the means and offers of grace and mercy which he found had been tendered to him . " At last , when " three years , " as Mather testifies , had thus passed over him , he began to appreciate that " faithful saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners . " He ever loved and honored Dr. Sibbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of the old Puritan religious experience . Happy was he whose conversion had all these definite stages of progress . Such an one had no occasion to be perplexed because he could not tell when and how he was converted , as Richard Baxter was perplexed for almost half his life-time , till he learned that " education is as properly a means of grace as preaching . " The religious experience of the Puritans , as exhibited in what may be taken for model specimens , was clearly enough the Holy Spirit leading the mind through the knowledge of guilt and helplessness to the knowledge of Christ ; but its imperfection was that the legitimate effect of the simple objective gospel was modified by influences derived essentially from the sphere of scholastic theology . While the matter of fact that Christ died for our offenses , and was raised for our justification , was by no means kept out of sight in the preaching or in the theologizing of that age ; while the grand evangelical announcement , " God so loved the world that he gave his only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but may have everlasting life , " was proclaimed as the only basis of Christian // hope , and the effective inspiration of Christian love and zeal ; that " faithful saying " was not always presented to men in the historic simplicity in which it commends itself to the serious and burthened soul as " worthy of all acceptation . " Too often the mind , awakened to the consciousness of sin and of dependence , was occupied with inquiries and propositions about the subjective process of conversion , and was thus kept back from appreciating and grasping the salvation offered in the gospel . Those controversies about the application of grace , those psychological and metaphysical debates about free-will and the method in which conversion is effected , and those profound speculations about the relations of human activity to the power and purposes of God , which make so little figure in the Scriptures and so grand a figure in the history of scholastic theology , had worked themselves so thoroughly into all the systems of that age , that they stood between every mind and the objective gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened inquirer must sound his dim and perilous way , ' before he could lay hold on the hope set before him . Yet we confess that to us such an experience as John Cotton 's seems more evangelical , and even less affected by a preconceived theory of the process , than the experience of conversion as it often takes place under the administration of some more modern systems . For evidence that the foundation has been laid of a deep and stable Christian character , give us a story of painful gropings and strugglings , and of blind and baffled endeavors , ending at last in a strange and sudden relief at the thought of Christ , rather than a story , however philosophical , which has for its beginning the suspension of the selfish principle , and for its middle the reconsideration of the question as to what is required by an enlightened self-love , and for its end a simple act of the will determining the man to be a Christian-all with the strictest adherence to the unities of time and place . Cotton appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of mind in respect to his personal relation to Christ . When , where and by what prelatical hands , he was invested with " holy orders " in the Church of England , none of his biographers have taken the trouble to inform us ,  --  so utterly unimportant were such questions in their view . They are more careful to inform us that before the great change in his religious character , his university performances in the way of preaching were distinguished by a florid and pedantic eloquence which made them highly acceptable to a scholastic auditory ; and that afterwards he addicted himself to a far more simple and earnest manner of handling religious themes , with much loss and damage to his university reputation , and with a corresponding augmentation of his usefulness to souls . One of his sermons in that less ambitious style was the means of bringing " Master Pres // ton , " afterwards the famous Dr. John Preston , to the knowledge of the truth. * At the age of twenty-six , ( in 1612 , ) John Cotton , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth year , entered upon the pastoral care of a parish in tile ecclesiastical establishment of England . In the seventh century , Botoiph , a Saxon who , in his travels on the continent , had seen and had learned to admire the monastic institutions in which learning and devotion were unwisely taking refuge , and whose pious zeal had become inflamed with the desire of providing such institutions for his native island , began to build a monastery or " minster " at a spot which afterwards was called Botoiph 's town  --  a name which in the progress of the ages has been shortened and softened into Boston . The borough of Boston is in the marshy region of Lincoinshire , on the banks of the navigable Witham some five miles above where that river enters into the common estuary of the streams that flow from " the fens , " and thirty-six miles below the ancient city of Lincoln . It was even in Cotton 's time a place of considerable trade both coast wise and with the opposite coast of Europe ; though then the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The parish church of Boston , dedicated to Saint l3otolph , is almost a cathedral in its dimensions and in its magnificence , and is reputed to be the largest church without cross-aisles in the kingdom . It was built more than five centuries ago , when the importance of the place seems to have been greater than it is even at this day . No Protestant church edifice in America can be compared with it for grandeur . It is 382 feet in length and 90 in breadth , with a tower 282 feet high which on that low flat coast is an important landmark to seamen . " The nave is exceedingly elevated and grand . " The chancel , " spacious and lofty , has ranges of stalls on each side , " as if it had been built for St. Botolph and his monks . Happily for the people of Boston , the right of presentation to the vicarage of their parish church , instead of being in hands altogether irresponsible , belongs to the corporation of the borough . Thus a presentation to the vicarage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preston , whose experience of spiritual religion was thus referred to the ministry of Cotton , was only about two years younger than Cotton himself and was at that time a fellow of Queen 's College . He was afterwards appointed chaplain to the Prince of Wales and preacher at Lincoln 's Inn , and in 1622 he became Master of Emanuel College . When the Duke of Buckingham wanted to court the Puritans , he affected to be the friend of Dr. Preston . Through his influence the leader of the Puritans , as Preston undoubtedly was , had the opportunity of rejecting the bishopric of Gloucester , and received instead of that dignity the lectureship in Trinity Church , Cambridge . At the accession of Charles I , Buckingham offered to make Preston Lord Chancellor of England , but he declined the dangerous offer . He died at the age of 41 , in 1628. // effect , though not in form , a call from the people of the parish . Such was the place to which Cotton was invited from his fellowship in Emanuel College and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first coming , he found some difficulty in the way of his induction . Though he was already , by conviction as well as by education , a Puritan in the more comprehensive sense of the word , he appears to have conformed generally , to the ceremonies which Calvin and many other regarded as follies that might be tolerated . Yet the bishop of the diocese , ( Barlow , Bishop of Lincoln , ) seems to have been opposed to him . He objected to Cotton 's youth as a disqualification for the charge of a divided people . And the ingenuous humility of the vicar elect was so far moved by this consideration , that he was almost persuaded to return to his college . But some of his friends , understanding in what way the bishop 's mind might be enlightened , took the business into their own hands , and used such arguments with him or with those who were about him , that all difficulty was removed . As Whiting tells the story , " one Simon Biby ( which some call Simony and Bribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so the business went on smooth , and Mr. Cotton was a learned man with the bishop , and was admitted into the place after their manner in those days . " us university career was not quite completed till a fe*v months after his settlement in Boston , when he returned to Cambridge for the purpose of taking his degree of Bachelor in Divinity . This he did in ample form , preaching his concio ad clerum in Latin , and maintaining his thesis in a public disputation , more academico . About the same time he acquired a better title than that of bachelor in any learned faculty , by marrying , as Mather tells us , " a pious gentlewoman , one Mrs. Elizabeth Horrocks , the sister of Mr. James Horrocks a famous minister of Lancashire , "  --  a worthy , we may add , whose fame and name would have been utterly lost long ago but for his having been brother of " that eminently virtuous gentlewoman " whose good fortune it was to be " recommended " to the young Bachelor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayns . " The new vicar was not long in winning , by his simplicity and earnestness , the undivided attachment of a people some of whom had strenuously favored another candidate . Nor did lie find it a very protracted labor to argue down and e. *tinguish an Arminian party in the town , for in those days , what was called Arminianism was not associated , as another kind of Arrninianism has been since Wesley 's time , with religious zeal and fervor . Some three or four years of his ministry passed away without any serious outward trouble . But his experience in the pastoral work seems to have made him more of a practical Puritan . The // rigor with which coiibrniity was urged upon the clergy , served only to make men like him more thoughtful and scrupulous about compliance . He did not renounce the ministry which he had received from the Lord Jesus Christ ; but he went on with his work , discontinuing whatever he found to be contrary to the Scriptures , for he knew that in that work he was responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Puritans in England . They were not seceders or schismatics ; they were simply non-conformists . Some refused to use the sign of the cross in baptism . Some refused to wear the priestly surplice , and officiated only in the black gown of the scholar . Some administered the Lord 's Supper without requiring the communicants to receive it kneeling . By these transgressions of rubrics and canons , they exposed themselves to prosecutions in the ecclesiastical courts arid to serious penalties . Not unfrequently , under the lenient administration of some heartily Protestant bishops , such deviations from the prescribed conformity were winked at for a while . But any dissatisfied parishioner , or any malicious intermeddler might bring a non-conforming minister into trouble by causing him to be prosecuted in the ecclesiastical courts . Such annoyance Cotton experienced at Boston . His parishioners as a body appear to have approved all his deviations from the canons and the rubrics . But complaint was brought against him in the consistorial court of the diocese , and for a while he appears to have been suspended from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher court , and there his friends and parishioners appear to have effected his restoration by very questionable methods . " Simon Biby " or some other agency no better seems to have been again resorted to . Whiting and Norton tell the story somewhat obscurely . According to their version , Thomas Leverett , ( afterwards ruling elder in the church at our New England Boston1 ) was employed by Cotton to manage the business ; " and he being a plain man , as Jacob was , yet subtile to get such a spiritual blessing , so far insinuated himself into one of the proctors of the High Court , that he sware in animam Dommi that Mr. Cotton was a conformable man , and so he was restored to Boston . " Mather , without naming Leverett , says , " A stedfast , constant , prudent friend , presenting a pair of gloves to a proctor of a higher court then appealed unto , that proctor without Mr. Cotton 's knowledge , swore in aniina ? n Domini that Mr. Cotton was a conformable man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise of his ministry . " It would be interesting to know xvhat magic there was in those gloves . Cotton himself says , in reference to his troubles on account of non-conformity , " What favor I was offered , not only for connivance but for preferment , if I would have conformed to any one of the ceremonies , I forbear to mention . Yea // when I was suspended upon special complaints made against me to the king that then was , and all hope of restitution denied to me without yielding to some conformity , at least in one ceremony at least once , yet the good hand of the Lord so kept me that I durst not buy my ministry so dear . And yet I thank the Lord my ministry was dearer to nie to speak the least , than any preferment . When the bishop of Lincoln diocese ( Dr. Mountaigne ) offered me liberty upon once kneeling at sacrament with him the next Lord 's day after , or else to give some reason why in conscience I could not unto Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time present with him at Westminster , I durst not accept his offer of liberty upon once kneeling , but 1 gave them this reason for my excuse and defense , Gultus non institut us , non est acceptus : Genuflectio in perceptione Euc/maristia3 est cultus non institutus ; Ergo , non est acceptus. " - Way of the Churches cleared , p. 19 . The reference to Bishop Davenant fixes the date of this affair in 1621 . The story which Whiting and all subsequent biographers tell us about the prosecution and appeal , is dated five or six years earlier . It can hardly be doubted that through the whole course of Cotton 's ministry at Boston , he must have been subject to frequent annoyances and interruptions of this nature . His people however adhered to him with unfailing friendship . They went with him in his non-conformity . The more religious and Puritanic part of them , " to the number of some scores , " went so far that they and he " entered into a covenant with the Lord and one with another , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It can hardly be wondered at , that with such an experience he became a strenuous asserter of Congregational independency . His labors at Boston are worthy of remembrance . Thrice in the twenty years of his service there , he completed the whole system of divimty in a series of Sunday afternoon exercises . This he did " in a catechistical way . " He " gave the heads of his discourse to those that were young scholars , and others in that town , to answer to his questions in public in that great congregation , and after their answers , he opened those heads of divinity , and sweetly applied all to the edification of his people and to such strangers as came to hear him . " The " young scholars " are not to be thought of as if they were like pupils in a modern Sunday school ; they were students , scholars in the ancient sense of the word . Such an afternoon exercise in the great congregation at St. Botolph 's was an admirable method of commanding the attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor was it a less admirable method of training the young scholars " in theology and leading them to study every topic in its connections with Christian experience and Christian practice . In his morning exercise on the Lord 's day , he seems to have followed a prevalent custom of that age , a custom which released the preacher from all perplexity in the choice of a subject . One text in those days often sufficed for a long course // of sermons , and when that had been disposed of , the next verse was expected to be entered upon in the next sermon . Thus Cotton , in his Lord 's day morning sermons , " preached over the first six chapters of the gospel by John , the whole book of Ecciesiastes , the prophecy of Zechariah and many other Scriptures . " At the monthly celebration of the Lord 's Supper , his texts were taken from 1 Cor. xi , and afterwards when that placer had been exhausted , a new one was opened in 2 Chron. xxx , which in its turn was thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Thursday lecture , " now languishing we believe at the church in Chauncey Place , is said to be lineally descended ; and at this service he " preached through the whole first and second epistles of John , the whole book of Solomon 's Song , and the parable.s of our Savior set forth in Matthew 's gospel to the end of chapter 16th comparing them with Mark and Luke . " In addition to his public and parochial labors he gave lectures more privately " to sundry young scholars that were in his house and some that came out of Germany . " The attendance on these private lectures so filled his house , that after a while , to avoid that inconvenience , he added to his public Thursday lecture three more weekly lectures in the church . In other words , he preached on Wednesday and Friday early in the morning , and on Saturday at 3 o'clock , i . M. Such were his ordinary services . But besides all this , he preached at the annual election of the mayor , and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the funerals of his parishioners , as well as on days of special humiliation or thanksgiving . A day of Puritan humiliation or thanksgiving in that age was no slight affair to the preacher or the hearers . Whiting , who in his youth was one of Cotton 's parishioners , testifies , in respect to his performances on such occasions , " I have known him in prayer and opening the word and applying it , five or six hours . " In brief , St. Botoiph 's church and vicarage , while Cotton was the vicar , seems to have been a sort of theological seminary . Preston , while master of Emanuel College , was wont to advise his pupils to spend some time with Cotton by way of completing their preparation for public usefulness . We can not but think that some such parochial seminaries at the present day might be a great improvement on our exclusively academical method of education for the ministry . Nor were the people of Boston losers by this resort of scholars to their pastor , for he seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholastic way . The study of the work of the ministry in a parish , under the guidance of a pastor , is a very different matter from the study of scientific theology in a university or a divinity college , under a corps of professors . Perhaps our candidates for the ministry under the present system have none too much of the latter ; but we are sure they have too little of the former . // The vicar of Boston did not perform his multiplied parochial labors without assistance . After his duties had multiplied , especially by the resort of students to his house , he had for his assistant Anthony Tiickney who had formerly been his pupil , and who was afterwards his successor there . Dr. Tuckney married a relative of Cotton ; and the relation which united them as colleagues in the ministry seems to have been entirely happy . Tuckney having succeeded to Cotton in the vicarage , remained there till he was called to London to sit in the Westminster Assembly in 1643 . In that memorable assembly he was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years afterwards he obtained the mastership of Emmanuel College . At a later period he became the head of St. John 's College and regius professor of Divinity at Cambridge . In 1648 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University . Dedicating one of Cotton 's posthumous works , of which he was editor , to their common friends at Boston , in 1654 , he said , " I often call to mind those most comfortable days in which I enjoyed the happiness of joint ministry with so able and faithful a guide ; and both of us so much satisfaction and encouragement from a people so united in the love both of the truth and of one another . " That Cotton remaiued in Boston so long , practicing church reformation with so much impunity , was owing not only to the unanimity with which the people of the borough adhered to him , but also to the connivance and powerful friendship of the bishop who then ruled that diocese . Dr. John Williams , Lord Keeper of the Great Seal , was made bishop of Lincoln in 1621. his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards Cotton , who had been contemporary with him in the university , he appears to have been particularly friendly . It is said that through his intercession with King James 1 , Cotton , whose ecclesiastical irregularities were notorious , and who might have been subjected to the heaviest penalties in the High Commission , was permitted to go on without interruption in his ministry . But the time was coming when Williams , with all his power and policy , would no longer be able to protect himself . The malignant star of Laud , in ominous conjunction with that of Wentworth , was beginning to be in the ascendant . New sevetities were practiced against the Puritans . What the proper ecclesiastical courts of the dioceses could not do through some defect in the laws , or what they failed to do through the tolerant disposition of here and there a bishop or subordinate functionary , was done by the High Conimission . What the courts of law and justice , and even the High Commission itself , could not do , was done by the terrific power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of converting the government of England into a despot // ism as unlimited as that of France or Spain , was rapidly advancing . In this condition of the church and state of England , many of the patriotic and reforming party , despairing of such a reformation as they had hoped for in their native land , began to look beyond the ocean . A little handful of separatists , who , for their impiety in daring to secede from the established worship of the realm and to set up an independent worship of their own , had been driven from England to Holland long a go , and who in 1620 had preserved their English nationality by retreating from Holland to America , had shown , with slender means and slight protection , how practicable it was for men inspired with a religious earnestness to find a free home in the new world , and to become the founders of a commonwealth . It was an age of colonization . Spain had acquired dominions of unlimited extent and of incredible riches , in the world which Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Portugal was drawing wealth from her colony in Brazil , and had found that America could enrich by other products than gold and silver . France had begun to establish an empire in America . Every great European power was agitated with a passion for acquiring and possessing provinces beyond the Atlantic . England shared in the passion of the age ; but of all English enterprises in the way of colonizing America , the little settlement which a few exiles for conscience sake had made at Plymouth , was the most successful . Most naturally , then , the question presented itself to some of the most devout and daring spirits among the Puritans , whether they ought not to undertake the work of planting the wilderness with English Protestant colonies . " About the year 1627 , " says one who had an important part in the movement , and who was at that date one of Cotton 's congregation , " some friends in Lincolnsh ire fell into discourse about New England ; and after some deliberation we imparted our reasons , by letters and messages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was likexvise deliberately thought upon . " In London and the west of England there were merchants and men of business who had been vainly endeavoring for several years to establish settlements upon the coast of New England for merely commercial purposes , and had abandoned the undertaking . Into some of their minds the same idea of a colony on higher principles and for religious ends , seems to have been breathed by John White , the Puritan rector of Trinity parish in Dorchester . In these consultations originated the colony of Massachusetts Bay . A beginning was made at Salem in 1628 . Early in the following year , the leaders of the enterprise succeeded in obtaining from the government of Charles I , a royal charter by which they were created an association with the title of " the Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay , " and with full // powers to found a colony and to govern it according to their own discretion . Under this charter , the enterprise immediately began to command a larger share of public attention . Reinforcements were sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church of England , Higginson and Skelton , who had both been sufferers for their non-conformity . On their arrival , Salem received its name , and a church was gathered on the plan of voluntary confederation . The report which Hugginson gave was widely circulated in England , three editions being published within a few months . All this while the plan of an extended emigration was gradually maturing . Such men as John Winthrop , Sir Richard Saltonstall , Isaac Johnson , and Thomas Dudley , men of wealth and high standing , were considering the question whether they ought not to lead the emigration in person instead of merely adventuring their capital in it and attempting to guide it without leaving their homes . What " considerations " moved them to engage in the planting of New England , and how they disposed of objections , we know from a paper , penned undoubtedly by Winthrop himself which was circulated in manuscript among those who were looking towards New England . " First , " said they , " it will be a service to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those parts of the world , and to raise up a bulwark against the kingdom of Anti-Christ. " " &amp;condly , all other churches of Europe are brought to desolation , " ( the time was one of great darkness and discouragement for Protestantism in Europe , ) " and it may justly be feared that the like judgment is coming upon us , and who knows but that God bath provided this place to be a refuge for many whom he means to save out of the general destruction ? " Nor was their godliness thoughtless of humanity . " Thirdly , the land grows weary of her inhabitants , so that man which is the most precious of all creatures , is here more vile and base than the earth they tread upon . " " Fourthly , we are grown to that excess and intemperance in all excess of riot as no mean estate will suffice a man to keep sail with his equals , and he that fails in it must live in scorn . " Hence , as they argued , came an odious want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the schools of learning and religion are so corrupted as ( besides the unsupportable charge of their education , ) most children , even the best , wittiest , and of fairest hopes , are perverted . " " &amp;xthly , the whole earth is the Lord 's garden , and he hath given it to the sons of Adam to be tilled and improved by them . Why then should we stand starving here for places of habitation , and in the mean time suffer whole cotintries , as profitable for the use of man , to lie waste ? " " Seventhly , what can be a better work than to help to raise and support a particular church while it is in its infancy , and to join our forces // with such a company of faithful people as by a timely assistance may grow stronger and prosper , and for want of it may be put to great hazard if not wholly ruined . " And finally , " If any such as are known to be godly , and live in wealth and prosperity here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , and run in hazard with them of a hard and mean condition , it will be an example of great use for the removal of scandal and sinister and worldly respects , to give more life to the faith of God 's people in their prayers for the plantation , and also to encourage others to join the more willingly in it. *** But if such men-including the men to whom the charter had been given and who were entrusted with the superintendence and control of the enterprise-were themselves to emigrate , embarking all their fortunes and hopes in the plantation of New England , how would the colony be directed and governed . By the charter the entire government of the colony was in the hands of the corporation , consisting of the governor , deputy governor , and assistants with the whole " company " or body of stockholders . Must the members of the company if they should go in person to New England , lose all their rights in the corporation ? If the governor and deputy and their assistants should go in a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work was to be done , would they be thereby disqualified and divested of their chartered powers ? These questions received the most deliberate consideration , and it was determined that the corporation itself " the governor and company of Massachusetts Bay , " should emigrate . Accordingly in 1630 , the exodus of the charter and government of Massachusetts was effected . Between the first of April and the last of August in that year , seventeen ships with more than fifteen hundred passengers sailed from England for Massachusetts . And thus were laid the foundations of a Puritan state , with a government recognized and authenticated by the sovereign of Great Britain . In all these consultations and proceedings John Cotton had been deeply concerned . Among the emigrants of 1630 under Winthrop were some sixty families from Lincolushire , and among the leaders of that emigration were some of " the Boston men " who had been actively engaged in the plan from its first conception . Most naturally therefore the name of Boston was given to the metropolis of the new commonwealth . * See the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27-31 . Also in Young 's Chr&amp;nicles of Mass. , 271-278 . Dr. Young 's Chronicles of the Pu . grims , and his more recent volume to which we have here made reference , are volumes in which nearly all of the most important documents relating to the earliest history of New England , are judiciously collected and laboriously edited . The diligence and carefulness of the learned editor are worthy of the i*ighest commendation. // Although Cotton must have often contemplated the probability that the course of public affairs in England would ultimately compel him to relinquish his ministry in that country , there is no evidence that he had as yet formed any purpose of removing to America . But the time was at hand when he must be separated from his flock . In the autumn of 1630 , a tertian ague , the disease of " the fens , " compelled him to desist from his labors for a year . About the same time , and by the same disease , the wife of his youth was taken from him . He found retirement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln , one of whose sisters , the Lady Arbella Johnson , had sailed in Winthrop 's fleet , with her husband , among the Puritan emigrants ; and another , the Lady Susan Humphrey , was soon to follow . When his health had been partly recovered in that hospitable retreat , he visited London and other distant places , and had the opportunity of seeing for himself what perplexity and fears were hanging over the prospect of ecclesiastical and religious reformation in England , and to what extent the expectations of " the godly " were turning toward the land of promise beyond the Atlantic . Returning to his charge in Lincolnshire he resumed his labors towards the close of 1631 . At last the time came . By the malice of an informer , his nonconformity was brought under the official notice of the High Commission Court ; officers of the court were sent to arrest him , and it became necessary for him to find safety in flight and concealment . There has been preserved a letter of his to his wife , ( for he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his flight to inform her of his safety ; and it gives us a better idea of the man than can be gathered from many a page of Mather 's quaint and pedantic eulogizing . It is dated , " October 3,1632 , " but it gives no hint of the place of his refuge . Addressing his " dear wife , and comfortable yoke-fellow , " the fugitive says , " If our heavenly Father be pleased to make our yoke more heavy than we did so soon expect , remember , I pray thee , what we have heard , that our heavenly husband , the Lord Jesus , when he first called us to fellowship with himself called us unto this condition , to deny ourselves and to take up our cross daily and follow him . And truly , sweet heart , though this cup may be brackish at the first taste , yet a cup of God 's mingling is doubtless sweet in the bottom to such as have learned to make it their greatest happiness to partake with Christ , as in his glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 1 am for the present . I am very fitly and welcomely accommodated , I thank God , so its here I might rest , ( desired enough , ) till my friends at home shall direct further . They desire also to see thee here , but that I think it not safe yet , till we see how God will deal with our neighbors at home . Lie refers , probably , to the efforts which his friends // were making to obtain some favor for him at court . For if you should now travel this way , I fear you will be watched and dogged at the heels . But I hope shortly God xviii make way for thy safe coming . Meanwhile send me now by this bearer such linen as I am to use . " Then he adds some messages of friendship or business . " Margarett , " who may have been his sister , " might come with this bearer , " if she were ready , and may ride " behind him on my mare , unless she desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , help her therein . " He requests her to go to his " mother Havered , " probably the mother of his deceased wife , and says , " commend my hearty respect and love to her ; and the rather because I had not time to see her at my coming out . To many other friends it will not be meet to speak of me now . The Lord watch over you all for good , and reveal himself in the guidance of all our affairs . So with my love to thee , as myself , I rest , desirous of thy rest and peace in Him. *** Mather reports that Cotton 's first intention was to take refuge immediately in Holland , as so many non-conforming ministers had done , but that by some friend he was persuaded to conceal himself in London . Intercession was made for him in high quarters ; the earl of Lincoln was his friend ; the earl of Dorchester , high in the court , exerted himself in his behalf . But the time had come when non-conformity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in vain . " If you had been guilty of drunkenness or uncleanness , or any such lesser fault , " - such was the message which he received from the earl of Dorchester - " I could have obtained your pardon , but inasmuch as you have been guilty of non-conformity and Puritanism , the crime is unpardonable , and therefore you must fly for your safety . " He de*ermined to seek a refuge among those of his people who had already emigrated and were still emigrating to New England . While he was thus concealed in London , he had opportunities of conferring on the great ecclesiastical questions of the time with many persons of Puritan principles , who were not yet prepared to be non-conformists to the extent to which he had refused conformity . Among these was John Davenport , then vicar of St. Stephen 's , Coleman street , whose account of his conference at that time with Cotton , has been preserved by Norton . Says Davenport , " His forced flight from Boston to London for his safety from pursuit of the pursuivants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I admire the special providence of God in it , toward myself and some others , among whom safe retirement and hiding places were provided for him , in and about London . For some of us agreed together to improve that opportunity for a conference with him about the grounds of his judgment and practice , // 407 ' whereby the church was in danger to be deprived of him and of the benefit of his precious gifts ; hoping that God might bless the same for the commnnicating of further light either to him or to us . " Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye-.  - -  names afterwards celebrated in the history of Independency-were with Davenport in that conference . The debate between Cotton and those who sought to know the grounds and reasons of his non-conformity , related chiefly to these two points , first , the limitation of church power to things commanded , involving the principle that there is no church power to impose upon ministers or worshipers things which God has not commanded ,  --  and secondly , the question whether bishops in the New Testament were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On such questions as these , many an earnest mind was in that day deeply agitated . If th' New Testament bishop was the ruler of nothing more than a single congregation , then the whole frame of the English national church government was without any warrant of holy writ . If the nature of church power is such that it can not legislate for the conscience but can only require conformity to Christ 's own institutions , then whatever in the prayer-book or in the mandates of ecclesiastical rulers was superadded to Christ 's own institutions , must needs be renounced by a scrupulous conscience . In the discussion of these points between Cotton and his London friends , there was " much debate about the meaning and extent of the second commandment , " both as to what it forbids and as to what it requires . The printed argunients in defense of conformity , by various writers whose names are now rarely mentioned and whose works are found only in the neglected alcoves of ancient libraries or among the collections of antiquaries ,  --  were diligently examined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shaped by the quick invention of the inquirers , who were stirnnlated not only by the natural desire to justify their own position , but also by the hope of bringing back their persecuted brother to such a measure of conformity as might permit him to remain in England and to continue in his ministry . But he convinced them that his understanding of the questions was more sound than theirs . To all their arguments " he answered , " as Davenport testifies , " with great evidence of scripture light , composedness of mind , mildness of spirit , constantly adhering to his principles and keeping them unshaken and himself from varying from them by anything spoken ad oppositum . When I observed that all this he did not in speech only , but also in sundry writings , ( the copies whereof I have , ) without the help of any book but the Scriptures , wherein he was mighty , ( and yet matters that required variety of reading , whether for confirmation of the truth or confutation of the contrary , fell frequently into discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and assistance of // him , quickening his apprehension and invention , strengthening his memory , composing his mind , and governing his spirit , far be- ' yond what I had taken notice of any man before him . The reason of our desire to confer with him rather than any other touching these weighty points , was our former knowledge of his approved godliness , excellent learning , sound judgment , eminent gravity , candor and sweet temper of spirit whereby he could placidly bear those that differed from him in their apprehensions . All which , and much more , we found in him . " Out of that conference it grew that Goodwin , Nye , Davenport , and others who had part in it , became unflinching non-conformists , and encountered the penalties in such case made and provided . Out of that conference came the distinctive position which Goodwin and Nye held afterwards in the Westminster Assembly as the champions of Independency against all forms of national and classical church government . Out of that conference came Davenport 's flight into Holland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Coleman Street congregation to found another Puritan colony . The return of Cotton to his ministry at St. Botolph 's in Boston , was no longer to be thought of After such consultation as the emergency would permit with individuals of his congregation , he resigned his ministry in a communication to the Bishop of Lincoln , his friend and former protector , Williams . In this communication which has been preserved by Hutchinson , he says , " The bent of my course hath been , ( according to my weak measure , ) to make and keep a threefold Christian concord amongst the people , between God and their conscience , between truehearted loyalty and Christian liberty , between the love of God and the love of one another . " In regard to that in which the course of his ministry had been least satisfactory to his Lordship , " to wit in not discerning Christian liberty to practice some com* mands of authority in some circumstances , " he says : " I freely acknowledge your Lordship bath not been wanting freely and often to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity , and with such weibtempered authority and mildness , that I profess unfeignedly no outward respect in the world could have detained me from requesting your Lordship 's favor , with ready subjection to your Lordship 's counsel , that I might have prolonged mine own peace and your Lordship 's favor together . But so it is , my good Lord , though I do unfeignedly and deservedly honor your Lordship , and highly esteem many hundreds of other reverend divines , great lights of the Church , ( in comparison with whom , what am I , poor spark ? ) who doubt not of their liberty in these matters , yet to this day , ( I speak in the simplicity of my heart , ) I can only follow your Lordship with observance , and them with reverence , but not with that plerophory of faith in these things which in such cases the apostle requireth . ( Rom. xiv , 5 . ) Your Lordship welt knoweth it is both the apostles ' and the prophets ' principle , ( and it holdeth in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Justus exfide SZLa vivit , non ahena ; and therefore howsoever I do highly prize and much prefer other men 's judg // ment and learning and wisdom and piety , yet in things pertaining to God and his worship , still I must , as I ought , live by mine own faith , not theirs . Nevertheless , where I can not yield obedience of faith , I am willing to yield patience of hope . " And now , my good Lord , I see the Lord , who began a year or two ago to suspend , after a sort , my ministry from that place by a long and sore sickness , the dregs whereof still hang about me , doth now put a further necessity upon me wholly to lay down my ministry there , and freely to resign my place into your Lord ship 's hands . For I see neither my bodily health nor the peace of the Church will now stand with my continuance there . " Cotton 's migration to Nexv England was not unexpected here . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had loved and honored him for his work 's sake , were already citizens of a new Boston , and their letters of invitation and persuasion were urging him to follow them . At last his preparations were completed . But how was he to escape from the kingdom , a hunted fugitive from the terrors of ecclesiastical law ,  - -  he for whom the officers of the High Commission were so carefully watching . The Griffin , a ship of three hundred tons , was about to sail with some two hundred passengers for Massachusetts , including not a few from Lincolnsh ire . in those days every vessel that sailed for New Englatid , was searched to prevent the escape of such fugitives as he . Should he embark with the rest at London , he could hardly hope to escape . rrhe ship therefore dropped down the Thames without him ; but she was expected to touch at the Isle of XVight , and thither the pursuivants hasted not doubting that there they should meet their fugitive . Meanwhile , John Cotton and Thomas Hooker , both fleeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month of the Thames , and there they embarked , while the p*rsuivants at the Isle of XVight waited for them in vain . Samuel Stone , so long the colleague of Hooker at Hartford , was a passenger in the same vessel . At the end of eight weeks , on Wednesday , the 4th of September , ( 0 . 5. ) 1633 , the Griffin arrived in Boston harbor . Cotton 's first child , a son , was born upon this voyage , in memory of which he was named Seaborn , or in Latin , as afterwards en rolled in the catalogue of Harvard College , Marigena . In the evening of the Saturday after the arrival of this company , at a meeting of the Boston Church " in their ordinary exercise , " Mr. Cotton took a part , by request , in the discussion of the evening , and afterwards he and his wife were propounded as candidates for membership in that church . rrhe next day in the afternoon , " he exercised , " as Gov . Winthrop has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public service of the corigregation . As he was then to be admitted , " he signified his desire and readiness to make his confession according to order . " Accordingly he made confession of his faith by " declarincr his faith about baptism , " for he desired then to present his infant child to God in that ordinance . In addition to his profession of faith , he *TOL VIII . 52 // gave two reasons for not baptizing the child at sea ,  --  first , that though their ship was a floating temple in which there were three daily services of prayer and preaching , " they had no settled congregati()n there , " no church with bishops and deacons ; and secondly , that " a minister hath no power to give the seals but in his own congregation . " He also spoke in behalf of his wife , " and gave a modest testimony of her , but withal requested that she might not be put to make open confession which he said was against the Apostle 's rule , and not fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might examine her in private . " So she was asked if she did consent to the confession of faith made by her husband , and if she did desire to be admitted , &amp;c. , whereto she answered affirmatively . " Thereupon they were both admitted , and the child was baptized . These details , and others to be hereafter given , are worthy of attention as illustrating both the spirit and the forms of the ecclesiastical polity set up in New England by the Puritans . The difference between the forms then introduced and the forms now in common use , indicates a correspol ) ding difference of theory . When the first emigrants , i.inder the spiritual oversight of Skelton and Higginson , were sent to Salem by the corporation still resident at London , no definite plan of church order seems to have been adopted . Neither their patrons at London , nor themselves were at that time Congregationalists . they were Puritan members of the Church of England . They protested indeed against the form of government and the forms of worship established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reformation ; but they were I ) ot Separatists , like the Leyden Pilgrims who had planted themselves at Plymouth . Yet they had adopted this general principle , that they were to attempt the reformation of the church according to the Scriptures . Naturally then did Skelton and Higginson with their associates , in 1629 , enter into fraternal communication with the church at Plymouth . And naturally did they constitute themselves into a particular Christian congregation by entering into a formal covenant with each other and with God , to walk together in all his ways , according as he shotild be pleased to reveal himself to them in his blessed word of truth . ' On the same day on which they thus bound themselves together as a church , they elected and ordained their presbytery , consisting of pastor , teacher , and ruling elder . The form of a Congregational church was that which they necessarily adopted , with their principles in their circumstances . They consulted with the Plymouth church , but they could not recognize any dependence upon Plymouth ; their right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and privileges belonging to a church , came to them not from Plymouth but directly from Christ . So in the following year , Winthrop and his company , when they sailed // from their native land , were not seceders or Separatists from the Church of England . They were riot indeed Episcopalians ; they had long ago come to the conclusion that such a reformation of the Church of England as they were hoping for , would sweep away the diocesan frame of government , the pomp of lordly bishops , the unscriptural ceremonies , and the prescribed forms of prayer ; but they considered themselves not the less members of the Church of England ,  --  just as an Englishman who cherishes the most radical opinions and aspirations about reform in civil government , and who if he were about to plant a colony of Englishmen in South Africa would become the founder of a pure republic , considers himself ; for all that , not the less a member of the state of Great Britain . They do not appear , at that time , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puritans as represented in the Westminster Assembly held to the last , and for the sake of which the Presbyterians brought back the monarchy , the idea , we mean , of a national church with an enforced uniformity . Thus in the " General Considerations for planting New England , " the word " church " is used distinctly in the sense not of a Congregational church , but of a collective or national church . Thus too , in that memorable and oft-quoted declaration , the " Humble Request " of Winthrop and his company " to the rest of their brethren in and of the Church of England , " they say without any equivocation or obscurity as to their meaning , " We esteem it our honor to call the Church of England , from *vhence we rise , our dear mother ; and can not part from our native country , where she specially resideth , without much sadness of heart and many tears in our eyes , ever acknowledging that such hope and part as we have obtained in the common salvation , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus too they could say to their " reverend fathers and brethren , " whom they were leaving behind them , " It is a usual and laudable exercise of your charity , to commend to the prayers of your congregations the necessities and straits of your private neighbors ; do the like for a church springing out of your own bowels . " We might aln*ost say that one object of this most touching epistle , was not only to show themselves no Separatists from the Church of England , but also to show that the Church of Massachusetts was to be essentially independent of the church in the mother country . " You are not ignorant that the Spirit of God stirred up the Apostle Paul to make continual mention of the Church of Phillippi , which was a colony from Rome , let the same spirit , we beseech you , put you in mind to pray for us without ceasing who are a weak colony from yourselves . " Accordingly when they had put the ocean between themselves and Britain , they had no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England , and were at liberty to organize their // own ecclesiastical institutions according to the primitive model . On the 30th of July , 1630 , only a few weeks after the arrival of the Arbella at her port , at the close of a day of fasting which had been kept not only by the newly arrived emigrants in their three distinct encampments , but also by the Church of Salem , and even by the remoter Church of Plymouth , the beginning was made of what was afterwards the First Church in Bostou . The four most eminent persons of the company then temporarily resident at Charlestown , entered into a religious covenant with each other , to be " one congregation or church , under the Lord Jesus Christ . " * Not long afterwards five others united with those four in the same covenant ; and soon the number of the brethren thus associated was increased to sixty-four , besides half as many women . The church was thus formed , but it was not yet organized . On Friday , the 27th of August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i. c. the church kept a fast arid chose Mr. Wilson our teacher , and Mr. Nowell an elder , and Mr. Gager and Mr. Aspinwall , deacons . We used imposition of hands , but with this protestation by all that it was only a sign of election and confirmation , not of any intent that Mr. Wilson should renounce his ministry he received in England . " Such was in that age the method of proceeding , the election ( *u*orovhx ) and the ordination ( %e1*oOau1u ) were one and the same transaction , the latter only the completion of the former . The distinction between ordination and installation , on which we with our hierarchical tendencies ins.ist so carefully , they rejected . Mr. Wilson having been elected teacher , was ordained with imposition of hands , and yet with the express tinderstanding that in his parochial charge in England he had already exercised a valid ministry . In the same way , some two years afterward , Winthrop writes again , " A fast * Those four pQrsons , who were probably designated by common consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dudley , Isaac Johnson , and John Wilson . The form of the covenant subscribed by them , was as follows . " In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , and in obedience to his holy , wise , and divine ordinances : We whose names are here underwritten , being by his most wise and good providence brought together into this part of America , in the Bay of Massachusetts ; and desirous to unite into one congregation or church under the Lord Jesus Christ our head , in such sort as becometh all those whom he hath redeemed and sanctified to himself , do hereby solemnly and religiously as in his most holy presence , promise and bind ourselves to walk in all our ways according to the rule of the Gospel , and in all sincere conformity to his holy ordinances , and in mutual love and respect to each other , so near as God shall give us grace . " The simple br&amp;vity of this form is noticeable , as is also the absence of any formal articles of belief or doctrine . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no other form than the covenant . Every member made his own profession of faith in his own way to the satisfaction of those who received him into their fellowship . The absence of a written and prescribed confession was not because they held soundness of doctrinal belief in less estimation than the churches now do , but rather for sn Qpposite reason . // was held by the congregation of Boston , and Mr. Wilson , formerly their teacher , was chosen pastor , and Thomas Oliver a ruling elder ; and both were ordained by imposition of hands , first by the teacher and the two deacons ( in the name of the congregation ) upon the elder , and then by the elder and the deacons upon the pastor . " Even so slight a change as the transfer of Wilson from the office of teacher to that of pastor was accompanied with the solemnity of ordination . The coming of Cotton into the colony was regarded as a great event . A few days after his arrival , the governor and council met at Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there were already seven churches in Massachusetts ) were summoned to aid in the consultation touching the setting of so great a light in a fit candlestick . In several places there was a desire to obtain him ; " but it was agreed by full consent that the fittest place for him was Boston ; " for there was already the metropolis . Accordingly , on the tenth of October , " a fast was kept at Boston , " and after Thomas Leverett , ( the same who had managed Mr. Cotton 's case so adroitly in the ecclesiastical court , ) had been chosen a ruling elder , and another godly man , who had been an apothecary in England , had been chosen deacon , not without imposition of hands , the solemnity of putting Cotton in the place to which he had been designated by common consent , was duly performed . He " was chosen teacher of the congregation of Boston , and ordained by imposition of hands of the presbytery in this manner . First , he was chosen by all the congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson the pastor , demanded of him , if he did accept of that call . lie paused , and then spake to this effect : that howsoever he knew himself unworthy and insufficient for the place , yet having observed all the passages of God 's providence ( which he reckoned up in particular ) in calling him to it , he could not but accept it . Then the pastor and the two elders laid their hands upon his head , arid the pastor prayed , arid then , taking off their hands laid them on again , and , speaking to him by his name , they did thenceforth design him to the said office , in the name of the Holy Ghost , and did give him the charge of the congregation , and did thereby ( as by a sign from God ) indue him with gifts fit for his office ; and lastly did bless him .

Other churches were present by their ministers not to ordain , but only to be witnesses of the ordination and to give the right hand of fellowship . // The commencement of Cotton 's labors in the New England Boston was early followed by a great increase of religious zeal and sympathy , such as in modern language would be called a revival of religion . " It pleased the Lord , " says Winthrop , " to give special testimony of his presence in the Church of Boston after Mr. Cotton was called to office there . More were converted and added to that church than to all other churches in the bay . " " Divers profane and notorious evil persons came and confessed their sins , and were comfortably received into the bosom of the church . Yea the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , to the discourses and exhortations of brethren not called to office in the church- " so as thereby some were converted , and others much edified . Also the Lord pleased greatly to bless the practice of discipliie , wherein he gave the pastor , Mr. Wilson , a singular gift , to the great benefit of the church . " The great truths of the Christian revelation , ministered in freedom from lips that were eloquent with the experience of Christ 's grace , to hearers who found themselves acting under new responsibilities , were attended with the xvorking of that Spirit by whose quickening the Gospel becomes the power of God to salvation . But that tendency to excess and to enthusiastic and extravagant opinions and practices , which so often manifests itself in connection with a deep and general religious excitement , soon made its appearance in this earliest New England " revival . " rphe admirers of old times , who believe that revivals in these days are materially different from what they were in the days of old , less guarded by sound doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive of spuriotis religion ,  --  would do well to study carefully the sequel of that extraordinary excitement which so inaugurated the completed organization of the Church in Boston , when John Wilson was its pastor , and John Cotton was its teacher , and when its brotherhood included the great chieftains and guides of the Puritan exodus . The time would fail us to describe particularly the Antinomianism or Familism , as they called it , of which Mrs. Hutchinson was the high priestess , and which in its " rise , reign and ruin " was almost the ruin of the colony and especially of that most favored Boston Church . But he who studies that matter thoroughly , will find no reason to doubt that the whole movement was connected with the views on which Cotton insisted in his preaching , and with the profound excitement of which his preaching was the occasion , and with the methods by which that excitement was promoted , as intimately as certain extravagant opinions and practices of more recent date are connected with the new divinity ' ' and the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes so triumphantly , referred . We could not rehearse the details of Cotton 's life on this side of the Atlantic , without writing the entire civil and ecclesiastical // history of Massachusetts , and indeed of New England , from the date of his arrival to the date of his death . He came when the constitution of civil government in the young commonwealth was just settling into a definite arid permanent form when questions were to be adjusted between the elected magistrates on the one hand , holding their power under the royal charter , and the people on the other hand , claiming those democratic rights which the people never fail to assert wherever they have the opportunity of putting forth their democratic tendencies ; and when laws were to be framed in accordance with the peculiar genius of that Pnritanic community whose institutions , civil as well as ecclesiastical , must needs be conformable to the principles and models of the Bible . His position as one of the ministers of the church in the metropolis , and still more the deference which was freely accorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministers in the colony , gave him great influence over the course of public affairs in a commonwealth in which the chosen religious teachers of the people , the professed and official expounders of God 's oracles , were called into solemn consultation with the government on every great question of public duty* Sometimes indeed he erred in judgment ; and sometimes his erro* neous counsel was rejected ; as when , preaching at the first election after his arrival , and fearing that his friend Winthrop might not be redected , he delivered the doctrine that a magistrate ought not to be turned into the condition of a private man without just cause and a public conviction after trial , and immediately the as serubled electors chose a new governor , and left Winthrop out of the magistracy altogether . But generally his opinions deliv* ered from the pulpit or in set consultations , were remarkable for sagacity and common sense . With the come-outerisrn of such ultra-Puritatis as Williams and Endicott , tearing the red cross out of the English flag , charging the charter with blasphemy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up every extravagant notion ,  --  he seems to have had no sympathy . In some things his wisdom was far before his age . He taught " that when magistrates are forced to provide for the maintenance of ministers , then the churches are iii a declining condition ; and that the ministers ' maintenance should be by voluntary contribution . " On that difficult subject in the ethics of commerce-so often vexed and darkened even at this day  --  the question of the rule that determines the moral quality of prices and profits , his good sense avoided equally the extremes of laxity on the one hand , and of scrupulousness on the other , and the principles which he defined need no correction in the light of moderii science . Of Cotton 's system of ecclesiastical polity , as it was gradually shaped in Massachusetts under his direction , there remains in the Congregational churches as they now exist , only enough to mislead // careless inquirers into the conclusion that the Congregationalism of the seventeenth century is fully represented by the Congregationalism of the nineteenth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if some skillful and unshrinking hand would portray the ancient system as Cotton left it , and would set the true meaning of the Cambridge Platform , point by point , in contrast with that incongruous mass of ancient principles and modern usages by which the churches are now governed . We will not here enter upon such a task . It is enough for us to say , that whatever there is of purity and religions prosperity , and of strength and effective influence , in the churches of New England at this day , is due rather to what they have held fast of the ancient system wrought out by Cotton and his compeers , than to the ideas and usages which , in the progress of two centuries , they have unconsciously borrowed from other systems . We have spoken of Cotton as the father of Congregationalism . Among his printed works , those which are now most frequently mentioned in connection with his name , are the tracts which he published in explanation and defense of the New England church polity . The " Keys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hundred and ninety-nine years after its first appearance , was his first contribution to aid the English people in the settlement of their then disorganized ecclesiastical system . His " Way of the Churches in Nexv England " is perhaps the most valuable commentary on the Cambridge Platform which has come down to us  --  a commentary , not in form , for it is older than the Platform , but in effect , for it describes as matter of fact the system which the Platform prescribes theoretically . His " Way of the Churches Cleared , " is a vindication of himself and of New England against the aspersions of an anonymous author , and of Bailie and Rutherford , two Scotch Presbyterians , who had thought that abusive assaults on the good name of individuals and of churches would answer the purpose of argument . Another work of his is often named to his reproach by those who know little of what is in it . " The Bloody Tenent Washed , " is an elaborate reply to a fierce attack which " that fiery Welchman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book is thoroughly conservative of the grand error which the Puritanism of that day held in common with the Church of England and the Church of Rome , and which the New England Congregationalists held fast even when their brethren in Old England were rejecting it  --  the doctrine that it belongs to the state as such , to investigate and determine questions of religions doctrine , to uphold and guard the true religion , and within certain bounds to stippress the propagation of such opinions as tend to the destruction of souls . The erratic Williams had caught a mighty truth with something of a prophet 's intuition , and he asserted it with // heedless and denunciatory zeal beyond a prophet 's vehemence . The sedate , judicious Cotton , calmly throwing off the aspersions of his adversary 's bitterness , defended the old error with logic that would have triumphed in the schools . But truth is weightier than logic ; and sometimes the intuitions even of enthusiasm happen to be right , and the most skillful array of argument is wrong . The name of Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name in the history of human progress than the name of John Cotton with all his practical wisdom . His published works sufficiently explain the high reputation which he had among his contemporaries as a dialectician , sagacious arid skillful , yet coot and courteous . Who could be more prompt than he to discern each flaw in his adversary 's argument ? Who more completely cased in impenetrable armor whenever he entered the lists ? Who could repel the personal aspersions which abounded in the controversies of that day , with so much of mingled meekness and dignity ? Who so gentle in his diction while rebuking , most effectively , the ungentleness of some impetuous assailant ? At the same time , we must confess that our reading of his works , even of those which were preached as sermons before they were reduced into the form of books , does not so easily explain to us his unquestionable power in the pulpit . He had a power that commanded the attention not of scholars only but of the promiscuous congregation , and that carried his hearers along in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propounded from the l ) ull ) it concerning right and wrong in the commonwealth , was law ; what he propounded concerning Christian doctrine , was very sure to have the snifrages of the church if not the synod . In the old Boston and the new , he made full proof of his ministry , and had the most authentic testimonies to his power as a preacher . Notwithstanding his quaint and whimsical expositions of Scripture , and his far-fetched deduction of doctrine from the sacred text-notwithstanding his manifest tendency to the iriost wire drawn method of discourse with divisions and subdivisions numbered till they are almost **26;872;TOOLONG his style warmed by no apparent glow of passion and illuminated by no flashes of imagination , there can be no doubt that in the pulpit he was eloquent . Something there must have been in the preaching , that has escaped in the process of writing and printing . Just at the close of his 67th year , while preaching a lecture at Cambridge , he was seized in the pulpit with a sudden and painful disease . This he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon afterwards , at his Thursday lecture , on the 18th of Nov. , 1652 , in his regular course of preaching from the second epistle to Timothy , he took for his subject the last four verses , and apologized for the unusual length of his text by saying that // otherwise he should not live to finish his exposition of that epistle . It was observed that he dwelt particularly on the closing benediction , " Grace be with you . " On the next Lord 's Day , he preached his last sermon from John i , 14 , on the glory of the Incarnate Word . Then it remained for him to spend , in the retirement of his study , one day of special spiritual preparation for his last change ; and he was ready . " When he could no more be seen abroad , all sorts , magistrates , ministers , neighbors , and friends far off and those near at hand , especially his own people , resorted to him daily as to a public father . " As death came nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston to pray over him ; which last solemn duty being performed not without much affection and many tears , " he gave diem his dying testimony , bearing witness for God 's faithfulness to him , and exhorting them to take heed to themselves and to all the flock . Afterwards , as " his ultimate solemn transaction with man in this world , " he called his wife and children around his bed , arid gave them his farewell . Then , " his work finished with all men , " he demanded to be left to those " divine soliloquies between God and his soul " in which he desired to occupy the last moments of mortal consciousness . On the 23d of December , between eleven arid twelve o'clock , just at the hour of his own Thursday lecture , he expired . So methodical , so business-like yet devout , was this good man 's dying . All the New England that then was , mourned under the bereavement .                @ @ @ @ @
