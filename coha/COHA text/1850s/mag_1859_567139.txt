ARTICLE IV. - TIIE FORCES OF THE PULPIT , AND THEIR RE LATION TO ITS POWER. * So preeminent is the Pulpit among the human agencies which God employs to advance his spiritual kingdom on earth , that an inquiry into the conditions of its power can not be void of interest to a thoughtful Christian mind . Especially will those who are called to the " ministry of the Word , " often turn to inspect the means by which , under God , they are to accomplish their high mission . This occasion invites to such a review , and suggests as a theme perhaps not altogether inappropriate , The relation of the forces of the pulpit to its power . By the use of these terms , it is not meant to be implied that the pulpit has any power apart from its connection with the Holy Spirit . It is an organism of parts , designed and adapted to accomplish a specific purpose in the economy of grace , but only when the Divine efficiency streams through it , does it become an organism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Like the human system , it must be pervaded and vivified by the indwelling spirit , or it will be powerless . And yet , as the body is curiously wrought into a repository for the powers of the soul , through which it acts on the world without , so has the great Architect fashioned the pulpit into an organism whose parts are nicely adjusted to be avenues through which the Divine Spirit puts forth his power for the regeneration and sanctification of men . We may , therefore , as properly speak of the forces of the pulpit as of the body , meaning those instrumentalities through which the Spirit exerts his power in the preaching of " the Word . " These forces , for the want of better terms , I shall style material , developmemt , action ; and the proposition designed to be illustrated is , that the pitlpit becomes a power j*tst to the degree in u'hich it employs these forces . * An Inaugural Discourse , delivered by FRANKLIN W. FISK , Professor of Sacred Rhetoric , in Chicago Theological Seminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Board of Directors of the Seminary . // Let us , then , first notice the relation of material to the power of the pulpit . This material is divine truth . It is properly termed a force , because it tend8 to produce an effect , and when the heart is opened by the Spirit of God , does produce it . Light is not more fitted to effect a change in the eye , and form an image on the retina , than is divine truth to produce a change in the soul , and impress upon it the image of God . Air is not better adapted to impart life to the body , than the inspired Word to give life to the soul . And just as man may close his eyes , and shut his mouth against the good gifts that come pouring into him , and thus die , so may he bar his soul against God 's purer light , and walk into eternal darkness and death . Yet both the light and the truth are no lessfor*e8 , because they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on to fulfill their blessed mission , the one to fill the whole body with light , and to bathe it in an ocean of light , the other to pour into the soul a celestial light , and fill it " with all the fufluess of God . " But not only is divine truth a force in preaching , it is preeminently the force , because through it alone does the holy Spirit convert and sanctify the soul . Other forces of the pulpit rise in importance only as they contribute to present the truth in its full force . They are at best only its aids , never its equals . Hence preaching , to be powerful , must be built up out of the truth . It must be born of the truth , if it would inherit its force . As it would never have come into being without the truth , so can it not live a forceful life , dissevered from it . It must touch the truth at every point , if it would be full of power . And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be , at times , tempted , if I mistake not , to dwarf his power by seeking his material outside the truth . One must be an indifferent observer of the times , who does not see that our age is drifting away from its confidence in the Word of God as a force . This distrust crops out here and there along the surface of society . It is seen in the low estimate at which the Bible is rated among the forces of the day . We hear on every side of the " force of association , " of the " force of public // opinion , " of the " force of civilization , " of every force but that which lies beneath them all , and gives to them whatever efficiency for good they possess . The sacred Word has come to be regarded by not a few among us , as a force well nigh 8pent . It did well enough in its day . It served very well to restrain a rude people , and break them into law , to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it must retire , and leave them to mightier forces which must henceforth conduct them on their high career of civilization . Such persons look upon the 3ible with something of the reverent curiosity with which they view an ancient castle , whose gray walls and frowning towers , perforated with loop-holes for the discharge of arrows , are of little account in an age of powder and artillery . And this sentiment abroad in the community has , to some extent , and in a modified form , invaded even the Church . It may be seen in the growing demand for preaching upon secular themes , not so much that the truth may bring down its forcu upon them , as that the truth itself may gather force from the contact . In such an atmosphere , it would not be strange if the preacher himself were to become infected , and losing by degrees a robust faith in the energy of the divine Word , should attempt to infuse into it energy , by linking it to earthly forces ; or ,  --  what is more probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth as a force , he should build largely into it secular material , in order to give it greater stature and influence among the people . Il3ut in either case , whether it be from waning faith in the truth , or from a desire to exalt it before his hearers , if the preacher step outside of it for his material , he will soon find that be has stabbed to the heart his power as a minister of " the gospel of the grace of God . " For the truth is the appointed channel through which the divine efficiency flows in preaching , and the preacher who opens other channels , will find no " living water " coursing through them for thirsting souls . He may build upon the gospel foundation his " gold , silver , precious stones , " or " wood , hay , stubble , " but his work will come to naught . His brilliant essays , his philosophical disquisitions , // his lofty encomiums , his burning denunciations , may , indeed , for a time , bear him high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no Jesus walking on that sea . Such preaching may well be styled " sensation preachino ' " for it never descends beneath the * to move the depths below . The preacher who would be clothed with might , must abide in the truth ; lie must " lodge under the shadow of the Almighty , " and come forth to speak to men , with an invincible faith in the energy of the Divine Word . He must feel that lie is blowing no " ram 's horn , " but wielding the " sword of the spirit , " made to cut its way right to the heart . His power will rise or fall much as his faith in the efficiency of the truth rises or declines . But if preaching , to be a power , must be built up out of Biblical truth , it is not less essential to its failnes8 of power , that it be built up out of the whole of such truth . There is no good reason for thinking that the Deity in a revelation to man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish the object of such revelation . There is no wasteful expenditure with God . We niny , therefore , reasonably conclude that every doctrine set forth in the Bible is necessary to the attainment of the end designed by Infinite Wisdom in givin his Word to man . An apprehension and reception of all its truths may not indeed be essential to salvation . Nor do they all come with equal power to the heart . But though among tlieni one stands forth like the sun amidst attendant orbs , yet reflecting its effulgence , they each descend with power on the soul . The forces of the Bible , like those of nature , are feeble in isolation , mighty in combination . The justice of God , for instance , is fitted to awaken no terror when viewed by itself . Angels , doubtless , contemplate it with joy . But let it confront the sinfulness of man , and it will canse him to quake with terror . Let them both be viewed in the light of the Cross , and what a power dwells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , and alms to form within him time germ of a new life ! And as the forces of nature have each a part to perform in the germination and growth of the seed committed to the earth , so have the forces of the Divine Woi*d each a part to execute in the development of the germ // of spiritual life formed in the soul . If the tree , deprived of its full nutriment , will have a sickly growth , and produce a shriveled fruit , so must the spiritual life of the Christian become somewhat dwarfed and unfruitful , if it be not nonrished and built up by the combined action upon it of all divine truth . It is only when the soul comes under the transforming power of all the forces of the Word of God , that it shoots up continually toward a " perfect man , unto the measxwe of the stature of the fullness of Christ . " This the Apostle intimates , when he affirms of the Old Testament Scripture , that given by inspiration of God , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correction , for instruction in righteousness , that the man of God may be perfect . " Hence , it would seem to follow that the preaching which embraces in its sweep the most doctrines of divine revelation , which wields the most forces of God 's magazine , which combines the most perfectly the elements of the chemistry of the Word , will be the most *ff*ective . It also follows that if preaching ally itself only to a portion of the Word of life , if it retrench and mutilate the Word , it will cut offjust as much of its own power as it cuts away from the body of truth . It matters not what may be the cause of such mutilation , whether a wrong theology , a wrong heart in the preacher , or external pressure , a like result will follow . Facts confirm this theory . In all ages of the Church tIme most powerful preachers have been those who have wielded the most forces of God*s Word . To mention names would be to give a catalogue of the most effective preachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest hold on men , moved them the most profoundly , and been productive of most good , has ever been he whose discourses have grown up out of all the doctrines of IRevelation . And it is no less clearly a fact that the preacher whose discourses have not embraced the great truths of Inspiration , who , from whatever cause , has failed to set forth " all the counsel of God , " has , to the extent of such failure , been tinpotent . Witness in any community the feebleness of the pulpit which rejects the Atonement , and the well-nigh utter powerlessness of that which denies the doctrine of eternal puuish // ment . And this , which has always been true of individual preaching , has also been true of the type of preaching that has prevailed among any people . Where has the pulpit had such power as in Scotland and in our own New England ?  --  a power which has swayed the intellect and moved the heart , and moul&amp;*d the character of whole peoples , evoked and directed their energies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the barren moors and rocky hillsides , has transformed them into fruitful gardens . Observe , on the other hand , the impotence of the pulpit throughout a large portion of Europe , where , for centuries , it has ignored a cardinal doctrine of God 's Word ; and see also what mighty power flowed back into it , and streamed through it in Germany , when the great reformer restored to it the doctrine of justification by faith alone . But aside from the fact that the pulpit which retrenches divine truth , retrenches equally its own power , it will also , I apprehend , be found true , that whatever effect it does produce , partakes also of its own feebleness . If indeed such preaching does reach the heart , and bring one out into the liberty of Christ , how puny a child of God he is , compared with one born under the preaching of the whole truth ! Observe everywhere the imbecility and the one-sidedness of Christian life which has been called into being , and nourished by the pulpit that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what robust and symmetrical Christians grew up under the ministry of the elder Edwards and his compeers ! " There were giants in the earth in those days , " and the children born to them became giants also . Thus far we have noticed chiefly the connection which religious truth sustains to the renovation of man , and in his relation to Deity . But the Christian has other ties than that which connects him with heaven . His new life must find expression in outward action , and enter into other relations . And so the design of God in giving a revelation to man was not simply to form within him a new life which should fit him for a better world , but also to teach him how through its manifestations in all the forms of outward activity , to live well in this . Hence the Word of eternal life , beginning with the // center of the man , sweeps out and covers the whole circle of his activity , and though it is condensed into the two great commands , " Thou shalt love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy neighbor as thyself , " yet , for man 's fuller instruction , they are taken out of this general form of statement , and wonderfully illustrated and enforced through the forms of and of the historv bio* raphy , parable , precept , on every page sacred Word . If , now , it be true that the pulpit becomes a power to the extent in which it wields divine truth , it is clear that it can attain to its highest power only when it proclaims fally these behests of Jehovah . The preacher who would be " girded with strength , " must study these two great commands in all the forms in which they are mirrored to him , so as to gain a just conception of their nature and extent , and then reflect them in their condensed and burning power on the consciences and hearts of his hearers . If the Bible lays down great principles to guide all human activity , then must the preacher , its authorized expoinuler and applier , clearly enunci ate these principles , and apply them to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting from the center of the man , goes out into all his social relations , then must the preacher accompany it , if he would arm himself with all its forces . In short , the Christian minister who would be " mighty in word , " must preach the ethics of the Bible , as well as what are distinctively termed its doctrines . To this point the current of the argument seems to have brought us . And yet our conclusion does not demand that such preaching should consist largely of ethical discourses , for the pulpit has chiefly to do with the relation of the soul to God , and concerns itselt with earthly relations only so far as the Bible itself takes cognizance of them . To that point the pulpit must advance , if it would not mutilate its power . The question of duty as regards him who is put in trust with the whole gospel , does not come within the scope of my theme . Now , it is not to be denied that the preaching which thus sweeps around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it at every point the searching rays of God 's truth , will often encounter opposition . And , indeed , when has it // been true that comprehensive preaching has not awakened opposition ? It must , then , be expected by him who would wield all the forces of the truth , and should be met in the spirit of heaven . But such opposition may be called into being by the preacher , as well as by the truth . He who stands in the sacred desk ought never so far to lose sight of the dignity and solemnity of his mission as to merge the preacher in the mere social reformer or the partisan . He should never forget that his great work is beneath all this framework of social organization , with the living centers out of which it springs , and that he comes up into it with the line and plummet of God 's truth only because that truth has gone before him . To this whole work let him address himself calmly , prayerfully , fearlessly . But if the pulpit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domain of social life , and confine itself to expounding the first table of the law , it will soon find that its power is departing , it will soon perceive that it is shut in within prison walls , which will advance upon it until they shall crush its life out of it . It may , for a time , " peep and mutter , " but its power will be gone . The present powerlessness of the pulpit throughout large portions of the old world , may be traced , I think , in no small degree , to its having renounced all authority over social organizations . Instead of rising above them in the majesty and authority of its divine mission , and attempting to mould them into conformity with the eternal principles of God 's law , it has rather been content to be permitted to fasten itself to them , and live upon them ; and thus it has in a measure degraded the Church to a parasite on the social system , when it should be the trunk through which the vital forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be confirmed by the manner in which ancient Grecian and IRoman eloquence declined . For there is a striking analogy between sacred and secular eloquence . Both , as Theremin has convincingly shown , are alike moral in their origin , means , and end. * Each has its * Theremin 's Rhetoric , chapters 4 , 6 , and 7. // own material and domain . The conditions of their power are , in many respects , the same . Now it is well known that the tyranny which drove in ancient eloquence from its rightful domain , aimed the first and the fatal blow at its power . Alexander struck it down when he struck down Grecian liberty ; C*sar stabbed it when he stabbed his country . And to-day , the power of secular eloquence is withering beneath the despotism of France . In closing , then , the discussion upon this division of my theme , let me sum up , in a word , the result to which both reason and facts seem to have brought us , that with other conditions equal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , " the whole truth , and nothing l3ut the truth . " Yet it is evident that the whole of revealed truth may be so presented from the pulpit as to be deprived of much of its force . Let us , then , advance to view the relation which the development of this material sustains to the power of the pulpit . I use the term development , because a sermon , in the highest sense of the term , is truly and properly a development of a religious truth . It is an nufolding of the divine thought , the germ , wrapped np in the words of the text . It grows out of this thought of God as legitimately as does the oak out of the germ within the acorn , and receives from the thought both its own nature and the law of its growth . The truth in the text is not so much the su4jeet  --  the thing lying under the sermon , and upon which as a foundation the discourse as an edifice is built , as the material , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discourse , sending all through it , its vital forces , and blooming out and filling it with its own fragrance . The truth in its process of development does , indeed , like the germ in nature , reach out on every side for that which may assist its unfolding , but the law which prescribes what shall be selected , and into what converted , proceeds from the germ , the divine thought , enveloped in the text . Thus each religious truth builds up around itself a body which it as a soul inhabits , sending through the discourse its living energies , and being the channel through which the divine // efficiency flows . Hence , as no two truths are exactly alike , so may no two sermons be fashioned in the same mould . " To every seed is given its own body . " Now it is characteristic of a discourse thus produced , that it is full of unity . It begins and it ends in unity . Unity presides over its origin , its movement , and its aim . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it goes right on to the attainment of one object  --  the production of action . At every point of the development this end is in view , causing all the material to fall into proper order , and making it all converge to the one result . Such a discourse , too , is full of logic . It is the logic of nature itself presiding over its processes of growth , and building up its material in regular sequences . Each growth of the tree does not less depend on the preceding growth , nor less determine the following , than does each proposition of a well constructed discourse depend on its predecessor , or give law to its successor . In such a discourse there is no incongruity of material , no backward or side movement , but thought follows thought with the rigor of demonstration . The discourse throughout is ribbed with strength , for the thoughts lie not together in isolation , but are linked to each other by the bands of a relentless logic . Moreover , such a discourse is full of siir*plicity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its order is simple , its logic is simple , its style is simple . Like a production of nature , it has no waste of material , nothing for mere ornament , but everything to bring forward the bud , the blossom , the fruit . Now a discourse thus abounding in unity , in order , in logic , in simplicity , is , in the highest degree , a discourse of power . Man is made to be affected by truth , and , most of all , by religious truth . But he must apprehend a truth before he can feel in view of it . One can evidently have no emotion respecting that of which he knows nothing . And it is equally clear that a truth which perceived tends to produce emotion , will most powerfully tend to awaken emotion , when most clearly perceived . If it stands forth like the sun , it will have the sun 's power to produce heat . Since , then , the emotions have their // ground in known truth , or what is conceived to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in the emotions , it is evident that the more vividly truth is presented to the mind , the more powerfully will it tend to move the will and the man to action . Hence , the method of most profoundly moving the emotions and the will resolves itself into the method of bringing the truth to stand forth in full stature and luminous betore the mind , that it may put forth upon the mind its inherent force . The discourse whose outline has been given , is the erubodimeut of such a method . It presents to the mind one idea , one truth , and it goes right forward to produce one result-one act of the will . The mind is not permitted to lose sight of the truth that is coming forth into stature and strength before it . Each successive division , each argument ruent , each turn , each illustration , brings the truth nearer and nearer , until the mind is in its immediate presence , and feels the power of the truth coming over it and subduing it . One need only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse , with thatmade by one strikingly deficient in the characteristics which have been named , to be convinced of the power of the one method , and the feebleness of the other . The mind , in viewing truth , delights in unity , in order , in logic , in simplicity . They are , as it were , the steps by which it rises to the plane of conviction , emotion , action . Hence the mind , if it be a thoughtful one , searches for them in every discourse to which it listens . It first attempts to find unity in the theme , then organized unity in its unfolding , logic in every movement , and simplicity in the whole . If now the discourse be greatly deficient in these qualities , the mind can do nothing with it . If it be without unity of subject , the mind is confused at the start , knowing neither whither it is to go , nor why it is to go . If , however , it finds the path of the discourse , it either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to a chasm which it can not leap . The movement of the discourse is backward , and oblique , and sidewise , and every way , but straight onward to conviction and persuasion ; and the mind , ever on the rack to put order and logical continuity into it , at length gives over // the hopeless task , and is in any other state rather than in that of being persuaded . And such has been the experience of the human mind in every age . The discourses , both secular and religious , which have had most power over men , have been those the most rigidly constructed in conformity with the principles I have noticed . Let me refer you to the greatest oration of the greatest orator of antiquity . History has recorded its effect . We wonder not that it had such mighty power , when we read it ourselves , for though we hear not that voice which , like the wind , swept over the sea of passion , heaving it into billows , or playing upon its smiling surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasion , nor are moved by the occasion , yet in that silent speech there still lives a power which , for more than twenty centuries , has swayed the most gifted minds of earth . It is the power which comes from one idea-one propositionthat flames before the mind , not merely as a truth which demands assent , but a truth which demands emotion , action . And what language can fitly portray the manner in which this result is effected ! Amidst the most surprising diversity of parts , and arguments , and illustrations , what simple unity and order reign throughout the whole ! What logic and progress in every movement ! And then how irresistibly does the logic pour itself into rhetoric-conviction into persuasion ! How skillfully , like a great general , does the orator marshal his compact masses of argument , and sweep the plain around his impregnable position , and then , like Napoleon , hurl his grand army of forces on the staggering columns of his adversary ! Such is the power of a well disciplined army of great thoughts . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same conditions of power in discourse prevail . Take the ablest and most effective speech of the great New England statesman , analyze it , and you shall find that beneath the rounded form and graceful outline , there is a structure built up by the severest logic , and framed throughout into one symmetrical and perfect whole . Or , turning to sacred discourse , take in pieces one of those sermons of President Edwards , which are said to // have produced such remarkable impressions , and you will find that the conditions of power are much the same in the sermon as in the oration . What uninspired preacher has developed a divine truth into such breadth and fullness , and with such order , logic and simplicity , as did that " Goliath of theologians , " as Chalmers was wont to call him ? The truth towering into its divine majesty , confronte*the sinner at every point . He could not escape it . Ie quailed and fell before it . Sit down and analyze calmly , if you can , the discourse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry God , " from the text , " Their foot shall slide in due time , " and when you are through with your analysis you will be quite prepared to receive the account of the effect which the sermon produced , when preached in a neighboring town . " lie began , " says the historian , * " in the clear , careful , demonstrative style of a teacher , solicitous for the result of his effort , and anxious that every step of his argument should be clearly and fully understood . As he advanced in unfolding the meaning of the text , the most careful logic brought him and his hearers to conclusions which the most ti'einendous imagery could but inadequately express . his most terrific descriptions of the doom and danger of the impenitent only enabled them to apprehend more clearly the truths which he had compelled them to believe . They seemed to be , not the product of the imagination , but , what they really were , a part of the argument . The effect was as might have been expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed and bowed down with an awful conviction of their sin and danger . There was such breathing of distress and weeping , that the preacher was obliged to speak to the people and desire silence , that he might be heard . " Examples such as these might be multiplied at pleasure , in confirmation of the view which has been taken . TiThs has it ever been true both in secular and sacred discourse , that the more perfectly a truth has been developed , the greater has been its power . // Now the method of thus unfolding and presenting truth can be acquired . It has been acquireii . And it is the province of homiletics to teach the principles of such development in sacred discourse . But no instruction in homiletics can of itself make the student a master of discourse . To a thorough knowledge of the principles of the science must be added patient and severe practice , and a careful study of the great models in discourse , if one would excel . He who would attain to high excellence in unfolding truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters of speech have trod . But he has illustrious examples to cheer him on his way . The Athenian orator , as is well known , reached his surprising excellence in composition only through the severest discipline and toil . The lonely cave and the well-worn copy of the great historian bore witness to his iron industry . It was in no small degree the intense study of the speeches in Thucydides , that made Demosthenes the greatest orator of Greece . It was in no small degree the intense study of the orations of Demosthenes , that has made Brougham the greatest of the living orators of England . No preacher ever bestowed more patient labor on his discourses than Edwards , rising before the day and economizing every moment , that he might be compelled neither to think superficially upon his theme , nor to compose in haste . Whoever , then , would in religious discourse aspire to equal in power such masters as these , must put himself to the work with an energy and a devotion like theirs . He must make it the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundations of his strength , in a knowledge of divine truth , obtained by a thorough study of it in the words of the Holy Ghost , and having built up all this precious material ,  --  these living stones ,  --  into a grand and symmetrical temple , he must bring to the exhibition of each truth all the vigor of his intellect , and the fervor of his heart . The preparation of each discourse must be , as Vinet expresses it , " an epoch in his history . " But , above all , and more than all , his whole heart must be in the work . He must love the truth upon which he labors . The gushing sympathies of his heart must embrace it , and the pulsations of his heart course through it . It is this // deep love for the truth and its author , which will disclose most vividly to him the comprehensive relations of the truth , which will lift him out of the murky atmosphere of mere intellect into the clear sunlight of the teachings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear to human applause , and make him aspire only to secure the approbation of Him " who hath counted him f*thful , putting him into the ministry . " And when thus his heart shall give law to his intellect , and fusing all the materials of the discourse , pour them forth into the channel of impassioned argument , then will the discourse be alive with power . But though one should have attained to such high excellence in unfolding Divine truth , yet it is manifest that he might so deliver his discourses as to render them , in a measure , ineffective . Let us , then , pass to notice the relation of action to the power of the pulpit . Nfan is pr&amp;iminently endowed with ability to express the thoughts and emotions of his soul . His body is the medium of expression . It is not a dead case of the soul , but is alive in every part with the movements of the mysterious being it incloses . Through it the spirit is ever struggling to utter the thoughts and emotions that stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the " breath of the Almighty " is ever pouring itself in tones richer and stranger than ever flowed from human instrument . This expression through the body of the thoughts and feelings of the soul is fitly termed action , for it expresses the soul 's acting . it is not voice alone , or gesture ; it embraces every movement of the body which can express a movement of the soul . Thus Cicero defines the term when he says , " all action " ( in speaking ) " springs from the soul . " * Now such action is a force . God has made men to be moved by it . It has moved men in all ages . Horace recognizes both the fact and the principle . " If you wish me to weep , you must first weep yourself " t The law is , that the expression of emotion tends to produce like emotion in others . We are so formed , that truth presented with the exhibition of * De Oratore , 3 , 59 . Ars Poetica , 102. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when not so presented . Hence it would seem to follow , that with the same degree of emotion , the more perfect the action , the greater the force . And this principle holds as well within the sphere of religious as of secular truth . It is not the method of God to advance his kingdom by contravening the laws of mind which he himself has est*blished , but rather , by the Divine Spirit , to bring the truth by means of them to act with increased power on the heart . Indeed , among the beneficent ends for which this ability to express emotion was conferred on man , none is more conspicuous than the use which God makes of it in carrying forward his great work in our world . It is not mainly by the printed page , but by the preacher who takes with him a heart as well as an intellect , that the " good tidings of great joy " are to be announced to all people . Hence it becomes him who has been commissioned to bear a part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full exercise not only of the gift of expressing thought , but emotion . And it is evident that this faculty of expressing feeling may be like every other mental endowment , improved by practice . It has been by practice carried to a wonderful degree of perfection . Garrick could throw into a single finger the whole emotion of his soul . Much certainly can and should be done by the sacred orator to render the body promptly obedient to the mandates of the heart , to give expression to the voice , to remove awkardness of gesture and bearing , to give himself , in short , command of his body , so that he may express whatever feeling he may have , with propriety and force . The chief obstacles to the success of any such attempt are , usually , the form of the pulpit , and the reading of the discourse . Not a few of our pulpits one might easily imagine to have been constructed to protect the preacher against an onset from his audience , rather than to furnish a position which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck with the impropriety of placing an orator behind such a breastwork , we need only imagine Demosthenes in the Pnyx , and Paul on Mars Hill , addressing from behind such a // structure the assembled Athenians . It effectually conceals the action of one half the body , and gives to the audience little more than that of the head and the arms of the speaker . But since the whole body was designed to aid in uttering the emotions of the soul , the whole should be given to the audience . Behind such a structure it is difficult to be eloquent . Yet the ordinary form of the pulpit is not a greater impediment to the action of the preacher , than is the reading of the discourse . It is an altogether unnatural way of attempting to move an audience . Its proper place is the lecture room , where men are to be instructed only , and not also to be moved to action . And yet it were better that the preacher should confine himself to his notes , than that he should bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a close reader of his sermons , was wont , in the last part of his life , to regret that he had used notes at all , lie regarded preaching wholly without them as both the primitive and natural method , and the most effective ; and he advised young ministers to write their sermons in full , and commit them to memory. * To this course , however , there are two prime objections ,  - -  the pastor 's want of time for such extra labor , and his conviction-if he has any just conception of what a sermon should be-that his sermon is not worth committing to memory . The day , we hope , may come when the young men who aspire to the high office of the Christian ministry , shall have such ample training for their work , and shall enter upon it with such fullness of preparation and self-discipline , that they will be able , partially at least , to dispense with notes in the ministrations of the pulpit . But the reading of a discourse by the preacher need not prevent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself familiar both with his course of thought and his manuscript . In what has thus far been said of action in the pulpit , we have taken for granted the e*ei8tence of emotion , without which action as defined can not be . There can evidently be no real expression of emotion where there is no emotion to ex // press . Action-if such it can be called-which is seen not to spring out of emotion in the preacher , is not only forceless , but contemptible . If there can be an object of disgust in the pulpit , it is he whose intonations and gesticulations have no feeling behind them from which they spring . Action becomes a force only when it comes forth from the acting of the soul . Let us , then , go back of the action to its source , and say that the preacher must liirn8elf be moved by the truth which he presents , if he would have it profoundly move his hearers . But if the preacher would be moved by the truth which he utters , lie must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love divine truth . His affections must turn toward it , as the needle to the pole . The truth must take full possession of him . lit must " live and move and have its being " within him . And when the sacred orator is thus moved by his theme , his action , though it be imperfect , becomes a great force . Edwards , in delivering his discourses , rarely made a gesture , yet the deep emotion which poured itself through his voice , caused his words to fall with great weight on the minds of his hearers. * But when the expression of such deep feeling is fuller and more perfect , its power , through the Divine Spirit , is surprising . When Whitefield preached thousands were moved and melted . In his preaching at Northampton , Edwards and his people wept like children.t Now such a full expression of deep emotion in the delivery of a well-developed discourse , which has grown up out of Divine truth , is , in the truest and best sense of the term , eloquence . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this necessarily brief and imperfect review of the forces of the pulpit , we may say , that as a divinely appointed instrument , the conditions of its power are in the fullest degree met , when the pulpit is in the highest degree eloquent . To become thus eloquent , in this noblest sense , should be the highest aspiration of the preacher , not indeed as an end , but as the rnean* by which he may most successfully win souls to Christ . And what mighty motives urge him to the attain * Edwards 's Works , Vol. 1 , p. 57. 1- " The Great Awakening , " p. 99. // ment of such eloquence ! Compared with them , how impotent are the incitements to attain to eloquence for worldly ends ! If love of country and friends , an earthly crown , and the plaudits of a Grecian audience , could so move the great Athenian orator as to make him surpass himself and all posterity , to what hights of eloquence ought love to God and to souls , an immortal crown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift the sacred orator ! And what material has he for eloquence !  --  a body of truths the richest , deepest , and sublimest the world has ever seen ,  --  truths of which Aristotle never dreamed ,  --  truths which , when they have , through the Divine Spirit , wrought themselves into and taken possession of such men as Whitefield , and Hall , and Chalmers , and Edwards , and Davies , and Mason , have made them what they were as preachers of the Gospel . To become such mighty men as these , let those especially who are in a course of training for the Christian ministry , aspire . Distant be the day when our young men of piety and talent shall seek the ministry as a theater for vaulting ambition ; yet , on the other hand , we would desire to remove the impression which is , to some extent , abroad anmong them , that the clerical profession is unfavorable to the full sweep and play of all the gifts with which God has endowed them . If a Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope for his mighty intellect , and for those deep and gushing emotions in presenting them , which made him even regarded by some as the god of eloquence , then let no young man fear that the profession will dwarf any of his powers . Nay , rather , if he enters on the sacred office with anything like a just sense of its demands both upon his intellect and his heart , he will , with humble dependence on Divine aid , strive with unconquerable energy to become what it demands of him ,  --  " an eloquent man , mighty in the Scriptures . " But let it never be forgotten that these forces , whose sum is eloquence , are , at best , only the conditions of the power of the pulpit , and not the power itself-that back of them there is a Divine Power which must energize them , or they will be impotent . As the bodies which lay about the prophet in the // valley of vision , though covered with " sinews and flesh , " yet had " no breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit be powerless , until the " breath of the Almighty " shall come into them ; then shall " they live , and stand up upon their feet , an exceeding great army , " mighty in God . But though the power of the pulpit has its source in God , yet by his own appointment , the conditions of the exertion of the power are to be fulfilled by m*an . And the preacher who most clearly perceives the relation of Divine power to human agency in the preaching of the Word , will be most solicitous to perform his part of the great work aright . Looking up for the Divine blessing , he will address himself to his appointed work as if success hung on himself alone . And yet he will begin and end every effort in God . Preparing each discourse in the Divine presence , and bathing it in prayer , lie will go from his closet to the pulpit , and from the pulpit to the closet , and his preaching will beJull of power . Such is the type both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may this Theological Institution ever give to it . Let there ever go forth from this school of sacred culture , men of disciplined intellects and renovated hearts ,  --  men who shall both know the whole truth of God , and how to wield it ,  --  men who shall be eloquent in the truth , and shall fear nothing but to speak error ,  --  men , who with faith in God , and in the power of the preached Word through IHim , shall carry to their work a holy enthusiasm , which no difficulties can quench . Let such men as these go hence from year to year , in ever-increasing numbers , into these empires opening to a Christian civilization , and become , through the Divine blessing , centers of light and saving power . Looking at the magnitude of the work of which I have been called to bear a part , I feel , beyond power of expression , my absolute need of Divine grace and strength to enable me to perform , in any suitable manner , the duties of the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do humbly cast myself .
