POEMS AND PROSE WRITINGS OF RICHARD H. DANA. * HAVING several times , through these columns , joined in the solicitations which have been frequently made to Mr. Dana for many years past , to collect and republish his writings , we hardly need commence a notice of them by saying that we are glad to possess them at last , in this convenient and beautiful form . But we must not be suspected of having urged their republication from any other motive than the wish to read them ; as for reviewing them there was no such design . And we undertake the task now with a very lively sense of the force of the line " non omnis fert omnia tellus . " To analyze the characteristics , and present a fair portrait of such a writer as Dana , is a labor from which we recoil with a feeling of being too old and worn . There might have been a time , so the mind flatters itself , but not now . We can only read him and derive vigor from contact with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without attempting to sum them or classify them . In a word , we can examine him critically only as we do a landscape in nature , under different aspects ; such a cloud is fine , such a river beautiful , such a rock harsh , we say , merely * they happen to strike us , without presuming to unify or find causes for these effects . Even this much we enter upon with a kindred misgiving as to the result , though not precisely in the same spirit with Macbeth , when he abandons his castle for the plain  --  and our only excuse with the reader must be , that it is our vocation- " it is no sin for a man to labor in his vocation . " Dana 's earliest productions were an essay called " Old Times , " and several review articles , contributed to the North American Review in the years 817-19 . " The Idle Man " was published in New York in 1821-22 . The first edition of his poems appeared in 1827 . That year he contributed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Literary Gazette , and in the four following years , three other reviews to other magazines . In 1833 , he published the second edition of his poems , and tales from the Idle Man , and the same year furnished an essay to the American Quarterly Observer . Two years after , in 1835 , he sent another essay , Law as suited to Man , ** to the same publication . Since that time he has not come before the public as an author until now , in these volumes , which include all that we have enumerated , with some additions . The poems and tales had been for some years out of print , and the reviews were mostly unknown ; of some of them we never saw the names until we saw them here . These volumes may therefore be regarded as almost a new publication . They are new to most readers , and are in themselves as fresh as if written yesterday . They begin with the poems , which , though they are the best known , and have been commented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , ) we must be permitted to linger over awhile before speaking of the essays . The first and largest of the poems , the Buccaneer , has long since taken its rank among our descriptive classics . It is a piece of remarkable originality , power and beauty  --  the most purely artistic , that is , impersonal , and remote from individual experience , of any of its author 's writings . The conception of the story , and the world it takes us into , are as new and peculiar as they are in the Ancient Mariner . The sea views are as exact as Crabbe 's , and far more beautiful ; the pirates , the hero , the scenery , and more than all , the spirit steed , were uncreated before ; they are all the genuine offspring of the poetic fancy , and are managed with that power * Poems and Prose Writings . By RICHARD HENRY DANA . In two volumes . New York : Baker &amp; Scribner. 1850 . Jan. // which brings them all in as congruous parts uniting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauties in detail , of the highest order ; it is full of examples of painting by words , and of the power of flashing a scene upon the eye by a single phrase . It bears evidence throughout to a rare delicacy and refinement of character ; there is nothing common in it , nothing that lets the reader unpleasantly down , or gives the sense of feigning which comes from pseudo-poetry . On the contrary , the most remarkable quality to us in it , is the power with which it is carried through over a very rough and jagged roadway of style . The wonder is , that we are not thrown out . For the metre is a difficult one to manage with effect , owing to the fullness of its cadence ; and the abrupt transitions , strange inversions , and tumultuous utterance of the sentences are beyond all example . It is an instance of a poem conceived in the boldness and free power of high genius , and executed in the constraint of " slow endeavoring art . " If we may apply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a * poem ; it is strong and fine , occasionally free , and easy sweeping , but generally over rigid . It does the thing it attempts , but does it laboriously . On the whok* , it is a rare example of genius soaring with fettered wings , and ranks among descriptive poems , as Milton 's Ode on the Nativity does among lyrics  --  a piece which , though it has many stanzes quite above admiration , , was yet felt by its author to be somewhat harshly executed . The Introduction to the Buccaneer has always been justly admired . To all who grew up through youth on the shore of the Narraganset , it , and indeed all the sea scenes in the poem , must have the power of reality ; with us their impression is intermingled with views about Newport ; we have always an indistinct notion that there is an island somewhere between Gayhead and Brenton 's reef , to the south-west ot Cuttyhunk , ( romantic name ! ) which is this island  --  and this idea is no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The island lies nine leagues away . Along its solitary shore , Of craggy rock and sandy bay , No sound but ocean 's roar , Save where the bold , wild sea-bird makes her home , Her shrill cry coming . through the sparkling foam . But when the light winds lie at rest , And on the glassy , heaving sea , The black duck , with her glossy breast , Sits swinging silently ,  - -  How beautiful ! no ripples break the reach , And silvery waves go noiseless up the beach . And inland rests the green , warm dell ; The brook comes tinkling down its side From out the trees the Sabbath hell Rings cheerful , far and wide . Mingling its sound with bleatings of the flocks , That feed about the vale among the rocks . Nor holy bell , nor pastoral bleat , In former days within the vale ; Flapped in the bay the pirate 's sheet ; Curses were on the gale ; Rich goods lay on the sand , and murdered men Pirate and wrecker kept their revels then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now slowly fall upon the ear ; A quiet look is in each face , Subdued and holy fear Each motion gentle ; all is kindly done. - Come , listen how from crime the isle was won . " The first three stanzas of this are exquisite ; in the fourth , we do not like " pastoral bleat , " - perhaps from a remote suggestion of something heard before , e. g. " oaten stop , or pastoral song . " " Flapped in the bay , " is like an unexpected blow ; and the having every line a clause by itself in the sentence , seems to give it a sudden unnatural intensity . But the next resumes and concludes the melody with a beautiful half-cadence in the last line . We have not space to follow through the piece ; it has many such beautiful stanzas as the following : " Who 's sitting on that long , black ledge , Which makes so far out in the sea , Feeling the kelp-weed on its edge * Poor , idle Matthew Lee ! So weak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he lord it round the shore . And on the shingle now he sits , And rolls the pebbles neath his hands ; Now walks the beach ; now stops by fits , And scores the smooth , wet sands ; 67 // Then tries each cliff , and cove , and jut , that bounds The isle ; then home from many weary rounds . He views the ships that come and go , Looking so like to living things . 0 ! t is a proud and gallant show Of bright and broad-spread wings , Making it light around them , as they keep Their course right onward through the unsounded deep . And where the far-off sand-bars lift Their backs in long and narrow line , The breakers shout , and leap , and shift , And toss the sparkling brine Into the air ; then rush to mimic strife : Glad creatures of the sea , arid full of life A sxveet , low voice , in starry nights , Chants to his ear a plaining song ; Its tones come winding up the heights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the stars grow dim , The song that gentle voice doth sing to him . 0 , it is sad that aught so mild Should bind the soul with bands of fear ; That strains to . soothe a little child , The man should dread to hear . But sin hath broke the world 's sweet peace ,  - -  unstrung The harmonious chords to which the angels sung. ** There are also many by which we might illustrate our notion of the roughness , the too ' sudden changes of thought and the general tone of the style , which requires the use of too many interrogations and exclamations . " It scares the sea-birds from their nests ; They dart and wheel with deafening screams , Now dark ,  --  and now their wings and breasts Flash hack disastrous gleams . Fair Light , thy looks strange alteration wear ; The world 's great comforter ,  --  why now its fear ! " The fourth line intends a fine picture , but the " disastrous gleams** , afflicts us , we hardly know why , unless because it bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening mien , and screaming horror 's funeral cry , " of Gray ; also in the Shakspearian " strange alteration , " does not the accent with which we are forced by the measure to prolong the word " *alteration " weaken the line ? And is not the last couplet , and especially the form in which the idea of the last line is expressed , more singular than natural ? At all events , if we may judge from our own experience , this peculiarity of style and thought in the Buccaneer must always hinder the mass of intelligent readers from doing it justice , or feeling and acknowledging its beauty as a whole ; it is only we who have omnivorous stomachs , and have long indulged them , who can relish food in which is mingled sweet and bitter , each of such acrid strength . For a different reason , the Changes of Home will also never be a favorite with the multitude . It springs from a character too sincere , too intense and delicate in feeling , and shows such a command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conceiving , in order to perceive the power of him who can depict it - that it can not touch directly and completely the common heart . Few could suffer what is here controlled . The general breast of humanity , at least in these days of enterprise and bustle , is insensible , fortunately perhaps , to the soothed anguish of spirit which colors this poem . We talk a great deal about love between men and women ; we understand it-on the stage . But how little are its powers and the necessities of them thought of in actual life . Go mad for love , like Jane Vere ! The girl must have a weak head . Suffer for love , like Dalton ! The young man 's " crazy "  --  a phenomenon . There are no such creatures in nature . We believe that to more than half the world the genuine passion is a mere name ; and that to another large proportion it is wholly conventional-something which they can conceive of , as we do of the extravagant honor in Kotzebue 's heroes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never supposed to exist in , much less influence , our real life , we being put here just to be prudent-to invent new machines , make money and be invited to larger parties . And as with love , so with all the tender affections . They are much talked of but little felt . The peculiar home-sickness which pervades this poem , the mellow au // tumnal light that shines over it , who is there that can feel its warm rays ? Who has suffered from long absence from early scenes , and contemplated in sadness the changes wrought by time among early companions ? Not many in sufficient degree to relish the characteristic beauty of this poem . " How like eternity doth nature seem To life of man ,  --  that short and fitful dream ! I look around me ; nowhere can I trace Lines of decay that mark our human race . These are the murmuring waters , these the flowers I mused o'er in my earlier , better hours . Like sounds and scents of yesterday they come. - Long years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one true heart : that heart was thine , Fond Emmeline ! and every heat was mine .

No feeble grief that sobs itself to rest ,  - -  Benumbing grief , and horrors filled my breast : Dark death , and sorrow dark , and terror blind. - They made my soul to quail , they shook my mind ,  - -  Wild rushings passed me as of driving wind . The storm went o'er me . Once again I stand Amid G*ls works ,  --  his broad and lovely land . I can not feel , though lovely all I see ; It is not what it was ,  --  no , not to me ; A void is in my soul ; my heart is dry : They touch me not ,  --  these things of earth and sky .

Yet stir once more within me that pure love , Which went with me by fountain , * hill , and grove . Delights I ask not of ye ; let me weep .

The world , the world has stript me of my joy : Bless me once more ; ye blest me when a boy . " passion ? There may be those , as we have observed , who can conceive it superficially ; but to the greater part , yes , even among women , this must seem affectation . " No feeble grief that sobs itself to rest ; " " this is pure pride , Mr. Dalton , " they w11i exclaim to themselves . " You flatter yourself you are so much finer than other people that you think you ought to suffer more , and so you make yourself miserable . Set to work , man ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but we took resolution , and forgot them . " Such Polonius-like overwise folks should remember that - " it is as proper tcTtheir age To cast beyond themselves in their opinions , As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion . " They will not believe that there are spirits more affectionate than theirs , in which also the sentiments are more awake , and the memory more retentive . Would God they could ! Would they could see the sorrow they daily cause in the affairs of life by arrogant interference ! Would they could perceive how they bear down and oppress the more retiring and more deeply sensitive natures with whom they come in contact ! But no , they must go on , such is the mystery of Providence , parcelling out the race , visiting their own sins upon their children , condemning their sons to resolution and their daughters to patience , till they attain the same induration which they themselves possess , and are ready to renew the never ending series . But at long intervals , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suffer and be strong , " who love what is beautiful , hate what is false , and dare to speak in free words . They seem to be sent to agitate and warm up the life-blood that would otherwise thicken and congeal around the heart . With them the words love , beauty , faith , are not niere words , but the names of realities ; and they live in the open air , out of the reach of what is dark and mean . All that is lovely and tender in life grows around them ; they are followed , if not by the love of those who ought most to desire home-felt joys , at least by the affection of those to whose spirits their spirit has im Where shall we find readers to feel this parted strength . 69 // We have never felt this so strongly in the case of any other writer as with Dana . Both in his prose and poetry he comes to us like one who has thought and felt as we have thought and felt ourselves-insomuch that we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samaria . It was not always so ; this poem , the Changes of Home , in boyhood , affected us so gloomily , that we could never read it with pleasure . Now it inspires us with a strong rapture , makes us feel less alone , and more determined , not because " misery loves company , " but because here is one who soars above sorrows that encompass us , and cries for life out of the Valley of the Shadow of Death . It is this great power which we would make the first characteristic quality of all Dana 's writings . He speaks to us from " out of the deep . " For those who have not , or can not , suffer , he has not written . Nor is it for all those who can , that he writes . It is mostly for those who have . And of these , they will understand him best who have groped their way through the peculiar gloom of New England Calvinism , who have been driven back into darkness from youth . To those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his thought minutely common . He is the hero who has fought through the mental diseases entailed upon the descendants of the Puritans . Old cherished prejudices come through him fanned and winnow*d . " This and that , " we say to ourselves , as we read in him , " is what we would have thought before , only that we dared not think it . " In him it appears something which he had observed from a level qulte above it .  --  but we are anticipating ourselves in saying what applies with most force to his prose . Is there none of our readers who , from any cause , " the heart-ache , or any of the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to , " have felt deeply enough to have experienced this utter waste and desolation of spirit ? " The spring was come again. - There is a grief Finds soothing in the bud , and bird , and leaf , A grief there is of deeper , withering power , That feels death lurking in the springing flower , That stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkaess ,  --  stands amid the sound Of happy thingi , and yet in silence hound ; Moves in a fearful void amid the throng , And deems that happy nature does it wrong ; Thinks joy unkind ; feels it must walk alone , That not on earth is one to hear its moan , Or bring assuaging sympathies , or bind A broken heart , or cheer a desert mind . " If not they can not with us derive a comfort , feigned , if they must so style it , from the thought of the following " I know , decay nor age awaits on truth ; And he who keeps a simple heart and kind May something there of early feelings find . For in all innocent and tender hearts A spirit dwells that cheerful thoughts imparts ; Midst sorrows , sunny blessings it bestows On those who think upon another 's woes . " Nor will such be able ever to appreciate clearly , as observers , much less to feel the loftiness , of the conclusion to the Thoughts upon the Soul : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Up from the dust ! the last great day is bright , Bright on the Holy Mountain , round the Throne , Bright where in borrowed light the far stars shone . Look down ! the Depths are bright ! - and hear them cry , Light ! light - Look up ! t is rushing down from high ! Regions on regions , far away they shine : T is light ineffable , t is light divine ! Immortal light , and life for evermore , ' Off through the deeps is heard from shore to shore Of rolling worlds ! - Man* wake thee from the sod ; Awake from death ! awake , and live with God ! " The poem , Factitious Life , is a fine sermon in verse against the superficiality of the world and in defence of true feeling . It is to our soi disant " good society , " what Burns ' " Holy Fair " was to the " unco guid " of the Scottish peasantry . A beautiful elegance pervades it in its versification , which is peculiarly easy , its language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best qualities of Pope and Cowper , translated , as it were , into our social life . XATe would there were more room for quotation . There are many truths in this Jan // poem almost as true as they were in 1827 . For instance " The youth enacts the sage , contemns the dead , Lauds his own times , and cries , Go up , bald head ! 1lisses and little masters read at school Abridged accounts of government and rule : Word-wise , and knowing all things , nothing . know ; - Would reap the harvest ere the ground they sow . The world 's reversed ; boy politicians spout ; And age courts youth , lest youth should turn him out . The child is grown as cautious as three-score ; Admits , on proof , that two and two are four .

For such as he are the great conservators of the family ; as women give shape and character to our bodies , so do the poets mould and direct our souls ; if our women were to turn untrue , then in a few generations we should grow loutish , uncouth , French-like ; and should finally dwindle away as other nations have done .

Thus Nature threw her beauties round me ; Thus from the gloom in which she found me , She won me by her simple graces , She wooed me with her happy faces . There is a delightful music in this . The " Pleasure Boat " with its " crinkling mast , " and the " thresher 's flail " is another still livelier strain , yet with a touch of sadness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory-haunting things , like Bryant 's " Water-fowl . " The " Clump of Daisies " has the true Herrick melody . The " Early Spring Brook " is one of those sad , low chants peculiar to Dana ; it is less lofty than the " Dying Raven , " or the " Husband and Wife 's Grave , " but it is breathed from the same suffering , patient spirit . It seems a sacrilege to quote a line of it . Most of those minor pieces have been long familiarized to the popular ear through school reading books , and various Griswoldian publications . We now come to the tales and essays from the Idle Man , Tom Thornton , Edward and Mary , Paul Felton , and The Son . Tom Thornton is full of that which Dana only could have written ; the weak mother , the passionate father-all the characters are analyzed and their thoughts and motives explained while they are developed ; yet as a whole this story has always seemed to us heavy-because , perhaps , it is too gloomy , too sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mary is an old favorite ; the love scenes in it are as refined , delicate , and touching as any that ever were written ; but we used to think , and still do , that the mere loss of fortune should never have occasioned the separation . Jan. // " Better is a dinner of herbs "  --  and young men and women ought never to marry if they are afraid to take each other " for better or worse . " A husband one loves is worth the sacrifice of a piano or a shawl ; and to toil for such a young lady as Mary would be pleasanter than to be waited on by Aladdin 's genii-at least so some school-boys feel when they read this tale . Paul Felton is justly considered the best of the stories , and one of the most , if not the most , remarkable production of Dana 's genius . It is a kind of Puritan Hamlet , in developing a character wrought upon to insanity , by allowing us to follow his reflections : we mean , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forced upon sensitive natures by the old New England system . When we remarked , above , that Dana seemed to have struggled through the mental diseases entailed upon New England , we had reference to this tale particularly , though we can trace the same in all his other writings . It would be easy , though hardly proper in this review , to show how it is that the old religious austerity tended directly to separate men into vain , spiritually proud , selfdeceived , or hypocrites , and , on the other hand , into self-reproachers , or unbelievers , according to temperament . The doctrines of the unpardonable sin , the damnation of infants , the joy of the righteous in contemplating the fate of the impenitcnt , etc. , etc. , together with the cold family discipline , transmitted from the days of the Sa1cm bonfires ; they who ever had the experience of being thrown suddenly from those icy haunts of superstition into the common light of day ; who have emerged from a youth spent under the shadow of Hopkins*aaisrn ( let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inspires horror to stand in place of it , ) to a manhood that must be wasted in the thick of city life-they only can know what New England education in other days has transmitted to the minds of her children . It has made some morbidly reflective ; some it has hardened ; the xveaker it has driven to vague speculation : we do not refer to the religious effect wholly , but to the general influence of the old system on the mind . Paul Felton 's disease is more common in New England than elsewhere . Had he been a clergyman he would have kept a diary , which would have resembled those Dana has a review of in the second volume . We can not fancy that one educated in respectable society in England , or here in New York , can fully comprehend the character . They may congratulate themselves upon their inability , while we may indulge a gratitude to Dana for having thought so much for us that we can better distinguish the light from the darkness , in the recesses of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown among the hard and minutely speculative , excites in one a terrible vigilance . From being questioned and " speered " at on account of his individuality , he begins to examine this individuality himself , and if he incline to a modest opinion of himself , the chance is that he will argue himself into a condition as wretched as poor Paul 's . Woe to his peace when once the current sets that way ! For the rest of his life he must either dare everything at every step , or wear himself out in attempting to discriminate . In spite of the everrecurring first view , and in spite of repeated experience , he must boldly take for his motto , " every body likes me , " and walk on with an assumed unconcern , doinghis work as well as he is able , with this dread burden upon his spirits bearing him down to the gates of death . He must live in a secondary nature , his original , free nature having become so weakened by the intolerable pressure from without , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy of despair . How grateful must such spirits be to a poet like Dana , who sings with no feeble voice , as in the passage we have quoted , " Up from the dust ! " - all compacted of resolution , and in faith invincible When we speak of the pain the minutely speculative inflict upon a frank and sensitive spirit , we have in our mind 's eye a life in Boston . There they go about like the Athenians of old , inquiring for new things and new religions . It would be a curious inquiry , the annual number of novelties in faith which that city produces . There all that the rest of the world has gone over and considered settled is forever agitated . There all the first principles and causes , elsewhere taken for granted , are forever talked over and argued upon . There are 73 // planted the roots of things , and the inhabitants are forever taking them up and resetting them , and fertilizing them in the usual modes .

Happy will such a one be if he fall into no sadder " musings " than the following : " To the man of fine feeling , and deep and delicate and creative thought , there is nothing in nature which appears only as so much substance and form , nor any connections in life which do not reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other are not felt by him merely as habits of the mind given to it by the custom of life ; nor does he hold them to be only as the goods of this world , and the loss of them as merely turning him forth an outcast from the social state ; but they are a part of his joyous being , and to have them torn from him is taking from his . *ry nature . " Life , indeed , with him , in all its connections and concerns , has an ideal and spiritual character which while it loses nothing of the definiteness of reality is ever suggesting thoughts , taking new relations , and peopling and giving action to the imagination . All that the eye falls upon and all that touches the heart run off into airy distance , and the regions into which the sight stretches are alive and bright and beautiful with-countless shapings and fair hues of the gladdened fancy . From kind acts and gentle words and fond looks there spring hosts many and glorious as Milton 's angels ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forms and faces* graceful and lovely as Uriel 's , are seen in the noonday sun . What would only have given pleasure for the time to another , or , at most , be now and then called up in his memory , in the man of feeling and imagination lays by - its particular and short-lived and irregular nature , and puts on the garments of spiritual beings , and takes the everlasting nature of the soul . The ordinary acts which spring from the good-will of spcial life take up their dwelling within him and mingle with his sentiment , forming a little society in his mind , going on in harmony with its generous enterprises , its friendly labors , and tasteful pursuits . They undergo a change , becoming a portion of him , making a part of his secret joy and melancholy , and wandering at large among his far-off thoughts . All that his mind falls in with , it sweeps along in its deep , and swift , and continuous flow , and bears onward with the multitude that fills its shoreless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , and so instantly does it act upon whatever he is concerned about , that a double process is going on within him , and he lives , as it were , a twofold life . Is he , for instance , talking with you about a Northwest Passage , he is looking far off at the ice-islands , with their turreted castles and fairy towns , or at the penguin , at the southern pole , pecking the rotting seaweed on which she has lighted , or he is listening to her distant and lonely cry within the cold and barren tracts of ice ,  --  yet all the while he reasons as ingeniously and wisely as you . His attachments do not grow about a changeless and tiring object ; but be it filial reverence , Abraham is seen sitting at the door of his tent , and the earth is one green pasture for flocks and herds ; or be it love , she who is dear to him is seen in a thousand imaginary changes of sitution , and new incidents are happening , delighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So that while he is in the midst of men , and doing his part in the affairs of the world , his spirit has called up a fairy vision , and he is walking in a lovely dream . It is round about him in his sorrows for a consolation ; and out of the gloom of his affliction he looks forth upon an horizon touched with a gentle morning twilight , and groxving brighter to his gaze . Through pain and poverty and the world 's neglect , when men look cold upon him and his friends are gone ) he has where to rest a tired spirit that others know not of , and healings for a wounded mind which others can never feel . " And who is of so hard a nature that he would deny him these l If there are assuagings for his spirit which are never ministered to other men , it has tortures and griefs and a fearful melancholy which need them more . lie brought into the world passions deep and strong , senses tremulous and thrilling at every touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an ardent arid romantic mind . He has dwelt upon the refinements and virtues of our nature , till they have almost become beauties sensible to the mortal eye , and to worship them he has thought could hardly be idolatry . " And what does he find in the world * Perhaps , in all the multitude , he meets a mind or Jan. // two which answer to his own ; but through the crowd , where he looks for the free play of noble passions , he finds men eager after gain or vulgar distinctions , hardening the heart with avarice , or making it proud and reckless with ambition . . . . There is so little of nature and sincerity , of ardor and sentiment of character , such a dulness of perception , such a want of that enthusiasm for all that is great and lovely and true , ( which , while it makes , us forgetful of ourselves , brings with it our highest enjoyments , ) such an offensive show and talk of factitious sensibility ,  --  that the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappointed , and becomes shut up in himself ; and he , whose mind is all emotion , and who loves with a depth of feeling that few have ever sounded , is pointed at , as he stands aloof from men , as a creature cold , selfish , and reserved . " But the world is not so utterly hard with such spirits that they have no where but within to look for consolation . ( We beg pardon of both author and reader for thus garbling this exquisite essay : ) " And there are beautiful souls , too , in the world , to hold kindred with a man of a feeling and refined mind : and there are delicate and warm and simple affections , that now and then meet him on his way , and enter silently into his heart , like blessings .

In such moments his fancies are turned to realities , and over the real the lights of his mind shift and play ; his imagination shines out warm upon it , and it changes , and takes the airiness of fairy life . * * * * * * * Religion , to such a one , has thoughts and visions and sensations tinged , as it were , with a brighter light than falls on other men . The love and reverence of the Creator make their abode in his imagination , and he gathers about them earth and air and ideal worlds . His heart is made glad with the perfectness in the works of God , when he considers that even of the multitude of things that are growing up and decaying , and of those which have come and gone , on which the eye of man has never rested , each was as fair and complete as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Freedom and order , and beauty and grandeur are in accordance in his mind , and give largeness and height to his thoughts ; he moves among the bright clouds ; he wanders away into the measureless depths of the stars , and is touched by the fire with which God has lighted them . All that is made partakes of the eternal , and religion becomes a perpetual delight . " In this short piece , which is an unique in our literature , and for refinement of style and beauty of thought , unapproached by any prose composition of its length , the poet has unconsciously drawn a portrait of himself , as he appears in all his writings , " the man of fine feeling , and deep , and delicate , and creative thought . " In the extracts we have given , the flow of thought is so broken that the reader will not be able , probably , to lose himself sufficiently in the style to be enough unconscious of its rhetoric to appreciate its fullness and poetic beauty ; nor will he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole essay ; it is a piece to be read and re-read , and never forgotten . We have now reached the second volume of Mr. Dana 's book , the contents of which may be considered quite new to one public , as they consist mainly of articles which now for the first time appear collected out of the confined circulation of sundry extinct magazines . It would be pleasant to converse about them , and quote from them here and there to give them such an introduction to our readers as would induce them to extend the acquaintance ; and we might do so as well to their gratification as our own , we think , but for the vulgar obstacles of time and space . As it is , we must content ourselves with little more than an enumeration of their titles ; some of them are reviews , and the idea of reviewing reviews puzzles the reason . The first , " Old Times , " from the North American Review for 1817 , is an essay in its author 's earlier and more careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have quoted above . It is a beautiful , tender expression of the reverent love of the past which all of ' us , even in these hurry skurry-times , we hope , feel in turning our minds back to the days of youth , and which is with Dana a characteristic instinct . " The Past and Present , " from the American Quarterly Observer for 1833 , is an essay of a very different caste , and one which it would be well that no reader should form an opinion of , for or against , till he is sure he fully compre 75 // bends it . However much one may differ from the author 's views and conclusions , we are sure no one can rise from a careful study of this piece without feeling that he has been in contact with a most daring and comprehensive spirit-one whose meditations reach , like Coleridge 's , and , ( we will venture to say it ) Milton 's , to the very verge of thought , the boundary which separates the dry land from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next essay , " Law as suited to Man , " from the Biblical Repository and Quarterly Observer for 1835 ; we consider the republication of it a national benefit . Leaving aside the particular doctrines set forth in these two essays , they both tend , as may be judged by the following paragraph , to nourish one trait of character which is of more consequence than is apt to be thought to the stability of our institutions under the flood of increase and acquisition  --  to say nothing of its moral beauty C* But even from the winning quiet of old age the present takes away reverence , while b aring , too , in his countenance , as the old man does , the aspect of the past . Where is that feeling for age , which Young so beautifully calls tender reverence " l Almost died out . Yet what a delightful sensation it is to the soul ; and how like is it to the kind respect a son bears a mother ! Its blessed influences will abide in that heart into which it has'once entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , when we , too , are old You*g man , if you would have a heart-blessing that shall go with you all your days , reverence age ! " The reviews which follow are of AIlston 's Sylphs of the Seasons , a volume of poems long since out of print ; Edgeworth 's readings on poetry , a light , amusing , cutting up of a book , which now seems hardly worth the trouble ; Hazlitt 's British Po ets . This has been extended into an elaborate compilation of critical notices of the poets , and is one of the most interesting pieces in the volume , full of acute suggestion , taste , and fine feeling . Dana has never borne the reputation of a wit , but he would have done so had he written only this and the preceding . There was much argument once about Pope . The criticism of him , therefore , is rather more extended and spirited than that of the others , and contains many turns of expression which must have told once ; e. g . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonies of Shakspeare , and Spenser , and the singers of old , must he hushed , for all the world to stand listening to the one unvarying note from the pipe of Pope . " Then follows a genial and heartily appreciative review of the Sketch Book ; another of Mrs. Radcliffe ; Charles Brockden Brown ; Pollock 's Course of Time ; and the Natural History of Enthusiasm , to us the least interesting ; and one of the diaries of Payson and Martyn , which must have done excellent service in their day , and are by no means strange or out of place now . Here we must close these brief remarks , in which we have said little that we would have said , little that was worthy the theme , or that satisfies ourselves . How time flies ! It seems but yesterday since we were reading the Buccaneers , and watching the summer clouds from beneath the ashen tree that stood by the old wide gateway  --  and now we are reviewing it !  --  and with a load of care and bitter memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were possible without sin to yield the conflict , and write here Finis coronat opus.
