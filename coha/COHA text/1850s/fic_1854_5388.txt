MY LIFE : Or The Adventures of Geo . Thompson . Being the Auto-Biography of an Author . Written by Himself . Why rove in Fiction 's shadowy land , And seek for treasures there , When Truth 's domain , so near at hand , Is filled with things most rare  --  When every day brings something new , Some great , stupendous change , Something exciting , wild and true , Most wonderful and strange ! ORIGINAL . First published 1854 Illustration : Yellow Cover of Thompson 's My Life . Original size 6 x 9-1/8 " . Courtesy , American Antiquarian Society . INTRODUCTION In which the author defineth his position . It having become the fashion of distinguished novelists to write their own lives  --  or , in other words , to blow their own trumpets ,  --  the author of these pages is induced , at the solicitation of numerous friends , whose bumps of inquisitiveness are strongly developed , to present his auto-biography to the public  --  in so doing which , he but follows the example of Alexandre Dumas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of whom are understood to be preparing their personal histories for the press . Now , in comparing myself with the above great worthies , who are so deservedly distinguished in the world of literature , I shall be accused of unpardonable presumption and ridiculous egotism  --  but I care not what may be said of me , inasmuch as a total independence of the opinions , feelings and prejudices of the world , has always been a prominent characteristic of mine  --  and that portion of the world and the " rest of mankind " which does not like me , has my full permission to go to the devil as soon as it can make all the necessary arrangements for the journey . I shall be true and candid , in these pages . I shall not seek to conceal one of my numerous faults which I acknowledge and deplore ; and , if I imagine that I possess one solitary merit , I shall not be backward in making that merit known . Those who know me personally , will never accuse me of entertaining one single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know me , are at liberty to think what they please .  --  Heaven knows that had I possessed a higher estimation of myself , a more complete reliance upon my own powers , and some of that universal commodity known as " cheek , " I should at this present moment have been far better off in fame and fortune . But I have been unobtrusive , unambitious , retiring  --  and my friends have blamed me for this a thousand times . I have seen writers of no talent at all  --  petty scribblers , wasters of ink and spoilers of paper , who could not write six consecutive lines of English grammar , and whose short paragraphs for the newspapers invariably had to undergo revision and correction  --  I have seen such fellows causing themselves to be invited to public banquets and other festivals , and forcing their unwelcome presence into the society of the most distinguished men of the day . I have spoken of my friends  --  now a word or two in regard to my enemies . Like most men who have figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured the hatred of many persons , who , jealous of my humble fame , have lost no opportunity of spitting out their malice and opposing my progress . The friendship of such persons is a misfortune  --  their enmity is a blessing . I assure them that their hatred will never cause me to lose a fraction of my appetite , or my nightly rest . They may consider themselves very fortunate , if , in the following pages , they do not find themselves immortalized by my notice , although they are certainly unworthy of so great a distinction . I enjoy the friendship of men of letters , and am therefore not to be put down by the opposition of a parcel of senseless blockheads , without brain , or heart , or soul . I shall doubtless find it necessary to make allusions to local places , persons , incidents , &amp;c . Those will add greatly to the interest of the narrative . Many portraits will be readily recognized , especially those whose originals reside in Boston , where the greater portion of my literary career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must necessarily be one of peculiar and absorbing interest , for he dwells in a world of his own creation , and his tastes , habits , and feelings are different from those of other people . How little is he understood  --  how imperfectly is he appreciated , by a cold , unsympathising world ! his eccentricities are ridiculed  --  his excesses are condemned by unthinking persons , who can not comprehend the fact that a writer , whose mind is weary , naturally longs for physical excitement of some kind of other , and too often seeks for a temporary mental oblivion in the intoxicating bowl . Under any and every circumstance , the author is certainly deserving of some degree of charitable consideration , because he labors hard for the public entertainment , and draws heavily on the treasures of his imagination , in order to supply the continual demands of the reading community . When the author has led a life of stirring adventure , his history becomes one of extraordinary and thrilling interest . I flatter myself that this narrative will be found worthy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my personal identity . Many have insanely supposed me to be George Thompson , the celebrated English abolitionist and member of the British Parliament , but such can not be the case , that individual having returned to his own country . Again  --  others have taken me for George Thompson , the pugilist ; but by far the greater part of the performers in this interesting " Comedy of Errors " have imagined me to be no less a personage than the celebrated " One-eyed Thompson , " and they long continued in this belief , even after that talented but most unfortunate man had committed suicide in New York , and in spite of the fact that his name was William H. , and not George . Two circumstances , however , seemed to justify the belief before the man 's death :  --  he , like myself , had the great misfortune to be deprived of an eye . How the misfortune happened to me , I shall relate in the proper place . I have written many works of fiction , but I have passed through adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination . In order to establish my claim to the title of " author , " I will enumerate a few of the works which I have written :  --  Gay Girls of New York , Dissipation , The Housekeeper , Venus in Boston , Jack Harold , Criminal , Outlaw , Road to Ruin , Brazen Star , Kate Castleton , Redcliff , The Libertine , City Crimes , The Gay Deceiver , Twin Brothers , Demon of Gold , Dashington , Lady 's Garter , Harry Glindon , Catharine and Clara . In addition to these works  --  which have all met with a rapid sale and most extensive circulation  --  I have written a sufficient quantity of tales , sketches , poetry , essays and other literary stock of every description , to constitute half a dozen cart loads . My adventures , however , and not my productions must employ my pen ; and begging the reader 's pardon for this rather lengthy , but very necessary , introduction , I begin my task . CHAPTER I In which I begin to Acquire a Knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , that it matters very little where or when a man is born  --  it is sufficient for him to know that he is here , and that he had better adapt himself , as far as possible , to the circumstances by which he is surrounded , provided that he wishes to toddle through the world with comfort and credit to himself and to the approbation of others . But still , in order to please all classes of readers , I will state that some thirty years ago a young stranger struggled into existence in the city of New York ; and I will just merely hint that the twenty-eighth day of August , in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three , should be inserted in the next ( comic ) almanac as having been the birth-day of a great man  --  for when an individual attains a bodily weight of two hundred pounds and over , may he not be styled great ? My parents were certainly respectable people , but they both inconsiderately died at a very early period of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickheaded uncle , to whom was attached an objectionable aunt , the proprietress of a long nose and a shrewish temper . The nose was adapted to the consumption of snuff , and the temper was effective in the destruction of my happiness and peace of mind . The worthy couple , with a prophetic eye , saw that I was destined to become , in future years , somewhat of a gourmand , unless care should be taken to prevent such a melancholy fate ; therefore , actuated by the best motives , and in order to teach me the luxury of abstinence , they began by slow but sure degrees to starve me . Good people , how I reverence their memory ! One night I committed burglary upon a closet , and feloniously carried off a chunk of bread and meat , which I devoured in the cellar . " Oh , my prophetic soul  --  my uncle ! " That excellent man caught me in the act of eating the provender , and  --  my bones ache at this very moment as I think of the licking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather insignificant brother , four years older than myself , who became my uncle 's apprentice , and who joined that gentleman in his persecutions against me . My kind relatives were rather blissful people in the way of ignorance , and they hated me because they imagined that I regarded myself as their superior  --  a belief that was founded on the fact that I shunned their society and passed the greater portion of my time in reading and writing . I lived at that time in Thomas street , very near the famous brothel of Rosina Townsend , in whose house that dreadful murder was committed which the New York public will still remember with a thrill of horror . I allude to the murder of the celebrated courtezan Ellen Jewett . Her lover , Richard P. Robinson , was tried and acquitted of the murder , through the eloquence of his talented counsel , Ogden Hoffman , Esq . The facts of the case are briefly these :  --  Robinson was a clerk in a wholesale store , and was the paramour of Ellen , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking together , both dressed in the height of fashion , the beautiful Ellen leaning upon the arm of the dashing Dick , while their elegant appearance attracted universal attention and admiration . But all this soon came to a bloody termination . Dick was engaged to be married to a young lady of the highest respectability , the heiress of wealth and the possessor of surpassing loveliness . He informed Ellen that his connection with her must cease in consequence of his matrimonial arrangements , whereupon Ellen threatened to expose him to his " intended " if he abandoned her . Embarrassed by the critical nature of his situation , Dick , then , in an evil hour , resolved to kill the courtezan who threatened to destroy his anticipated happiness . One Saturday night he visited her as usual ; and after a splendid supper , they returned to her chamber . Upon that occasion , as was afterwards proved on the trial , Dick wore an ample cloak , and several persons noticed that he seemed to have something concealed beneath it . His manner towards Ellen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate . What passed in that chamber , and who perpetrated that murder the Almighty knows  --  and , perhaps , Dick Robinson , if he is still alive , also knows ! A The next morning ( Sunday , ) at a very early hour , smoke was seen to proceed from Ellen 's chamber , and the curtains of her bed were found to have been set on fire . The flames were with difficulty extinguished , and there in the half consumed bed , was found the mangled corpse of Ellen Jewett , having on the side of her head an awful wound , which had evidently been inflicted by a hatchet . Dick Robinson was nowhere to be found , but in the garden , near a fence , were discovered his cloak and a bloody hatchet . With many others , I entered the room in which lay the body of Ellen , and never shall I forget the horrid spectacle that met my gaze ! There , upon that couch of sin , which had been scathed by fire , lay blackened the half-burned remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound which had caused her death . It had plainly been the murderer 's intention to burn down the house in order to destroy the ghastly evidence of his crime ; but fate ordained that the fire should be discovered and extinguished before the fatal wound became obliterated . Robinson , as I said before , was tried and pronounced guiltless of the crime , through the ingenuity of his counsel , who termed him an " innocent boy . " The public , however , firmly believed in his guilt ; and the question arises  --  " If Dick Robinson did not kill Ellen Jewett , who did ? " I do not believe that ever before was presented so shameful an instance of perverted justice , or so striking an illustration of the " glorious uncertainty of the law . " It is rather singular that Furlong , a grocer , who swore to an alibi in favor of Robinson , and who was the chief instrument employed to effect the acquittal of that young man , some time afterwards committed suicide by drowning , having first declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the trial ! The Sabbath upon which this murder was brought to light was a dark , stormy day , and I have reason to remember it well , for , in the afternoon , that good old pilgrim  --  my uncle , of course ,  --  discovered that I had played truant from Sunday School in the morning , and for that atrocious crime , he , in his holy zeal for my spiritual and temporal welfare , resolved to bestow upon me a wholesome and severe flogging , being aided and abetted in the formation of that laudable resolution by my religious aunt and my sanctimonious brother , the latter of whom had turned informer against me . Sweet relatives ? how I love to think of them  --  and never do I fail to remember them in my prayers . Well , I was lugged up into the garret , which was intended to be the scene of my punishment . If I recollect rightly , I was then about twelve years of age , and rather a stout youth considering my years . I determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my independence , and defend myself to the best of my ability . " I have suffered enough ; " said I to myself , " and now I 'm going in . " " Sabbath-breaker , strip off your jacket , " mildly remarked by dear uncle as he savagely flourished a cowhide of most formidable aspect and alarming suppleness . My reply was brief , but expressive : " I 'll see you d  --   --  d first , " said I. My uncle turned pale , my aunt screamed , and my brother rolled up the white of his eyes and groaned . " What , what did you say ? " demanded my uncle , who could not believe the evidence of his own senses , for up to that moment I had always tamely submitted to the good man 's amiable treatment of me , and he found it impossible to imagine that I was capable of resisting him . Well , if there ever was an angel on earth , that uncle of mine was that particular angel . Saints in general are provided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wailings of a small pig , which is suffering the agonies of death beneath a cart-wheel . And , if there ever was a cherub , my brother was certainly that individual cherub , although , in truth , my pious recollections do not furnish me with the statement that cherubs are remarkable for swelled heads and bandy legs . " I say , " was my reply to my uncle 's astonished inquiry , " that I ai n't going to stand any more abuse and beatings . I 've stood bad treatment long enough from the whole pack of you . I 'm almost starved , and I 'm kicked about like a dog . Let any of you three tyrants touch me , and I 'll show you what is to get desperate . I disown you all as relatives , and hereafter I 'm going to live where I please , and do as I please . " Furious with rage , my sweet-tempered uncle raised the cowhide and with it struck me across the face . I immediately pitched into that portion of his person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the excellent man fell head over heels down the garret stairs , landing securely at the bottom and failing to pick himself up , for the simple reason that he had broken his leg . What a pity it would have been , and what a loss society would have sustained , if , instead of his leg , the holy man had broken his neck ! My dear brother , accompanied by my affectionate aunt , now choked me , but I was not to be conquered just then , for " thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just . " The lady I landed in a tub of impure water that happened to be standing near ; and she presented quite an interesting appearance , kicking up her heels and squalling like a cat in difficulties . My other assailant I hurled into a heap of ashes , and the way he blubbered was a caution to a Nantucket whaleman . Rushing down the stairs , I passed over the prostrate form of my crippled uncle , who requested me to come back , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , brute that I was , I disregarded him  --  requested him to go to a place which shall be nameless  --  and then left the house as expeditiously as possible , fully determined never to return , whatever might be the consequences . " I am now old enough , and big enough , " I mentally reflected , " to take care of myself ; and to-morrow I 'll look for work , and try to get a chance to learn a trade . Where shall I sleep to-night ? It 's easy enough to ask that question , but deuced hard to answer it . I wish to-day was n't Sunday ! " Rather an impious wish , but quite natural under the circumstances . I felt in my pockets , to see if I was the proprietor of any loose change ; my search was magnificently successful , for I discovered that I had a sixpence ! Yes , reader , a new silver sixpence , that glittered in my hand like a bright star of hope , urging me on to enterprise  --  to exertions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I continued to grasp it tightly in my hand . I never had been allowed any pocket money , even on the Fourth of July ; and this large sum had come into my possession through the munificence of a neighbor , as a reward for performing an errand . Not knowing where else to go , I went down on the Battery , and sheltered myself under a tree from the rain , which fell in torrents . Rather an interesting situation for a youth of twelve  --  homeless , friendless , almost penniless ! I was wet through to the skin , and as night came on , I became desperately hungry , for I had eaten no dinner that day , and even my breakfast had been of the phantom order  --  something like the pasteboard meals which are displayed upon the stage of the theatre . However , I did not despair , for I was young and active , full of the hope so natural to a youth ere rough contact with the world has crushed his spirit . I was well aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had often been called one by my hostile and unappreciating relatives , whose opinions I had ever held in most supreme contempt . As I stood under that tree to shelter myself from the rain , I felt quite happy , for a feeling of independence had arisen within me . I was now my own master , and the consciousness that I must solely rely upon myself , was to me a source of gratification and pride . I had not the slightest doubt of being able to dig my way through the world in some way or other . Night came on at last , black as the brow of a Congo nigger , and starless as a company of travelling actors . I could not remain under the tree all night , that was certain ; and so I left it , although I could scarcely see my hand before me . That hand , by the way , still tenaciously grasped the invaluable sixpence . Groping my way out of the Battery , and guided by a light , I entered the bar-room of a respectable hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were seeking shelter from the storm , and at the same time indulging their convivial propensities . Much noise and confusion prevailed ; and two gentlemen , who , as I afterwards learned , were officers belonging to a Spanish vessel then in port , fell into a dispute and got into a fight , during which one of them stabbed the other with a dirk-knife , inflicting a mortal wound . Officers were sent for , the murderer and his victim were removed , and comparative quiet prevailed . I was seated in an obscure corner of the bar-room , wondering how I should get through the night , when I was unceremoniously accosted by a lad of about my own age . He was a rakish looking youth , quite handsome withal , dressed in the height of fashion , and was smoking a cigar with great vigor and apparent relish . It will be seen hereafter that I have reason to remember this individual to the very last day of my life . Would to heaven that I had never met him ! This youth slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallo , bub ! why , you 're wet as a drowned rat ! Come and take a brandy cocktail  --  it will warm you up ! " I had never drank a drop of liquor in my life , and I had n't the faintest idea of what a brandy cocktail was , and so I told my new friend , who laughed immoderately as he exclaimed  --  " How jolly green you are , to be sure ; why , you 're a regular greenhorn , and I 'm going to call you by that name hereafter . Have you got any tin ? " I knew that he meant money , and so I told him that I had but a sixpence in the world . " Bah ! " cried my friend , as he drew his cigar from his mouth and salivated in the most fashionable manner , " who are you , what are you and what are you doing here ? Come , tell me all about yourself , and it may perhaps be in my power to do you a service . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him my whole story , without any reserve ; and he laughed uproariously when I told him how I had pitched my tyrannical uncle down stairs . " It served the old chap right , " said he approvingly  --  " you are a fellow of some spirit , and I like you . Come take a drink , and we can afterwards talk over what is best to be done . " I objected to drink , because I had formed a strong prejudice against ardent spirits , having often been a witness of its deplorable effects in depriving men  --  and women , too  --  of their reason , and reducing them to the condition of brute beasts . So , in declining my friend 's invitation , I told him my reasons for so doing , whereupon he laughed louder than ever , as he remarked  --  " Why , Greenhorn , you 'd make an excellent temperance lecturer . But perhaps you think I have n't got any money to pay the rum . Look here  --  what do you think of that ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them triumphantly . I had never before seen so much money , except in the broker 's windows ; and my friend was immediately established in my mind as a millionaire , whose wealth was inexhaustible . I suddenly conceived for him the most profound respect , and would not have offended him for the world . How could I persist in refusing to drink with a young gentleman of such wealth , and ( as a necessary consequence ) such distinction ? Besides , I suddenly felt quite a curiosity to drink some liquor , just to see how it tasted . After all , it was only very low people who got drunk and wallowed in the mire . Gentlemen ( I thought ) never get drunk , and they always seem so happy and joyous after they have been drinking ! How they shake hands , and swear eternal friendship , and seem generously willing to lend or give away all they have in the world ! So thought I , as my mind was made up to accept the invitation of my friend . It is singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just taken place in that bar-room , and which had been directly produced by intemperance . " The fact is , my dear Greenhorn , " said my friend , impressively , as he flourished his hand after the manner of some aged , experienced and eloquent orator , " the fact is , the use of liquor , and its abuse , are two very different things . A man ( here he drew himself up ) can drink like a gentleman , or he can swill like a loafer , or a beast . Now I prefer the gentlemanly portion of the argument , and therefore we 'll go up and take a gentlemanly drink . I shall be happy , young man , to initiate you into the divine joys and mysteries of Bacchus  --  ahem ! " I looked at my friend with increased wonder , for he displayed an assurance , a self-possession , an elegant nonchalance , that were far beyond his years , for he was only about twelve years old  --  my own age exactly . And then what language he used  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world ! I longed to be like him  --  to equal him in his many perfections  --  to sport as much money as he did , and to wear as good " harness . " I forgot to mention that he carried a splendid gold watch , and that several glittering rings adorned his fingers . " Who can he be ? " was the question which I asked myself ; and of course , I could not find an answer . " Felix , " said my friend , addressing the bar-keeper in a style of patronizing condescension , as we approached the bar , " Felix , my good fellow , just mix us a couple of brandy cocktails , will you , and make them strong , d'ye hear , for the night is wet , and I and my verdant friend here , are about to travel in search of amusement , even as the Caliph and his Vizier used to perambulate the streets of Baghdad . Come , hurry up ! " The bar-keeper grinned , mixed the liquor , and handed us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remarked " here 's luck , " a ceremony and an observation which both somewhat surprised me at the time , although I have long since become thoroughly acquainted with what was then a mystery . Many of my readers  --  indeed , I may say the greater portion of them  --  will require no explanation of this matter ; and as for those who are in ignorance of it , I will simply say , long may they keep so ! My friend tossed off his cocktail with the air of one who is used to it , and rather liked it than otherwise ; but I was not quite so successful , for being wholly unacquainted with the science of drinking , the strength of the liquor nearly choked me , to the intense amusement of my more experienced friend , who advised me to try again . I did try again , and more successfully , the liquor went the way of all rum , and soon produced the usual effects . Of course its influence on me was exceedingly powerful , I being entirely unaccustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over me  --  I thought I was worth just one hundred thousand dollars  --  I embraced my friend and swore he was a " trump "  --  I then noticed , with mild surprise , that he had been multiplied into two individuals  --  there were two barkeepers now , although just before I drank , there was but one  --  an additional chandelier had just stepped in to visit the solitary one which had lighted the room  --  to speak plainly , I saw double ; and to sum the whole matter up in a few words , I was , for the first time in my life , most decidedly and incontestably drunk . As nearly as I can remember , my friend linked his arm within mine , and we passed out into the street  --  he partially supporting me , and keeping me from falling . Two precious youths , of twelve years of age , we certainly were  --  one staggering and trying to fall down , and the other laughing , and holding him up ! The rain had ceased falling , and the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air sobered me , and my friend congratulated me on my recovery from a state of inebriety . " After a little practice at the bar , " said he  --  " it will take a good many tods to floor you . Let me give you a few hints as regards drinking . Never mix your liquor  --  always stick to one kind . After every glass , eat a cracker  --  or , what is better , a pickle . Plain drinks are always the best  --  far preferable to fancy drinks , which contain sugar , and lemons , and mint , and other trash ; although a mixed drink may be taken on a stormy night , such as this has been . Drink ale , or beer , sparingly , and only after dinner  --  for , taken in large quantities , it is apt to bloat a person , and it plays the very devil with his internal arrangements . Besides , it is filthy stuff , at best , being made of the most repulsive materials and in the dirtiest manner . Always drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vile stuff which is sold in the different bar-rooms will soon send you to your grave . If you pass a day or two in drinking freely , do not miss eating a single meal , and if you do not feel inclined to eat , force yourself to do it ; for , if you neglect your food , that terrible fiend , Delirium Tremens , will have you in his savage grasp before you know it . Every morning after a spree , take a good stiff horn of brandy , and soon afterwards a glass of plain soda , which will cool you off . Never drink gin  --  it is vulgar stuff , not fit to be used by gentlemen .  --  When you desire to reform from drinking , never break off abruptly , which is dangerous ; but taper off gradually  --  three glasses to-day , two to-morrow , and one the next day . Never drink with low people , under any circumstances , for it brings you down to their level . When you go to a drinking party , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun  --  confine yourself to one kind of liquor  --  take an occasional sip of vinegar  --  and the very devil himself can not drink you under the table ! Now do you understand me , my dear greenhorn ? " Such language and advice , emanating from a boy of twelve , astonished me , and hurried me to the conclusion that he must be a very " fast " youth indeed . I took a more particular survey of my new friend . He was not remarkable handsome , but his face was flushing not with health , but with drinking . A rosy tint suffused his full cheeks , and a delicate vermillion colored the top of his well-formed nose . His form was somewhat slighter than mine , but he looked vigorous and active . His closely buttoned jacket developed a full breast , and a pair of muscular arms . His small feet were encased in patent-leather boots . Upon his head was a jaunty cloth cap , from beneath which flowed a quantity of fine , curly hair . I really envied him his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I admired him ; and he liked me for it . Such was Jack Slack , I may as well give his name at once , for I hate the trickery of authors who keep the curiosity of their readers painfully excited to the end of their narratives for the purpose of producing an effect . My professional habits as a writer prompt me to do the same ; but I must not forget that I am writing my own history , and not an effusion of my imagination , which seems to be a prolific mother , for it hath produced many children , and ( if I live ) may produce many more . While I now write , the Sabbath bells are ringing in sweet harmony , and through my open window comes the cool but mild breath of an autumnal morning . Yes , it is Sunday , and all the holy associations of the sacred day crowd upon me . I can almost see the village church , and the throng of worshippers within it , listening to the fervent remarks and exhortations of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its stained windows , its elaborate carvings , its pealing organs , and its fashionable assembly of superficial worshippers . While others are praying , pleasuring and sleeping , I am rushing my iron pen over the spotless paper , and wishing that my penmanship could keep pace with my thought .  --  This is a digression ; but the reader will pardon it . There is one dear creature , I know , who , when her eyes scan these pages , will understand me . But she , alas ! is far away . Where was I ? Oh , speaking of Jack Slack . How well do I remember the night upon which first I met him ! I can see him now , with his mischievous smiles , his eyes full of deviltry  --  his scornful lips  --  I can almost hear his mocking laugh . Yes , although eighteen years have passed since then , the remembrance of that night is fresh within me , as if its occurrence were but things of yesterday . May perdition seize the circumstances which led me to encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But for him , I might have led a happy , tranquil life ; unknown , it is true , but still happy . But , poor fellow ! he is dead now . He died by my hand , and I do not regret the act , nor would I recall it , had I the power . But of this the reader shall know hereafter . That was my first night of dissipation  --  that was the occasion of my initiation into the mysteries of debauchery . I had previously led a necessarily regular and abstemious life  --  to bed at eight , up at six , at school by nine , and so on . ( By the way , I never learned any thing at school  --  the master pronounced me the most stupid rascal in the concern ; and flogged me accordingly  --  good old man ! All I ever learned was acquired in a printing office . ) Well , here was I at the age of twelve , fairly launched upon the sea of city life , without a guide , protector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a reckless , dissipated individual , careless of myself , my interests , my fame and fortune ? Jack Slack and I , arm-in-arm , entered Broadway , and proceeded at a leisurely pace up that noble avenue . Many a courtezan did we meet , and many a watchman did we salute with the compliments of the season . ( There were no Brazen Stars , B nor M.P . ' s , then . ) One lady of the pave , whom my companion addressed in terms of complimentary gallantry , said  --  " Little boy , go home to your mother and tell her she wants you ! " I am now about to make a humiliating confession , but I must not shrink from it , inasmuch as I sat down with the determination of writing " the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . " I allowed Jack to persuade me to accompany him on a visit to a celebrated establishment in Leonard street  --  a house occupied by accommodating ladies of great personal attractions , who were not especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house of ill-fame ; and without exactly comprehending the nature of the place and its arrangements , I was deeply impressed with the strangeness and novelty of everything that surrounded me . The costly and elegant furniture  --  the brilliant chandeliers  --  the magnificent but rather loose French prints and paintings  --  the universal luxury that prevailed  --  the voluptuous ladies , with their bare shoulders , painted cheeks , and free-and-easy manners  --  the buxom , bustling landlady , who was dressed with almost regal splendor and wore a profusion of jewelry  --  the crowd of half-drunken gentlemen who were drinking wine and laughing uproariously  --  all these things astonished and bewildered me . My friend Jack appeared to be well known to the inmates of the house , with whom he seemed to be an immense favorite . Having  --  much to my dissatisfaction and disgust  --  introduced me to a lady , he took possession of another one , and called for a couple of bottles of wine . Jack and his lady were evidently upon the most intimate and affectionate terms , while my female companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appreciate her advances , being altogether unaccustomed to such things . The champagne was brought , and I was persuaded to drink freely of it . The consequence was that I soon became helplessly intoxicated . I can indistinctly remember the dancing lights , the popping of champagne corks  --  the noise , the confusion , the thrumming of a piano , and the boisterous laughter  --  and then I fell into a condition of complete insensibility . When I awoke , I was astonished at my situation and naturally enough , for I was in a strange apartment and snugly stowed away in a strange but decidedly luxuriant bed . The room was handsomely furnished , but to my additional surprise , many female garments were scattered about , indicating that the regular inhabitant of the place was a lady . This mystery was soon solved , for I was not the only inmate of the couch . My companion was the lady to whom I had been introduced by Jack Slack . Pitying my helpless condition  --  and , doubtless , prompted by the mischievous Jack  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , being actuated by a benevolent anxiety for my safety . What a delicate situation for a modest youth to be placed in ! Having , to my no small satisfaction , ascertained that the lady was fast asleep , I arose so carefully and noiselessly as not to awaken her . In truth , I was disgusted with the whole concern , and determined to leave it as speedily as possible . A light was fortunately burning in the room , which enabled me to move about with safety . A gold watch which lay upon the table informed me that it was nearly midnight .  --  Leaving the chamber and its sleeping inmate , I crept down stairs , and , on passing the door of the principal sitting-room , the voice of Jack Slack , who was singing a comic song amid the most enthusiastic applause , convinced me that my interesting friend was still rendering himself a source of amusement and an object of admiration . Without stopping to compliment him upon the excellence of his performance , I approached the front door , turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and passed out into the street , just as the clock of a neighboring steeple was proclaiming the hour of twelve . My head ached terribly after the champagne which I had so profusely drank , and besides , I felt heavy and sleepy to an extraordinary degree . Unable to resist the overpowering influence of my feelings , I sat down upon the steps of a house and was fast asleep in less than a minute . Then I dreamed of being seized in the powerful grasp of some gigantic demon , and hurried away to the bottomless pit . I certainly felt conscious of being moved about , but my oblivious condition would not admit of arriving at any definite understanding of what was happening to me . When I finally awoke , I found myself in an apartment that was far different in its aspect from the luxurious chamber I had just quitted . The floor , walls and ceiling of the apartment were of stone ; there were no windows , but a narrow aperture , high up in the wall , admitted the feeble glimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water-pipe , and platform on which I lay , and on which reposed several gentlemen of seedy raiment and unwholesome appearance . The place and the company , as dimly revealed by the uncertain morning light , inspired me with emotions of horror ; and in my inexperience and ignorance , I said to myself  --  " I must leave this place at once . How I came here is a mystery , but it is certain that I can not remain . " I arose from my hard couch , and approached the iron door with the confident expectation of being able to pass out without any difficulty , for I imagined that I had fallen into one of those cheap and wretched lodging houses with which the city abounds . ( By the way , I may hereafter have something to say with reference to these cheap lodging-houses . Some rich development may be made , which will rather astonish the unsophisticated reader . ) To my surprise , I found that the door could not be opened ; and then one of my fellow-lodgers , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to leave us , my lad ? Then leave us your card , or a lock of your hair to remember you by . " " Will you be kind enough to tell me what place this is ? " said I. The man laughed loudly , as he replied  --  " Why , do n't you know ? What an innocent youth you are , to be sure ! How the devil could you come here , without knowing anything about it ? But I suppose that you were drunk , which is a great pity for a boy like you . Well , not to keep you in suspense , I must inform you that you are in the watch-house of the Tombs ! " This information appalled me . To be in confinement  --  to be a prisoner  --  to be associated with a company of outcasts , thieves and perhaps murderers  --  was to me the height of horror . I looked particularly at the man with whom I had been conversing . He was a savage-looking individual , with a beard like that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage . He was roughly dressed , in a garb that announced him to be a mariner . In the course of a conversation that we fell into , he informed me that he had committed a murder on the preceding evening , and that he expected to be hung . " We quarrelled at cards , " said he , " and he gave me the lie  --  whereupon I drew my death-knife and stabbed him to the heart . He died instantly ; the police rushed in , and here I am . My neck will be stretched , but I do n't care . What matters it how a man dies ? When my time comes , I shall go forth as readily and as cheerfully as if I were going to take a drink . " ( I will here remark that I afterwards saw this man hung in the yard of the Tombs . His history is in my possession , and I shall hereafter write it . ) C At nine o'clock I was taken before the magistrate , who , after severely reprimanding me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remark that if I were brought there again he would be obliged to commit me to the Tombs for the term of five days . Delighted at having obtained my liberty , I posted out of the court room and found myself in Centre street . My debauch of the preceding night had not spoiled my appetite , by any means ; and , as I still had in my possession the sixpence alluded to before , I resolved to produce some breakfast forthwith . Aware that my limited finances would not admit of my obtaining a very sumptuous repast , and fully appreciating the necessity of economy , I entered the shop of a baker and purchased three rolls at the rate of one cent per copy . Thus provided , I repaired to a neighboring street pump , and made a light but wholesome breakfast . It was thus , reader , that your humble servant began to acquire a knowledge of the world . FOOTNOTES : A The last that was heard of Robinson , he was in Texas , and it was reported that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some battle , the name of which I do not remember .

It will be issued by the publisher of this narrative . CHAPTER II In which I become a Printer , and am introduced into certain mysteries of connubial life . Having breakfasted to my entire satisfaction and also to my great bodily refreshment , I entered the Park , seated myself upon the steps of the City Hall , and thought " what is best to be done ? "  --  It was Monday morning , and the weather was excellently fine . It was an excellent time to search for employment . A sign on an old building in Chatham street attracted my notice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Job Printing . " " Good ! " was my muttered exclamation , as I left the Park and crossed over towards the old building in question  --  " I 'll be a printer ! Franklin was one , and he , like myself , was fond of rolls , because he entered Philadelphia with one under each arm . Yes , I 'll be a printer . " Entering the printing office , I found it to be a very small concern , containing but one press and a rather limited assortment of type . The proprietor of the office , whom I shall call Mr. Romaine , was a rather intellectual looking man , of middle age . Being very industrious , he did the principal portion of his work himself , occasionally , however , hiring a journeyman when work was unusually abundant . As I entered he looked up from his case and inquired , with an air of benevolence  --  " Well , my lad , what can I do for you this morning ? " " If you please , sir , I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly . " Ah , indeed ! Well , I was just thinking of taking an apprentice . But give an account of yourself  --  how old are you , and who are you ? " I frankly communicated to Mr. Romaine all that he desired to know concerning me , and he expressed himself as being perfectly satisfied . He immediately set me to " learning the boxes " of a case of type ; and in half an hour I had accomplished the task , which was not very difficult , it being merely an effort of memory . It having been arranged that I should take up my abode in the house of Mr. Romaine , I accompanied that gentleman home to dinner . He lived in William street and his wife kept a fashionable boarding-house for merchants , professional men , &amp;c . Several of these gentlemen were married men and had their wives with them . Mrs. Romaine , the wife of my employer , was one of the finest-looking women I ever saw  --  tall , voluptuous , and truly beautiful . She was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating and agreeable . She was always dressed in a style of great elegance , and was admirably adapted to the station which she filled as landlady of an establishment like that . I will remark that although she had been the wife of Mr. Romaine for a number of years , she had not been blessed with offspring , which was doubtless to her a source of great disappointment , to say nothing of the chagrin which a married woman naturally feels when she fails in due time to add to the population of her country . Accustomed as I had been to the economical scantiness of my uncle 's table , I was both surprised and delighted with the luxurious abundance that greeted me on sitting down to dinner at Mrs. Romaine 's . I was equally well pleased with the sprightliness , intelligence and good-humor of the conversation in which the ladies and gentlemen engaged , and also with their refined and courteous bearing towards each other . I congratulated myself on having succeeded in getting not only into business , but also into good society . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see me now , they might not be well pleased at my situation and prospects . Let them go to Beelzebub ! I will get on in the world , in spite of them ! " In a few days I began to be very useful about the printing office , for I had learned to set type and to roll behind the press ; I also performed all the multifarious duties of devil , and was so fortunate as to secure the good will of my employer , who generously purchased for me a fine new suit of clothes , and seemed anxious to make me as comfortable as possible . His wife , also , treated me very kindly ; but there was something mysterious about this lady , which for a time , puzzled me extremely . One discovery which I made rather astonished me , young as I was , and caused me to do a " devil of a thinking . " Mr. Romaine and his wife occupied separate sleeping apartments , and there seemed to be an aversion between them , although they treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my readers will agree with me that mere politeness is not the only sentiment which should exist between a husband and his wife . There was evidently something " rotten in Denmark " between Mr. and Mrs. Romaine , and I determined , if possible , to penetrate the mystery . Mr. Romaine , who was professedly a pious man , was particularly in favor of " remembering the Sabbath day to keep it holy , " and he therefore directed me to be very punctual in attendance at church and Sunday school , and I obeyed his praiseworthy request until visions of literary greatness and renown began to dawn upon me , whereupon , prompted by gingerbread and ambition , and being moreover aided and abetted by another printer 's devil of tender years and literary aspirations , I , one Sunday morning , entered the printing office , ( of which I kept the key , ) and assisted by my companion , set up and worked off one hundred copies of a diminutive periodical just six inches square , containing a very brief abstract of the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few rather partial theatrical criticisms . This extensive newspaper we issued on three successive Sundays , circulating it among our juvenile friends at the moderate rate of one cent a copy . On the fourth Sunday we were caught in the act of printing our journal by Mr. Romaine himself , who , although he with difficulty refrained from laughing at the fun of the thing , gave us a long lecture on the crime of Sabbath-breaking , and then made us distribute the type , forgetting that we were breaking the Sabbath as much by taking our form to pieces as by putting it together . Mr. Romaine was also strongly opposed to theatres , but , nevertheless , I visited the " little Frankin " four or five times every week , to see John and Bill Sefton in the " Golden Farmer , " and other thrilling melo-dramas , a convenient ally , a garden and a shed enabled me to enter my chamber at any hour during the night , without my employer 's becoming aware of my absence from home . One night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned home about midnight . On entering the garden , I discovered to my surprise a light streaming from the kitchen windows  --  a very unusual occurrence . I crept softly up to one of the windows , and looking into the kitchen , a scene met my gaze that filled me with astonishment . Mrs. Romaine , arrayed in her night-dress only , was seated at a table , and at her side was a young gentleman named Anderson , who boarded in the house , and who was a prosperous merchant . His arm was around the lady 's waist , and her head rested affectionately upon his shoulder . She looked uncommonly beautiful and voluptuous that night , I thought , young as I was , I wondered not at the look of passionate admiration with which Anderson regarded his fair companion , upon whose sensual countenance there rested an expression of gratified love . Upon the table were the remains of a supper of which they had evidently partaken ; there were also a bottle of wine and two glasses , partially filled . Mrs. Romaine sipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the guilty pair seemed to be enjoying themselves highly . It was plain that the lady was resolved to lose nothing by her estrangement from her husband ; it was equally plain that between her and Mr. Romaine there existed not the smallest particle of love . I now ceased to wonder why the wedded pair occupied separate apartments ; and I came to the conclusion that disappointment in the matter of children was the cause of their mutual aversion . If I were writing a romance instead of a narrative of facts , I would here introduce an imaginary tender conversation between the pair . But as no such conversation took place I have none to describe . " Well , " said I to myself  --  " this is a pretty state of affairs , truly . I guess that if Mr. Romaine suspected any thing of this kind , there would be the very devil to pay , and no mistake . But it 's no business of mine ; and so I 'll climb into my window and go to bed . " My employer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely pitied him on account of his unhappy connubial situation . I turned away from the kitchen window , and began to mount the shed in order to reach my chamber . I had nearly gained the roof of the shed , when a board gave way and I was precipitated to the ground , a distance of about ten feet . Fortunately I sustained no injury ; but the noise aroused and alarmed the loving couple in the kitchen . Mrs. Romaine , in her terror and dread of discovery , gave utterance to a slight scream ; while Mr. Anderson rushed forth and seized me in a rather powerful grasp . I struggled , and kicked , and strove to extricate myself , but it was all of no use . With many a muttered imprecation Anderson dragged me into the kitchen , and swore that if I did not remain quiet he would stab me to the heart with a dirk-knife that he produced from his pocket . " You young rascal , " said he " who employed you to play the part of a spy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lurking outside , in the garden ? If so , let him beware , for I am a desperate man , one not to be trifled with ! " I explained everything to the entire satisfaction of both the gentleman and lady , whose countenances brightened when they found that matters were far from being as bad as they expected . " Now , my boy , " said Anderson , " just do keep perfectly dark about this business , and I 'll make your fortune . You shall never want a dollar while I live . As an earnest of what I may hereafter do for you , accept this trifle , which will enable you to gratify your theatre-going propensities to your heart 's content . " The " trifle " was a ten dollar gold piece . I had never before possessed so much money ; and no millionaire ever felt richer than I did at that moment . Delightful visions of dramatic treats arose before me , and I was happy . Mr. Anderson made me drink a couple of glasses of wine , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated . Then he told me that I had better go to bed , and I fully agreed with him . So , bidding the enamoured couple a patronizing good night and facetiously wishing them a pleasant time together  --  the wine had made me bold and saucy  --  I left the kitchen and began to ascend the stairs towards my own room with all the silence and caution of which I was capable . I was destined that night to make another astonishing discovery . Being quite tipsy , I was deprived of my usual judgement , and suffered myself to stumble against a table that stood upon one of the landings opposite the chamber door of a young and particularly pretty widow named Mrs. Raymond , who boarded in the house . She possessed a snug independent fortune , and led a life of elegant leisure . Although demure in her looks and reverend in her deportment , there was a whole troop of dancing devils in her eyes that proclaimed the fact that her nature was not exactly as cold as ice . My collision with the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Raymond 's door , which burst open , and down I landed in the very centre of the apartment . I heard a scream , and then a curse . The scream was the performance of the fair widow ; the curse was the production of Mr. Romaine , my pious , Sabbath-venerating and theatre-opposing employer , who , springing up from the sofa upon which he had been seated by the side of the widow , seized me by the throat and demanded how the devil I came there ? My wits had not entirely deserted me , and I managed to tell quite a plausible story . I candidly confessed that I had been to the theatre and stated that I had got into the house through the kitchen window . Of course I said nothing about Anderson and Mrs. Romaine . " You have been drinking , " said Mr. Romaine , in a tone that was by no means severe , " but I forgive you for that , and also for having disobeyed me by going to the theatre . Be a good boy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live . " While he was speaking , I looked about the room . It was exquisitely furnished with the most refined and elegant taste . Mrs. Raymond , who still sat upon the sofa , blushed deeply as her eyes encountered mine . She was en deshabille , and looked charming . I could not help admiring the divine perfections of her form , as revealed by the deliciously careless attire which she wore . I did not wonder that my respected presence confused her , for she had always held herself up as the very pink and pattern of female propriety , and besides , she often lectured me severely upon the enormity of some of my juvenile offences , which came to her knowledge . Mr. Romaine continued to address me , thus : " If you will solemnly promise to say nothing about having seen me in this room , I will reward you handsomely . " I readily gave the required promise , whereupon my pious employer presented me with a five-dollar bill , which I received with all the nonchalance in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountering any more adventures . Sleep did not visit me that night , for my thoughts were too busily engaged with the discoveries which I had made ; and besides , the blissful consciousness of being the possessor of the princely sum of fifteen dollars , would have kept me awake , independent of anything else . A day or two after these occurrences , while looking over one of the morning newspapers , I saw an advertisement signed by my uncle , in which that worthy man offered a reward for my apprehension . The notice contained a minute description of my personal appearance and the clothes which I had on when I " ran away . " Although my garments had been entirely changed , I was fearful that some one might recognize my person , and carry me back to my uncle 's house , where I had every reason to expect far worse treatment than I had ever received before . But Mr. Romaine , to whom I showed the advertisement , told me not to be at all alarmed , as he would protect me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was never molested in consequence of that advertisement . After the night on which I had detected the intrigue of my employer and his wife , I began to live emphatically " in clover , " and accumulated money tolerably fast . All the parties concerned treated me with the utmost consideration and respect . Mr. Romaine suffered me to do pretty much as I pleased in the printing office , and so I enjoyed a very agreeable and leisurely time of it , doing as much Sunday printing on my own account as I desired , and going to the theatre as often as I wished . Mr. Anderson would occasionally slip a five dollar note into my hand , at the same time enjoining me to " keep mum ; " Mrs. Romaine , with her own fair hands , made me a dozen superb shirts , supplied me with handkerchiefs , stockings and fancy cravats innumerable , and so arranged it that when I returned from the theatre at night , a nice little supper awaited me in the kitchen . These repasts she would sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was fond of all the good things of this life , including good eating and drinking . Anderson would join us occasionally , and a snug , cosy little party we made . Mrs. Raymond , the pretty widow , was not backward in testifying to me how grateful she was for my silence with reference to her frailty . She made me frequent presents of money , and gave me an elegant and valuable ring , which I wore until the " intervention of unfortunate circumstance " compelled me to consign it to the custody of " my uncle "  --  not my beloved relative of Thomas street , ( peace to his memory , for he has gone the way of all pork , )  --  but that accommodating uncle of mine and everybody else , Mr. Simpson , who dwelleth in the Rue de Chatham , and whose mansion is decorated with three gilded balls . Kind , convenient Uncle Simpson ! Ah ! those were my halcyon days , when not a single care cast its shadow o'er my soul . As I think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the words of a fine popular song  --  " I would I were a boy again ! " Three years passed away , unmarked by the occurrence of any event of sufficient importance to merit a place in this narrative . When I reached my fifteenth year , the fashionable boarding-house of Mrs. Romaine became the scene of a tragedy so bloody , so awful and so appalling , that even now , while I think and write about it , my blood runs cold in my veins . That terrible affair can no more be obliterated from my memory than can the sun be effaced from the arch of heaven ; and to my dying day , its recollection will continue to haunt me like a hideous spectre . But I must devote a separate chapter to the details of that sanguinary event . I would gladly escape from the task of describing it ; but , of course , were I to omit it , this narrative would be incomplete . Therefore the unwelcome duty must be performed . CHAPTER III In which is enacted a bloody tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Romaine stealthily regarded his wife with looks of intense hatred and malignant ferocity ; then he would transfer his gaze from her to Mr. Anderson , who was altogether unconscious of the scrutiny . My employer was usually a very quiet man , but I knew that his passions were very violent , and that , when once thoroughly aroused , he was capable of perpetrating almost any act of savage vengeance . I began to fear that he suspected the intimacy which existed between his adulterous wife and her paramour . By the way it may be as well to remark that I had never told either Anderson or Mrs. Romaine of the intrigue between Mr. Romaine and the widow , Mrs. Raymond ; and it is scarcely necessary to observe that I was equally discreet in withholding from my employer and his " ladye love " all knowledge of the state of affairs between the other parties . I communicated my fears to Mr. Anderson , but he laughed at them saying  --  " Nonsense , my dear boy  --  why should Romaine suspect anything of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very discreet and careful . Our intimacy began three or four years ago ; and as it has lasted that length of time without discovery , it is scarcely likely to be detected now . You are quite sure that you have given Romaine no hint of the affair ? " " Do you think me capable of such base treachery ? " I demanded , with an offended air . " Forgive me , " said Anderson , " I did wrong to doubt you . Believe me , your fears are groundless ; however , I thank you for the caution , and shall hereafter exercise additional care , so as to prevent the possibility of discovery . Here is a ticket for the opera to-night ; when you return , which will be about midnight , come to Harriet 's room , and we three will sup like two kings and a queen . " Having dressed myself with unusual care , I went to the opera . While listening to the divine strains of a celebrated prima donna , my attention was attracted by a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of a youth apparently about my own age , and two showy looking females whose dresses were cut so low as to reveal much more of their busts than decency could sanction , even among an opera audience . There could be no doubt as to the character of these two women . I examined their youthful cavalier with attention ; and soon recognized my quondum friend and pitcher  --  JACK SLACK . Jack was magnificently dressed , and his appearance was truly superb . The most fastidious Parisian exquisite  --  even the great Count D'Orsay himself might have envied him the arrangement of his hair , the tie of his cravat , the spotlessness of his white kids . He flourished a glittering , jeweled lorgnette , and the way the fellow put on " French airs " must have been a caution to the proudest scion of aristocracy in the house . After a little while Jack saw me ; and , having taken a good long stare at me through his opera-glass , he beckoned me to come to him , at the same time pointing significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to intimate that she was entirely at my disposal . But I shook my head , and did not stir , for I had no desire to resume my acquaintance with that fascinating but mysterious youth . Perhaps I entertained a presentiment that he was destined to become , to both of us , the cause of a great misfortune . Jack looked angry and disappointed , at my refusal to accept of his hospitable invitation . He directed the attention of his women towards me , and I saw that they were attempting to titter and sneer at my expense ;  --  but the effort was a total failure , for there was not a better-dressed person in the house than I was . Having honored the envious party with a smile of scorn ,  --  which , I flattered myself , was perfectly successful ,  --  I turned towards the stage , and did not indulge in another look at Jack or his friends during the remainder of the opera . I am convinced that from that hour , Jack Slack became my mortal foe . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Jack getting into a carriage with the two courtezans . He observed me , and uttered a decisive shout , to which I paid no attention , but hurried home , anxious to make one of the little party in the apartment of Mrs. Romaine , and quite ready to partake of the delicacies which , I knew , would be provided . On my arrival home , I immediately repaired to Mrs. Romaine 's private room , where I found that good lady in company with Mr. Anderson . We three sat down to supper in the highest possible spirits . Alas ! how little did we anticipate the terrible catastrophe that was so soon to follow ! The more substantial portion of the banquet having been disposed of , the sparkling wine-cup was circulated freely , and we became very gay and jovial . Unrestrained by my presence , and exhilarated by the rosy beverage of jolly Bacchus , the lovers indulged in many little acts of tender dalliance . Always making it a point to mind my own business , I applied myself diligently to the bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me thirsty . I had just lighted a cigar , and was resigning myself to the luxurious and deliciously soothing influence of the weed , when the door was thrown violently open , and Mr. Romaine rushed into the room . His appearance was frightful ! his face was dreadfully pale , and his eyes glared with the combined fires of jealousy and rage . Intense excitement caused him to quiver in every limb . In one hand he grasped a pistol , and in the other a bowie knife of the largest and most formidable kind . It was but too evident that my fears had been well founded , and that Mr. Romaine had discovered the intimacy between Anderson and his wife . The reader will agree with me that the " injured husband " was equally culpable on account of his intrigue with the young and handsome widow , Mrs. Raymond .  --  How prone are many people to lose sight of their own imperfections while they censure and severely punish the failings of those who are not a whit more guilty than themselves ! The swinish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequenter of brothels  --  the arch hypocrite takes to task the open , undisguised sinner  --  and the rich , miserly old reprobate , whose wealth places him above the possibility of ever coming to want , who would sooner " hang the guiltless than eat his mutton cold , " and who would not bestow a cent upon a poor devil to keep him from starving  --  that old rascal , perhaps , in his capacity as a magistrate , sentences to jail an unfortunate man whom hunger has driven into the " crime " of stealing a loaf of bread ! Bah ! ladies and gentlemen , take the beams out of your own eyes before you allude to the motes in the optics of your fellow beings . That 's my advice , free of charge . On seeing her husband enter in that furious and threatening manner , Mrs. Romaine , overcome with fear and shame  --  for she well knew that her guilt had been detected  --  fell to the floor insensible . Anderson , confused and not knowing what to say , sat motionless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling anxiety , the issue of this most extraordinary state of affairs . Romaine was the first to break the silence , and he spoke in a tone of voice that was singularly calm considering his physical agitation . " Well , sir , " said he , addressing Anderson  --  " you are enjoying yourself finely  --  drinking my wine , devouring my provisions , and making love to my wife in her own bed-chamber . Anderson , for some time past I have suspected you and Harriet of being guilty of criminal intimacy . I have noticed your secret signs , and have read and interpreted the language of your eyes , whenever you and she have exchanged glances in my presence . You both took me to be a weak fool , too blind and imbecile to detect your adulterous intercourse ; but I have now come to convince you that I am a man capable of avenging his ruined conjugal honor ! " Anderson , recovering some degree of his usual self-possession , remarked , " Your accusation , sir , is unjust . Your wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to sup with her here to-night and that is all about it . If our intentions were criminal , would we have courted the presence of a third party ? " With these words , Anderson pointed towards me , but Romaine , without observing me at all , continued to address the paramour of his wife . " Anderson , you are a liar , and the falsehoods which you have uttered , only serve to increase your guilt , and confirm me in my resolution to sacrifice both you and that guilty woman who lies yonder . Can I disbelieve the evidence of my own eyes ? Must I go into particulars , and say that last night , at about this hour , in the kitchen  --  ha ! you turn pale  --  you tremble  --  your guilt is confessed . I would have killed you last night , Anderson , but I had not the weapons . This knife and pistol I purchased to-day , and I shall use them ! " Try and revive that harlot , for I would speak with her ere she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of Mrs. Romaine upon a sofa , he sprinkled water upon her face , and she was soon restored to a state of consciousness . For a few moments she gazed about her wildly ; and then , when her eyes settled upon her husband , and she saw the terrible weapons with which he was armed , she covered her face with her hands and trembled in an agony of terror , for she knew that her life was in the greatest possible danger . Romaine now addressed his wife in a tone of calmness which was , under the circumstances , far more terrible than the most violent outburst of passion : " Harriet , " said he  --  " I now fully comprehend your reasons for requesting to be allowed to occupy a separate apartment . You desired an opportunity to gratify your licentious propensities without any restraint . Woman , why have you used me thus ? Have I deserved this infamous treatment ? Have I ever used you unkindly , or spoken a harsh word to you ? Do you think that I will tamely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my brow ? Do you think that I will suffer myself to be made an object of scorn , and allow myself to be pointed at and ridiculed by a sneering community ? " " Forgive me , " murmured the unhappy wife  --  " I will not offend again . I acknowledge that I have committed a grievous sin ; but Heaven only knows how sincerely I repent of it ! " " Your repentance comes too late , " said Romaine , hoarsely  --  " Heaven may forgive you , but I shall not ! You say that you will not offend again . Having forever destroyed my happiness , my peace of mind , and my honor , you will not offend again ! You shall not have the opportunity , wretched woman . You shall no longer survive your infamy . You and the partner of your guilt must die ! " With these words , Romaine cocked his pistol and approached his wife , saying , in a low , savage tone that evinced the desperate purpose of his heart  --  " Take your choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by steel ? " The miserable woman threw herself upon her knees , exclaiming  --  " Mercy , husband  --  mercy ! Do not kill me , for I am not prepared to die ! " " You call me husband now  --  you , who have so long refused to receive me as a husband . Come  --  I am impatient to shed your blood , and that of your paramour . Breathe a short prayer to Heaven , for mercy and forgiveness , and then resign your body to death and your soul to eternity ! " So saying the desperate and half-crazy man raised on high the glittering knife . Poor Mrs. Romaine uttered a shriek , and , before she could repeat it , the knife descended with the swiftness of lightning , and penetrated her heart . Her blood spouted all over her white dress , and she sank down at the murderer 's feet , a lifeless corpse ! Paralyzed with horror , I could neither move nor speak . Anderson also stood motionless , like a bird which is subjected to the fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was placed , he seemed to be rooted to the spot and incapable of making a single effort to save himself by either resistance or flight . The scene was most extraordinary , thrilling and awful . The luxurious chamber  --  the failing lamp  --  the murderer , holding in his hand the bloody knife  --  the doomed Anderson , whose soul was quivering on the brink of the dread abyss of eternity ; all these combined to form a spectacle of the most strange and appalling character . Romaine now raised his pistol and took deliberate aim at Anderson , saying , " My work is but half done ; it is your turn now ! Are you ready ? " " Do not shoot me like a dog , " implored the unfortunate young man , who , to do him justice , possessed a considerable amount of courage  --  " give me , at least , some chance for my life . If I have wronged you , and I candidly confess that I have , I am ready to give you the satisfaction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal footing with yourself , and we will settle the matter as becomes men of honor . This boy , here , will be a witness of the affair . " To this proposition , Romaine scornfully replied , " I admire your assurance , sir .  --  After seducing the wife , you want a chance to shoot the husband . Well , as I am an accommodating man , it shall be as you say , for I am sick of life and care not if I am killed . But I have no other pistol . Stay !  --  suppose we toss up a coin , and thus decide which of us shall have this weapon , with the privilege of using it . Here is a quarter of a dollar ; I will throw it up in the air , and when it falls upon the floor , if the head is uppermost , the pistol is mine ; but if the tail is uppermost , the pistol shall be yours . I warn you that if I win , I shall show you no mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none from you . Do you agree to this ? " " I do , " replied Anderson , firmly , " and I thank you for your fairness . " Romaine threw up the coin , which spun around in the air and landed upon the carpet . How strange that it should have become the province of that insignificant coin to decide which of those two men must die ! Romaine calmly took the dim lamp from the table , and knelt down upon the carpet in a pool of his wife 's blood . " Watch me closely , and see that I do not touch the coin , " said he , as he bent eagerly over the life-deciding quarter of a dollar . How my heart beat at that moment , and what must have been the sensation of poor Anderson ! " The head is uppermost , and I have won ! " said Romaine , in a hoarse whisper  --  " come and see for yourself . " " I am satisfied , your word is sufficient , " said Anderson , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed to abandon himself to profound despair . Romaine 's pale face assumed an expression of savage delight , as he raised the pistol and pointed it at the head of his intended victim , saying  --  " Then , sir , nothing remains but for me to avail myself of the favor which fortune has conferred upon me . Young man , in five seconds I shall fire ! " " Hold ! " cried Anderson , " I have a favor to ask , which I am sure you will not refuse to grant me . Before I die , let me write a couple of letters , and make a few notes of the manner in which I wish my property to be disposed of . It is the last request of a dying man . " " It is granted , " said Romaine , " there , upon that escritoire , are writing materials . But make haste , for I am impatient to finish this disagreeable business . " Anderson sat down , and began to write rapidly . I longed to rush out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be averted ; but I feared that any movement on my part might result in the passage of a bullet through my brain , and therefore I remained quiet , for which I am sure , no sensible reader will blame me . Poor Anderson ! tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks while he was writing one of the letters , which , as I afterwards ascertained , was addressed to a young lady to whom he was engaged to be married . He wrote two letters , folded , sealed and directed them ; these he handed to me , saying  --  " Have the kindness to deliver these letters to the persons to whom they are addressed . Will you faithfully promise to do this ? " I promised , of course ; he shook hands with me , and bade me farewell ; then , calmly turning towards Romaine , he announced his readiness to die . Up to that moment , I had tried to persuade myself that Anderson 's life would be spared , thinking that Romaine must have had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was doomed to be terribly disappointed . Scarcely had Anderson muttered the words , " I am ready to die , " when Romaine pulled the trigger of the upraised pistol , and the young merchant fell dead upon the floor , the bullet having penetrated his brain . " Now I am satisfied , for I have had my revenge , " said the murderer , coolly , as he wiped the perspiration from his pallid brow . " Blood-thirsty villain ! " exclaimed I , unable longer to restrain my indignation  --  " you will swing upon the gallows for this night 's work ! " " Not so , " rejoined Romaine , calmly , " for I do not intend to survive this wholesale butchery , and did not , from the first . I was determined that Anderson should die , at all events . He won the pistol , for the coin fell with the tail uppermost . Had he stooped to examine it , I would have blown out his brains , just the same . But hark ! the boarders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the pistol , and they are hastening here . The gallows  --  no , no , I must avoid that ! They shall not take me alive . Now , may heaven have mercy upon my guilty soul ! " With these words the unhappy man seized the Bowie knife and plunged it into his heart , thus adding the crime of suicide to the two atrocious murders which he had just committed . Scarcely had this crowning point of the fearful tragedy been enacted , when a crowd of people , half-dressed and excited , rushed into the room . Among them was the beautiful widow , Mrs. Raymond . On seeing the bleeding corpse of Romaine stretched upon the floor , she gave utterance to a piercing scream and fell down insensible . In the horror and confusion that prevailed , I was unnoticed . I determined to leave the house , never to return , for I dreaded being brought before the public , as a witness , being a great hater of notoriety in any shape . ( The reader may smile at this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my frequent appearance before the public as a writer , has been the result of necessity  --  not of inclination . ) Accordingly , I left the house unobserved , and took lodgings for the remainder of the night at a hotel . But sleep visited me not , for my mind was too deeply engrossed with the bloody scenes which I had witnessed , to suffer the approach of " tired nature 's sweet restorer . " In the morning I arose early , and investigated the condition of my finances . The result of this examination was highly satisfactory , for I found that I was the possessor of a considerable sum of money . I walked about the city until noon , uncertain how to act . I felt a strong disposition to travel , and see the world ;  --  but I could not make up my mind in what direction to go . After a sumptuous dinner at Sandy Welch 's " Terrapin Lunch , "  --  one of the most famous restaurants of the day  --  I indulged in a contemplative walk up Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " I can not help contrasting my present situation with the position I was in , three years ago . Then I was almost penniless , and gladly breakfasted on dry bread at a street pump ; now I have three hundred dollars in my pocket , and have just dined like an epicurean prince . Then I was clad in garments that were coarse and cheap ; now I am dressed in the finest raiment that money could procure . Then I had no trade ; now I have a profession which will be to me an unfailing means of support . But , alas ! then I was comparatively innocent , and ignorant of the wicked ways of the world ; now , although only fifteen years of age , I am too thoroughly posted up on all the mysteries of city follies and vices . No matter : there 's nothing like experience , after all . " Comforting myself with this philosophical reflection , I strolled on . A newsboy came along , bawling out , at the top of his voice  --  " Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two murders and suicide in William street last night  --  only one cent ! " Of course I purchased a copy ; and , upon perusing the account , I could not help smiling at the ludicrous and absurd exaggerations which it contained . It was a perfect modern tragedy of Othello , with Romaine as the Moor , Mrs. Romaine as Desdemona , and Anderson as a sort of cross between Iago and Michael Cassio . I was not alluded to in any way whatever , which caused me to rejoice exceedingly . D Suddenly remembering the two letters which had been confided to my care by the unfortunate Anderson , I resolved to deliver them immediately . One was directed to a Mr. Sargent , in Pine street . I soon found the place , which was a large mercantile establishment . Over the door was the sign " Anderson &amp; Sargent . " This had been poor Anderson 's place of business , and Sargent had been his partner . I entered , found Mr. Sargent in the counting-room , and delivered to him the letter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , and said  --  " I have already been made acquainted with the full particulars of this melancholy affair . Anderson was a clever fellow , and I 'm sorry he 's gone , although his death will certainly promote my interests . He gives me , in this letter , every necessary instruction as to the disposition of his property , and he also directs me to present you with the sum of two hundred dollars , both as an acknowledgement of your services and as a token of his friendship . I will fill out a check for the amount immediately . " This instance of Anderson 's kindness and generosity , almost at the very moment of his death , deeply affected me ; and , at the same time , I could not help feeling disgusted with the heartlessness displayed by Sargent , who regarded the tragical death of his partner merely as an event calculated to advance his own interests . Having received the check , I withdrew from the august presence of Mr. Sargent , who was a tall , thin , hook-nosed personage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money at the bank , and then hastened to deliver the other letter , which was addressed to Miss Grace Arlington , whose residence was designated as being situated in one of the fashionable squares up-town . I had no difficulty in finding the house , which was of the most elegant and aristocratic appearance . My appeal to the doorbell was responded to by a smart-looking female domestic , who , on learning my errand , ushered me into the presence of her mistress . Miss Grace Arlington was a very lovely and delicate young lady , whose soft eyes beamed with tenderness and sensibility , whose voice was as sweet as the music of an angel 's harp , while her step was as light as the tread of a fairy whose tiny feet will not crush the leaves of a rose . When I handed her the letter , and she recognized the well known handwriting , she bestowed upon me a winning and grateful smile which I shall never forget . My heart misgave me as she opened the missive , for I could well divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messenger of such evil tidings . I watched her closely as she read . She was naturally somewhat pale , but I saw her face grow ghastly white before she had read two lines . When she had finished the perusal of the fatal letter , she pressed her hand upon her breast , murmured " Oh God ! " and would have fallen to the floor if I had not caught her in my arms . " Curses on my stupidity ! " I muttered , as I placed her insensible form upon a sofa  --  " I ought to have prepared her gradually for the terrible announcement which I knew that letter to contain ! " I rang the bell furiously , and the almost deafening summons was answered by half-a-dozen female servants , who , on seeing the condition of their young Mistress , set up a loud chorus of screams . The uproar brought Mr. Arlington , the father of the young lady , to the scene . He was a fine-looking old gentleman , a retired merchant and a millionaire . I hastened to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , which lay upon the floor , confirmed my statements . Mr. Arlington was horror-struck , for he , as well as his daughter , had until that moment been in happy ignorance of the bloody affair . The old gentleman had first established Anderson in business , and he had always cherished for that unfortunate young man the warmest friendship . No wonder , then , that he was overpowered when he became aware of the tragical end of him whom he had expected so shortly to become his son-in-law . A celebrated physician , who resided next door , was sent for . He happened to be at home , and arrived almost instantly . He knelt down beside the broken-hearted girl , and , as his fingers touched her wrist , a look of profound grief settled upon his benevolent face . " Well , Doctor , " exclaimed Mr. Arlington , breathlessly , " what is the matter with my child ? She will recover soon , will she not ? It is merely a fainting fit produced by the reception of unwelcome news . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tone of deep sympathy , as he brushed away the tears from his eyes  --  " I may as well tell you the melancholy truth at once . The sudden shock caused by the unwelcome news you speak of , has proved fatal ; your daughter is dead ! " Poor old Arlington staggered to a seat , covered his face with his hands , and moaned in the agony of his spirits . Notwithstanding all his wealth , how I pitied him ! Seeing that I could be of no service whatever , I left the house of mourning and walked down town in a very thoughtful mood . I had already begun to enter upon an experience such as few youths of fifteen are ever called upon to encounter ; and I wondered what the dim , uncertain Future had in store for me . However , as the reader will see in the next chapter , I did not long suffer my mind to be intruded upon by melancholy reflections . FOOTNOTES : D Many of my New York readers will remember the " William Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody event created the most intense excitement at the time of its occurrence . Having witnessed the horrible affair , I have truly related all the facts concerning it . CHAPTER IV In which I set forth upon my travels , and met with a great misfortune . Having plenty of means at my disposal , I determined to enjoy myself to the full extent of my physical and intellectual capacity , for I remembered the graceful words of the charming poet who sung  --  " Go it while you 're young : For , when you get old , you ca n't ! " Behold me , at the age of fifteen , fairly launched upon all the dissipations of a corrupt and licentious city ! It is not without a feeling of shame that I make these confessions ; but truth compels me to do so . I soon became thoroughly initiated into all the mysteries of high and low life in New York . In my daily and nightly peregrinations I frequently encountered my old friend Jack Slack ; we never spoke , but on the contrary regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stronger within me grew the presentiment that this mysterious youth was destined to become my evil genius and the cause of a great misfortune . Therefore , whenever I met him , I could not help shuddering with dread . Three years passed away in this manner , and I had reached the age of eighteen , with an unimpaired constitution and a firm belief that I was destined to exist for ever . I had lived luxuriously upon the earnings of my pen , for I was a regular contributor to the Knickerbroker Magazine and other popular periodicals . Having accumulated considerable money , notwithstanding my extravagance , I resolved to take a Southern tour , visiting Philadelphia , Washington , and other cities of note . Accordingly , one fine day , I found myself established in comfortable quarters , at the most fashionable hotel in the " city of brotherly love . " I became a regular frequenter of the theatres and other places of amusement , and formed the acquaintance of many actors and literary people . It was here that I had the honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ; to " Ned Forrest , " the American favorite ; to " Uncle " J.R . Scott , as fine a man as ever drank a noggin of ale or ate a " dozen raw , " and to Major Richardson , the author of " Wacousta , " and the " Monk Knight of St. John , " the latter being one of the most voluptuous works ever written . Poor Major ! his was a melancholy end . He was formerly a Major in the British army , and was a gentleman by birth , education and principle . Possessing a fine person , a generous heart and the most winning manners , he was a general favorite with his associates . He became the victim of rapacious publishers , and grew poor . Too proud to accept of assistance from his friends , he retired to obscure lodgings and there endeavored to support himself by the productions of his pen . But his spirit was broken and his intellect crushed by the base ingratitude of those who should have been his warmest friends . Often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied one ; and , with a bottle of whiskey before us , we have condemned the world as being full of selfishness , ingratitude and villainy . Winter came on , and the Major had no fuel , nor the means of procuring any . I have repeatedly called upon him and found him sitting in the intensely cold atmosphere of his miserable apartment , wrapped in a blanket and busily engaged in writing with a hand that was blue and trembled with the cold . He firmly refused to receive aid , in any shape , from his friends ; and they were obliged to witness his gradual decay with sad hearts . The gallant Major always persisted in denying that he needed anything ; he swore his garret was the most comfortable place in the world , and that the introduction of a fire would have been preposterous ; he always affirmed with a round military oath , that he " lived like a fighting-cock , " and was never without his bottle of wine at dinner ; yet I once came upon him rather unexpectedly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red herring . Sometimes , but rarely , he appeared at the theatres , and , upon such occasions , he was always scrupulously well-dressed , for Major Richardson would never appear abroad otherwise than as a gentleman . Want , privation and disappointment finally conquered him ; he grew thin , and haggard , and melancholy , and reserved , and discouraged the visits of his friends who used to love to assemble at his humble lodgings and avail themselves of his splendid conversational powers , or listen to his personal reminiscences and racy anecdotes of military life . One morning he was found dead in his bed ; and his death caused the most profound grief in the breasts of all who knew him as he deserved to be known , and who respected him for his many excellent qualities of head and heart . His remains received a handsome and appropriate burial ; and many a tear was shed o'er the grave of him who had been a gallant soldier and a celebrated author , but a truly wronged and most unfortunate man . The reader will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anxious to do justice to the memory of a much-valued friend and literary brother . I now resume the direct course of my narrative , and come to the darkest portion of my career . One night , in a billiard room , I had a very unpleasant encounter with an old acquaintance . I observed , at one of the tables , a young man whose countenance seemed strangely familiar to me , although I did not immediately recognize him . He was dressed in the extreme of fashion , and his upper lip was darkened by an incipient moustache  --  the result , doubtless , of many months of industrious cultivation . A cigar was in his mouth , and a billiard-cue was in his hand ; and he profusely adorned his conversation with the most extravagant oaths . Altogether , he seemed to be a very " fast " young man ; and I puzzled my brain in endeavoring to remember where I had met him before . Suddenly , he raised his eyes , and their gaze encountered mine ; then I wondered that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slack ! " This fellow is my evil genius ; he follows me everywhere , " thought I , turning to leave the saloon . Would to heaven that I had never entered it ! But regrets are useless now . Jack stepped after me , and detained me . I instantly saw that trouble was about to come . " Greenhorn , " said Jack , with an air of angry reproach , as he laid his hand upon my shoulder  --  " why do you so continually avoid me ? What in the devil 's name have I ever done to deserve this treatment ? Have I ever injured you in any way ? Damn it , we are equal in age , and in disposition  --  let us be friends . I can put you in a way , in this city , to enjoy the tallest kind of sport . Give me your hand , and let 's go up to the bar and take a social drink . " " Jack , " said I , seriously and very calmly  --  " I will shake hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not like you ; and I believe that it will be better for us both not to associate together at all . Observe me !  --  I have no hard feelings against you ;  --  you are a clever fellow , and generous to a fault ; but something whispers to me that we must not be companions , and I therefore respectfully desire you not to speak to me again . Good night . " E I turned to go , but Jack placed himself directly in my path , and said , in a voice that was hoarse with passion  --  " Stay and hear me . We must not part in this way . Do you think that I will tamely submit to be cut in a manner so disgraceful ? Do you think that I am going to remain the object of an unfounded and ridiculous prejudice ? Explain yourself , and apologize , or by G  --   --  , it will be the worse for you ! " " Explain myself  --  apologize ! " I scornfully repeated  --  " you are a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me go . " " No ! " passionately screamed my enraged antagonist , who was somewhat intoxicated  --  " you must stay and hear me out . I may as well throw off the mask at once . Know , then , that I hate you like hell-fire , and that , the very first time I saw you , I resolved to make you as bad as myself . Therefore did I induce you to drink , and visit disreputable places . The cool contempt with which you have always treated me , had increased my hatred ten-fold . I thirst for vengeance , and I 'll fix you yet ! " " Do your worst , " said I , contemptuously ; and again did I essay to take my departure . Meanwhile , during the quarrel , the frequents of the saloon had gathered around and appeared to enjoy the scene highly . " If he has given you any cause of offence , Jack , why do n't you pitch into him ? " suggested a half-drunken fellow who bore the enviable reputation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion , and struck me with all his force . I of course returned the blow , with very tolerable effect .  --  Had the row commenced and terminated in mere fisticuffs all would have been well , and I should not now be called upon to write down the details of a bloody tragedy . Drawing a dirk-knife from his breast , Jack attacked me with the utmost fury . I then did what any other person , situated as I was , would have done  --  I acted in my own defence . " Self-defence " is universally acknowledged to be the " first law of nature . " There was I , a stranger , savagely attacked by a young man armed with a dangerous weapon , and surrounded by his friends and associates  --  a desperate set , who seemed disposed to assist in the task of demolishing me . I quickly drew from my pocket a pistol , without which , at that time , I never travelled . Before , however , I could cock and level it , my infuriated enemy dashed his dirk-knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . It was fortunate that the weapon did not penetrate the brain , and cause my instant death . Maddened by the horrible pain which I suffered , and believing myself to be mortally wounded , I raised the pistol and discharged it . Jack Slack fell to the floor , a corpse , his head being shattered to pieces . I never regretted the act . A cry of horror and dismay burst from the lips of all present , on witnessing this dreadful but justifiable deed of retribution . " Gentlemen , " said I , as the blood was trickling down my face  --  " I call upon you all to witness that I slew this young man in self-defence . He drove me to commit the deed , and I could not avoid it . I am willing and anxious to abide the decision of a jury of my countrymen ; therefore , send for an officer , and I will voluntarily surrender myself into his custody . " Scarcely had I uttered these words , when the excruciating torment which I suffered caused me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a prison-cell , with a bandage over my damaged optic , and a physician feeling my pulse . " Ah ! " said I , looking around , " I am in limbo , I see . Well , I do not fear the result . But , doctor , am I seriously injured  --  am I likely to kick the bucket ? " " Not at all , " was the doctor 's encouraging reply  --  " but you have lost the sight of your eye . " " Oh , is that all ? " said I with a laugh  --  " well , I believe that it is said in the Bible somewhere , that it is better to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to go to the devil with two . " The physician departed for his home , and I departed for the land of dreams . The pain of my wound had considerably mitigated , and I slept quite comfortably . I have always been somewhat of a philosopher in the way of enduring the ills of life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with as good a grace as possible . In this I succeeded much better than might have been expected . When a person loses an eye and is at the same time imprisoned for killing another individual , it is certainly natural for that unfortunate person to yield to despair ; but , seeing the uselessness of grief , I resolved to " face the music " with all the courage of which I was possessed . Two or three days passed away , and I became almost well  --  for , to use a common expression , I owned the constitution of a horse . The newspapers which I was allowed to send out and purchase , made me acquainted with something that rather surprised me , for they communicated to me the information that Jack Slack , the young gentleman to whom I had presented a ticket of admission to the other world , was a person whose real name was John Shaffer , alias Slippery Jack , alias Jack Slack . His profession was that of a pickpocket , in which avocation he had always been singularly expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been frequently imprisoned . I was gratified to see that the newspapers all justified me in what I had done , and predicted my honorable discharge from custody . That prediction proved correct ; for , after I had been in confinement a week , the Grand Jury failed to bring a bill of indictment against me , and I was consequently set at liberty . Tired of Philadelphia , I went to Washington . A New York member of Congress , with whom I was well acquainted , volunteered to show me the " lions ; " and I had the honor of a personal introduction to Mr. Van Buren and other distinguished official personages . Some people would be surprised if they did but know of the splendid dissipation that prevails among the " dignitaries of the nation " at Washington . I have seen more than one member of the United States Senate staggering through the streets , from what cause the reader will have no difficulty in judging . I have seen a great statesman , since deceased , carried from an after-dinner table to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National departments engaged in a brawl in a brothel . I have seen Representatives fighting in a bar-room like so many rowdies , and I have heard them use language that would disgrace a beggar in his drink . I need not allude to the many outrageous scenes which have been enacted in the councils of the nation ; for the newspapers have already given them sufficient publicity . Leaving Washington , I journeyed South , and , after many adventures which the limits of this work will not permit me to describe , I arrived in the City of New Orleans . I had no difficulty in procuring a lucrative situation as reporter on a popular daily newspaper ; and enjoyed free access to all the theatres and other places of amusement .  --  I remained in New Orleans just one year ; but , not liking the climate ,  --  and finding , moreover , that I was living too " fast , " and accumulating no money ,  --  I resolved to " pull up stakes " and start in a Northerly direction . Accordingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for me had I remained in New Orleans , for the hardest kind of times prevailed in the " Quaker City , " on my arrival there . It was almost impossible to obtain employment of any description ; and many actors , authors and artists , as well as mechanics , were most confoundedly " hard up . " I soon exhausted the contents of my purse ; and , like the Prodigal Son , " began to be in want . " One fine day , in a very disconsolate mood , I was wandering through an obscure street , when I encountered a former lady acquaintance , whom , I trust , the reader has not forgotten . But the particulars of that unexpected encounter , and the details of what subsequently transpired , are worthy of a separate chapter . FOOTNOTES : E It is singular , but it is true , that a few nights prior to the tragical occurrences which I am about to relate , I saw , in a dream , a perfect and exact fore-shadow of the whole melancholy affair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady acquaintance , and , like a knight errant of old , became the champion of beauty . A musical voice pronounced my name ; and looking up , I saw a very handsome woman seated at the window of a rather humble wooden tenement , the first floor of which was occupied as a cheap grocery . I immediately recognised my old acquaintance , Mrs. Raymond , the pretty widow of the fashionable boarding-house in William street , New York  --  she who had carried on an intrigue with Mr. Romaine . I have , in a former chapter , described the terrible affair in which Romaine slew his wife and Anderson her paramour  --  and then killed himself . I need scarcely say that this encounter with Mrs. Raymond , under such peculiar circumstances , rather astonished me . I had known her as a lady of wealth , and the most elegant and fastidious tastes ; and yet here I found her living in an obscure and disreputable portion of the city , and occupying a house which none but the victims of poverty would ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and conduct you up stairs , " said Mrs. Raymond ; and she disappeared from the window . In a few moments she opened the door leading to the upper part of the house ; and having warmly shaken hands with me , she desired me to follow her . I complied , and was shown into an apartment on the second floor . " This is my room , and my only one ; do n't laugh at it , " said Mrs. Raymond , with a melancholy smile . I looked around me . The room was small , but scrupulously clean ; and , notwithstanding the scantiness and humility of the furniture , a certain air of refinement prevailed . I have often remarked that it is impossible for a person who has been accustomed to the elegancies of life , to become so low , in fortune or character , as to entirely lose every trace of former superiority . " You may break , you may ruin the vase , if you will , But the scent of the roses will cling ' round it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine table , two or three common chairs , a closet , a bed , and a harp  --  the relic of better and happier days . The uncarpeted floor was almost as white as snow  --  and certainly no snow could be purer or whiter than the drapery of her unpretending couch . We sat down  --  I and my beautiful hostess  --  and entered into earnest conversation . I examined the lady with attention . She had lost none of her former radiant beauty , and I fancied that a shade of melancholy rather enhanced her charms . Her dress was coarse and plain , but very neat , like everything else around her . Never before , in the course of my rather extensive experience , had I beheld a more interesting and fascinating woman ; and never shall I forget that day , as we sat together in her little room , with the soft sunlight of a delightful May afternoon pouring in through the windows . " It haunts me still , though many a year has fled , Like some wild melody . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her words with a look of the deepest sympathy , " I see that you have met with a great misfortune . Pardon me , if  --  " " You shall know all , " said I ; and then I proceeded to make her acquainted with all that had happened to me since the occurrence of the William street tragedy . Of course , I did not omit to give her the full particulars of my fatal affray with Jack Slack , as that accounted for the " great misfortune " to which she had alluded . When I had finished my narration , the lady sighed deeply and said  --  " Ah , my friend , we have both been made the victims of cruel misfortune . You see me to-day penniless and destitute ; I , formerly so rich , courted and admired . Have you the time and patience to listen to my melancholy story ? " I eagerly answered in the affirmative ; and Mrs. Raymond spoke as follows :  --  " After that terrible affair in William street  --  the recollection of which still curdles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a private family at the lower end of Broadway . I soon formed the acquaintance of a gentleman of fine appearance , and agreeable address , named Livingston , who enjoyed the enviable reputation of being a person of wealth and a man of honor . I was pleased with him , and noticing my partiality , he made violent love to me . Tired of living the life of a single woman  --  desirous of securing a protection , and wishing to become an honorable wife instead of a mistress  --  I did not reject him , for he moved in the very highest circles , and seemed to be in every way unobjectionable . I will not weary you with the details of our courtship ; suffice it to say that we were married . We took an elegant house in one of the up-town avenues ; and , for a time , all went well . After a while , I discovered that my husband had no fortune whatever ; but I loved him too well to reproach him  --  and besides , he had never represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the circle in which he moved which had bestowed upon him that reputation . Also , I considered that my fortune was sufficient for us both . Therefore , the discovery of his poverty did not in the least diminish my regard for him . It was not long before the extensive demands which he kept constantly making upon my purse , alarmed me ; I feared that he had fallen into habits of gambling ; and I ventured to remonstrate with him upon his extravagance . He confessed his fault , entreated my forgiveness , and promised amendment . Of course , I forgave him ; for a loving wife can forgive anything in her husband but infidelity . But he did not reform ; he continued his ruinous career ; and my fortune melted away like snow beneath the rays of the sun . The man possessed such an irresistible influence over me , that I never could refuse an application on his part for money . I believed that he sincerely loved me , and that was enough for me  --  I asked for no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage . ' " At length my fortune was all gone  --  irrevocably gone . ' No matter , ' I thought  --  ' I have still my dear husband left ; nothing can ever take him away from me . I will share poverty with him , and we shall be happy together . ' We gave up our splendid mansion , and sold our magnificent furniture , and rented a small but respectable house . And now my blood boils to relate how that villain Livingston served me  --  for he was a villain , a cool , deliberate , black-hearted one . He deserted me , carrying off with him what little money and the few jewels I still possessed , thus leaving me entirely destitute . But what added to my affliction ,  --  nay , I should rather say my maddening rage , was a note which the base scoundrel had written and left behind him , in which he mockingly begged to be excused for his absence , and stated that he had other wives to attend to in other cities . ' I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every word of which is branded upon my heart as with a pen of fire  --  ' I never loved you , and my only object in marrying you was to enjoy your fortune ; I have no further use for you . It may console you to know that the principal portion of the large sums of money which you gave me from time to time , was applied , not as you imagined to the payment of gambling debts , but to the support of two voluptuous mistresses of mine , whom I kept in separate establishments that were furnished with almost regal splendor . Thus did you unconsciously contribute to the existence of two rivals , who received a greater share of my attentions than you did . In conclusion , as you are now without resources , I would advise you to sell your charms to the highest bidder . There are many wealthy and amorous gentlemen in New York , who will pay you handsomely for your smiles and kisses . I shall not be jealous of their attentions to my sixth wife ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yours truly , LIVINGSTON . ' Thus wrote the accursed wretch , for whom I had sacrificed everything  --  fortune , position in society , and friends ; for who among my fashionable acquaintances , would associate with an impoverished and deserted wife ? Not one . Furious at Livingston 's treatment of me , I resolved to follow him , even unto the end of the earth , in order to avenge my wrongs . By careful inquiry , I learned that he had taken his departure for the western part of the state of Pennsylvania . You will hardly credit it , but it is God 's truth , that being without money to pay travelling expenses , I actually set out on foot , and travelled through New Jersey until I reached this city . I subsisted on the road by soliciting the hospitality of the farmers , which was in most cases grudgingly and scantily bestowed , for benevolence is not a prominent characteristic of the New Jersey people , F and besides , there was certainly something rather suspicious in the idea of a well-dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival here in Philadelphia , I found myself worn out and exhausted by the fatiguing journey which I had performed . Having called upon some kind Quaker ladies of whose goodness I had often heard , I told them my sad history , which aroused their warmest sympathies . They placed me in this apartment , paid a month 's rent in advance , purchased for me the articles of furniture which you see , and obtained for me some light employment . I worked industriously , and almost cheerfully , my object being to earn money enough to carry me to Pittsburg , in Western Pennsylvania , where , I have reason to believe , the villain has located himself . " In my moments of leisure , I longed for some means of recreation ; for I saw no company , and was very lonesome . So I wrote on to New York , and through the agency of a kind friend , had my harp sent out to me here , the rest of my poor furniture being presented to that friend . Then did the divine charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance rather discouraged me : I found that with the utmost industry I could not earn more than sufficient to pay my rent and other necessary expenses , although I lived frugally , almost on bread and water , except on Sundays , when I would manage to treat myself to a cup of tea . You may smile at these trifling details , my dear friend , but I mention them to show you the hardships and privations to which poor women are often exposed . My landlady , who keeps the grocery store down stairs , is a coarse , vulgar , hard-hearted woman ; and , when I was thrown out of employment in consequence of the hardness of the times , and could not pay her rent , she not only abused me dreadfully , but annoyed me by making the most infamous suggestions , proposing that I should embrace a life of prostitution , and offering to procure me plenty of ' patrons . ' I , of course , indignantly repelled the horrible proposals  --  but , would you believe it ? she actually introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a purpose which you can easily imagine . The old villain , however , decamped when I displayed a small dagger , and declared that I would kill myself rather than become his victim . This conduct of mine still further incensed my landlady against me ; and I expect every moment to be turned out into the street . It is true that I might raise a small sum of money by the sale of my harp , which is a very superior instrument , but as it was the gift of my first husband , I can not endure the thought of parting with it , for there are associated with it some of the fondest recollections of my life . I am sure that if those kind Quaker ladies had known the character of this house and the neighborhood around it , they would not have placed me here . Heaven only knows what I have suffered , and still suffer . I live in constant dread that some ruffian , instigated by my landlady , who wishes to gratify both her avarice and malignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my guard , and make me the victim of a brutal outrage . This fear keeps me awake nights , and makes my days miserable . Nor is this all ; I have not tasted food since the day before yesterday . " " Good God ! " I exclaimed  --  " is it possible ? Oh , accursed be the circumstances which have made us both so misfortunate ; and doubly accursed be that scoundrel Livingston , the author of all your sorrows . By heavens ! I will seek him out , and terribly punish him for his base conduct towards you . Yes , my dear Mrs. Raymond  --  for such I shall continue to call you , notwithstanding your marriage to that monster Livingston  --  rest assured that your wrongs shall be avenged .  --  The villain shall rue the day when he made a play-thing of a woman 's heart , robbed her of her fortune , and then left her to poverty and despair ! " This language of mine may seem rather theatrical and romantic ; but the reader will please to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of its utterance  --  a period of life not remarkable for sobriety of language or discretion of conduct . Were that interview to take place to-day , I should probably thus express myself :  --  " My dear Mrs. Raymond , I advise you to forget the d  --   --  d rascal and put on the tea-kettle , while I rush out and negotiate for some grub ! " Mrs. Raymond gratefully pressed my hand , and said  --  " I thank you for thus espousing my cause ;  --  but , my dear friend , mine must be the task of punishing the villain . No other hand but mine shall strike the blow that will send his black , polluted soul into eternity ! " These fierce words , which were pronounced with the strongest emphasis , caused me to look at my fair hostess with some degree of astonishment ; and no wonder  --  for the quiet , elegant lady had been suddenly transferred into the enraged and revenge-thirsting woman . She looked superbly beautiful at that moment ;  --  her cheeks glowed , her eyes sparkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy sea . " Well , " said I  --  " we will discuss that matter hereafter . Have the goodness to excuse my absence for a few minutes . I have a little errand to perform . " She smiled , for she knew the nature of my errand . I went down stairs and walked up the street , in the greatest perplexity ; for  --  let me whisper it into your ear , reader , I had not a sufficient amount of the current coin of the realm in my pockets to create a gingle upon a tomb-stone . " What the devil shall I do ? " said I to myself  --  " here I have constituted myself the champion and protector of a hungry lady , and have n't enough money to purchase a salt herring ! Shall I show up my satin waistcoat ? No , d  --   --  n it , that wo n't do , for I must keep up appearances . Ca n't I borrow a trifle from some of my friends ? No , curse them , they are all as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll test the benevolence of some gospel-wrestler , and borrow the devil 's impudence for the occasion . " I walked rapidly into a more fashionable quarter of the city , looking attentively at every door-plate . At last I saw the name , " Reverend Phineas Porkley . " G That was enough . Without a moment 's hesitation I mounted the steps and rang the bell savagely . The door was opened by a fat old flunkey with a red nose of an alarming aspect . I rushed by him into the hall , dashed my hat recklessly upon the table , and shouted  --  " Where 's Brother Porkley ? Show me to him instantly ! Do n't dare say he 's out , for I know that he 's at home ! It 's a matter of life and death ! Woman dying  --  children starving  --  and the devil to pay generally . Wake Snakes , you fat porpoise , and conduct me to your master ! " The flunkey 's red nose grew pale with astonishment and fear ; yet he managed to stammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , sir  --  Mr. Porkley , sir  --  he 's at home , certainly , sir  --  in his library , sir  --  writing his next Sunday 's sermons , sir  --  ca n't see any one , sir  --  " " Catiff , conduct me to his presence ! " I exclaimed , in a deep voice , after the manner of the dissatisfied brigand who desires to " mub " the false duke in his own ancestral halls . Not daring to disobey , the trembling flunkey led the way up one flight of stairs and pointed to a door , which I abruptly opened . There , in his library , sat Brother Porkley , a monstrously fat man with a pale , oily face that contained about as much expression as the surface of a cheese . But how was Brother Porkley engaged when I intruded upon him ? Was he writing a sermon , or attentively perusing some good theological work ? Neither . Oh , then perhaps the excellent man was at prayer . Wrong again . He was merely smoking a short pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensible man  --  for is it not better to take one 's comfort than to play the part of a hypocrite ? I think so . " My dear Brother Porkley , " cried I , rushing forward and grasping the astonished parson by the hand , which I shook with tremendous violence , " I come on a mission of Charity and Love ! I come as a messenger of Benevolence ! I come as a dove of Peace with the olive branch in my claw ! Porkley , greatest philanthropist of the age , come down , for suffering humanity requires your assistance ! " " What do you mean , sir ? " demanded the reverend Falstaff , as he vainly strove to extricate his hand from my affectionate grasp , " who are you and what do you want ? " " Brother , " said I , in a broken voice , as I dashed an imaginary tear from the tip end of my nose , " in the next street there dwells a poor but pious family , consisting of a widow woman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , one hundred feet below the surface of the earth , in the midst of darkness , horror and bull-frogs , which animals they are compelled to eat in a raw state , in order to exist . Yes sir ! " " But what is all this to me ? " " Much , sir , you are a Christian  --  a clergyman  --  and a trump . If you do not assist that distressed family , your reputation for benevolence will not be worth the first red cent . Those children are howling for food  --  bull-frogs being scarce  --  and that fond mother is dying of small-pox . " " Small-pox ! " " Yes sir ! I have attended her during the last five nights , and fear that I am infected with the disease ; but I am willing to lose my life in the holy cause of charity . " " Good God , sir ! You will communicate the disease to me ! Let go my hand , sir , and leave this house before you load the air with pestilence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaving until you have done something for the relief of that distressed widow and her twelve small children . " " D  --   --  n the distressed widow and  --  bless my soul ! what am I saying ? My good young man , what will satisfy you ? " " Five dollars , reverend sir . " " Here , then , here is the money . Now go , go quickly . Every moment that you remain here is pregnant with evil . Pray make haste ! " " But wo n't you come and pray with the distressed widow and her  --  " " No ! If I do may I be  --  blessed ! Will you go ! " " I 'm off , old Porkhead ! " With these words I bolted out of the library , stumbled over a corpulent cat that was quietly reposing on the landing , descended the stairs in two leaps , upset the fat flunkey in the hall , and gained the street in safety with my booty  --  a five dollar city bill . I hastened back towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating-saloon on the way and loaded myself with provisions ready cooked . I did not forget to purchase two bottles of excellent wine . Thus provided , I entered the apartment of Mrs. Raymond , who received me with a smile of gratitude and joy which I shall never forget . We sat down to the table with sharp appetites , and did full justice to the repast , which was really most excellent . The wine raised our spirits , and , forgetting our misfortunes , merrily did we chat about old times in New York , carefully omitting the slightest allusion to the bloody affair in William street . When we had finished one bottle , Mrs. Raymond favored me with an air upon her harp , which she played with exquisite skill . After executing a brilliant Italian waltz , she played and sang that plaintive song : " The light of other days have faded , And all their glory 's past . " Just as the song was finished , there came a loud knocking at the door . " It is my landlady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal yourself , and you will see how she treats me . " I stepped into the closet ; but through a crevice in the door I could see all that transpired . A fat , vulgar-looking woman entered with a consequential air , and a face inflamed by drink , gave her a peculiarly repulsive appearance . Of course she was utterly unconscious of my presence in the house . Taking up her position in the middle of the apartment , she placed her hands upon her hips , and said , in a hoarse and angry voice  --  " Come up out o ' that ! You 're a pretty one to be playing and singing , when you owe me for two months ' rent . You have been feasting , too , I see . Where did you get the money ? Why did n't you pay it to me ? Have you any money left ? " " No I have not . " " Come up out o ' that ! Why the devil do n't you sell that humstrum of yours , that harp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring a good ten dollars , I 'll be sworn . And why do n't you take my advice and earn money as other women do ? You are handsome , the men would run after you like mad . That nice , rich old gentleman , Mr. Letcher , that I brought to see you , would have given you any amount of money if you had only treated him kindly  --  but you frightened him away . Come up out o ' that ! Now , what do you mean to do ? I ca n't let you stay here any longer unless you raise some money . This evening I 'll fetch another nice gentleman here ; and if you cut up any of your tantrums with him , I 'll bundle you out into the street this very night . " " If you bring any man here to molest me , " said Mrs. Raymond , spiritedly  --  " I will stab him to the heart , and then kill myself . " " Come out o ' that , " screamed the landlady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think to frighten me with your tragical airs . I must have my money , and so I 'll take this harp and sell it , in spite of you ! " She seized upon the instrument and was about to carry it off , when I rushed forth from my place of concealment , exclaiming  --  " Come up out o ' that ! Drop that instrument , you old harridan , or I 'll drop you ! Do not imagine that this lady is entirely friendless . I am here to protect her . " The astounded landlady put down the harp and began to mutter many apologies , for I was extremely well dressed , and she probably believed me to be some person of consequence who had become the protector and patron of Mrs. Raymond . " Oh , sir  --  I 'm sure , sir  --  I did n't mean , sir  --  if I had known , sir  --  I beg a thousand pardons , sir  --  " " Come up out o ' that ! " cried I , " leave the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was rather remarkable , considering her extreme corpulence . After a short pause , Mrs. Raymond said to me  --  " You see to what abuse my circumstances subject me . " " Would to God my circumstances were such as to render you that assistance you so much need ; would that I could raise you from such unendurable misery ! But to speak without equivocation , my condition is as penniless as your own . " " Then you can , indeed , sympathize with my distress . " " Most sincerely ; but you must not go alone in quest of that villainous husband ;  --  and money will be necessary . " " This harp will  --  " " Oh , no  --  you can never part with it . " " I must . " " Then let it be but temporarily . There is a pawnbroker 's shop on the next square , there we can redeem it  --  if you can for a time endure to have it removed from your sight . " " No matter , " said my heroine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is in pursuit of vengeance . The weather is delicious ; we will travel leisurely , and have a very pleasant time . Should our money become exhausted , we will solicit the hospitality of the good old Pennsylvania farmers , who are renowned for their kindness to travellers , and who will not refuse a bite and a sup , or a night 's shelter , to two poor wanderers . If you refuse to accompany me , I will go alone . " " I will go with you to the end of the earth ! " I exclaimed , with enthusiasm , for I could not help admiring the noble courage of that beautiful woman , whose splendid countenance now glowed with all the animation of anticipated vengeance . She pressed my hand warmly , in acknowledgement of my devotion ; and then , having put on her bonnet and shawl , she announced herself as being in readiness to set out . " I have no valuables of any kind , " said she , " and the landlady is welcome to this furniture , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this house no more . " I shouldered the harp , and we left the house without encountering the amiable landlady . To reach the nearest pawnbroker 's , it was necessary to pass through one of the principal streets . To my dismay a crowd of actors , reporters and others were assembled upon the steps of a hotel . The rascals spied me out before I could cross over ; and so , putting on as bold a front as possible , I walked on pretending not to notice them , while a " running commentary , " something like the following , was kept up until I was out of hearing : " Stag his knibbs , " H said the " heavy man " of the Arch street theatre . " Thompson , give us a tune ! " bawled out a miserable wretch of a light comedian , or " walking gentleman . " " Jem Baggs , the Wandering Minstrel , by G  --   --  ! " yelled a pitiful demon of a newspaper reporter . " Who is that magnificent woman accompanying him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surveying my fair companion with an admiring gaze . " Egad ! she 's a beauty ! " cried all the fellows , in a chorus . Mrs. Raymond blushed and smiled . It was evident that these expressions of admiration were not displeasing to her . " Excuse those gentlemen , " said I to her , apologetically  --  " they are all particular friends of mine . " " I am not offended ; indeed they are very complimentary , " responded the lady , with a gay laugh . She had the most musical laugh in the world , and the most beautiful one to look at , for it displayed her fine , pearly teeth to the most charming advantage . We reached the pawnbroker 's and I went boldly in while Mrs. Raymond waited for me outside the door , for I did not wish her to be exposed to the mortification of being stared at by those who might be in the shop . The pawnbroker was a gentleman of Jewish persuasion , and possessed a nose like the beak of an eagle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vat is dish ? " said he , " a harp ? Oh , dat is no use . We have tousands such tings offered every day . Dere is no shecurity in mushical instruments . Vat do you want for it ? " " Ten dollars , " I replied , in a tone of decision . " Ca n't give it , " said the Israelite  --  " it ish too moosh . Give you eight . " " No , " said I , taking up the harp and preparing to depart . " Here , den , " said my uncle , " I will give you ten , but only shust to oblishe you  --  mind dat . " I duly thanked him for his willingness to oblige me . Uncle Moses gave me the ticket and money ; and I left the shop and rejoined Mrs. Raymond , to whom I handed over the duplicate and the X. " I will take the ticket , " said she , smiling  --  " but you shall keep the money , for I appoint you my cashier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sought out a cheap second-hand clothing establishment , which , fortunately , was kept by a woman , who , when matters were confidentially explained to her , readily entered into our plan . Mrs. Raymond and the woman retired into a rear apartment , while I remained in the shop . Half or three-quarters of an hour passed away . At last the door of the inner apartment was opened and there entered the shop a young person whom I did not immediately recognize . This person seemed to be a very beautiful boy , neatly dressed in a cloth jacket and cap , and possessing a form of the most exquisite symmetry . This pretty and interesting lad approached me , and tapping me playfully upon the cheek , said  --  " My dear fellow , how do you like me now ? Have I not made a change for the better ? How queenly I feel in this strange rig ! " It was of course Mrs. Raymond who addressed me . Her disguise was perfect ; never before had I seen so complete a transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to be otherwise than what she seemed , a singularly delicate and handsome boy , apparently about sixteen years of age . I congratulated the lady upon the admirable appearance which she made in her newly adopted costume , but expressed my regret that she should have been compelled to part with her magnificent hair . " There was no help for it , " said she , laughing . " I confess that I experienced some regret when I felt my hair tumbling from my shoulders ; but the loss was unavoidable , for those tresses would have betrayed my sex . This good woman , here , proved to be a very expert barber . " Reflecting that a coarse suit of clothes would be just as good and better , for a dusty road , than a fine suit of broadcloth , I made a bargain with the proprietress of the shop to exchange my garments for coarse ones of fustian , she giving me a reasonable sum to counter-balance the great superiority of my wardrobe . This arrangement was speedily completed , and I found myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in appearance , certainly deserved the title of a perfect " greenhorn . " All parties being satisfied , I and my fair companion departed . In the evening , having supped , we went to the theatre , where I revenged myself upon the " heavy man , " and the " light comedian , " who had in the afternoon made merry at my expense for carrying the harp , by getting up a hiss for the former gentleman , who knew not one single word of his part , and by hitting the latter individual upon the nose with an apple , for which latter feat ( as the actor was a great favorite , ) I was hounded out of the theatre , and narrowly escaped being carried to the watch-house . I and my fair friend then took lodgings for the night at a neighboring hotel . FOOTNOTES : F Some people imagine that New Jersey belongs to the United States . That opinion I hold to be erroneous .

" CHAPTER VI In which is introduced a celebrated Comedian from the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , London . The next morning , bright and early , " two travellers might have been seen " crossing one of the ponderous bridges that lead over the Schuylkill from Philadelphia to the opposite shore . The one was a stout young cavalier , arrayed in fustian brown ; the other was a pretty youth , attired in broadcloth blue , and brilliant was his flashing eye , and coal-black was his hair . By my troth , good masters , a fairer youth ne'er touched the light guitar within the boudoir of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " quoth he in fustian brown , " my soul expands in the soft beauty of this rosy morn , my blood dances merrily through every vein , and I feel like eating a thundering good breakfast at the next hostelrie.  --  What sayest thou , fair youth ? " " Of a truth , Sir George , " quoth he in broadcloth blue , in a voice of liquid melody , " I am hungered , and would gladly sit me down before a flagon of coffee , and a goodly platter of ham and eggs . " " Bravely spoken , " quoth the stout young cavalier , with watering mouth ; and then , relapsing into silence , the train journeyed onward . Soon they paused before a goodly hostelrie , which bore upon its swinging signboard the device of " The Pig and the Snuffers . " " What ho , within there ! House , house , I say ! " hastily roared the youth in fustian brown , as he vigorously applied his cowhide boot to the door of the inn . Forth came mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a right merry one , I ween , with mighty paunch and nose of ruby red . Now , by the rood ! a funnier knight than this same Rupert Harmon , ne'er drew a foaming tankard of nut-brown ale , or blew a cloud from a short pipe in a chimney corner . " Welcome , my masters  --  a right good welcome , " quoth the fat host of the Pig and Snuffers . " Bestir thyself , knave , " quoth the cove in fustian brown , as he entered the inn followed by the pretty youth in broadcloth blue  --  " beshrew me , I am devilish hungry , and athirst likewise . Knave , a stoup of sack , and then let ham , eggs and coffee smoke upon the festive board ! " " To hear is to obey , " said he of the Pig and Snuffers , as he waddled out of the room in order to give the necessary instructions for breakfast . It came ! Ha , ha ! Shall I attempt to describe that breakfast ? Nay  --  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style of my friend , G.P.R. James , the great English novelist , I shall continue my narrative in my own humble way . We breakfasted , and cheerfully set out upon our journey . The weather was delightful ; the odor of spring flowers perfumed the air , and the soft breeze made music amid the branches of the trees . On every side of us were the evidences of agricultural prosperity  --  fine , spacious farm-houses , immense barns , vast orchards , and myriads of thriving domestic animals . Sturdy old Dutch farmers , jogging leisurely along in their great wagons to and from the city , saluted us with a hearty " good morrow ; " and one jolly old fellow who was returning home after having disposed of a quantity of produce , insisted upon giving us a " lift " in his wagon . So we got in , and about dark reached the farmer 's home  --  a substantial and comfortable mansion that indicated its owner to be a man of considerable wealth . I was surprised at the powers of endurance exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's journey , exhibited not the slightest symptom of fatigue . She kept up a most exuberant flow of spirits , and seemed delighted with the novelty of the journey which we had commenced . She was truly a charming companion , full of wit , sentiment and intelligence ; and I look back upon those days with a sigh of regret  --  for such unalloyed happiness I shall never see again . The good old farmer , with characteristic hospitality , declared that we should go not further that night ; and we gladly availed ourselves of his kindness . He introduced us to his wife  --  a fine old lady , and a famous knitter of stockings  --  and also to his only daughter , a plump , rosy , girl about eighteen years old . This damsel surveyed my disguised companion with a look of the most intense admiration ; and I saw at once that she had actually fallen in love with Mrs. Raymond ! " There will be some fun here , " said I to myself  --  " I must keep dark and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one of her own sex , is rather rich ! " After a capital supper  --  ye gods , what German sausages !  --  I accepted the old farmer 's invitation to inspect his barn , cattle , &amp;c . My fair friend was taken possession of by the amorous Dutch damsel , who seemed to be particularly anxious to display the beauties of her dairy , which is always the pride of a farmer 's daughter . I could not help laughing at the look of comical embarrassment which poor Mrs. Raymond assumed , when the buxom young lady seized her and dragged her off . I of course praised the farmer 's barn and stock with the air of a judge of such matters , and we returned to the house , where I applied myself to the task of entertaining the old lady , and in this I succeeded so well , that she presented me with a nice pair of stockings of her own knitting . After a while , my fair friend and the farmer 's daughter returned ;  --  and I noticed that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dutch damsel exhibited anger and disappointment . I could easily guess how matters stood ; but , of course , I said nothing . During the evening , my fair friend had an opportunity of speaking to me in private ; and she said to me , with a deep blush , although she could not help smiling as she spoke  --  " I have something to tell you which is really very awkward and ridiculous , yet you ca n't think how it vexes me . Now do n't laugh at me in that provoking manner , but listen . That great , silly Dutch girl , after showing me her dairy , which is really a very pretty affair and well worth seeing , suddenly made the most furious love to me  --  supposing me , of course , to be what I seem , a boy . I was terribly confused and frightened , and knew not what to say , nor how to act . Throwing her fat arms around me , she declared that I was so handsome that she could not resist me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her that I was too young to know anything about love ; and then the creature volunteered to teach me all about it . Then I intimated that I could not think of marrying at present , as I was too poor to support a wife ; but she laughed at the idea of matrimony , and said that she only wanted me to be her little lover . Finally I effected my release by promising to meet her about midnight , in the orchard by the gate . Now , is not all this very dreadful  --  to be persecuted by a big , unrelenting Dutch girl in this manner ? " I roared with laughter . It was rude and ungallant , I confess ; but how could I help it ? Mrs. Raymond made a desperate effort to become angry ; but so ludicrous was the whole affair , that she could not resist the contagious influence of my mirth ; and she , too , almost screamed with laughter . When our mirth had somewhat subsided , I inquired  --  " Well , are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What an absurd question ! Of course not ! She may wait by the orchard gate all night , for what I care  --  the great , lubbery fool ! " " What do you say to my meeting her at the appointed time and place ? I will act as your representative , and make every satisfactory explanation . " " You shall do no such thing . How dare you make such a proposition ? I am perfectly astonished at your impudence ! " The next morning , after breakfast , we prepared to depart . I saw that the farmer 's daughter regarded my fair friend with a ferocious look . The damsel had probably passed two or three hours in the night air , waiting for her " faithless swain . " Having thanked the good old farmer for his hospitality , and received his blessing in return , we departed . It is not my intention to weary the reader with the details of each day 's travel ; indeed , my limited space would not admit of such particularity . I shall , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journey as I may deem especially worthy of mention . When we reached Lancaster , we discovered that our funds had entirely given out , for we had lived expensively at taverns on the way , instead of exercising a judicious economy . How to raise a fresh supply of money was now the question , and one most difficult to be answered . But an unexpected stroke of good fortune was in store for us . Strolling into the bar-room of the principal hotel , I saw a play-bill stuck up on the wall . This I read with avidity ; and then , to my great satisfaction , I became aware of the fact that an old friend of mine , one Bill Pratt , a travelling actor and manager , had " just arrived in Lancaster with a talented company of comedians , who would that evening have the honor of appearing before the ladies and gentlemen of the above named place in a series of entertainments at once Moral , Chaste , Instructive and Classical , at the Town Hall . Admission  --  twelve-and-a-half cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend immediately posted to the Town Hall , and there I found Brother Pratt busily engaged in arranging his stage , putting up his scenery , &amp;c . He was prodigiously glad to see me . I Among his company I recognized several old acquaintances . I introduced my travelling companion to the ladies and gentlemen of the profession ; and I do not think that any of them suspected her true sex . We all dined together at the hotel ; and a merry party we certainly were , " within the limits of becoming mirth . " Wit sparkled , conundrums puzzled , bad puns checked , and rich jokes awoke the laughing echoes of the old dining-hall . Happy people are those travelling actors  --  happy because they are careless , and , in the enjoyment of to-day , think not of the morrow . Are they not true philosophers ? " Oh , what 's the use of sighing , Since time is on the wing  --  To-morrow we 'll be dying , So merrily , merrily sing  --  Tra , la , la ! " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piazza ; and , while we smoked our cheroots , we recalled the past , dwelt upon the present , and anticipated the future . After a considerable amount of desultory conversation , the Brother suddenly asked me  --  " Who is that handsome little fellow with whom you are travelling ? " " Oh , he ran away from home in order to see something of the world , as well as to avoid being apprenticed to a laborious trade , " was my reply , for I did not consider it at all necessary to let my friend into the secret . " He 's a lad of spirit , and I like him , " rejoined the Brother . " If he went upon the stage , what a splendid court page he 'd make ! But where are you going ? Tell me all about it . " I told the Brother all that was necessary for him to know . " And so , " said he , reflectively , " you are entirely out of funds . That 's bad . We must raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will immediately cause bills to be printed , announcing that ' the manager has the pleasure of informing his numerous patrons that he has , at enormous expense , succeeded in effecting a brief engagement with Mr. George Thompson , the celebrated comedian from the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , London , who will make his first appearance in his celebrated character of Robert Macaire , in the great drama of that name , as performed by him upwards of two hundred nights before crowded and fashionable audiences including the royalty , nobility and gentry of England , who greeted him with the most terrific and enthusiastic yells of applause , and Her Majesty the Queen was so delighted with the masterly and brilliant representation , that she presented Mr. Thompson with a magnificent diamond ring valued at five thousand pounds sterling , which ring will be exhibited to the audience at the conclusion of the performance . ' How will that do , my boy ? We 'll raise the price of admission to twenty-five cents on account of the extra attraction . I 'll play Jaques Strop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on your way rejoicing , with a full pocket . " " I say , old fellow , " I gravely remarked  --  " are you not laying it on a little too thick ? " " Not at all , " coolly replied the brother as he carefully knocked the ashes off the end of his cigar , " not at all . Humbug is the order of the day . I 'll get a flashy ring to represent the one presented to you by the queen . You know enough about stage business to play the part of Robert Macaire very respectably and you also know that I am not very slow in Jaques Strop . You 'll make a hit , depend on it . I 'll get you the book , and you can look over the part . What you do n't learn you can gag . J I 'll announce you for to-morrow night . Leave all to me ; I 'll arrange everything . Let 's go in and drink ! " I was soon master of the part ; and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found to be " dead letter perfect . " The manager and the members of his company congratulated me on the success which I was sure to meet with . Meanwhile , the town had been flooded with bills , which made the same extravagant announcement that Brother Pratt had suggested to me . Public expectation and curiosity were worked up to the highest pitch ; and a crowd of excited people assembled in front of the principal hotel , in anticipation of the sudden arrival of the " distinguished comedian " in a splendid coach drawn by four superb white horses , and attended by a retinue of servants in magnificent livery . Evening came , and the large hall was crowded almost to suffocation , although the price of tickets had been doubled . I was full of confidence , having fortified myself by imbibing several glasses of brandy and water . Just before going on the stage Brother Pratt was , to use a common expression , " pretty well over the bay . " Well , to make a long story as short as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaques Strop . My appearance was greeted with a perfect whirlwind of applause , which lasted four or five minutes . Taking off my dilapidated beaver , I gracefully bowed my thanks and then began the part which commences thus : " Come along , comrade , put your best leg foremost . What are you afraid of ? We are out of danger now , and shall soon reach the frontier . " I may say without egotism , that I got through the part remarkably well , and I certainly kept the audience in a continual roar of laughter . Mrs. Raymond occupied a front seat ;  --  and her encouraging smile sustained me throughout the play . When the piece was over , I was loudly called for . " Now , my boy , " said Brother Pratt to me , " go in front of the curtain and make a rip-staving speech  --  I know you can do it . Say that at the urgent solicitation of the manager , you have consented to appear to-morrow night as Jem Baggs , in the Wandering Minstrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these people will now want to see the ring which Queen Victoria presented to me . How shall I manage that ? " " Easy enough , " replied the Brother , as he drew from his pocket and handed me a big brass ring ornamented with a piece of common glass about the size of a hen 's egg . Out I stepped in front of the curtain . A bouquet as large as a cabbage struck me in the face , and fell at my feet . The giver of this delicate compliment was an ancient female very youthfully dressed . I picked up the bouquet , and pressed it to my heart . This was affecting , it melted the audience to tears . Silence having been obtained , I made a bombastic speech , which Brother Pratt afterwards declared to be the best he had ever heard delivered in front of the " green baize . " I spoke of being a stranger in a strange land , of the warm welcome which I received , of eternal gratitude , of bearing with me beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closely allied to the British aristocracy , but declared that my sentiments were purely republican and in favor of the " Star-Spangled Banner . " Here there was a tempest of applause and when it had subsided , the orchestra , consisting of a fiddle and a bass-drum , struck up the favorite national air which my words had suggested . Then I exhibited the diamond ring which had been presented to me by the Queen of England ; and , as the spectators viewed the royal gift , the most profound silence prevailed among them . When I had sufficiently gratified them by displaying the lump of brass and glass , I remarked that I would appear on the next evening as Jem Baggs in the Wandering Minstrel . This announcement was received with shouts of approbation ; and bowing almost to the foot-lights , I withdrew . The next night , the audience was equally large and enthusiastic , and my " farewell speech " was so deeply affecting , that there was not a dry eye in the house . Brother Pratt urged me to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered me a good salary , and glowingly depicted the pleasant life of a strolling player , I declined , not having any ambition in that way . Besides , it was my duty to get on to Pittsburg with Mrs. Raymond , without any unnecessary delay . Having received nearly fifty dollars as my share of the proceeds , I took my leave of Brother Pratt and his company ; and , accompanied , of course , by my fair friend , resumed my journey . I wish I had sufficient time and space to describe all the adventures through which we passed , prior to our arrival in Pittsburg . But such details would occupy too much room , and I must make the most of the few pages that are left for me to occupy . We crossed the Alleghanies , and , taking the canal at Johnstown , soon reached Pittsburg . Here we made some essential improvements in our garments , and put up at a respectable hotel , Mrs. Raymond still sustaining her masculine character . By diligent inquiry , we learned that the villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair friend prepared to avenge the base wrongs which he had inflicted upon her . FOOTNOTES : I All who have the good fortune to know Bill Pratt alias " The Original Beader , " will acknowledge that a wittier , funnier or better man never breathed . J This word , in theatrical parlance , signifies " to employ language which the author of the play never wrote . " CHAPTER VII A deed of blood and horror . We had no difficulty in ascertaining the place of Livingston 's abode ; for he was well known in the city . He resided in a handsome house situated on one of the principal streets ; and we discovered that the lawless rascal was actually engaged in the practice of the law ! " My dear friend , " said Mrs. Raymond to me one day , as we were strolling along the banks of the river , " I will not suffer you to involve yourself in any trouble on my account . You must have nothing to do with this Livingston . You must remain entirely in the back-ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you frankly that I shall kill the man . He is not fit to live , and he must not be permitted to continue his career of villainy . Whatever may be my fate , do not , I entreat you , by unhappy on my account . When I have shed the heart 's blood of Livingston , I shall be willing to die upon the scaffold . To the very last moment of my life , I shall cherish for you a sentiment of the most affectionate gratitude ; you sacrificed all your own plans in order to accompany me here , and , throughout the entire long journey , you have treated me with a degree of kindness and attention , which I can never forget while life remains . But a truce to melancholy ; let us change the subject . " " With all my heart , " said I ; and leaving the river side , we walked up into the centre of the city . We passed an elegant dwelling-house on the door of which was a silver plate bearing the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain who ruined Mrs. Raymond . A carriage drove up before the door , and from it leaped a tall , fine-looking man , dressed in the height of fashion . He assisted a beautiful and elegantly attired lady to alight from the vehicle , and conducted her into the house . " That man is Livingston , and that woman must be one of his wives , " said Mrs. Raymond , with a bitter smile , as she placed her hand in her bosom , where , I knew , she carried a dirk-knife . " My friend , " resumed she , after a pause , " leave me ; I may as well perform my bloody task now , as at any other time . I will invent some pretext for requesting an interview with Livingston , and then , without uttering a single word , I will stab him to the heart . Farewell , forget me , and be happy ! " " Stay , " said I  --  " you must not leave me thus . Let me persuade you to abandon , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Livingston . You are agitated , excited ; wait until you are cool , and capable of sober reflections . " Mrs. Raymond regarded me with a look of anger , as she said , passionately  --  " And was it for the purpose of giving me such advice as this , that you accompanied me from Philadelphia to this city ? You knew , all the while , the object of my journey , and yet now , in the eleventh hour , when an excellent opportunity presents itself for the accomplishment of that object , you seek to dissuade me from my purpose . Have I entirely mistaken your character ? Are you really as weak-minded , and as devoid of courage and spirit , as your language would seem to indicate ? When that young ruffian mutilated you in Philadelphia , did n't you consider that you acted perfectly right ? Well , this Livingston has destroyed the happiness of my life , and transformed me from a lady of wealth into a penniless beggar . Say does he not deserve to die ? " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then it seems too terrible to go about the horrible business deliberately , and in cold blood . " " He coolly and deliberately planned and effected the ruin of my peace , happiness and fortune , " rejoined Mrs. Raymond , in a tone of fixed determination  --  " and it is therefore but just that he should be coolly and deliberately slain . Once more , farewell ; by everything sacred , I swear that you shall not turn me from my purpose . My regard for you is great  --  but , if you seek to detain me by force , your heart shall be made acquainted with the point of my knife ! " " I have no idea of using force , " said I , reproachfully  --  " but , if I had , no such threat as the one which you have just now made , would deter me . Go , my friend , go  --  do as you will ; but I will go with you , for I swear that I will not leave you . " This announcement deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon for the language which she had used . " Forgive me , my best , my only friend , " said she  --  " the loyalty and devotion which you have always manifested towards me should have prompted different expressions .  --  If you are determined to accompany me , and see me through this business , follow me . " I obeyed , hoping to be able to prevent the perpetration of the terrible deed which she meditated . She rang the bell at the door , which was opened by a servant . " I wish to see your master , instantly , on particular business , " said the disguised woman . " What name , sir ? " demanded the servant . " It matters not . Say to Mr. Livingston that two gentlemen wish to see him on business of the greatest importance . " The servant disappeared , but soon returned , saying that she would conduct us to her master . We followed her into a handsomely furnished library , where Mr. Livingston was seated , looking over some letters . He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young gentlemen , what can I do for you to-day ? Do you wish to consult me on any matter of law ? I am entirely at your service . " It was evident that the villain did not recognize the woman whom he had so basely wronged . Mrs. Raymond uttered not one single word , but , thrusting her hand into her bosom , she slowly approached the author of her ruin , who still continued to peruse his letters in entire unconsciousness of the terrible danger that hung over him . I watched Mrs. Raymond with the closest attention , fully determined to spring forward at the critical moment and prevent the desperate woman from accomplishing her deadly purpose . It was a deeply interesting and thrilling scene , and one which I shall never forget . There sat the intended victim , whose soul was hovering on the awful precincts of an endless eternity ; there stood the avenger of her own wrongs , her right hand nervously grasping the hilt of the weapon in her bosom , her face deadly pale , and her eyes flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with agitation , and ready to spring forward at the proper time to prevent the consummation of a bloody tragedy . Mr. Livingston suddenly looked up from his letters , and started when he beheld the pale and wrathful countenance of Mrs. Raymond , whose eyes were fixed upon him with an expression of the most deadly hatred . " Your face seems strongly familiar to me ; have we not met before ? " asked Livingston . " Yes , " calmly replied Mrs. Raymond  --  " we have met before . " " That voice ! " cried the doomed villain  --  " surely I know it . Who are you , and what want you with me ? " " I am the victim of your treacherous villainy , and I want revenge ! " screamed Mrs. Raymond , as , with the quickness of lightning , and before I could prevent her , she drew her weapon and plunged it into the heart of Livingston , who fell from his chair to the floor and died instantly . " Now I am satisfied , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade of her knife . Language can not depict the horror which the contemplation of this bloody deed caused within me . True , I had myself slain a human being  --  but then it was done in self-defence , and amid all the heat and excitement of a personal contest . This deed , on the contrary , had been committed , coolly and deliberately ; and , although Mrs. Raymond 's wrongs were undoubtedly very great , I really could not find it in my heart to justify her in what she had done . How bitterly I reproached myself for not having adopted some effectual means of hindering the performance of that appalling deed , even at the risk of incurring Mrs. Raymond 's severe and eternal displeasure ! I felt myself to be in some measure an accessory to the crime ; and I feared the law would , at all events , consider me as such . " What is done can not be helped now , " said I to Mrs. Raymond , who stood calmly surveying the body of her victim  --  " come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may possibly escape the consequence of this bloody act . " " No , " said the woman  --  " I shall not stir an inch . I have relieved the world of a monster , and now I am ready to receive my reward , even if it be the scaffold . But go , my friend  --  go , and secure your own safety . " " No , I will not leave you , even if I have to share your fate , " was my reply . That was a very foolish determination , I admit ; for how could my remaining with her , do her any good ? I was merely placing myself in a position of the utmost peril . But I thought it wrong to desert Mrs. Raymond in that dark and trying hour ; and therefore , as she refused to escape , I resolved to remain with her . Some one softly opened the door , and a female voice said  --  " My dear , are you particularly engaged ? May I come in ? " Hearing no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rosy lips . This lady was the newly-made wife of Livingston . She had been , of course , in happy ignorance of his true character , and of the fact that he was already the husband of several wives . On seeing us , she evinced surprise , for she knew not of her husband having visitors . Suddenly , her eyes fell upon Livingston 's bleeding corpse , which lay upon the floor . On seeing this horrid spectacle , she gave utterance to a piercing scream , and fell down insensible . That shrill , agonizing scream penetrated every part of the house , and brought all the inmates to the library , to see what had happened . Horror took possession of the group , as they gazed upon the awful scene . For a few minutes , there reigned the most profound silence . This was at last broken by one of the male servants , who demanded  --  " Who has done this ? " " I did it , " replied Mrs. Raymond , calmly , " I alone am guilty . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This young man here is entirely innocent ; he tried to prevent the act , but I was too quick for him . Let me be conveyed at once to prison . " Officers being sent for , soon arrived and took us both into custody , notwithstanding the passionate protestations of Mrs. Raymond that I had no hand whatever in the affair . " That must be shown to the satisfaction of higher authorities than we are , " said one of the officers . " At all events , it is our duty to secure this young man as a witness . If he is innocent , he will doubtless be able to prove it . " Half an hour afterwards , I was an inmate of the Pittsburg jail , in an apartment adjoining that occupied by Mrs. Raymond , whose real sex still remained undiscovered . CHAPTER VIII An Escape , and a Triumph . After a few weeks ' incarceration , Mrs. Raymond , in accordance with my advice , made known the secret of her sex to the chief officer of the prison , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered at the hand of Livingston . The officer , who was a good and humane man , was deeply affected by this narrative . He immediately placed Mrs. Raymond in a more comfortable room and caused her to be provided with an abundance of female garments , which she now resumed . Her story , of course , was given in all the newspapers ; and it excited the deepest sympathy in her behalf . One editor boldly asserted that no jury could be found to convict the fair prisoner under the circumstances . As regarded my case , the propriety of my immediate discharge from custody was strongly urged , an opinion in which I fully concurred . I shall dwell upon these matters as briefly as possible . I was first brought to trial , and the jury acquitted me without leaving their seats ; Mrs. Raymond was merely convicted of manslaughter in the fourth degree , so great was the sympathy that existed in her behalf , and the judge sentenced her to be imprisoned during the term of two years . Although I considered her particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to effect her liberation in some way or other . I may as well here remark that the last wife and victim of Livingston never survived the blow . She soon died of a broken heart . My first step was to repair to Harrisburg , the capitol city of the State , in order to solicit Mrs. Raymond 's pardon from Governor Porter , who was renowned , and by some parties strongly condemned , for his constant willingness to bestow executive clemency upon prisoners convicted of the most serious offences . K I easily obtained an interview with his Excellency , whom I found to be a very clever sort of personage . Having made known my errand , and related all the particulars of Mrs. Raymond 's case , I urged her claims to mercy with all the eloquence of which I was master . The Governor listened to me with attention ; and , when I had concluded , he said  --  " My inclination strongly prompts me to pardon this most unfortunate lady ; but I have recently pardoned so many convicted prisoners , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I really dare not grant any more pardons at present . I will , however , commute the lady 's sentence from two years to one . " With this partial concession I was obliged to be contented . The necessary documents were made out , and with them I posted back to Pittsburg . When I entered the cell of my fair friend and told her what I had effected in her behalf , she burst into tears of gratitude and joy . One long year taken off her sentence , was certainly something worth considering . " Courage , my friend ! " said I , " even if you are obliged to serve out the remnant of your sentence , which I trust will not be the case , a year will soon pass away . I shall not leave Pittsburg until you are free . You will see me often ; and I will take care that you are abundantly provided with everything that can contribute to your comfort . Keep up a good heart ; you have at least one friend who will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which time I gained an excellent subsistence by writing for various newspapers and magazines . Three times every week I had an interview with Mrs. Raymond , whom I caused to be supplied with every comfort and luxury as allowed by the rules of the prison . She had just nine months to serve , when one day I was unexpectedly enabled to effect her liberation in the following manner . I had called upon her , as usual . After an interview of about half an hour 's duration , I bade her adieu and left her apartment . To gain the street , it was necessary to pass through the office of the prison . In that office were generally seated three or four turnkeys , one of whom always went and locked Mrs. Raymond 's door after my leaving her . Upon entering the office on the occasion to which I now refer , I found but one turnkey there , and he was fast asleep . I instantly resolved to take advantage of the lucky circumstance which good fortune had thrown in my way . Hastening back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of affairs and bade her follow me . She obeyed , as might be supposed , without much reluctance . We passed through the office and out into the street ; but , before departing , I transferred the key from the inside to the outside of the door and locked the sleeping turnkey in , so that there could be no possibility of his immediately pursuing us , when he should awaken and discover the flight of his prisoner . I was tolerably well furnished with cash , and my fair friend , at my suggestion , purchased an elegant bonnet and shawl  --  for , it will be remembered , she had resumed the garments appropriate to the female sex . As for myself , I was exceedingly well dressed , and no alteration in my costume was necessary , in order to present a respectable appearance . I entertained no serious apprehensions of any great effort being made to capture the fugitive , she having had but nine months to serve , and being therefore a person of but little importance when viewed as a prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prison would charitably refrain from making any extraordinary exertions in the matter . But these considerations did not prevent me from exercising a reasonable degree of caution . We left Pittsburg that evening , for Philadelphia , where we arrived in due season . I immediately sought and procured employment as a writer , at a liberal salary . A few days after our arrival in Philadelphia , Mrs. Raymond said to me  --  " My dear friend , I am not going to remain a burden to you . Listen to the plan which I have to propose . I think of going upon the stage . " " What , and becoming an actress ? " " Yes . I flatter myself that my voice and figure are both passable ; and I really think that I possess some talent for the theatrical profession . A respectable actress always receives a good salary . If the plan meets with your approbation , I shall place myself under the tuition of some competent teacher ; and my debut shall be made as soon as advisable . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan , which I thought , in fact , to be a very excellent idea . Once successfully brought out upon the stage , she would have a profession which would be to her an unfailing means of support . According to the best of my judgment , she possessed every mental and physical qualification necessary to constitute a good actress . Beautiful and sprightly , talented and accomplished  --  possessing , too , the most exquisite taste and skill as a vocalist and musician , I saw no reason why she should not succeed upon the stage as well , and far better , than many women a thousand times less talented . Therefore , encouraged by my cordial approbation of her plan , and acting in accordance with my recommendation , the fair aspirant to dramatic honors placed herself under the instructions of a popular and well-known actor , who was fully capable of the task which he had undertaken . A few months passed away , and my fair friend announced herself as being nearly in readiness to make her first appearance . I was delighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recitations with which she occasionally favored me , were delivered in the highest style of the elocutionary art , and convinced me that she was destined to meet with the most unbounded success . She proposed making her debut as Beatrice , in Shakespeare 's glorious comedy , " Much Ado About Nothing , "  --  a character well calculated to display her arch vivacity and charming sprightliness . I saw her rehearse the part , and was satisfied that she must achieve a brilliant triumph ,  --  an opinion that was fully concurred in by her gratified instructor , and also by the manager and several of the leading actors and actresses of the theatre . The eventful evening came at last , and the house was crowded in every part . Seating myself in a private box in company with the actor who had instructed Mrs. Raymond , I awaited her appearance with the utmost confidence . The curtain arose , and the play commenced . When Beatrice came on , a perfect storm of applause saluted her . Her appearance , in her elegant and costly stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undaunted by the sea of faces spread out before her , she went on with her part , and was frequently interrupted by deafening shouts of approval . The Benedict of the evening being a very fine actor , and the Dogberry being as funny a dog as ever created a broad grin or a hearty laugh  --  the entire comedy passed off in the most admirable manner ; and , at its conclusion , my fair friend being loudly called for , she was led out in front of the curtain by Benedict . A shower of bouquets now saluted her ; and , having gracefully acknowledged the kindness of the audience , she retired . This decided success caused the manager to engage Mrs. Raymond at a liberal salary . She subsequently appeared with equal success in a round of the best characters ; and the press , and every tongue , became eloquent in her praise . She was now in a fair way to acquire a fortune as great as the one which she had lost through the villainy of Livingston . Thinking her worthy of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I advised her , after a year 's sojourn in Philadelphia , to travel as a star . To this she eagerly assented , and accordingly I accompanied her to New York , where she was immediately engaged by the late Thomas S. Hamblin , of the Bowery Theatre . L Her success at this popular establishment was unprecedented in the annals of dramatic triumphs . Night after night was she greeted by crowded , enthusiastic and enraptured audiences . In short , she became one of the most celebrated actresses of the day . FOOTNOTES : K It is related of Governor Porter as an illustration of his pardoning propensities , that once , after his term of office had expired , a gentleman accidentally ran against him in the street . " I beg your pardon , " said the gentleman . " I can not grant it , " said Mr. Porter , " for I am no longer Governor . " L I have not , for reasons that will be easily understood , given the name which Mrs. Raymond assumed , after her adoption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a change of residence . A dreadful accident abruptly terminated Mrs. Raymond 's brilliant professional career . One night , while she was dressing in her private room at the theatre , a camphene lamp exploded and her face was shockingly burned . Her beauty was destroyed forever , and her career upon the stage was ended . Thus was the public deprived of a most delightful source of entertainment , and thus was a popular actress thrown out of the profession just as she had reached the pinnacle of fame , and just as she was in a fair way to acquire a handsome fortune . It would be impossible for me to describe the grief , consternation and horror of the unfortunate lady , on account of this melancholy accident . In vain did I attempt to console her , she refused to be comforted . She abandoned herself to despair ; and I caused her to be closely and constantly watched , fearing that she might attempt to commit suicide . The play-going public soon found a new idol , and poor Mrs. Raymond was forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fortunate that her sight was not destroyed . When she became well enough , she endeavored to gain a situation as a teacher of music ; but she was unceremoniously rejected by every person to whom she applied , on account of the repulsiveness of her countenance . This of course , still further increased the dark despair that overshadowed her soul . " My friend , " said she to me one day , " I shall not long survive this terrible misfortune . My heart is breaking , and death will ere long put an end to my sufferings . " " Come , come , " said I , " where is your philosophy ? Have you not passed through trials as great as this ? While there is life , there is hope ; and you will be happy yet . " I uttered these commonplace expressions because I knew not what else to say . Mrs. Raymond replied , with a mournful smile  --  " Ah ! with all your knowledge of the world , you know not how a woman feels when she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses his wealth  --  the fond mother from whom death snatches away her darling child ; these bereaved ones do not feel their losses more acutely than does a once lovely woman feel the loss of her charms . Do not talk to me of philosophy , for such language is mockery . " I visited my unfortunate and no longer fair friend very often , but all my attempts to cheer her up signally failed . She persisted in declaring that she was not long for this world ; and I began to believe so myself , for she failed rapidly . I saw that she was provided with every comfort ; but alas ! happiness was beyond her reach forever . One evening I set out to pay her a visit . On my arrival at the house in which she had taken apartments , the landlady informed me that she had not seen Mrs. Raymond during the whole of that day . " It is very singular , " remarked the woman , " I knocked five or six times at the door of her chamber , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not gone out . " These words caused a dreadful misgiving to seize me . Fearing that something terrible had happened , I rushed up stairs , and knocked loudly upon the door of Mrs. Raymond 's chamber . No answer being returned , I burst open the door , and my worst fears were realized , for there , upon the floor lay the lifeless form of that most unfortunate woman . She had committed suicide by taking arsenic . This dreadful event afflicted me more deeply than any other occurrence of my life . I had become attached to Mrs. Raymond on account of a certain congeniality of disposition between us . We had travelled far together , and shared great dangers . That was another link to bind us together . Besides I admired her for her talent , and more particularly for her heroic resolution . She was , altogether , a most extraordinary woman , and , under the circumstances , it was no wonder that her tragical end should have caused within me a feeling of the most profound sorrow . Having followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was very accustomed to do  --  I sat down to indulge in a little serious reflection , the result of which was that I determined to go to Boston , for New York had become wearisome to me . Besides , I knew that Boston was the grand storehouse of American literature  --  the " Athens of America , " and I doubted not my ability to achieve both fame and money there . To Boston I accordingly went . On the first day of my arrival , I crossed over to Charlestown for the purpose of viewing the Bunker Hill Monument . Having satisfied my curiosity , I strolled into a printing office , fell into conversation with the proprietor , and the result was that I found myself engaged at a moderate salary to edit and take the entire charge of a long-established weekly newspaper of limited circulation , entitled the " Bunker Hill Aurora and Boston Mirror . " This journal soon began to increase both in reputation and circulation , for I filled it with good original tales and with sprightly editorials . Yet no credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with my productions , and people imagined that W  --   --  , the proprietor , was the author of the improvements which had taken place . " Egad ! " the subscribers to the Aurora would say  --  " old W  --   --  has waked up at last . His paper is now full of tip-top reading , whereas it was formerly not worth house-room ! " How many instances of this kind have I seen  --  of writers toiling with their pens and brains for the benefit and credit of ungrateful wretches without intellect , or soul , or honor , or common humanity ! Charlestown is probably the meanest and most contemptible place in the whole universe  --  totally unfit to be the dwelling-place of any man who calls himself white . The inhabitants all belong to the Paul Pry family . A stranger goes among them , and forthwith inquisitive whispers concerning him begin to float about like feathers in the air . " Who is he ? What is he ? Where did he come from ? What 's his business ? Has he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . ) Is he married , or single ? What are his habits ? Is he a temperance man ? Does he smoke  --  does he drink  --  does he chew ? Does he go to meeting on Sundays ? What religious denomination does he belong to ? What are his politics ? Does he use profane language ? What time does he go to bed  --  and what time does he get up ? Wonder what he had for dinner to-day ? " &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c . During my residence in Charlestown , where I lived three years , I became acquainted with the celebrated editor and wit , Corporal Streeter , who was my next-door neighbor . I dwelt , by the way , in an old-fashioned house situated on Wood street . Two ancient pear trees sadly waved their branches in front of the house , and they are still there , unless some despoiling hand has cut them down  --  which Heaven forbid ! If ever I re-visit that place , I shall gaze with reverence at the old house  --  for in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The antique edifice I christened " The Hermitage . " The squalling cats of that neighborhood afforded me a fine opportunity for pistol practice . At the end of three years , I had a slight " misunderstanding " with Mr. W  --   --  , the proprietor of the Aurora , one of the most stupendously mean men it was ever my misfortune to encounter . He was worthy of being the owner of the only newspaper in Charlestown , alias , " Hogtown . " Having civilly requested Mr. W  --   --  to go to the devil at his earliest convenience , I left him and his rookery in disgust , and shifted my quarters over to Boston . Here I engaged largely in literary pursuits , and began to write a series of novels . These were well received by the public , as every Bostonian will recollect . In my next chapter , I shall tell the reader how a gentleman got into difficulties . CHAPTER X Six weeks in Leverett Street Jail . A popular actor who was a personal friend of mineM took a farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just before the close of the evening 's performances , I attempted to enter the stage door for his purpose of seeing him in his dressing-room , as he intended to sup with me and several friends . A half-drunken Irishman attached to the stage department in some menial capacity , stopped me and insolently ordered me out . I treated the Greek , of course , with the contempt which he merited , whereupon he called another overgrown bog-trotter to his assistance , and the twain forthwith attacked me with great fury . Finding myself in danger of receiving rather rough treatment , I drew a small pocket pistol and aimed at their shins , being determined that one of them , at least , should hobble around upon crutches for a short time . The cap on the pistol , however , refused to explode , and the two vagabonds immediately caused me to be arrested , charging me with " assault and battery with the intent to kill ! " I was forthwith accommodated with a private apartment in Leverett Street jail , where I remained six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being amply provided with good dinners , not prison fare , but from the outside , candles , newspapers , books , writing materials , &amp;c . During my imprisonment , I wrote " The Gay Deceiver , " and " Venus in Boston . " My next door neighbor was no less a personage than Dr. John W. Webster , who was afterwards executed for the murder of Dr. Parkman . Webster was a great glutton , and thought of nothing but his stomach , even up to the very hour of his death . On account of his " position in society , " ( ! ) every officer of the prison became his waiter ; and a certain ruffianly turnkey , who was in the habit of abusing poor prisoners in the most outrageous manner , would fawn to the Doctor like a hungry dog to a benevolent butcher . Webster was very polite to me , frequently sending me books and newspapers  --  favors which I as often reciprocated . He once sent me a jar of preserves , a box of sardines and a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines and liquors of every kind being prohibited luxuries . That night I became very happy and jovial ; but I did not leave the house . Dr. Webster was confident of being acquitted ; but the result proved how terribly he was mistaken . Probably , in the annals of criminal jurisprudence , there never was seen a more striking instance of equal and exact justice , than was afforded by the trial , conviction and execution of John W. Webster . Money , influential friends , able counsel , prayers , petitions , the prestige of a scientific reputation failed to save him from that fate which he merited as well as if he had been the most obscure individual in existence . After six weeks imprisonment , I was brought to trial before Chief Justice Wells . I was defended by a very tolerable lawyer , to whom I paid twenty-five dollars in consideration of his conversing five minutes with a jury of my peers , the said jury consisting of twelve hungry individuals who wanted to go out to dinner . When my legal adviser had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter over among themselves ; and , after about fifteen minutes absence , they returned and expressed their opinion that I was " not guilty . " This opinion induced me to believe that they were very sensible fellows indeed . Not for a moment did I think of demanding a new trial ; that would have been impertinent , as doubting the sagacity of the jury . My two Irish prosecutors left the court-room in a rage ; and two more chop-fallen disappointed and mortified Greeks were never seen . The Judge took his departure , the spectators dispersed , and I crossed the street and dined sumptuously at Parker 's , with a large party of friends . Very many of my Boston readers will remember a long series of articles which I wrote and published about that time , in the columns of one of the newspapers , entitled " Mysteries of Leverett Street Jail . " In those sketches I gave the arrangements of the Jail , and its officers , " particular fits ; " and the manner in which the fellows writhed under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The startling revelations which I made created great excitement throughout the whole community ; and I have good reason to believe that those exposures were the means of producing a far better state of affairs in the interior of the " stone jug . " I have thus , very briefly , given the extent of my experience with reference to the old Leverett Street Jail . Unlawful ladies and gentlemen are now accommodated in an elegant establishment in Cambridge street , for the old Jail has been levelled to the ground to make room for " modern improvements . "  --  I visited it just before the commencement of its destruction , and gazed at my old apartment " more in sorrow than in anger . " There were my name and a few verses , which I had written upon the wall . There was the rude table , upon which I had penned two novels , which , from their tone , seem rather to have emanated from a gilded boudoir . There , too , in the grated window , was a little flower-pot in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withered and died long ago , for the prisoners who succeeded me probably had no taste for such " trash . " I took and carefully preserved the dead remains of my floral favorite  --  " for , " said I to myself  --  " they will serve to remind me of a dark spot in my existence . " And now , with the reader 's permission , I will turn to matters of a more cheerful character . FOOTNOTES : M I allude to Mr. W.G. Jones , now deceased . CHAPTER XI " The Uncles and Nephews . " Ring up the curtain ! Room there for the Boston Players . Let them approach our presence , not as they appear upon the stage , in rouge , and spangles , and wigs , and calves and cotton pad ; but as they look in broad daylight , or in the bar-room when the play is over , arrayed in garments of a modern date , wearing their own personal faces , swearing their own private oaths , and drinking real malt out of honest pewter , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say ! There is an intimate connection between the press and the stage , that is a congeniality of character , habit , taste , feeling and disposition , between the writer and the actor . The press and the stage are , in a measure , dependent on each other . The newspaper looks to the theatre for light , racy and readable items , with which to adorn its columns , like festoons of flowers gracefully hung around columns of marble . The theatre looks to the newspaper for impartial criticisms and laudatory notices . Show me a convivial party of actors , and I will swear there are at least two or three professional writers among them . I know many actors who are practical printers , fellows who can wield a composing-stick as deftly as a fighting sword . Long life and prosperity to the whole of them , say I ; and bless them for a careless , happy , pleasure-loving , bill-hating and beer-imbibing race of men . Amen . There is one point of resemblance between the hero of the sock and buskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his person and adopts the language of another , in order to represent a certain character ; the latter clothes his ideas in an appropriate garb of words , and puts sentiments in the mouths of his characters which are not always his own . But I was speaking of the Boston Players . Admitting the foregoing argument to be correct , it is not to be wondered at that I became extensively acquainted among the members of the theatrical profession . My name was upon the free list of every theatre in the city ; and every night I visited one or more of the houses  --  not to see the play , but to chat in the saloons with the actors and literary people who in those places most did congregate . After the play was over , we all used to assemble in an ale-house near the principal theatre ; and daylight would often surprise us in the midst of our " devotions . " A curious mixed-up set we were to be sure ! I will try to recollect the most prominent members of our club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Prior , who might properly be regarded as President of the club . Then came H.W. Fenno , Esq. , the gentlemanly Treasurer of the National . He , however , seldom tarried after having once " put the party through . " The eccentric " Old Spear " was generally present , seated in an obscure corner smoking a solitary cigar . Comical S.D. Johnson and his hopeful son George were usually on hand to enliven the scene ; and so was Jim Ring , alias J. Henry , the best negro performer , next to Daddy Rice , in the United States . Chunkey Monroe , who did the villains at the National ; and , towering above him might be seen his cousin , Lengthy Monroe , who enacted the hard old codgers at the same establishment . That fine fellow , Ned Sandford , must not be forgotten ; neither must Sam Lake , the clever little dancer . Rube Meer was invariably to be found in company with a pot of malt ; and he was usually assisted by P. Jones , a personage who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four pints . Charley Saunders , the comedian and dramatist , the author of " Rosina Meadows " and many other popular plays  --  kept the " table in a roar , " by his wit and also by his excruciatingly bad puns . Bird , of " Pea-nut Palace " notoriety , held forth in nasal accents to Bill Colwell , the husband of the pretty and accomplished Anna Cruise . Big Sam Johnson , a heavy actor , a gallant Hibernian and a splendid fellow , discussed old Jamaica with his friend and boon companion , Sam Palmer , alias " Chucks . " The mysterious Frank Whitman captures his brother-actor at the Museum , Jack Adams , and imprisoning him in a corner from which there was no escape , imparts to him the most tremendous secrets . Ned Wilkings  --  one of the best reporters in the city  --  tells the last " funny thing " to John Young ; while Joe Bradley , proprietor of the Mail , touches glasses with Jim McKinney . Meanwhile , the two waiters , Handiboe and Abbott , circulate around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing the dirty glasses , from which they slyly contrive to drain a few drops now and then , for their bodily refreshment . As an instance of the " base uses " to which genius may " come at last , " I will state that Handiboe , whom we now find in such a menial position , was once quite a literary character ; while poor Abbott , to whom I now throw a few small coins in charity , was a setter of type . The rest of the party is made up of Pete Cunningham , Sam Glenn , Bill Dimond , Jim Brand , Bill Donaldson , Dan Townsend , Jack Weaver , Cal Smith , and a host of others whom it would puzzle the very devil himself to remember . Such was the " Uncle and Nephew Club , " of which I had the honor to be a prominent member . Almost every man belonging to it was a wit , a punster or a humorist of some kind ; and I will venture to say , that had some industrious individual taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were said at our meetings , a large volume might be formed that would be no contemptible specimen of genius . Whenever a member had the audacity to perpetrate some shocking bad pun , and such enormities were frequent , the offender was sentenced to undergo some ludicrous punishment ; and the utmost good-humor and hilarity always prevailed . I will now relate a rather amusing adventure in which I participated with others of the " Uncles and Nephews . " One night we were assembled , as usual , at our head-quarters . The Fourth of July was to " come off " the next day , and we determined to have some fun . Accordingly , a couple of stout messengers were despatched to the theatre , armed with the necessary authority and keys , and they soon returned laden with dresses from the wardrobe . These garments the party proceeded to assume ; and we were quickly transformed into as picturesque-looking a crowd as any that ever figured at a masquerade ball . As for myself , I made a very tolerable representation of Falstaff ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other gentlemen of Shakespeare 's creation , gave variety to the procession . Then there was a clown in full circus costume , accompanied by Harlequin in his glittering shape-dress . We sadly longed for a sprightly Columbine ; but then we consoled ourselves with Pantaloon , admirably rendered by P. Jones . Our " music " consisted of a bass-drum , which was tortured by the clown ; a fish-horn beautifully played upon by Sam Palmer ; a dinner-bell whose din was extracted by Jack Adams . Having formed the procession on the side-walk , the music struck up , and we marched . Our first halting-place was at the saloon of Peter Brigham , at the head of Hanover street . Here we filed in , and great excitement did our extraordinary appearance create . A mob soon collected before the door , attracted by our grotesque costumes as well as by the infernal noise of our " musical " instruments , upon which we continued to perform with undiminished vigor . Peter Brigham was in agonies , and rushed about the saloon like an insane fly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fled . The mob outside cheered vociferously ; and Harlequin began to belabor poor Pantaloon with his gilded lath to the immense amusement of the spectators . Peter Brigham at length mounted a chair , and said  --  " Gentlemen , will you hear me ? ( Hoarse growl from the bass-drum . ) I can not suffer this noise and racket to go on in my house . ( Blast of defiance from the fish-horn . ) You know I have always tried to keep a decent and respectable place . ( Peal of sarcastic laughter from the dinner bell . ) I have a proposition to make .  --  ( Hear ! hear ! ) If you will promise to leave the house quietly , I will treat you all to as much champagne as you can drink . " ( Yell of acceptance from the bass-drum , fish-horn and dinner-bell ! Great excitement generally . ) The wine was produced , and the facility with which it was disposed of , caused Mr. Brigham to stare . He endured its consumption , however , with the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make speeches , and exhibit other indications of a design on our part to " tarry yet awhile . " Peter then reminded us of our promise ; and , as gentlemen of honor , we fulfilled the same by immediately falling into procession and marching out of the saloon . Away we went down Hanover street , followed by the admiring and hooting crowd . We entered the establishment of Theodore Johnson , and were hospitably received by the prince of good fellows , who , assisted by Chris Anderson , " did the honors " with the utmost liberality . Sam Palmer and P. Jones , here favored the company with a broad-sword combat ; after which I , as Falstaff , gave a few recitations  --  the performances concluded with Abbott as Jocks , the Brazilian ape . Our next visit was to the Pemberton House , then under the control of Uriah W. Carr , a very small man , both physically and morally . Uriah received us very churlishly , and peremptorily refused to " come down " with the hospitality of the season . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published some verses concerning him . The following is all that I can recollect of that interesting production :  --  " T is comical , indeed it is To see him mix a punch  --  He puts two drops of liquor in , And then he eyes the lunch ; He struts about most pompously , Then stands before the fire , Just like a little bantam-cock , This comical Uriah ! " Inasmuch as Uriah refused to bring on the " bush " for either love or money , we determined to help ourselves . Therefore , every man appointed himself a bar-keeper pro tem . Wines , liquors and cigars were disposed of with marvelous celerity , and poor little Uriah danced about and tore his hair in the agony of his spirits . Meanwhile , a large number of actors and others , boarding at the Pemberton , joined us , being ushered in by Charles Dibden Pitt , a performer of great elegance and power , then playing a brilliant star engagement  --  at the Museum . This gentleman is decidedly " one of the boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At his suggestion , a committee was appointed to descend to the kitchen and bring up provisions . Ned Abbot and Bill Ball performed this duty in the most admirable and satisfactory manner . They departed for the lower regions , and soon returned laden both with substantials and delicacies . Then , such a feast !  --  or , rather , such a banquet ! Champagne flowed like water , for we had discovered a closet filled with baskets of the foaming beverage . The whole company was of course soon in a state of glorious elevation . The song and jest went round unceasingly , and peals of jovial laughter trooped away like merry elves upon the midnight air . We were in excellent humor to adopt the prayer of the following who said  --  " Oh , let us linger late to-night , Nor part while wit and song are bright ; And , Joshua , make the sun stand still , That we of joy may have our fill ! " There was one gentleman who refused to participate in the festivities of the occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the progress of the banquet with a troubled brow ; yet he did not dare to openly remonstrate , through fear of offending Mr. Pitt , and other valuable boarders . Unfortunately for the harmony of the festival , a party of drunken students from Cambridge dropped in , and I instantly saw that a row was inevitable . After unceremoniously helping themselves to drink , the students gazed at our strange-looking company superciliously , and one of them remarked with a sneer  --  " What fools are these , dressed up in this absurd manner ? Oh , they must be monkies , the property of some enterprising organ-grinder . Let them dance before me , for my soul is heavy , and I would be gay ! " Here little Billy Eaton , the writer , who was one of our party , fired up and obligingly offered to fight and whip the man with the heavy soul , for and in consideration of the trifling sum of one cent . This handsome offer was accepted ; but , before the gentlemen could strip for the combat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chairs were brandished , canes were flourished and decanters were hurled , to the great destruction of mirrors and other fragile property . The bar was overturned , and the din of battle was awful to hear . Notwithstanding the uproar and confusion that prevailed , I could not help noticing poor Uriah , who , in the dimly-lighted hall , was quietly dancing an insane polka , accompanying his movements by low howls of despair . The little man had temporarily lost his few wits , that was plain . The combat raged with undiminished fury . Our clown attacked a student with his bass-drum , one end of which burst in , imprisoning the representative of the seat of learning , who found it impossible to extricate himself from his musical predicament . Sam Palmer , with his fish-horn , did tremendous execution ; while Jack Adams was equally effective with his dinner-bell which , at every blow , sounded forth a note of warning . The heroic P. Jones performed prodigies of valor , and covered himself with glory . This wonderful young man , having planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of a pugilistic frog , and boldly defied his enemies to " come on and be punched . " At the commencement of the fight , Abbott coiled himself up under the table , and was seen no more ; while Handiboe fled for safety to the cole-hole . The battle was at its height , and the bird of victory seemed about to perch upon the banner of the " Uncles and Nephews , " when some reckless , hardened individual turned off the gas , thus producing total darkness . This made matters ten times worse than ever , for it was impossible to distinguish friends from foes . Suddenly , in rushed a posse of watchmen , headed by the renowned Marshal Tukey , and bearing torches . Many of the combatants were arrested , and but few contrived to make their escape . I had the honor of figuring among the unlucky ones ; and , with my companions passed the night in durance vile . In the morning , when day light feebly penetrated our gloomy dungeon , what a strange-looking spectacle presented itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were about a score of men , the majority of them arrayed in the soiled and torn theatrical dresses . These unhappy individuals afforded a most melancholy sight , as many of them had black eyes , bruised noses and battered visages . " D  --   --  d pretty fools we 've made of ourselves , " said Macbeth , one of whose optics had been highly discolored . " Yes , " groaned Othello , whose black eyes were only partially concealed by the yellow color which he had smeared over his face  --  " and here we are in the jug , where we shall be compelled to remain all day , and lose all the fun of the Fourth of July . " " That is n't the worst of it , " sighed Hamlet , whose royal frontispiece had received severe damage  --  " I am on the bills to play twice this afternoon and once this evening , and my being absent will cause me to be forfeited , if not discharged . D  --   --  n those college students ! What the devil became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , " said I  --  " they are in a separate apartment . Of course the officers would not put them in with us , for that would be encouraging a renewal of the fight . " " My head aches horribly , " remarked Richard , Duke of Gloster  --  " I would give my kingdom for a drink ! " " And I , " observed Shylock  --  " would like a pound of flesh , providing it were beefsteak , for I am almost famished . " " Hah ! what a hog ! " growled Cardinal Richelieu , one side of whose face had been " cove in " most dreadfully  --  " to think of eating at such a time as this ! " " Hark , " said Claude Melnott , whose handsome countenance had been knocked completely out of shape , and who looked as if he had just returned from the wars rather the worse for wear ; " hark ! Do n't you hear the sound of artillery , and of music ? The ceremonies and festivities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were with Pauline , in our palace on the lake of Como ! " " Dry up , you fool ! " angrily exclaimed the aged and venerable King Lear , whose nasal organ exhibited signs of its having sustained a violent contusion  --  " I have n't closed an eye during the whole night , and now you keep me awake with your infernal jabbering . Shut up , I say ! " " Oh , shut up be blowed ! " said P. Jones  --  " how can a man shut up when he thinks of the good budge ( rum ) he loses by being shut up here ? Rube Meer , is n't this too bad ? " " Worse than the time when I sent on a fishing excursion with Jim Morse , " groaned poor Rube , as he fumbled in his pocket for a match with which to light his pipe , " has anybody got a rope with which a fellow could contrive to hang himself ? " " I say , Jack Adams , " said Sam Palmer , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Smith and old Kimball say , when we do n't make our appearance to-day , the busiest day in the whole year ? " " I care not , " replied Jack , as he fondly pressed the portrait of his Katy to his lips , " so long as this blessed consolation is left me , the world may do its worst ! Frown on , ye fiends of misfortune ! I defy ye all , so long as my Katy Darling remains but true ! " " That 's the one ! " shouted the bold Dick Brown , as " usher " at the National Theatre , " let us have the song of Katy Darling , and all join in the chorus . " This was done ; and from the depths of that gloomy dungeon rolled forth the words , in tones of thunder  --  " Did they tell thee I was false , Katy Darling ? " Suddenly , to our great joy , the ponderous iron door of the dungeon was unlocked and thrown open , and an officer announced that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage to satisfy the landlord of the Pemberton House for the damage he had sustained . This we of course agreed to do , it being understood that the college students should be compelled to pay one-half the amount , which was certainly no more than right , as they had perpetrated half the damage , and had commenced the row in the first place . The landlord having received sufficient security that his damages would be made whole , we were all set at liberty , to our most intense delight , for we had anticipated being imprisoned during the whole of that glorious day . We left the house of bondage , and , as we passed through the already crowded streets , our fantastic dresses and strange appearance generally , collected a mob at our heels , which , in broad daylight , was certainly rather annoying . However , we soon reached the theatre , and resumed our own proper habiliments . It was announced upon the bills of the theatre that a certain actor would that evening deliver an original Fourth of July poem . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single line had I committed to paper . The actor was in a terrible quandary , and swore that his failure to recite the poem , as announced , would render him unpopular with the public and ruin him forever . Telling him to keep cool and call again in two hours , I sat down to my writing-desk and dashed off a poem of considerable length . My pen flew with the rapidity of lightning , words and ideas crowded upon me in overwhelming numbers , and in three-quarters of an hour my work was done ! I sent for the actor who was astonished at the brief space of time in which I had performed the task . Having heard me read the poem , he declared himself to be delighted with it ; and , with all due humility and modesty , I must say that the production did possess considerable merit . I had avoided the usual stereotyped allusions to the " star spangled banner , " to the " Ameri-eagle , " to the " blood of our forefathers , " &amp;c. ;  --  and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressed people arising in their might to throw off the yoke of bondage and assert their independence as a nation . The actor soon committed the poem to memory ; and , having rehearsed it over to me and found himself perfect , he departed . That night he recited it from the stage to a dense audience ; and , during its delivery and at its conclusion , I had the satisfaction of listening to the most delicious music that an author 's ears can ever know , the clapping of hands , and deafening peals of applause . CONCLUSION My Parting Bow . Several years have passed since the date of the events last narrated . Those years have been crowded with adventures full as extraordinary as those already detailed ; but alas ! neither time nor space will at present , admit of my giving them to the public . Perhaps , at some future time , I may make up for this deficiency , if my life is spared . The reader may rest assured of one thing :  --  that not one single word of fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I wander in the realms of romance , when there are more startling facts at my command than I can possibly make use of ? Is not truth stranger than fiction ? Every day 's experience proves such to be the case . I can not close up these pages without availing myself of the opportunity to return my thanks in this public manner , to several gentlemen from whom I have received courtesies and acts of kindness . First and foremost , there is Jerry Etheridge , a man of great political influence and historical learning . To this distinguished gentleman I am indebted for an act of generosity that rescued me from a serious embarrassment . I am not the only recipient of his bounty , for I know many others who have applied to him in times of need , and who have left him , encouraged by his cheering words and relieved by his liberality . He is one of those true philanthropists who never publish their good deeds to others . I consider that when one man befriends another and then tells of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no gratitude is due the one who confers the benefit , which he bestows , perhaps just on purpose to acquire a reputation for whole-souled benevolence , and not out of any particular good-will to the other . I am also under obligation to Mr. W.R. GOODALL , the promising young American actor , who will one day , I predict , occupy a most elevated position in the profession which he has adopted , and for which he is peculiarly qualified . Who that ever heard his famous imitations , as Jeremiah Clip , will hesitate to admit that he is a young man of the most extraordinary talent ? NED SANDFORD and JIM LANERGAN , both of whom are now while I write this , playing at the Broadway Theatre , I return my most sincere thanks for favors received ; and I trust that they will pardon me for making this public allusion to them . Finally , to every person who has , through disinterested motive , treated me with kindness and consideration , I would say  --  friends , your goodness shall never be forgotten while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will , I presume , continue to snarl at my heels like mongrel curs . Their miserable attempts to injure me will only rebound back upon themselves . I am above the reach of their malignity , and shall pursue my own independent course regardless of their spleen . Nearly one year has now elapsed since I left Boston  --  a place that I can not but regard with some degree of affectionate remembrance ; for , with all its faults , I like it still . It is possible that I may hereafter continue to write tales for the public amusement . Should I conclude to continue in my business as a writer , I shall always , as heretofore , labor to produce that which is interesting , exciting and founded on truth , and entirely unobjectionable in a moral point of view . Unlike many so-called writers who throw off a quantity of trash and care not how it fills up space , I am always willing to bestow time and toil upon my work , for the sake of my own credit , for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and in order to give the public perfect satisfaction . Reader , fare thee well ! We may never meet again ; but I thank thee for accompanying me from the beginning to THE END ***
