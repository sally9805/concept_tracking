ART . IlL-LIFE AND LETTERS OF NIEBUIIR . The Life and Letters of Barthold George Niebuhr , with Essays on his Character and Influence . By the CHEVALIER BUNSEN , and Professors BRANDIS and LORBELL . New-York : Harper &amp; Brothers , 3*29 and 331 Pearl Street , Franklin Square . 1852 . New Haven : T. H. Pease . WE are glad to have at last a biography of this distinguished historian , in our own language . The original work , entitled " Lebensnachrichten ilber Bartliold Georg Niebuhr , aus Brie fen desselben und aus Erinnerungen einigen seiner ndchsten Freunde , " was published at Hamburg in 1838 . A very full compilation from these memorials appeared in the London Quarterly Review in 1840 . But the present , we believe , is the first tran*lation into English , and this contains but about one half of the original letters : that portion of the correspondence which relates to learned subjects being reserved for a separate publication . Niebuhr lived in the most exciting period of modern history . In his youth , the commotions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried his already developed faculty of historical sagacity and prophecy ; the early years of his manhood were passed in struggling against the overshadowing power of the military despotism which arose out of that event ; and he died before the revolutions of 1830 had spent their first force . In his public life , he was distinguished as a financier and diplomatist , but he will be remembered principally as the Historian of Rome . He has had many equals , perhaps superiors , in the former respect ; but in the latter , he stands alone , without a rival . We shall not , therefore , dwell upon the political and official side of his life . Indeed , his public labors , though they consumed the greater part of the active years of his life , were quite secondary to the great purpose for which he seems to have been designed  --  to re-construct and re-write the history of Rome . Perhaps , the scholar has never lived , all of whose studies so entirely centered around one grand idea , and so universally tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a few dates which indicate the important points in the development and growth of his intellectual and moral character , and which will make our view of him more distinct . Barthold George Niebuhr was born at Copenhagen , August // 27 , 1776 . In 1778 , his father removed to Meldorf , the chief town of South Dithrnarsh , and here the son received the whole of his education , previous to entering the University . He became a member of the University of Kiel in 1794 , and remained till 1798 , when by the advice of his father he became private secretary to the Danish Minister of Finance , and took up his residence in Copenhagen . He left Copenhagen in 1798 , and visited England and Scotland . He resided about a year in Edinburgh , attending the lectures of the University , in the departments of science . He returned in 1799 , and in 1800 received an appointment to an honorable station from the King of Denmark , in which he continued till 1806 . He then entered the civil service of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he became a Professor of History in the new University of Berlin . in 1813 , he was recalled by the King into public service , first as Minister of Finance till 1816 , and then as Prussian Embassador to the Court of Rome till 1823 . He was then , at his own request , relieved from all political employmen ts , and appointed to the Professorship of History in the University of Bonn . He died in Bonn , in January , 1831 . We believe in the aristocracy of race . The Greek proverb , the good from the good , the best from the best-&amp;7aO* * ci*'c*Oc5v , * *p*-wv-states a very general law of humanity . The family of the Niebuhrs had lived as far as the memory of man went back , as yeomen on their own marsh farm , in Hadeln , the northwestern province of Hanover . They were free proprietors and free men . The first of the family that became known beyond their native marshes was Carsten Niebuhr , the celebrated Arabian traveler , and the father of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traits which most marked his character were sincerity and truthfulness . Without genuis and without any tendency whatever to philosophical speculation , he lived , as his son says in his memoir of him , in observation and perception . And there was an accuracy and precision in his observations of whatever caine before him , and a literal fidelity in reporting these observations , which made him the most trustworthy of travelers , and which re-appeared in the son , and made him one of the most truth-loving of historians . But although he was a plain matter of fact man , without a trace of imagination , in nowise given to poetry , he proved himself to possess a deep vein of sentiment . For just as he was ready to start on a second journey of exploration , into the heart of Africa , he fell in love-gave up his cherished plans and aims of lifemarried , resigned his office as an engineer-removed to the small village of Meldorf in South Dithmarsh , away from all the // society to which he was accustomed , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected , till his death , which happened in 1815 . But the historian united in him both parents . " I have inherited , " he says , " the vehemence and sensitiveness of my disposition , together with my features , from my mother . " We are always interested in the education of really great men . The more we observe and the more we read , the more satisfied are we that the errors and intellectual faults of this period are seldom overcome or remedied in full in subsequent years , whereas the germs of all the great works of the life are therein developed , and the mode of their development affects the after growth . The poem  --  the philosophical system ,  --  the history-which stands forth among the monuments of human intellect , is born early-matures slowly  --  and has in it the whole life of the individual . The loss of time in education , not unfrequently , of entire years , is one of the most painful subjects of future reflection . And this loss is felt more and more throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habits of the youth are the habits of the man ;  --  the intellect which is not early accustomed to grasp with precision , will ever continue to state and judge inaccurately ; the infirmity of will which resists not the wanderings of the mind with the fool 's eyes to the ends of the earth , will become weaker rather than stronger ; the memory which is left to take care of itself and which as a consequence turns out a faithless friend , will continue unreliable and of little use . No doubt , there are many men of decided talents , who are not what are called scholars during the course of their education , that become distinguished in after life ; but we feel sure , that if such would own the truth , we should learn that they have suffered in some respects all their days for the negligences or misapplication of their minds in early years . The language of Sir Walter Scott , addressed to his son , reveals a secret which a very great many of distinguished men keep locked up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful culture of the powers , in severe study , always operates unspent through life . Niebuhr was in many respects well educated , for the great business of his life ; perhaps he would not have been better educated , if it had been revealed to the father , that his son was to be the great historian of Rome , instead of a learned traveler , a diplomatist , or a financier . We may be assured first of all that the child was trained to habits of exact observation , and literal accuracy of statement . Geography would of course be early and faithfully taught . We doubt not that no little of the // extreme accuracy of the historian , in all geographical and antiquarian knowledge , may be traced to the father 's reverence for that " map of ancient Gaul of D'Anville , " which always lay before them as they read together C*sar 's Commentaries , and upon which the son was obliged " to look out every place as it occurred , and to tell its exact situation . " r* he historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , well remembered these early instructions , and has left a delightful picture of his school-boy days : " He instructed both of us in geography , and related to us many passages of history . He taught me English aud French-better , at any rate , than they would have been taught by anybody else in such a place ; and something of mathematics , in which he would have proceeded much farther , had not want of zeal and desire in in e unfortunately destroyed all his pleasure in the occupation . One thing indeed was characteristic of his whole system of teaching : - as he had no idea how anybody could have knowledge of any kind placed before him , and not seize it with the greatest delight and avidity , and hold to it with the steadiest perseverance , he became disinclined to teach whenever we appeared inattentive or reluctant to learn . As the first instructions I received in Latin , before I had the good fortune to become a scholar of the learned and excellent J*ger , were very defective , he helped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions had no pretension to be grammatical ; - his knowledge of the language , so far as it went , was gained entirely by reading , and by looking at it as a whole . He was of opinion , that a man did not deserve to learn what he had not principally worked out for himself ; and that a teacher should be only a helper to assist the pupil out of otherwise inexplicable difficulties . From these causes his attempts to teach me Arabic , when he had already lost that facility in speaking it without which it is impossible to dispense with grammatical instruction , to his disappointment and my shame , did not succeed . When I afterwards taught it myself ; and sent him translations from it , he was greatly delighted . " I have the most lively recollection of many descriptions of the structure of the universe , and accounts of eastern countries , which he used to tell me , instead of fairy tales , when he took me on his knee before I went to bed . The history of Mohammed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom he had the deepest veneration-of the conquests and spread of Islamism-of the virtues of the heroes of the new faith , and of the Turkish converts , were imprinted on my childish imagination in the liveliest colors . Historical works on these same subjects were nearly the first books that fell into my hands . " I recollect too , that on the Christmas-eve of my tenth year , by way of making the day one of peculiar solemnity and rejoicing to me , lie went to a beautiful chest containing his manuscripts , which was regarded by us children , and indeed by the whole household , as a sort of ark of the covenant ; - took out the papers relating to Africa , and read to me from them . He had taught me to draw maps , and with his encouragement and assistance I soon produced maps of Habbesh and Sudan . " I could not make him a more welcome birthday present than a sketch of the geography of eastern countries , or translations from voyages and travels , executed as might be expected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I might be his successor as a traveler in the East . But the influence of a very tender and anxious mother upon my physical training and constitution thwarted his plan almost as soon as it was formed . In consequence of her opposition , my father afterwards gave up all thoughts of it . " The distinguished kindness he had experienced from the English , and the services which he had been able to render to the East India Company by throwing light on the navigation of the higher part of the Red Sea , led him to entertain the idea of sending me , as soon as I was old enough , to India . With this scheme , // which , plausible as it was , he was afterwards as glad to see frustrated as I was myself , many things in the education he gave me were intimately connected . He taught me , by preference , out of English books , and put English works of all sorts into my hands ; at a very early age he gave me a regular supply of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the powerful influence they have had on my maturer life , but as indications of his character . " He entered with the greatest indulgence and interest into the half precocious , half infantine thoughts of the boy ; built castles in the air with him ; conversed with him upon all the topics of the day , and communicated to him his ideas and views on all subjects that came under discourse . Thus , when we spoke of fortification , he brought out books and plans , and made me draw and measure polygons . " Thus the son . Let us now hear the father . The elder Niehuhr thus announces an event quite important in the life of the youthful scholar : " Barthold has begun to-day to learn the Greek alphabet , and shall now proceed to write German in Greek charscters . ' Somewhat later , writing to the same individual , he says , He studied the Greek alphabet only for a single day , and had no further trouble with it ; he did it with very little help from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know his equal ; but he requires to be managed in a peculiar way . May God preserve our lives , and give us grace to guide him aright ! Oh , if he could but learn to control the warmth of his temper ; I believe I might say his pride . He is no longer so passionate with his sister ; but if he stumbles in the least in repeating his lessons , or if his scribblings are alluded to , he fires up instantly . He can not bear to be praised for them , because he believes that he does not deserve it . In short , I repeat it , he is proud ; he wants to know every thing , and is angry if he does not know it . May the Almighty guide and direct him 1 ' Then he continues , My wife complains that I find fault with Barthold unnecessarily . I did not mean to do so . He is an extraordinary good little fellow , but he must be managed in an extraordinary way , and I pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him properly . " ' It was fortunate for the harmonious development of his powers , that he early enjoyed the society of several men of letters who could understand and properly appreciate the peculiarities of his mind , particularly , the celebrated Voss , and Boje , the editor of the " Deutsches Museum . " The latter thus writes of him : " This reminds me of little Niebuhr . His docility , his industry , and his devoted love for me , procure me many a pleasant hour . A short time back , I was reading Macbeth ' aloud to his parents without taking any notice of him , till I saw what an impression it made upon him . Then I tried to render it all ir*telligible to him , and even explained to him how the witches were only poetical beirgs . When I was gone , he sat down ( he is not yet seven years old , ) and wrote it all out on seven sheets of paper , without omitting one important point , and certainly without any expectation of receiving praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what he had written , and showed it to me , lie cried for fear he had not done it welL Since then he writes down every thing of importance that he hears from his father or me . We seldom praise him , but just quietly tell him where he has made any mistake , and he avoids the fault for the future . " We have not much sympathy with infant prodigies ; but the developments of the faculties and the acquisition of knowledge , in the present case , were so much in keeping with the whole // subsequent life , and were withal so extraordinary , that we will speak of them . We are informed that " In the conversations which took place among thesefriends and foreigners during their visits to Holstein , the boy , then eleven or twelve years of age , was frequently called to take part , and not seldom information was asked of him regarding geographical , statistical , historical and other subjects , and given in a manner which excited their astonishment . His father used often to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his darling son had become his joy and pride . His statistical knowledge was even then extraordinary ; he was frequently assiduously engaged in subjects of this nature , such for instance as working out lists of mortality . " It is also said , " That when the war in Turkey broke out in the year 1787 , it so strongly excited the child 's mind , that he not only talked of it in his sleep at night , hut fancied himself in his dreams reading the newspapers , and repeating the intelligence they contained about the war ; and his ideas on these subjects were so well arranged , and founded on so accurate a knowledge of the country , and the situation of the towns , that the realization of his nightly anticipations generally appeared in the journals a short time afterward . " This faculty of divination had full scope for exercise in the early part of the French revolution , and his conjectures were so frequently correct as " to excite the astonishment even of the eminent statesman Count Bernstoff , that such a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and events . He took a still deeper interest in the disturbances in the Netherlands , in the Emperor Joseph 's times . " He was impelled to this peculiar exercise of the judgment by the necessities of his nature , and his success depended upon his exact geographical and historical knowledge , together with a kind of instinctive power in the combination of events and the evolution of results . But the time approaches for the young man to enter the University , as we are informed by his father : " Barthold has not troubled his head so much about the Turks and the Emperorfor some time past , but has made up his mind to enter the highest class at Easter , and is therefore busily engaged with the history of literature . He revels so in the Latin authors that I am almost obliged to restrain his ardor . " Niebuhr entered the University of Kiel in the Spring of 1794 . He attended sevei-al courses of lectures , on Germaa history , Jurisprudence , Logic and Metaphysics , and Aesthetics* reserving the study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other studies . The lectuies on Germau history do not seem to have been of much 5profit to him ; he writes to his father , " I already know nearly all that comes in them . " But he has most to say in his letters about Reinhold 's Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant . We can track him : on the 7th of June , ( 1794 , ) he tells his father- " We have now come to the faculty of Cognition , and consequently have finish* // ed the Representional Faculty . " But he complains sorely : " if it were possible for him to develop all his ideas , or even some of them , in my mind with half his clearness of thought , how even would my skepticism vanish . " A little after he writes home that the Professors think him " quite competent to take the Critique ' in hand . " But on the whole , he could not force himself to prosecute these studies far-he continually returns to his historical investigations . Thus far his education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philosophy , and history , and we can not but think that these studies are the principal instruments of the best intellectual discipline . He , however , very properly added to these the study of the physical sciences , which he prosecuted in Edinburgh . Whether he was altogether fortunate in the entire neglect of the pure mathematics , we will not undertake to say ; it must be remembered , however , that with respect to the capacity for strict and persistent attention which they are so well adapted to strengthen , he scarce needed any training . We have said that Niebuhr was well educated , but he himself thought otherwise ; and , as the letter in which this opinion is expressed , contains his own estimate of himself , we will make a quotation from it . It was written to Jacobi , on the occasion of sending him the first volume of his history : " I was born with an inward discord , the existence of which I can trace back to my earliest childhood , though it was afterward much aggravated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a mixture of such an education with no education at all . I did not conceal this from you in former days . Had I to choose my own endowments for another life on earth , I would not wish to possess greater facility in taking up impressions from the external world , in retaining and coinbin. ing them into new forms within an inward world of imagination , full of the most various and animated movement , nor a memory more accurate or more at command , ( a faculty inseparable from the former , ) than nature has granted me . Much advantage might have been derived from these gifts in childhood ; perhaps , in some pursuits , they might have insured me every success ; nay , this result would have arisen spontaneously , had I not been subjected to a kind of education , which could only have been useful to a mind of precisely the opposite description . " Our great seclusion from the world , in a quiet little provincial town , the prohibition . from our earliest years , to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials for the insatiable requirements of my childish fancy , not from life and nature , but from books , engravings and conversation . Thus , my imagination laid no hold on the realities around me , but absorbed into her dominions all that I read  --  and I read without limit and without aim-while the actual world was impenetrable to my gaze ; so that I became almost incapable of apprehending any thing which had not already been apprehended by another-of forming a mental picture of any thing which had not before been shaped into a distinct conception by another . It is true that , in this second-hand world , I was very learned , and could even at a very early age , pronounce opinions like a grown-np person ; but the truth in me and around me was vailed from my eyes  --  the genuine truth of objective reason . Even when I grew older , and studied antiquity with intense interest , the chief use I made of my knowledge , for a long time , was to give fresh variety and brilliancy to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my // mother 's anxiety about it , I was so much confined to the house that I was like a caged bird , and lost all natural spirit and liveliness , and the true life of childhood , the observations and ideas of which must form the basis of those peculiar to a more devehuped age , just as the early use of the body is the basis of its after training . No one ever thought of asking what 1 was doing , and how I did it ; and it was not until my thirteenth year , that I received any regular instruction . My friends were satisfied at seeing that I was diligently employed , and that , though I had at first no teaching , I was equal to boys of my age in things for which they had had regular masters , and soon surpassed them when I had the same advantages , while , moreover , I was as well acquainted with a thousand matters , to be learned from books , as a grown-up man . Yet , after a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , notwithstanding my empire in the air , my life in the actual world was poor and powerless ; that the perception of realities alone possesses truth and worth ; that on it are founded all imaginative productions which have any value at all , and that there is nothing truly worthy of respect but that depth of mind which makes a man master of truth in its first principles . As soon as I bad to enter on the sciences , properly so called , I found myself in a difficulty , and , unfortunately , I took once more the easiest path , and left on one side whatever cost me some trouble to acquire . I was often on the verge of a mental revolution , but it never actually took place ; now and then , indeed , I planted my foot on the firm ground , and , when that happened , I made some progress . " We apprehend there is some fallacy in the adverse judgments which distinguished men have sometimes passed upon the mode of their education . No education can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents or teachers completely to adjust the balance of the powers of the mind and to give to each its due development ; much less is it possible so to forecast the future course of life as to adapt the education in all respects to that course . There will be some deficiencies , and these are very naturally magnified in importance by those who suffer from them . Besides , it is not always possible to control the impulses of a decided talent for particular courses of study , and those who complain most have not unfrequently only their own waywardness to blame . This , however , was not the case with Niebuhr . Indeed , we somewhat doubt whether the habits of picturing out in a world of imagination , the scenes and events of which he read and his acquaintance with the realities of the world of business which drew him from this " second-hand world , " were not , in their mutual action and re-action , of the utmost importance to the future historian . They disciplined that faculty of combination and representation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Niebuhr was only two years at the University , he made one acquisition surpassing everything which he ever obtained elsewhere . We speak of this matter in his own language : " Yesterday afternocn I felt very gloomy ; I set off to Eensler 's to cheer myself up . I went into the library , and had not been long there , when the servant was sent to ask me down stairs . I found , besides Hensler 's wife and daughter-in-law , // the mother and sister of the latter-consequently countrywomen of mine from Dithmarsh  --  and several others . I felt then really , to a painful degree , the timidity and bashfulness before ladies of which I wrote to you lately . However much I may improve iii other society , I am sure I must get worse and worse every day in their eyes ; and so , out of downright shyness , I scarcely dare speak to a lady ; and as I know , once for all , that I must be insupportable to them , their presence becomes disagreeable to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began to talk to Miss Behrens , and young Mrs. Hensler . Now , in gratitude and candor , I must confess that they were sociable enough toward me to have set me at my ease if my shyness were not so deeply rooted . But it is of no use . I avoid them , and would rather be guilty of impoliteness , by avoiding them , than by speaking to them , which I should now feel to be the greatest impoliteness of alL At last , however , especially through taking a walk with Hensler and Dr. Behrens , I got so roused up that my awkwardness vanished , and I went home cured . Thus I was healed by Hensler 's words and looks , " We have only to go forward two or three years to find quite a change come over this " shyness , " and to May , 1800 , to behold him married to the aforesaid " Miss Behrens , " who was to him hope , and joy , and strength . But even in this affair of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a Roman character , and this was always my ideal of a citizen 's wife ; pride , intellect , the most retiring modesty , unbounded love , constancy , and gentleness . In history we only meet with such women among the Roman matrons  --  the Calpurnias , Portias , Arrias . " It should also be explained that " young Mrs. Hensler " was the widow of a son of the aged Professor Hensler . She was six years older than Niebuhr , and between them a most intimate and endearing friendship was formed , which lasted till death . It was she to whom most of the letters in this volume were directed . She extended her friendship beyond death in the charge of his orphan children which she undertook , and in the care of his memory which she has embalmed in these memorials . We pass over his residence , after his marriage , in Co pen hagen , and also his civil services in Prussia , to speak more particularly of the few years he spent in Berlin . Niebuhr 's professorship at Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He entered upon it in the autumn of 1810 , and relinquished it , on the summons of the King , in the spring of 1813 . The ablest scholars in Germany had been appointed to professorships in the new University , and Niebuhr found congenial friends in Schleiermacher , Savigny , Spalding , Buttmann , and Heindorf . These distinguished men lived in the uttermost harmony , attending each other 's lectures and striving without jealousy , for eminence in their several fields of investigatidn . A philological club assembled a number of them at each other 's houses once a week , to read and correct some classical author , the evening concluding with a supper , at which freedom and hilarity prevailed . Niebuhr , referring to it says , " we are reading // and emendating Herodotus . I explain the historical , others , the gramatical part , and thus we really form a miniature academy . " In the second winter of his residence , we have this picture of his social life . He tells Madame Hensler ,  --  " Our life flows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I attend my society ; four days a week , I hear Schleiermacher ; two days I lecture myself ; we seldom go into company . One evening in the week the Savignys and ourselves generally spend together , and we often spend an evening with one or another of our friends besides . " - His lectures from the first awakened the most profound interest , and were hailed by Savigny as opening a new era for Roman history . Niebuhr had hitherto published nothing , excepting a translation of the first Philippic of Demosthenes . His uncommon powers and acquisitions were known only to a few friends . He anticipated a small class of students only , but instead of this his lectures were crowded-besides students , members of the Academy , professors of the University , public men , and officers of all ranks attended them . Niebuhr was now in the full enjoyment of his powers-his outward and inner life was in harmony  --  and he had entered upon a field of study before untrodden . Every day almost he made some new discovery . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fully possessed . It is interesting to trace the progress of his discoveries , and the continued fulfillment and the continued enlargement of his hopes . We quote from letters to Madame Hensler , to whom the family letter was regularly forwarded . " I must begin to think of publishing now , because it is while I am delivering my lectures , that my best discoveries in ancient history come to light , which , if not published , might probably be forgotten , and lost to the world . In addition to my previous discoveries , which are now all gaining in clearness and certainty , I have already made several new ones , some of which are very important , in the progress of my labors . " A few days later , he announces the discovery of " the cyclical system of the old Italian mode of reckoning the year . " Again , " the lectures too are inspirit ing , because they require persevering researches , which I venture to say can not remain unfruitful to me , and they are more exciting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth inspired by fresh thoughts and discoveries , and afterwards converse with those who have heard them , and . to whom they are as new as to myself . This makes the lectures a positive delight to me , and I feel already quite averse to bring them to a close . " It was amidst such happy studies , in the bosom of congenial // society , and in the flush of brilliant discoveries , that the most remarkable book of modern times  --  the History of Rome-was written and published . We say the most remarkable book ; for if Niebuhr is right , then all Roman writers on Roman history are wrong ; if his history is to be relied on , much of theirs is to be rejected ; if he has truly developed the constitution of the Roman State , then that history has been buried in obscurity for more than eighteen hundred years , and it has been reserved for a modern of the nineteenth century to bring it to light . And yet it is the opinion of scholars most competent to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great majority of historians-that Niebuhr has actually made this discovery , and that his re-construction of Roman History is to be taken as in the main the only true history . But , still , this work was no miraculous thing ; it had a natural growth in the mind of its author . Niehuhr was a historian from his earliest years . It was an instinct of his nature , to develop , to combine , to construct . While in the University , he says , " history is my vocation . " " From the peculiar direction of my mind and talents , I believe that nature intended me for a literary man , an historian of ancient and modern times , a statesman and perhaps a man of the world ; although the last , thank God , neither in the proper sense of the word , nor in the horrible one that is usually associated with it . Meanwhile , my individual taste will certainly carry the day : and if my name is ever to be spoken of , I shall be known as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even the philosophy of Kant , which was then in the glow of youthful vigor and triumph , was not able to withdraw him from historical studies . His friends urged him to devote himself in the University at first to this study , and he did so  --  but amidst the effort we hear him say , " History grows dearer and dearer to me , so much so , that my ardor in reading history interferes with my zeal for philosophy , while no philosophy can blunt my inclination to history . " He early began to make discoveries , and even in the University , he advanced views which were new to learned scholars . Thus , in writing to his father , he says , " I have just returned from Hensler 's again . My ideas about the origin of the Greek tribes , the history of the colonization of the Greek cities , and my notions in general about the earliest migration from west to east , are new to him , and he thinks it probable they may be correct . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clear a form as I can . " Throughout the interval between leaving the University and his settlement as professor at Berlin , no public // employments could quench his zeal in the pursuit of historical truth ; his studies , though various , were all made to converge to one point . We catch occasional glimpses of these studies in his correspondence . Thus he writes his father in 1798 ,  --  " I have lately read parts of Theophanes , and Luitprand on the Byzantine empire , and yesterday meditated on some passages of Xenophon concerning the Greek tactics , which I have been studying among other things this winter , and of which I have obtained a tolerable conception , especially those of the Macedonians and Lacedaemonians . " We find him , in 1802 , studying Arabic , and translating a part of Elwakidi 's history of the Conquest of Asia , under the first Kaliphs , from a manuscript in the library of Copenhagen ; and , again the next year , at work on a treatise as to the nature of the Roman public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;c. , in which his views were different from the current ones ; and again , studying Dionysius of Halicarnassus , in pursuit of the track of proof for his conviction , that in very early times a mutual acquaintance and traffic subsisted between Rome and Greece . But he has himself drawn so lively a picture of himself , in letters written to Count Moltke , one in 1804 , on occasion of the visit of the latter to italy , and another after his return , that we prefer to give them almost entire " Physical exhaustion alone can make me unfit at times for those things , which used to be equally dear and interesting to us both ; every moment of leisure carries me back to them ; and if Turgot , under the severest financial labors , kept his tastes and intellect unchanged , you ought to give me credit for doing the same . While you were preparing to tread the classic soil , and when you arrived in Italy , I was living in a . work that afforded me hours of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in investigating the Roman history from its first beginning to the times of the tyranny , in all the remains of ancient authors that I could procure . This work gaxe me a deep and living insight into Roman antiquity , such as I never had before , and such as made me perceive , at the same time , clearly and vividly , that the representations of all the moderns , without exception . are but mistaken , imperfect glimpses of the truth . My studies were interrupted by a journey on official affairs to Hamburgb , Leipsic and Frankfurt ; a journey which did not on the whole bring me much pleasure , because I felt it my duty to employ my whole mind on the financial matters placed in my hands ; and it was necessary to associate exclusively with those who could be useful to me in this respect . On my return home , I resumed my investigations , with redoubled energy , arid for the first time felt strongly the consciousness , that . I could produce something worthy of study , of fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a work . I began a treatise , of comprehensive scope and courageous freedom of thought , on the Roman laws of property , and the history of the Agrarian laws . An influx of business weighed me down for some time , and made it impossible for me to complete this treatise for our Scandinavian Society , to which I had intended to send it ; however , it shall be finished , and ainit a series of papers on isolated topics and periods of ancient history . My first essay will be widely condemned , and no nobleman and landed pro . prietor will like it , at l*st if he is consistent . I do not even expect it from you ; but I shall write , as I think and speak , in the strength of my unalterable convictions , as the old Romans would approve and praise , were they still among us. // " I could envy you the happiness of having lived so long in Rome . You will bring home ineffaceable recollections of those scenes . *hall you not see Samnium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny myself , if I had those means of assuring my safety which are at your command . If you get so far , think of me . Every field there is classic . I think you will hardly return without having seen the regions which equal in importance the sublimest ruins of Rome . Could you procure me at Rome one of the celebrated Samnian denarii , and an Attic tetradrachma ? If you pass through Ravenna , do not overlook the tomb of Theodoric , nor the old mosaics in the churches . All travelers despise Ravenna , and yet it is the link that binds ancient and modern history together , and much has been preserved within its walls . " * * * * " I envy you the recollections of your Italian journey . It is a hard thought to me , that I shall never see the land that was the theatre of deeds , with which I may perhaps claim a closer acquair*tance than any of my contemporaries . I have stu ( lied the Ruinin history with all the effort of which my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that 1 may assume that acquaintance without vanity . This history will , also , if I write , form the subject of most of my works . " But calculations are my occupations-merchants , Jews , and brokers my society . Alcibiades was not wrong when he said , that among Thracians and Persians you must distinguish yourself after their fashion , ( if you must or will live among them , I add , fur truly it is better to remain away ; ) and thus it is my ambition to rival the Jews , and surpass our merchants , in the cunning of trade . You would not believe with what respect the Jews regard me ; only they can not understand my having no private advantage in view . But I am heartily sick of this life . Have you seen the manuscript rolls at Pompeii , and do you know if any of them will be printed before long , and how they are to be obtained I Write me word about this  --  and if you are able to inquire of any one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how one can obtain a copy of the Philodemus , printed in 1793 l " But the four years in which Niebuhr was in the Prussian civil service , ( 1806-1810 , ) were the most hostile to his historical studies . It was in the midst of the wars with Bonaparte , the successive defeats of the Prussians , and the dissolution of the Prussian government , that labors and anxieties overwhelmed him , and he says , " I am often seized with regret when I think of my beautiful researches into history ,  --  my happy meditations on dark periods-my power of bringing them vividly before my mind 's eye-7my life in antiquity . Where is all this gone ? Shall I never renew it ? Shall I ever be able to restori* it to fresh life ? " But , still he is pushing forward his studies even in these circumstances . While at Amsterdam , negotiating a loan for Prussia , he busied himself ( he says ) with researches into the ancient races and institutions of Northern Germany , and the study of the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot the present ; but then comes a story of the carnage at Madrid , an image of the agonies of Prussia , a recollection of my ever-beloved Denmark , and all my dreams vanish ; I feel nothing but my misery . We may also add that Niebuhr 's knowledge ofianguages was most profound and extensive . We quote fr*m a letter of his father , dated December , 1807 , upon this point : // " My son has gone to Memel with the commissariat of the army . When he found he should probably have to go to Riga , he began forthwith to learn Russian . Let us just reckon how many languages he knows already . He was only two years old when we came to Meldorf , so that we must consider-i . German , as his mother tongue . He learnt at school-2 . Latin ; 3 . Greek ; 4 . Hebrew ; and besides , in Meldorf , he learnt-5 . Danish ; 6 . English ; 7 . French ; 8 . Italian ; but only so far as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books from a vessel wrecked on the coast induced him to learn-9 . Portuguese ; 10 . Spanish ; - of Arabic , he did not learn much at home , because I had lost my lexicon , and could not quickly replace it ; - in Kiel and Copenhagen , he had opportunities of practice in speaking and writing French , English and Danish ; its Copenhagen , he learnt-li . Persian ( of Count Ludolph , the Austrian minister , who was born at Constantinople , and whose father was an acquaintance of mine , ) and 12 . Arabic , he taught himself ; in Holland he learnt-13 . Dutch ; and again in Copenhagen-14 . Swedish , and a little Icelandic ; at Memel-15 . Russian ; 16 . Slavonic ; 17 . Polish ; 18 . Bohemian ; and , 19 . Jllyrian . With the addition of Low German , this makes in all twenty languages . Forgive this effusion of my heart concerning my son . I did not mean to boast of him . " But it was not the mere knowledge of facts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials upon which he worked . Lie possessed certain powers of mind essential to the historian , some of which at least were never equaled perhaps in any other person . We mention the power of historical insight  --  the rapid understanding of the real meaning of events . This was so remarkable in him that he seemed to regard it himself as a kind of divination . He says , " the most important points are the results of sudden flashes of light and divination . " " Reflection , properly speaking , is not my forte ; what I perceive , I see with a glance , and it is not till I have reached my aim ( where , indeed , I can not fail to do so ) that I am able to connect my new point of view with the old one . " We quote one more very remarkable passage : " I am as certain of the correctness of my views as I am of my own existexice , and that I have discovered the solution of the enigma . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of understanding , and the faculty of guessing and divining . For many points , still more numerous and express proofs might be produced , than those I have brought forward . He who presumes to pronounce a judgment on this subject without knowing more than the current opinions on it , has really no voice at all in the matter . Further , it is not to be expected that every one , or even that many , should have that faculty of immediate intuition which would enable them to partake in my immovable conviction , for which I should be ready to die . " We mention , again , the power of combination and imagination . He easily combined the most scattered and remote facts into one whole , and what he could combine he could represent vividly in the imagination . It stood before him as a living reali // ty . He once told a friend , who had called on him and found him in great emotion , that he often could not bear to read more than a few pages at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that was said and done and suffered , by the persons represented . He could see Antigone leading her blind fatherthe aged fEdipus entering the grove-he could catch the music of their speech , and felt certain that he could distinguish the true accent of the Greeks , though he could not reproduce it with his barbarian tongue . He lived in the past as in the present , and aimed to reproduce it as if it were a present reality . " I wish to write history with such vividness-so to explain vague by well developed images ,  --  so to disentangle confused representntions* that the name of a Greek of the age of Thucydides and Polybius , or a Roman in the time of Cato or Tacitus , should constantly call up in the mind the fundamental idea of their character . " We mention again his memory , which is to us a most wonderful mental phenomenon . Niebuhr repeatedly speaks of it . While at the University , he says , " I am astonished at my own memory-I am dictating a short outline of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifles that have occurred from 1792 onwards . " Speaking a few years before his death of the continuation of his history , which was not yet written , he says , " it would cost me little labor , as I am so familiar with the events that , except a few corrections from memory , I can relate them as if I had been an eye-witness . " Indeed , he could trust so implicitly to his memory that he never committed any portion of his historical essays to writing , till the whole was complete in his own mind . His biographer says , that he scarcely ever forgot anything he had once heard or read , and the facts he knew remained present at all times , even in their minutest details . His wife and sister , by way of trying his memory , questioned him from the table of contents in Gibbon 's history about the most trivial things , but after carrying on the contest till they were tired , gave up all hope of ever detecting him in a momentary uncertainty , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other subject . On another occasion , talking with Professor Welcker , of Bonn , upon some subject which called for the information , he quoted the results of barometrical observations , in the different years as far back as 1770 , with perfect accuracy . Lieber mentions that he was present at a conversation with an English gentleman about some statistical statement which he had read when he resided in England , when Niebuhr dictated to him a considerable column of figures on the subject . Professor Brandis says , " No sufficient explana // tion of his memory is furnished either by the pretended laws of the association of ideas , or of the reproduction of representations , or by any logical dependence among the ideas themselves . It was equally retentive of perceptions and thoughts , of views and feeling&amp; of sights and sounds ; whatever came within the sphere of his recognition took up its due relative position in his mind with equal certainty and precision . " A great part of the Greek and Roman poetry had imprinted itself so indelibly on his memory , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could answer on the spot every allusion or quotation from the Latin poets in the notes and letters of the younger Valckenaer , who was most deeply read in those authors ; even in his later years he retained every poem which appealed strongly to his heart , whether it were a modern Greek or Servian ode , or a song of Goethe , Count Platen , or others . In his later years , at least , we scarcely think that he ever learnt anything by heart ; whenever a poetic thought which had vividly seized upon his mind was clothed in the form perfectly adapted to it , both the form and its inner spirit implanted themselves firmly within him , without the necessity of any mechanical assistance . " Besides all these intellectual qualifications , there was an earnestness and a sincerity of character , which were a better guar* antee even than the strictest verbal accuracy , of the truthfulness of his history . His whole character was truthful , and his history grew out of and embodied his character . " I have written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely with regard to the praise or blame I have dispensed , but also with respect to historical researches , that I could die on this book . " The remark of the Edinburgh Review , that Niebuhr affected paradoxes to avoid stringing together common places , is in oppo. sition to the whole character of the man , and is simply absurd . With this original , overmastering impulse , directing all his thoughts , and feelings , and studies towards one grand object , and subjecting his whole public life to its control ; with this extraordinary memory , grasping and holding every fact which through various and scattered memorials has been pre* served ; with this peculiar power of insight and combination , penetrating the significance of every event , and re-creating the past ; with this power of vivid representation , making the times and persons he would describe , stand before him with all the distinctness of present realities ; with this deep earnestness and strong moral feeling , creating an interest in the people of ancient times and their distinguished men , even greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaries-we can see that only leisure and opportunity were wanting for the production of this great work . The work was well received in Germany , and gave an impulse to the study of history . It is a little remarkable that it attracted no attention in England . A writer in the Lond6n Quarterly in 1822 , eleven years after its publication , supposes that " not half a dozen persons had read it . " Three years later , the same Review gave a fair and discriminating account of Niebuhr 's historic.al labors , though this did not hinder some one , in the same publication , even so late as 1829 , upbraiding this most learned and candid scholar , as " a pert , dull scoffer. " it was the plan of Niebuhr to continue his history down to the time of Augustus , and he supposed that he could comprehend the whole in five volumes . But before the third volume was prepared for the press , he was again summoned by the King of Prussia into public service , and the work was suspended ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till twelve years after . This was not owing , however , altogether to his public employments , but in part , for the first two or three years , to the calamity which overwhelmed him in the death of his wife , and in part , to his more extended investigations . If there be anything which pre*rninently evinces the capabilities of human nature for good , it is the reverence which men of the greatest genius and most exalted character have rendered to the deeper affections , to the unselfishness , to the purer charities of woman . How much is spoken in these few words , in reply apparently to some importunity to prosecute his history ,  --  " but you do not know , you did not see , and can not understand , how a work such as my history arises , and can alone arise-in love and joy only , not in affliction , anguish , and bereavetnent . " But the last wish of his wife was , that he should finish his history , and at length time wrought its usual effects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sacred task . We pass onward to his residence in Rome , which extended from 1816 to 1823 . Niebuhr was disappointed at Rome . " Nothing is new to me . As a child , I lay so often , for hours together , before the pictures I gave you as a keepsake , that their images were even then at that early time as distinctly impressed upon my mind , as if I had actually seen them . The ruins all date from the time of the Emperors , and he who can get up an enthusiasm about them , must at least rank Martial and Sopho* des together . " " Rome has no right to its name ; at most it should be called New Rome , ( like New York . ) Not one single street here goes in the same direction as the old one ; it is an // entirely foreign vegetation that has grown up on a part of the old soil , as insignificant and thoroughly modern in its style as possible , without nationality , without history . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Origines have been erased and a Diario di Roma ' * written over them . " The feelings , with which in early years he contemplated Rome , no longer survived : he suffered the anguish of homesickness , and though only forty years of age , thought and felt , and spoke as an aged man. - " I sit faithfully enough for hours together before my books , but memory and sagacity will not serve me as formerly ; vague recollections of things I have read . and of the existence of relations , dawn upon my mind , but refuse to let me grasp them , or to assume a distinct shape . " But he somewhat recovered the tone of his mind , though gradually . His wife-for under the guardianship of the good Madame Hensler , he has married again-bore him a son , which awakened new feelings within him ; and , what is a little remarkable , a lingering illness , from which his recovery was long doubtful , seemed to restore him to calmness and composure , and his mind became cleared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is refreshing to hear him say ,  --  " the inclination to study and work has once more awakened , and many ideas which I could never recall , have returned with full distinctness as I lay upon my silent sick bed . " - Still he never fully recovered the freshness and life of his early creative powers. - He was , as he himself tenderly said ,  --  " a lopped tree , which may put forth green boughs again , but whose glory has departed with its spreading branches . " - We shall not enter into any minute detail of his residence at Rome . His studies were chiefly historical . He made several discoveries of portions of ancient works , and edited some of them , and he was accumulating constantly materials for his history . Niebuhr returned to Germany in 1823 , and took up his residence at Bonn . In 1825 , we find him again freed from public duties , and in the unrestrained enjoyment of scholastic life ; and as in Berlin , the three years of entire leisure , after fourteen years of harassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , so , in Bonn , the leisure of the few last years of his life , after twelve years of official ' labor , rebuilt and completed it for all time . A singular circumstance set him to work again with good heart upon this great undertaking of his life . in writing a pamphlet in reply to a severe attack which had been made upon his edition of Cicero " De Republica , " an unexpected light // broke in upon his mind , illustrating a point in Roman history , of whose elucidation he had despaired for twelve years , and which had been one cause of his delay in the completion of his history . " it so happened , " he says , " that I gained this new light on the anniversary of my betrothal to my late wife , whose last wish was , I should finish my history ; and the coincidence kindled my courage to undertake the continuation which had been so long delayed . Thus my life is no longer without a vocation , and my melancholy , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition was completed in the summer of 1826 , in the recomposition of which he had spent one year of unremitted labor . It was almost a new work . A second edition of this volume was called for the next year , anti a third in 1828 ; in both of which many alterations anti additions were made . The revised edition of the second volume of the original history was published in the autumn of 1830 ; and he left a third volume about half prepared for publication , and which was afterwards given to the world under the supervision of Professor Classen . We need not , at this late day , dwell upon the value of this history . Others had detected the inconsistencies and fabulous character of the ancient histories of Rome ; it was Niebuhr 's merit to show why and how each circumstance was invented . Others had labored to overthrow ; Niebuhr labored to build up . Others had satisfied themselves with repeating the histories of the Roman writers ; Niebuhr weighed the value of their testimony , and judged the credibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world the Constitutional History of Rome . Niebuhr died January 2 , 1831 . We have already spoken sufficiently of his intellectual character . His character as a man , in all the relations of life , was not only without reproach , but was distinguished by high virtues . It is somewhat difficult to give his religious character and opinions , because we must look at him from a point of view with which we are not in this country familiar . We have no desire to make every distinguished man who may speak reverently of Christian institutions , a Confessor of the Christian religion ; nor , on the other hand , would we exclude from the ranks ( If believers , sincere and good men , who look at Christianity from points of observation different from our own . Niebuhr then held to the divine revelation of the Word of God , but he did not hold to such an inspiration as prevented historical mistakes . With this explanation we quote the following expression of his views : " He whose earthly life and sorrows were depicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Whole history had the same reality , even if it were not related // with literal exactness in any single point . Hence also the fundamental fact of miracles which , according to my conviction , must be conceded , unless we adopt the not merely incomprehensible , but absurd hypothesis , that the Holiest was a deceiver , and his disciples either dupes or liars ; and that deceivers had preached a boly religion , in which self renunciation is every thing , and in which there is nothing tending toward the erection of a priestly rule-nothing that can be acceptable to vicious inclinations . As regards a miracle in the strictest sertse , it really only requires an unprejudiced and penetrating study of nature , to see that those related are as far as possible from absurdity , and a comparison with legends , or the pretended miracles of other religions , to perceive by what a different spirit they are aninated . " According to these statements , I might , perhaps , fairly claim to be called a genuine Protestant Christian ; to be recognized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom those who make Christ into a cunning political aspirant-a skillful charlatan and jtiggler-men who , it is to be hoped , will not ( lie without receiving the punishment of indignant universal contempt , and whom you , my respected friend , no doubt likewise despise in your heart , mild as your words are with respect to these blasphemers . Nevertheless , I can not as yet make this claim for myself , nor would Luther recognize it , for I am far from having so firm a faith in these objects , so vivid a certainty of them , as of those of historical experience they are still only in and among my thoughts-not external to , and above me . " In the sense in which many , and in which you in your paper , use the term Mystics , you can not , in truth , save the Reformers themselves from this name . For are the ideas of incarnation , redemption , divine grace , any thing but mystical ? Mysticism , as I conceive , ( apart from the follies that usurp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pious man , only capable of longing and striving after a state of faith and Christian temper of mind , attains these through a supernatural assistance ; and when he has been made a partaker of them , may recetve an tllumination of the heart and mind , in a manner inexplicable by logic and psychology , and to them foolishness . Who can deny that this may give rise to the wildest fanaticism ? But , on the other hand , who can deny that people the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose , have held this belief with unshakable confidence , and that the reflection of their faith shines out in their writings and deeds ? " This was written in 1812 . His opinion of the prevailing neologism of the German theologians may be gathered from the following extract . Harms 's " Theses , " there refered to , were directed against the rationalistic tendencies of the age , and maintained the old orthodox Lutheran doctrine of the utter corruption of human nature , and the necessity of a correct creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harms 's Theses , let us , in the first place , settle the points on which we agree with each other and with Harms . In my opinion , he is not a Protestant Christian , who does not receive the historical facts of Christ 's earthly life , in their literal acceptation , with all their miracles , as equally authentic with any event recorded in history , and whose belief in them is not as firm and tranquil as his belief in the latter ; who has not the most absolute faith in the articles of the Apostles ' Creed , taken in their grammatical sense ; who does not consider every doctrine and every precept of the New Testament as undoubted divine revelation , in the sense of the Christians of the first century , who knew nothing ( if a Theopuenstia . Moreover , a Christianity after the fashion of the modern philosophers and pantheists , without a personal God , without immortality , without human individuality , without historical faith , is no Christianity at all to me ; though it may be a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often said , that I do not // know what to do with a metaphysical God , and that I will have none hut the God of the Bible , who is heart to heart with us . " " In my youth I beheld the former theological " enlightenment , " ( with disgust , indeed , although from a distance , ) during which every adherent of the old belief was an object of contempt . Oh that men woulc*build up I Nothing cac come of constraint and command in these matters . Oh that men strove , in simplicity of heart , and in union with those likeminded to themselves , to attain true , fruit-hearingfaith , piety , and love . " Do not fancy me unqualified to give my voice on this subject . I know that I am qualified , by possessing a fully adequate knowledge of the history of the church , and even of her system , of which 1 know more perhaps than you give me credit for . Here , where it is of importance to guard young men against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn my attention to theology . " While at Rome , Niebuhr had full opportunity to see the workings of the Papal religion , and we must regard his testimony as valuable at this time . He acknowledged the piety of many members of that communion . We quote the following interesting fact and speculation : " If my position did not forbid it , I should like to exhibit to the world the present state of the church here ; it might , perhaps , be of use . I have become acquainted with one very remarkable man , a peasant from Treves , who came to Rome to get absolution from the Pope for some scruples , but has met with a very contemptuous reception . From his example , it is very clear that the Romish clergy are quite right with their views in prohibiting the reading of the Bible ; for , by diligently reading the Scriptures , he had become nothing else than a very warm old Protestant pietist , without , however , being aware of it himself . He insisted boldly that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences of belief could not affect eternal happiness . He had some similarity with Jacob Boehme in the style of his mental culture , which was quite uncommon , and in the persecutions he had undergone ; was like him an enthusiast , and not free from the proud humility of the pietists , though only infected with this to a slight degree . I felt a great respect for him personally , and I hope to save him from further persecution . His history and character seem to belong to quite a different age . His case has made me think it probable that if the Protestant clergy still retained a positive belief , and the Bible were circulated in Catholic Germany , a second Reformation would not be at all impossible . " On the other hand , he fully saw the corruption of the priesthood . He declares the occupation of Rome by Bonaparte , a blessing to the counlry , and for these very remarkable reasons : " The Jeremiades on the misery of Rome under Bonaparte are the stupid twaddle of ignorant artists . To extirpate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessary amputation , and , on the whole , it was performed-my friends may cry out against me as they will-with discretion , forbearance , and moderation ; the people were employed and cared for . The population of the city was suddenly diminished , but those who remained would soon have found themselves much better ofi at all things would have been brought into a natural course . The number of births increased rapidly , the priests were no longer able to command or permit abortion ; the number of deaths diminished incredibly . The conscription was disliked , hut was wholesome for the people ; a French regiment was a school of honor and morality to an Italian , as much as it is of corruption to a German . Some life was awakened among the higher classes ; they began to take some interest in things , and very much , perhaps all that is possible , would be gained for the Romans if they // were to recover animation . There were a pretty good number of criminals executed without the attendance of a priest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion of the common people , every criminal who is executed goes fully absolved into heaven . " Niebuhr made great efforts to procure a Protestant chaplain in Rome , and at last succeeded . He thus mentions the cornmencement of religious worship : " Our evangelical worship has been happily commenced , and truly , in God 's name . ' The 27th of June will be a notable day henceforward in church history ; for what Protestant worship there had been in Rome previously , was destitute of all spiritual power . " " That ours will prosper under such an excellent clergyman is certain . I think I have always known what a genuine pastor must be , who should in our days raise up a church , and infuse into her a new life , but I had never seen such a one till we became acquainted with Schmeider . I can not tell you how we all Jove and reverence him . " Niebuhr took the deepest interest in the religious education of his son . Marcus , he says , shall believe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my most ardent wish that Marcus may be sincerely and earnestly pious . I can not inspire him with this piety ; but I can and will support the clergyman . His heart shall be raised to God as soon as he is capable of a sentiment ; and his childish feelings shall be expressed in prayers and hymns ; all the religious practices that have fallen into disuse in our age , shall be a necessity and a law to him . " And once more : " I wish , I strive with all my heart , that he may grow up with the most absolute faith in religion , yet so that his faith may not be an outward adhesion that must fall away from him afterward , when his reason comes into play , but that from his earliest years the way may be prepared for the union of faith and reason . " We add this characteristic passage " I have spent yesterday and last night in thinking of my Milly , and this day , too , is sacred to these recollections . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She seemed as if returning to me after a long separation . I felt uncertain , as one so often does in dreams , whether she was still living on this earth , or only appeared on it for a transient visit ; she greeted me as if after a long absence , asked hastily after the child , and took it in her arms . " happy are those who can cherish such a hallowing remembrance as that of the departure of my Milly , with pious faith , trusting for a brighter and eternal spring . Such a faith can not be acquired by one 's own efforts . Oh , that it may one day be my portion ! Not that I am a materialist ; you know well that no one can be further from that than I am ; but the possibility of an existence , of which we can form no distinct conception , is not enough for me , does not help me ; other and opposite possibilities always present themselves . I well know what is that faith which deserves the name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only // be possible to me to attain it through supernatural communication , or wonders and Si , , ns beheld with my own eves : it is one thing to respect , and not to reject , quite another really to believe , as in ones own existence . " He died , seeking comfort and strength in silent prayer . In nine days his wife followed him . Both were buried in one grave . His children were placed under the care of his earliest and life-long friend ,  --  ..  - -  - Madamne Hensler.
