WHAT CONSTITUTES REAL FREEDOM OF TRADE ? CHAPTER III . Ir has been shown that the system of Adam Smith looks to concentration with local division of labor ; the artisan and the noviculturist taking their places by the side of each other . Concentration involves increase of population , the division of land , and the combined action of man . It has also been shown , that the system of the modern British school looks to the dispersion ' of population and the territorial division of labor , the people of one part of the world confining themselves to agriculture , while those of another part devote themselves chiefly to the transport and conversion of the products of agricultural labor . The machinery of conversion is thus centralized , and centralization and depopulation go always hand in hand with each other . Depopulation is accompanied , necessarily , by diminution in the number of owners and occupants of land , and diminished power of combination among men . Both are called free-trade systems , yet they differ in every point . The cornerstone of the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other is found in the necessity for trade . To ascertain which is the real free-trade one is the object of this enquiry . The amount of injury resulting from interference with perfect freedom is dependant upon the importance of the matter , or thing , interfered with . The prohibition to walk would be seriously inconvenient , whereas a similar prohibition of dancing would be unimportant . All men require to do the one , while to none is it necessary to do the other . All men have labor to sell , while few require to purchase nutmegs . The trade inland , whether by purchase and sale , or by arrangements for its occupation , is immense , while that in silks is comparatively small . Land and labor VOL . Vi . wo . iv . NEw SERLES. are the great instruments of production , while nutinegs and silks are among their products . An interference with trade in the former to the extent of one per cent . would be more injurious than one amounting to a hundred , with trade in the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade in the instruments of production , while that of the modern British school limits itself to freedom of trade in their products , as we propose now to show . That done , it will not be difficult to determine which is the real free-trade school . The slave does not sell his labor , nor does he choose his master . The land he cultivates is undivided . He and his fellow slaves work together in gangs , and voluntary association is unknown . He is a creature of necessity and as such is man universally treated by Mr. M'Culloch . The freeman sells his labor and chooses his employer . The land he cultivates is divided from that of his neighbor man . He combines his efforts with those of his fellow-men for the accomplishment of almost every object in life . He is a being of power and as such is man universally regarded by Dr. Smith . The first poor cultivator is surrounded by land unoccupied . The more of it at his command the poorer he is . Compelled to work alone , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll nor raise a log , with which to build himself a house . He makes himself a hole in the ground which serves in lieu of one . He cultivates the poor soil of the hills to obtain a little corn , with which to eke out the supply of food derived from snaring the game in his neighborhood . His winter 's supply is deposited in another hole , liable to injury from the water which filters through the light soil into which alone he can penetrate . He is 23 // however , his Sons grow up . They combine their exertions with his , and now ob* tam something like an axe and a spade . They can sink deeper into the soil ; and can cut logs , and build something like a house . They obtain more corn and more game , and they can preserve it better . The danger of starvation is diminished . Being no longer forced to depend for fuel upon the decayed wood which alone their father could use , they are in less danger of perishing from cold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the growth of the family new soils are cultivated , each in succession yielding a larger return to labor , and they obtain a constantly increasing supply of the necessaries of life from a surface diminishing in its ratio to the number to be fed ; and thus with every increase in the return to labor the power of combining their exertions is increased . If we look now to the solitary settler of the west , even where provided with both axe and spade , we shall see him obtaining , with extreme difficulty , the commonest log hut . A neighbor arrives , and their combined efforts produce a new house with less than half the labor required for the first . That neighbor brings a horse , and he makes something like a cart . The product of their labor is now ten times greater than was that of the first man working by himself . More neighbors come , and new houses are needed . A * is made , and by the combined effort of the neighborhood the third house is completed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second weeks , of far more severe exertion . These new neighbors have brought ploughs and horses , and now better soils are cultivated , and the product of labor is again increased , as is the power to preserve the surplus for winter 's use . The path becomes a road . Exchanges increase . The store makes its appearance . Labor is rewarded by larger returns , because aided by better machinery applied to better soils . The town grows up . Each successive addition to the population brings a consumer and a producer . The shoemaker wants leather and corn in exchange for his shoes . The blacksmith requires fuel and food , and the farmer wants shoes for his horses ; and with the increasing facility of exchange *aore labor is applied to production , and the reward of labor rises , producing new wants , and requiring more and larger exchanges . The road becomes a turnpike , and the wagon and horses are seen upon it . The town becomes a city , and better soils are cultivated for the supply of its markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more distant . The tendency to union and to combination of exertion thus grows with the growth of wealth . In a state of extreme poverty it can not be developed . The insignificauf tribe of savages that starves on the product of the superficial soil of hundreds of thousands of acres of land , looks with jealous eyes on every intruder , knowing that each new mouth requiring to be fed tends to increase the difficulty of obtaining subsistence ; whereas the farmer rejoices in the arrival of the blacksmith and the shoemaker , because they come to eat on the spot the corn which heretofore he has carried ten , twenty , or thirty miles to n*arket , to exchange for shoes for himself and his horses . XVith each new consumer of his products that arrives he is enabled more and more to concentrate his action and his thoughts upon his home , while each new arrival tends to increase his yower of consuming commodities brought from a distance , because it tends to diminish his necessity for seeking at a distance a market for the produce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the knowledge how to use them , and the power of association will begin . The supply of food becoming more abundant , they hail the arrival of the stranger who brings them knives and clothing to be exchanged for skins and corn ; wealth grows , and the habit of associationthe first step towards civilization-arises . The little tribe is , however , compelled to occupy the higher lands . The lower ones are a mass of dense forests and dreary swamps , while at the foot of the hill runs a river , fordable but for a certain period of the year . On the hill side , distant a few miles , is another tribe ; but communication between them is difficult , because , the river bottom being yet uncleared , roads can not be made , and bridges are as yet unthought of . Population and wealth , however , continue to increase , and the lower lands come gradually into cultivation , yielding larger returns to labor , and enabling the tribe to obtain larger supplies of // food with less exertion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roads are made in the direction of the riverbank . Population increases more rapidly because of the increased supplies of food and the increased power of preserving it , and wealth grows still more rapidly . The river bank at length is reached , and some of the best lands are now cleared . Population grows again , and a new element of wealth is seen in the form of a bridge , and now the two little communities are enabled to communicate more freely with each other . One rejoices in the possession of a wheelwright , while the other has a windmill . One wants carts , and the other has corn to grind . One has hides to spare , while the other has more shoes than are required for their use . Exchanges increase , and the lit town grows because of the increased amount of trade . Wealth grows still more rapidly , because of new modes of combining labor , by which that of all is rendered more productive . Roads are now made in the direction of other communities , and the work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now combined , and because the machinery used is more efficient . One after another disappear forests and swamps that have occupied the fertile lands , separating ten , twenty , fifty , or five hundred communities , which now are brought into connection with each other and with each step labor becomes more and more productive , and is rewarded with better food , clothing , and shelter . Famine and disease disappear , life is prolonged , population is increased , and therewith the tendency to that combination of exertion among the ind*jviduals composing these communities , which is the distinguishing characteristic of civilization in all periods of the world , and in all nations . With further increase of population and wealth , the desires of man , and his ability to gratify them , both increase . The nation , thus formed , has more corn than it wants ; but it has no cotton , and its supply of wool is insufficient . The neighboring nation has cotton and wool , and needs corn . They are still divided , however , by broad forests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the great forests and swamps disappear , giving place to rich farms , through which broad roads are made , with immense bridges , which enable the merchant to transport his wool and his cotton to exchange with his now rich neighbors for their surplus corn or clothing . Nations now combine their exertions , and wealth grows with still increased rapidity , facilitating the drainage of marches and thus bringing into activity the richest soils ; while coal mines cheaply furnish the fuel for converting limestone into lime , and iron ore into axes and spades , and into rails for the new roads that are needed to transport to market the vast products of the fertile soils now in use , and to bring back the large supplies of sugar , tea , coffee , and the thousand other products of distant lands with which intercourse now exists . At each step population and wealth , and happiness and prosperity , take a new bound ; and men realize with difficulty the fact that the country which now affords to tens of millions all the necessaries , comforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same that , when the superabundant land was occupied by tens of thousands only , gave to that limited number scanty supplies of the worst food : so scanty that famines were frequent and sometimes so severe that starvation was followed in its wake by pestilence , which , at brief intervals , swept from the earth the population of the little and scattered settlenents , among which the people were forced to divide themselves when they cultivated only the poor soils of the hills . We have here that order of things which " necessity imposes , " and which is , nevertheless , " promoted by the natural inclinations of man . " * Unhappily " human institutions " have every where " thwarted natural inclinations , " and thence has arisen the necessity for such enquiries as the present . The picture here presented is that of increased productive power resulting from increase of population , facilitating the development of that first of all " the natural inclinations of man , " the love of association , and every act of combined exertion involves an exchange of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife prepares it for the table . * The owner of a horse lends it on one day to the owner of a plough , and on another borrows the plough // 356 What Constitutes Real Freedom of Trade ? qwq ber of little pieces of work , for which , in more populous countries , they would call in the assistance of those workmen . Country workmen are almost everywhere obliged to apply themselves to all the different branches of industry that have so much affinity to one another as to be employed about the same sort of materials . A country carpenter deals in every sort of work that is made of wood a country smith in every sort of work that is made of iron . The former is not only a carpenter , but a joiner , a cabinet-maker , and even a carver in wood , as well as a wheelwright , a plough-wright , a cart and wagonmaker . The employments of the latter are still more various . It is impossible there should he such a trade as even that of a nailer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails a-day , and three hundred working days in the year , will make three hundred thousand nails in the year . But in such a situation it would be impossible to dispose of one thousand that is of one day 's work in the year . " When , on the contrary , population has increased and the power of combination has risen , the habit of association is great , and the division of labor almost infinite . Its effects arc thus exhibited by Dr. Smith : " It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts , in consequence of the division of labor , which occasions , in a well-governed society , that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people . Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for ; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation , he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the price of a great quantity of theirs . He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for , and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for , and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the society . Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or day-laborer in a civilized and thriving country , and you will perceive that the number of people , of whose industry a part , though but a small part , has been employed in procuring him this accommodation , exceeds all computation . The woollen coat , for example , which covers the day-laborer , as course and rough as it may appear , is the produce of the joint-labor of a great multitude of workmen . The shepherd , the sorter of the wool , the wool-comber or carder , the dyer , the scribler , the spinner , the weaver , the fuller , the dresser , with many others , must all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely production . How many merchants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very distant part of the country ' * How much commerce and navigation in particular , how many ship-builders , sailors , sailmakers , rope-makers , must have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of by the dyer , which often come from the remotest corners of the world t What a variety of labor , too , is necessary in order to produce the tools of the meanest of those workmen ! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the ship of the sailor , the mill of the fuller , or even the loom of the weaver , let us consider only what a variety of labor is requisite ifl order to form that very simple machine , the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool . The miner , the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore , the feller of the timber , the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house , the brickmaker , the bricklayer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forger , the smith , must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them . Were we to examine , in the same manner all the different parts of his dress and household furniture , the coarse linen shirt which he wears next his skin , the shoes which cover his feet , the bed which he lies on , and all the different parts which compose it , the kitchen-grate at which he prepares his victuals , the coals which he makes use of br that purpose , dug from the bowels of the earth , and brought to him , perhaps , by a long sea and a long land-carriage , all the other utensils of his kitchen , all the furniture of his table , the knives and forks , the earthen or pewter plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals , the different hands employed in preparing his bread and his beer , the glass window which lets in the heat and the light , and keeps out the wind and the rain , with all the knowledge and art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these northern parts of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation , together with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing those different conveniencies ; if we examine , I say , all these things , and consider what a variety of labor is employed about each of them , we shall be sensible that , without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands , the very meanest person in a civilized country could not he provided , even according to , what we very falsely imagine , the easy and simple manner in which he is commonly accommodated . Compared , indeed , with the more extravagant luxury of the // 359 qwq ten thousand naked savages . " wealth in the form of spades and axes , tends qwq mand of a great machine in which exist all the elements of production , waiting only the application of the physical and mental powers with which he has been endowed , to render them available for his purpose . The gift was accompanied with the command to labor , that he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might have clothing and shelter ; to labor that he might acquire knowledge ; to labor , that he might enjoy leisure and repose . It is a great laboratory , in which combination of effort yields largely , but can scarcely have existence when population is small and men cultivate the poorer s us . To combination division is essential , and where that does not exist , the progress of cultivation is always slow . Hence the wretched condition of all commons , and of all lands upon which exists the partial right of common , as on most of those of France , under the system of vaine pature. * Starting from the point of absolute barbarism , when all land is held in common , it will be found that cultivation improves with every approach towards absolute ownership . Thus , it is better now in every part of England than in any part in the days when men were serfs , and had in land no property whatsoever . It is better where short leases exist than where all are tenants at will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are short , and the highest cultivation is invariably found where the owner and occupant are one and the same , and where there exists every inducement to the most perfect economy of time and labor . It is thus far better in Cumberland , where heads of families are generally proprietors of a few acres , than in Wilts or Dorset , where it is held in large masses , and cultivated by hired laborers . This may again be seen in the high cultivation of the peasant proprietors of the valley of the Arno ; in the rich fields and the neat and comfortable houses of the small landholders of Belgium ; and in the high prosperity of the same class in Norway . The division of land , and its cultivation by the owner for his own profit , are the necessary consequences of the growth of wealth ; and with * The lands of France being unenclosed , cattle are turned loose upon them in the autumn , and thus each man in a neighborhood is enabled to exercise a partial right of common over his neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the progress of agriculture . each step in this direction agriculture becomes more and more a science , furnishing employment for minds of the highest order , and yielding the largest returns to their exertions . It ceases to be the labor of the slave , and becomes the refined and elegant occupation of the gentleman , who gives to the direction of a small estate all his faculties , andobtains a liberal reward for permitting a portion of its proceeds to be applied to its improvement ; while to those who execute with their hands what he plans with his head , large wages are afforded ; and he finds in this employment greater happiness than was enjoyed by those of his predecessors whose thousands of acres were scratched by serfs to cnable them to pay the ransom to his captor on the field of battle . Such is the tendency of things when wealth and population grow . War and waste produce a reverse effect , and land concentrates itself in fewer hands . Hence it is that the age of barbarism , dignified with title of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the world the right of primogeniture , another of the weak inventions by which man cndeavors to set aside the great laws of nature ; but over which she invariably tiumphs when men remain at peace . These views are in perfect accordance of those of Dr. Smith who thought that nothing could be " more contrary to the real interest of a numerous family than a right which , in order to enrich one , beggars numerous children . " Nothing , in his opinion " could be more completely absurd than the system of entails . " They are founded , " says he , " upon the most absurd of all suppositions , the supposition that every successive generation of men have not an equal right to the earth , and to all that it possesses ; but that the property of the present generation should be restrained and regulated according to the fancy of those who died , perhaps five hundred years ago . Entails , however , are still respected , through the greater part of Europe ; in those countries , particularly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of civil or military honors . Entails are thought , necessary for maintaining this exclusive prmvmlege of the nobility to the great offices and honors of their country ; and that order having usurped one unjust advantage over the rest of their fellow-citizens , lest their property should render it ridiculous , it is thought reasonable that they should have another . The common law of England , indeed , // accordingly more restricted there than in any other European monarchy ; though even England is not altogether without them . In Scotland , more then one-fifth , perhaps more than one-third part of the whole lands in the country , are at present supposed to be under strict entail . " Great tracts of uncultivated land were in this manner not only engrossed by particular families , but the possibility of their being divided agnin was as much as possible precluded for ever . It seldom happens , however , that a great proprietor is a great improver . In the disorderly times which gave birth to those barbarous institutions , the great proprietor was sufficiently employed in defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority over those of his neighbors . He had no leisure to attend to ' the cultivation and improvement of land . When the establishment of law and order afforded him this leisure , he often wanted the inclination , and almost always the requisite abilities . If the expense of his house.and person either equalled or exceeded his revenue , as it did very frequently , he had no stock to employ in this manner . If he was an economist , he generally found it more profitable to employ his annual savings in new purchases than in the improvement of his old estate . To improve land with profit , like all other commercial projects , requires an exact attention to small savings and small gains , of which a man born to a great fortune , even though naturally frugal , is very seldom capable . The situation of such a person naturally disposes him to attend rather to ornament , which pleases his fancy , than to profit , for which he has so little occasion . The elegance of his dress , of his equipage. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hts infancy , he has been accustomed to have some anxiety about . The turn of mind which this habit naturally forms , follows him when he comes to think of the improvement of land . He embellishes , perhaps , four or five hundred acres in the neighborhood of his house , at ten times the expense which the land is worth after all his improvements ; and finds , that if he was to improve his whole estate in the same manner , and he has little taste for any other , he would be a bankrupt before he had finished the tenth part of it . There still remain in both parts of the united kingdom , some great estates which have continued , without interruption , in the hands of the same family since the times of feudal anarchy . Compare the present condition of those estates with the possessions of the small proprietors in their neighborhood , and you will require no other argument to convince you how unfavorable such extensive property is to im provement . I " If little improvement was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hoped for from those who occupied the land under them . In the ancient state of Europe , the occupiers of land were all tenants at will . They were all , or almost all , slaves , but their slavery was of a milder kind than that known among the ancient Greeks and Romans , or even in the West Indian colonies . They were supposed to belong more directly to the land than to their master . They could , therefore , be sold with it , but not separately . They could marry , provided it was with the consent of their master ; and he could not afterwards dissolve the marriage by selling the man and wife to different persons . If he maimed or murdered any of them , he was liable to some penalty , though generally but to a small one . They were not , however , capable of acquiring property . Whatever they acquired was acquired to their master , and he could take it from them at pleasure . Whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was at his expense . The seed , the cattle , and the instruments of husbandry , were all his . It was for his benefit . Such slaves could acquire nothing but their daily maintenance . It was properly the proprietor himself , therefore , that in this case occupied his own lands , and cultivated them by his own bondmnen . This species of slavery still subsists in Russia , Poland , Hungary , Bohemia , Moravia , and other parts of Gerinany . It is only in the western and southwestern provinces of Europe that it has gradually been abolished altogether . " But if great improvements are seldom to be expected from great proprietors , they are least of all to be expected when they employ slaves for their workmen . The experience of all ages and nations , I believe , demonstrates that the work done by slaves , though it appears to cost only their maintenance , is in the end the dearest of any . A person who can acquire no property can have no other interest but to eat as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does beyond what is sufficient to purchase his own maintenance , can be squeezed out of him by violence only , and not by any interest of his own . In ancient Italy , how much the cultivation of corn degenerated , how unprofitable it became to the master , when it fell under the management of slaves , is remarked both by Pliny and Columella . In the time of Aristotle , it had not been much better in ancient Greece . Speaking of the ideal republic described in the laws of Plato , to maintain 5000 idle men ( the number of warriors supposed necessary for its defence ) , together with their women and servants , would require , he says , a territory of boundless extent and fertility , like the plains of Babylon. " // We see thus that Dr. Smith 's whole system looks to increased freedom of trade in labor and land , the great instruments of production . The base on which it rests is that land , being the great source of all production , the labor which is applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessaries , conveniences , and luxuries of life . " He desired therefore to increase the quantity that might be given to cultivation , by diminishing that required for transportation , and he saw that when the laborer took his place by the side of the food , he not only diminished the necessity for transporting the food itself , but he also aided in the conversion of other raw materials into commodities ready for use , so as to fit them for cheap transportation to distant countries , thus increasing the power to trade both abroad and at home . It was obvious to him that the more men worked in combination with each other the more productive would be the labor of each , and the greater would be the number whose labors might be applied to the work of production . The necessary consequence of this would be that while each might consume more , each would be enabled to accumulate more rapidly , and each step in the progress of accumulation would be but the prelude to a new and greater one , and that thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther the progress of population , and causing to increase still more rapidly the habit of association , and the power to produce , to consume , and to accumulate . Increase of produce necessarily involves increase of trade , for there are more commodities in which to trade . So likewise with increase of accumulation , for the investment of savings involves the exchange of food and clothing for the labor employed in clearing and draining lands , the building of houses and mills , the opening of mines , and the erection of furnaces . The more men work in combination with each other , the greater will be the power to produce , and the greater , necessarily , must be the power to consume and to accumulate , and thus is it seen that , with the growth of population and wealth , the trade in labor and land , and in the products of both , tends to increase more rapidly than population , and each is seen to be helping , and helped by , the other . It has been shown that the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it is only with the growth of population and wealth that the richer soils  --  the heavily timbered lands , the fiats and the swamps ,  --  can be cleared or drained . So long as the farmer has to depend on distant markets , he must apply himself to the production of those articles of which the earth yields but little in return to labor , and which therefore command a high price , and will bear transportation , and so long he must continue unable to clear and drain the richest soils . He can not raise potatoes , or turnips , of which the earth yields by tons , for he has no market on the land , and they will not bear transportation . Concentration makes a market on the land for the products of the land , as the mechanic placed among the food consumes largely , and is a customer to the farmer for those products of which the earth yields largely in return to labor . The system of Dr. Smith tended to bring the mechanic to the food , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trade . The soil that is constantly cropped for the supply of distant markets becomes exhausted , and its occupant is compelled to fly to lands still more distant , with constant diminution in the return to labor . The system of Dr. Smith looked to placing the consumer by the side of the producer , enabling the farmer to obtain large crops to be consumed on or near the land , the refuse of which could be returned to the land , thus increasing instead of diminishing its productive powers , and thereby facilitating the growth of population , the power of combination , the power to trade , and the amount of trade . With increase in the power of production the power of accumulation necessarily increases , and with each step in the progress thereof the demand for labor increases , and the laborer acquires more and more the power to determine for himself to whom he will sell his labor and what shall be its price . The value of present labor increases as compared with the proceeds of accumulated labor , called capital , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion which can be claimed by the owner of landed or other capital is constantly decreasing , leaving to the laborer a constantly increasing proportion , with consequent increase in the facility of converting the laborer working for others // into the little capitalist working for himself - owner of a little farm , or of a machine of some description calculated to render his labor more productive . Division of land is , therefore , the necessary consequence of the system of Dr. Smith , which looks everywhere to increase in the freedom of man , and to increase in the power of voluntary association , the combination of the exertions of the mechanic and the occupant of land for the purpose of increasing the productive power of labor and land , being , in his estimation , the one thing needful for the improvement of the condition of man . The following view of the effect of the division of land in increasing production , is from a recent writer , who , being a believer in the theory of over-population , may be regarded as excellent authority " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest possible surplus , after adequately remunerating the cultivator and that small farms can afford a larger surplus than similar portions of a large one , is evident from the fact of their paying higher rents . Further proof may be found in Flanders and Lombardy , when the densest populations in Europe , and those in a large proportion town populations , are maintained in comfort by laud divided among small farmers . How this end is attained , is surely of comparatively little importance ; even if it were true that the implements and methods of small farmers are clumsy and defective , that they disdain the aid of science , and require twice as much labor as would suffice under a different system , it vould still be manifest that they possess some advantage which more than compensates for all these drawbacks . In spite of their adherence to old practices , they manage to get more from the land than the large capitalist with all his improvements , and after receiving sufficient for their own consumption , they have a large residue for sale . ( They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade within the family increases , and this is evidence that the system is the one that constitutes freedom of trade . ) They might , perhaps , do better still by imitating some of the methods of the large capitalist ; but even as it is , they do better than he does , and their plan must , on the whole , be better than his . Nothing can be more unjust , however , than to stigmatize the culture of small farms as necessarily rude and inartificial . The small holdings of the Flemish peasantry not only bear heavier crops than lands of the same quality in the best farmed districts of England or Scotland , but the land is kept much cleaner , is much better drained , and much more abundantly manured . It may be true that in Great Britain large farmers are almost the only improvers ; but this is because few except large farmers have leases , and consequently any motive for improvement . When small farmers have any hold on the land , as in Norway , Belgium , Switzerland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that promises to be generally beneficial . In this way channels many miles in length are made for irrigation or drainage ; and a dozen owners of three or four cows , or occupiers @f as many acres , combine to make cheeses as large and fine as any that Cheshire can produce ; and even to establish a beetroot manufacture , the most extensive and scientific of all modern agricultural operations . Mutual cdoperation thus places within the reach of small farmers almost every advantage possessed by their wealthy rivals . The principal differeIice in their modes of procedure is , that the former being less able to purchase extensive machinery , employ a larger relative quantity of labor . This , however , is the reverse of disadvantageous either as regards themselves or the public . The agricultural class constitute the nerves and sinews of a nation , and its increase so generally deprecated by political economists , only becomes an evil when it encroaches on the nourishment which might be reserved for other classes . If additional agricultural laborers can procure subsistence without detracting from that of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the labor of two men the produce of a piece of ground can be so much augmented as to furnish ample subsistence for both , and yet leave as great a surplus as when only one cultivator was employed , the double application of labor increases both the strength and the wealth of the country . If the surplus be greater than before , it increases also the income of the proprietor of the land . Now , this , and much more than this , takes place on small farms . Labor there is much more productive than on large ones . Most of lhe work is done under the master 's eye , and much of it done by his own hands , or those of his family . All the laborers have motives for exertion unknown to hired servants , or at least are subject to a vigilant supervision which a larger landholder can not exercise . They bestow on their work a care , l ) patience , and assiduity , which can not be purchased at any price ; and these qualities much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or injudicious arrangement . The produce of the soil is so much increased in consequence , as not only to provide for the consumption of the additional cultivators , but to leave a larger quantity remaining than if fewer laborers , without the same motives for industry , had been employed . If , then , the merits of a system may be judged of from its results , the subdivision of farms would be favorable instead of injurious to agriculture . It // and would cause more labor to be employed , but it would increase the power of labor in a greater degree . A larger proportion would thus become applicable to the payment of rent , and to the consumption of the non-agricultural part of the community ; provisions would grow cheaper , but landlords , notwithstanding , would receive incomes as large , if not larger , than at present . " * This is strong , but how much stronger would it not have been had its author been satisfied that with the increase of production , the landlord would be entitled to claim a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rent would be increased , the laborer would retain not only a larger quantity but a larger proportion of the increased quantity . Every one knows that the more rapid the increase of capital in the form of cleared lands , ploughs , harrows , mills , and furnaces , the greater is the necessity of the capitalist for the laborer , and the higher the price of labor , and experience teaches us that that price is always such as to give to the laborer a larger proportion of the product . In former times , the owner of land took twothirds , and production was then very small . Later , he was compelled to be satisfied with one-half , but more recently it has been estimated at only one-fourth . In former times , the rate of interest was from ten to twenty per cent , whereas it is now but five , and such is the movement in every community in which the wealth increases in its ratio to population . Of the effect *f this an idea may be formed from an examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory of Mr. Ricardo , upon which is based the whole modern English politicoeconomical system : First period Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seventh Eighth Ninth Tenth Eleventh RICARDO 'S DOCTRINE . , 0 100 - 100 190 10 180 270 30 240 340 60 280 400 100 300 450 150 300 490 210 280 520 280 240 540 360 180 550 450 100 550 550 00 OBSERvATION . 0* - " .0 0 0 . 30 20 10 70 42 28 120 60 60 180 80 100 250 100 150 330 120 210 420 140 280 510 155 355 620 170 450 740 180 560 870 190 680 Thornton , on Over-population , p. 331 . The quantity divided among the owners of land increases as the proportion diminishes , while the laborers obtain an increased proportion of an increased quantity. * It will be obvious to the reader that the power of the laborer to accumulate capital must increase with each and every step in this direction , and equally so that when the laborer goes to the food , the tendency will be towards the acquisition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable him healthfully and profitably to employ his hours of leisure . " Its cultivation , " says Mr. Thornton , from whom we continue to quote " costs him nothing , but serves rather as an amusement for the leisure of himself and family , enabling all but the very youngest to make themselves useful . Abundance of manure is found in the refuse and scraps of all kinds that would otherwise be thrown away . Nothing is wasted , and habits of thrift and industry are formed . The produce being proportioned less to the extent of the ground , * This proportional law of distribution , proving the perfect harmony of the interests of the laborer I and capitalist , was first published by the author of this article , in 1837. it is now adopted , and published as his own , in his Harmonies Economiques , " by . lJIons . Bastiat , who says of it : " Such is the great , admirable , consoling , necessary , and inflexible law of capital .

The absolute quantity of each is greater , but the proportional part of capital constantly diminishes as compared with that of labor . " Cease , then , capitalists and laborers , to look upon each other with eyes of suspicion and of envy . Close your ears to those absurd declaimers , of whom nothing equals their pride if it be not their ignorance , who , under the promise of future harmony , begin by exciting present discord .

" // than to the care and attention bestowed upon it , is infinitely greater than a large occupier could have obtained from the same space ; and besides the direct addition which it makes to the laborer 's means of existence , enables him to keep pigs , poultry , &amp;c. , at little or no exper.se . He enjoys a variety as well as an abundance of articles of diet , which , even if he possessed their value in money , it would be scarcely possible for him to buy , and he has besides a resource on which he may rely when other means of livelihood temporarily fail . A day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a number of causes , when , if he is entirely dependent on wages , he may become involved in inextricable difficulties , whereas with the help of a stock of food of his own raising , he might easily struggle through his embarrassment . The occupancy of a little land does away with much of the precariousness , which is the worst feature in the laborer 's condition ; and this is particularly the case when the land is the laborer 's own property , as it would not improbably become , in circumstances such as those supposed , when he might often be able to save a little money . He then feels himself sufilciently independent not to be over anxious about the future ; but not so much so as to grow careless of obtaining work , or of satisfying his employer . On the contrary , finding thait he has been admitted into a higher or ( ler of society , he uses every exertion to maintain his new position . Men of this class are commonly the most diligent and trustworthy , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with every-day experience . As the laborer becomes a little capitalist he feels himself animated by HOPE* and his exertions increase , while he becomes more careful and economical , and thus it is that with every increase in the ratio of wealth to population there is seen an improvement in the moral , as well as in the physical condition of man . He acquires the habit of combininr* his exertions with his neighbor , and with each such combination his powers of production increase , and therewith there is an increase in the power to trade . We see thus that it is in the direction of concentration-that of placing the consumer of food in the midst of the producers of the food-that we must look for freedom of trade , and in that direction it was that it was sought by Adam smith . With the growth of the habit of combination , schools are established at which * Thornton , on Over-population , p. 334. children are cheaply educated , books and newspapers increase in number , the intel-. lectual condition is improved , and macn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further increase in the power to produce , and in the power to trade . The habit of union produces a habit of peace and love of harmony , and the power of self-protection increases , with diminished necessity for employing men in the unproductive labor of carrying swords or muskets , and also diminished necessity for collecting taxes for their maintenance , the consequence of which is that capital grows with increased rapidity , and with it there is an increase in the power to produce , and in the power to maintain trade . With each such step wealth increases in its ratio to population and the hiborer is enabled to demand a still increased proportion of the increased product , and to become , with still increased facility , a capitalist , the individual and the community exercising from day to day more perfectly the form of selfgovernment . Thus it is that the system taught by Adam Smith tends to the improvement of the physical , moral , intellectual , and political condition of man , while with each step in the progress of improvement there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is which in every country is " promoted by the natural inclinations of man , " * and " if human inclinations had not thwarted those natural inclinations , the towns could no where have increased beyond what the improvement and cultivation of the country in which they were situated could support . " t The artisan and the laborer would have been every where seen placing themselves where food was cheap , and " the beauty of the country , the pleasures of a country life , the tranquility of mind which it promises , and wherever the injustice of human laws does not disturb it the independency which it really affords , " would have been every where found to have " charms that more or less attract every body .

Such was the political economy of Adam Smith , and it is impossible to read his book without a feeling of admiration for the man who saw so clearly , and so early , the course of policy that most tended to increase the happiness and respectability , the strength and independence , of men and of nations . He believed in the advantage resulting from division of the land , and pointed distinctly to the course which tended to its accomplishment . He felt with " the small proprietor , " knowing " every part of his little territory , " and viewing it with " all the affection which property , especially small property naturally inspires , and who on that account takes pleasure not only in cultivating it , but in adorning * Wealth of Nations , Book IV .

That of his successors looks , as will now be shown , to increased necessity for trade , and diminished power to trade resulting from a necessity for diminution in the power of man to gratify his " natural inclination " for marriage , and for association with his fellow-men . In the school of the one , commerce is regarded as the handmaid of agriculture . In the other , " Commerce is King , " and it is that commerce with distant nations which was regarded by Dr. Smith as yielding the smallest returns to the labor and capital employed .
