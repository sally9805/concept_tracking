txt ART . VIll. - LIFE AND LABORS OF MARY LYON . The Power of Christian Benevolence illustrated in the Life and Labors of Mary Lyon . Compiled by EDWARD HITCHCOCK , D. D. , LL . D. , President of Amherst College ; with the assistance of others . Northampton : Hopkins , Bridgman &amp; Co. , 1852. pp. 486 . IT is worth while to notice the authorship and general cast of those numerous books and lectures in which woman is both the subject discussed and the object addressed . it will at once be seen that the writers generally are men , and that they , take for granted a constitutional inferiority in the other sex in point of intellectual power . Such an assumption on such a subject , of course , gives its own coloring to a writer 's matter and manner . Taking his lady-readers or hearers on what he is pleased to consider their weak side , he goes largely into flowers and flatteries , as though a woman 's heart served her in the place of an understanding , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Lady 's Book , edited by a gentleman , does not deal largely in love-stories and the fashions ? What Lady 's Book does deal to any extent , in argument and instruction of the higher kinds ? What lecturer on woman and woman 's sphere does not assume an original and wide disparity between the sexes in point of intellect , and a corresponding disparity in their need of intellectual cultivation to fulfill their appropriate duties ? Perhaps literary and scientific men form their idea of woman by an arithmetical process . Unwilling to divide with any the glories of intellectual preeminence , they subtract a large amount from their own share of those crowning qualities , and thus take the first step towards their ideal of the other sex . Next , considering sensibility to be a cheap and cumbrous article , better honored in the riddance than in the possession , they cheerfully assign to woman a portion of it as much larger than their own , as they took from her understanding , complimenting themselves meanwhile on their singular generosity . Next , they concede any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners and the proprieties of life , &amp;c. ; the said &amp;c. denoting that the items included in it are not worth specifying , and so are given and granted in the lump . Finally , the control of the will is transferred from reason to fancy , and caprice , with her blind eye , made mistress of the judgment . The picture , in the // painter 's own good opinion , is now finished . But it is evident , that the painter has himself sat for it , making some omissions , alterations and additions , in each case complimentary to his own vanity . Abating those changes , the picture is his own . It is equally plain , that no such process of forming an idea of either half of human nature can lead to an accurate result . If either sex forms its idea of the other from consciousness , with omissions and additions , the result must be a fancy-sketch . When men paint their own fights , they naturally represent themselves as victors ; but give the pencil to the lion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman-painter should undertake to draw a lady 's face from his own , he must needs miss the mark ; and she must be very fond , or very foolish , if she should acknowledge the likeness as her own . Yet many a gentleman s lecture on woman is listened to by crowded auditories of that very sex , as if the subject were particularly new to them , and they were thankful for some light from those who understand it . Few men write or speak on woman without giving to the sensible and reflecting portion of the sex just cause of offense . First of all they are careful to instill orthodox notions about woman 's sphere , as if she were quite liable to mistake it , and to become something else beside a wife and a mother . They apply to the sex the term , " weaker vessel , " in a sense very different from the apostle 's . They play the guardian and protector with too assured an air , as if there could be no question that their services are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience , because they so evidently assume the inferiority of those on whom they are lavished . They deal in flowers and perfumes , in flatteries and frivolities , as though their hearers could appreciate nothing else . Their very condescension is a sting ; and the wound it makes rankles all the more for every attempt to fan it with the fumes of sweet incense . Religion even is urged upon a woman 's attention , as peculiarly suited to her state and case . Human nature can well enough bear the consciousness of limited powers . We can even bear to have it considered an established fact that others have the advantage of us in point of intellectual power . But to be directly told so , to meet the doctrine in all your vade-mecums , to find it underlying all the plans and modes of education , to be dosed with it as a delicacy and as though your palate must be strangely in the wrong if you do not like it , is a very different thing , and we have occasion to know that some women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Not that we see any crisis approaching . We see no coming Declaration of independence // casting its shadow before it . But we hear complaints which we know to be serious , and which we can not help thinking reasonable . That woman must indeed be servile in feeling , and an unfit companion for a man of sense and reason , who can tamely bear to be told that she is comparatively weak in understanding , even though it should be attempted to sweeten the bitter pill with the kind assurance that what is wanting in head is made up in heart . It is a wrong to her to give her only your small talk , as if she could not appreciate , and was not entitled to , anything higher and better . Even a boquet of flowers may be flung at a person in such a manner as to make it an insult instead of an acceptable gift . Commendation of a person 's sensibilities may be diluted and adulterated with such disparagement of his understanding that the mixture and the druggist shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher walks of intellectual effort unquestionably belongs to man , yet it is unnecessary to flaunt and parade the fact before woman 's eyes . A victor can well afford to be silent in his own praise . What , then , shall we say of him who boasts of having won the race when he has had no competitor ? What kind of victory is that where there is no foe ? The Roman ovations and triumphs were empty and vain enough in themselves , and a smoke in the nostrils of all the world beside . But what if they had been all a farce ? Would mankind have spared their laughter ? When have women to any extent disputed the prize in the higher walks of intellectual effort ? When have her relations and her duties been such that she could have done it ? Are not the best twenty years in the life of almost every woman so occupied as entirely to preclude any continuous literary effort ? Who then are you , 0 vain man , boasting yourself at the end of the race over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see that her early promise was as bright as your own , but that just at the start , she became too busily engaged in all important duties to continue the contest with you ? Who can say that , if the arena were open to women as it is to men , they would not win an equal share of all the games ? So long as the two run together , woman keeps up with man . With all the incumbrances which her sphere naturally and necessarily imposes , there are not wanting examples of females excelling in literature and the arts , and even in science , enough to startle the lords of creation and make them tremble for the safety of their crown , if they have any silly pride in the case . A great portion of the vast field of literature is fully open to woman , and nowhere more than in our own country , and in our // own country nowhere more than in our own New England . Our schools try the whole New England mind , of what sort it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , it is brought to light and to use , whatever the sex of the owner . The consequence is , that among our best and most successful teachers and writers are many women . The standard of female education is also continually rising , and the amount of female talent engaged in entertaining or instructing others with the pen or the voice , or both , is increasing perpetually and at a rapid rate . No sensible person wishes the sphere of either sex changed . It is the greatest imaginable absurdity to think of it . God has cast the web and woof of human society just right , and he who tries to mend it , will only show his own folly . But precisely because the spheres of the sexes are in a considerable degree different , the question which is originally superior in intellectual powers can never be settled by actual experiment . What we can say , is , that the sexes possess just the same intellectual powers in kind , neither having one that the other lacks . Even If we select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our intellectual faculties , we shall find no ground for the opposite opinion ; and , for ourselves , we can say that our experience in teaching logic , which is the theory of reasoning , and mathematics which is the best practice of it , has shown what indeed we should have been sorry to disbelieve , that there is no sex in mind , and that the actual difference between the two is one of development . If you could give to women the same field , the same time , and the same motive as to men , ( a thing every one knows undesirable and impossible , but if it could be done , ) such an experiment , and nothing short of it , would fairly settle the long-mooted question of the original equality of the sexes in intellectual power . But we have our fears that the settlement would be in a way not exactly flatter . ing to our vanity . And even if there were sex in mind , and if mental vision does go pan passu with stature and bodily strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does in the very glorying lose it , and sink beneath the sex he glories over . The dog who snapped at the shadow of his piece of meat in the water lost the substance ; and every one would say that he had his reward . Some wise people seem to be very much afraid that the sexes are going to change places and duties , and so the world will unfortunately be turned upside down . For our own part , we apprehend that there is little danger of woman 's forsaking her sphere at present . Whenever we see an exquisite , who ought to be a man , but comes short of it by his whole length , we feel // that we can not answer for our own sex . There is no reasonable doubt that women will for the most part continue to be Wives and mothers as long as the world stands , just as they have been for several thousand years ; and that they will , even without special instructions from Lyceum lecturers , continue to perform the all-important and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally an Amazon . There are Abby Folsoms . But so there is occasionally a Sardanapalus ; and even Hercules submitted with a better grace than he should to wear an apron among the maids of Omphale . A few female ranters ought not seriously to discompose the slumbers of the graver sex . It is only the natural fermentation and sickness of hope deferred or disappointed . The stars will as soon forget their appointed round , as women generally become unsexed . But when the stars themselves rebel against gravitation , and go plunging fitfully , at fancy 's will , through space , we may of course look for strange things everywhere . Even if there were the danger which the self-appointed and anxious curators of our kitchens , nurseries and parlors , seem to apprehend , the best and surest remedy would be in close neighborhood to the danger . If a woman takes a fancy to play the comet , instead of a fixed star , as she ought , there are none like her own sex for drumming her back to her own place again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would take many men and many lecturers , to match the happy and mighty influence of a single Miss Lyon over her sex . If the Queen of Night , in disgust with her station because it is inferior and gives her no great range of recreation , should go scowling and glimmering at random through the sky , it would be a useless folly for the king of day to forget his ancient honors , lose his temper , and quit his shining , till he had lectured the pretty rebel back to her place again . She would soon right herself , and find her pleasure in her duty . So with woman . The strongest principles of her nature impel her to keep herself and her sex in their proper sphere . For a gentleman to instal himself professor of kitchen , nursery , or parlor-duties , is even more preposterous than if a childless man should undertake to teach a father how to bring up his children . The happiness of each moiety of the race is invested in the performance of its own peculiar duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delinquency on either side ,  --  a security manifold greater than any danger that is likely to arise . Miss Lyon 's Memoir , the title of which prefaces this article , and a part of which , not inappropriately nor unfortunately , it fell to ladies to prepare , has given occasion to these thoughts . // She was a shining example of what a woman may be , and what a woman may do . Her life is a lesson and a treasure , not only to her own sex , but to the race . The wise will be made wiser by it , and the good will be made better . It will teach the teacher , and furnish impulse and instruction to the christian minister . It will kindle new hopes and desires after knowledge and usefulness in the hearts of many young ladies . It will deepen the public sense of the importance of christian education , and show that by heaven-directed wisdom and zeal the highest success in promoting it is attainable . It will illustrate the value of moral and religious influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will show that a wise economy of time and effort requires religion to be made the first , the second , and the third thing in a school , as well as in all other phases of human life . It will prove by bright and sufficient examples , that the entrance of the word of God into a school of any kind giveth light and comfort and every blessing in large abundance to teacher , parent , and pupil , as well as to the church and the world . It will do something to stay the general declension from the good old way of our Puritan fathers , who taught their children betimes to worship God and fear his holy name . It will add fresh fuel to the flame of missionary zeal , and bring forward many a willing and living sacrifice to the work of the gospel among the heathen . Fathers and mothers , by their firesides , may learn wisdom from it . Instructors of young men may here be taught even by a woman . Politicians and statesmen may find lessons about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great hope of the world 's regeneration and the coming in of Millennial glory ; and scarcely any traveler to the shores of eternity can read attentively Miss Lyon 's pilgrimage thither without profit . The Memoir itself is a series of biographical pictures . You seem to see Miss Lyon 's image before you in every successive phase of her wonderful life and labors . The representations are certainly minute enough ; to some they may appear too much so . But they have a strong individuality and will leave a deep impression . If , occasionally , too much detail for the bulk of readers is indulged , it is soon atoned for by some scene of lively interest . The narrative is clear ; the style is simple ; the tone is thoroughly earnest . There is no effort to strike by the power of words , or by the artful grouping of incidents . Though several persons were concerned with Dr. Hitchcock in the writing of the book , yet one spirit seems to have animated them all . It is a spirit of earnest candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth was enough to place Miss Lyon in the foremost rank , not only of women , but of the benefactors of the race , and that studied ornament and high-flown panegyric would not only wrong her memory , but the sacred cause which they all had at heart . They therefore felt , that the more simply the truth could be told , the better . They have made her own works to praise her in the gates . They write indeed as none but friends , and kindred spirits , and fellow-teachers , could have written . Yet the whole narrative has such a truthful air , the unquestioned labors and services of Miss Lyon in many a field were so valuable and so great , and her letters , of which there are many in the volume , show a soul at once so large , and wise , and good , that we do not envy the man who can rise from the perusal and not own that she was indeed a wonderful woman . The style and spirit of a memoir should resemble its subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not himself , but his author , so he that translates a human life into language for a common and lasting possession and benefit to mankind , should make that language itself emblematic of the life which it is intended to portray . Memoirs thus written are like mirrors , plain-mounted , but clear , in which you see the exact lineaments of the object , while the mirror itself does not attract your notice . Or they may be compared to those bodies which , having no fragrance themselves , are fitted to receive and impart the delicious perfume . Such spicery does more than embalm the dead . It fixes and perpetually gives out the perfume of virtues that can not die . The memory of the just is like odors of sweet incense , which only need a simple embodiment and preservation . So the authors of this memoir seem to have thought . Unlike many an ambitious biographer , they sought to hide themselves , and exhibit Miss Lyon in her own character and deeds . They wished others to see and know her , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure gold , most precious ; and seemed to need no foil to set her off to advantage . This may fully explain why they have used great plainness of speech , and written as if they were not always in fear of the rules of rhetoric . The nice critic , whose scales are sensitive to the least particle of offense , may find something , perhaps much , to blame . As the authors wrote without the fear of critics before their eyes , so now they would doubtless say , let the critics make full proof of their vocation . It can not but be a sufficient reward to them , if far and wide , some adequate knowledge of the life and labors of Miss Lyon shall be conveyed , and if the proper lessons thence derived shall be extensively learned . // It is not our purpose to give even a brief sketch of the history of this most useful woman 's life . A teacher may exercise the most heroic self-denial and energy , but as he exhibits these noble qualities , not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike the public eye as a hero . Miss Lyon had all the spirit and resolution , and she really performed the deeds of a christian heroine . Yet her high resolve was so finely tempered in all things with good sense and sober christian principle , the light she shed , though bright , was yet so mild , and her career though so noble and exalted in its aims and sacrifices , was yet so far removed from the full and open sea of human life and affairs , as men generally view them , that we are afraid no grouping of ours would give the just and strong effect of the whole . Let the reader , whose American eye clearly sees that for us in this country the general diffusion of a moderate share of knowledge is infinitely better than the largest possible concentration of it*in the minds of a favored few ,  --  let him whose American heart throbs to its core , responsive to every wise effort to level the masses upward to the broad table-land of intelligence , virtue and usefulness , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair ; let any and all such , study this record of heroic and christian benevolence as exemplified in the life and labors of Miss Lyon . The Puritan 's and the patriot 's blood will warm as he reads . He will thank God , and take courage . As for a detailed accour*it , therefore , of the untiring zeal and assiduity and remarkable success with which Miss Lyon studied in her youth and early prime ; how well she economized and contrived that she might have time and means to study , counting knowledge far more precious than silver ; what friends were raised up to aid her in her extremity , and with what wisdom and liberality they fulfilled their highly privileged office in her education ; how the rays of divine truth fell first on her large and luminous understanding , and lingering there awhile , at length penetrated to her equally large heart , and there kindled and became a living fire , so that she was Indeed a burning and a shining light to all around ; what schools enjoyed the first fruits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingathering of her riper years and rare powers ; how almost from the first , as if she were a chosen vessel unto God , the " dews " of his grace would fall on the soil she cultivated and the seed she sowed , while all around might be as the waste and howling wilderness ; how in her full maturity the inspiration of the All-wise gave her counsel and understanding to devise and plan a Female Seminary , in some respects wholly , and in others comparatively // new and without precedent ; with what humble faith and holy courage and high resolve she ventured on her undertaking , as on ahnost pathless waters , in a bark , frail yet freighted with every hope she held dearest on earth ; how she looked to her Bible and her God alone for chart , compass , and courage , and how her own clear eye and unshaken soul stood ready bankers , disbursing light and faith and hope on demand to every one whose heart failed him for fear and for thinking too much of what the world would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved and longed for , were at last laid with prayers and tears and toil , and its topstone with joy and praise and giving of thanks and holy consecration in all things to Him who had shown her the pattern , and bade her build a school to his great name ; how the laughter and derision of many a Tobias and Sanballat was turned into shame and confusion of face ; how God accepted the work and service of her hands , and blessed both it and her abundantly ; how , though she sleeps with her fathers , yet he still remembers his holy covenant and the oath he swore to her , that he would be a God to her and to her spiritual children after her , and how he hath in all things done for her beloved seminary exceeding abundantly above all that she asked or thought : is not all this , and more , written in this book of her Memoirs , so fully and legibly , that he who runs may read , and present and future generations may learn something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vast power for good which he can give to one single woman , not only for her own sex , but for the whole race , and for all coming time ! It may not be amiss for us here to express in few words our view of what Miss Lyon was in mind and character . Her native powers were unquestionably such as might provoke the lords of creation to jealousy . She was largely endowed in those very faculties which are thought to hold the first rank in the human mind . There was nothing wanting . Nothing was in excess . Her mind was like a perfect sphere , full and complete in all its parts . Her strength was not unwomanly , unless it be thought that the proper idea of woman involves some peculiar weakness . She could grasp and handle abstract truths with the ease and skill of the practiced philosopher . She could at the same time illustrate them with a woman 's fertility of invention , and enforce them with all a woman 's earnestness . Her mental eye was originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vision was peculiarly large . Her thoughts were accustomed to work themselves clear in speech , rather than in silence ; and hence she would often at first give a confused // utterance to principles which she saw with perfect distinctness and grasped with a strong hand . While she could race with the swiftest and soar with the loftiest , she had that natural greatness of soul which can not exult over the intellectual weaknesses and failures of others . She took no vain notice of her own triumphs . She showed no complacency in the e*xercise of her own shining talents . Least of all , did she deal in that scorn with which the common sort of minds are so apt to overflow , when they unfortunately happen to rank themselves above mediocrity . She was naturally generous , and seemed never to envy those that were above her , nor despise those that were below . Her natural activity was great . There was as much of fire in the susceptible part of her being , as there was of light in the intellectual . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding . Her watchword was action , not unsteady and fitful , but like the flow of a great river , fed with many and unfailing streams . She could never have been a drone . She could not have contented herself with being a mere parlor ornament . She never could have wasted her strong sense and full heart in a perpetual round of fashionable dressing , calling and receiving calls . Death from sheer weariness would have resulted from so heavy and intolerable an infliction . So strong a vitality reigned within her , as to forbid even the busy idleness so common among her sex , when their circumstances excuse them from toil . Many a woman spends her days , as if her mission on earth were principally to exist , and as if that were a burden hard to bear . Virgil makes Eolus with flattering lips , and doubtless a double heart , assure Juno that her great work was to find out what would please herself ; hut even that problem is too much for many a fair lady of this lower world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her Master , she was straightened till her work was accomplished . Her zeal at length consumed her , hut it was long in doing it . Her frame was made of asbestos , and stood an intense heat for a great while . To many an idler it would be a burden even to hear the report of what she achieved for education and for the world . There is ample proof that the Sybarite effeminacy which banishes even the hum of active industry , because it can not bear it , is not dead . Miss Lyon was distinguished for practical wisdom . The proof of it is in the complete success of her life . Of her many steps , none had to be backward , none downward . Her career is a climax in which every successive round is a large gain on the preceding . She never made a marked failure . This is to be // ascribed , not so much to her energy , as to her wisddm . She understood the two great elements in this world 's affairs , human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plans ; and whatsoever she did prospered . Her wisdom was not the underground cunning which mines and countermines , and can do nothing more . It was open as the sun 's face in a fair day , and straight forward as his rays . She was as honest and truthful as an echo , or as the clear blue sky when it has just been washed with an April shower . This highly intellectual woman was one of a thousand examples to show that it is not the tenderness of the sex , if it is anything , that peculiarly predisposes them to religion . Her christian life began , as all christian life must begin , in study and conviction . She thought on her ways , before she turned her feet to God 's testimonies . It seemed to her at first ; as it did to others , that her intellectual perceptions were far in advance of her feelings . Doubtless there was much moral blameworthiness in this . Yet it deserves also to be considered , that a new creature in a new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and that the proper organ for this purpose is the eye , and not the heart . She used her eyes faithfully . She studied the Bible thoroughly . She reflected . No new truth came to her without its own fresh welcome . She became rooted and grounded and settled in the faith . She searched till she up divine knowledge , as many lay up that which is of earth ; and as other many lay up gold . in process of time right feeling came by floods , and her soul was liquid with emotion . It was not fitful and unsteady emotion , like gusts of wind in early spring-time . It was not overwhelmingly strong , breaking down the metes and bounds of frail human nature . It was steady and true , as the su'n to his appointed time . It was " punctual as lover to the moment sworn . " The feeling heart became as deep and steady , as the seeing eye was clear and true . Profoundly weak indeed is the somewhat current notion that religion is peculiarly adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some would thereby compliment woman as particularly affectionate and confiding . Others compassionately think that inasmuch as peculiar trials and sorrows fall to the lot of woman , she must need , and is entitled to , peculiar consolation . Hence they cheerfully resign to her the largest share of what is not particularly a boon to them . There are others who are inclined to the same notion , not because they forget , but because they remember , that if christianity be peculiarly adapted to any , it must be to those who are the chief of sinners ; and there // are others still who say the same thing as a double disparagement to christianity and to woman , as though each were just weak enough for the other . As if christianity demanded little conviction and much emotion , and woman 's feeble understanding and tender feelings more readily met the demand than man s sterner and more ir*tellectual nature . As if practical religion did not thrive best in the deep soil of thorough conviction , and in the clear sunlight and pure air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spread its arms far and wide . It must bring its food from far . The strongest intellect , therefore , and not the weakest , is the best fitted for religion. * Its first step is conviction ; and in every real step , conviction is an indispensable ingredient . Conviction is an affair properly of the reason and not of the feelings . For our part , we see with the intellectual faculty , and could never understand how some persons , even of respectable talents , seem to see with their emotions . They can not help feeling that such an argument is convincing , or such a proposition true . One might as well be convinced of meekness or of envy , as test the force of an argument by his heart . The mission of the Holy Spirit is first to convince , and next to comfort ; and all true peace must come of truth , first seen , and then cordially welcomed . The clearest eye , then , whether it be man 's or woman 's , is so far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not spring from truth , seen as they are without honorable parentage , should be suffered to die without notice . If any one is still troubled with the question why more women than men are converted and saved , let him first wait till the final judgment , and see whether it will prove to be a fact . Next , if it shall prove to be a fact , let him seek a probable solution of it in that constitution of society by which men are exposed , so much more than women , to the cares of the world , the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things , which choke the truth and make it unfruitful . But even this solution supposes that it is not the intellect , but the passions and propensities of man , that are so dangerously strong , while their circumstances are peculiarly disadvantageous . Miss Lyon 's benevolence was pure , and deep , and as like God 's , as is perhaps ever seen in mere human flesh . Her complacency could easily distinguish character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . But her benevolence ignored rank and intelligence , creed and character . It was the " Love of being in general , " and she had so much of it that a thousand beings in particular drank of its full overflowings and yet it did not fail . Her benevolence was not the conviction // that she ought to be benevolent . It was not merely an emotion . It was a strong will bent on doing good , and bringing every power and every instrument into sweet captivity to that high end . Her benevolence was such as required and presupposed a high intelligence . She could not have loved and chosen the welfare of others as she did , without a large and clear eye to see wherein it consisted . In few minds of either sex is there a better balance of the moral and the intellectual than she attained and for a long time exhibited . Each power acted on every other unto the enlargement and most profitable investment of all in works of wisdom and love . Her benevolence was not official . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeth ; doubtless saw in it great deficiency . But , judging and speaking after the manner of men , we must say that , if it is true of any , it is true of her that she dwelt in christian love and in the christian 's God . Women who have been trained on the principles which Miss Lyon possessed , and in the spirit which controlled her instructions , will not " quit their proper sphere . " They will feel its importance . They will know their own duty . In the faithful discharge of that duty they will seek and find their honor and their happiness . It is from firesides where christian women watch that the streams must issue which are to make glad the city of God , and cleanse the pollutions of the world . Every great interest of the race is lodged in those hands which have charge of our infancy and youth . The millennium must begin in , and spread from , the nursery . Does the idea , to any one s deficient thought , seem ludicrous ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor cause his voice to be heard , in the streets . It is not men of science and letters , nor merchantprinces whose ships are in every sea , nor all the authors of great and valuable improvements in the arts and conveniences of life , nor busy politicians with eye ever so clear and heart ever so true to work out and bring in the best system of public economy ; it is not mighty monarchs with all their wealth and power , and with more wisdom even than monarchs ever had before , that can make the Sun of righteousness arise on this dark world and bring the glad day of purity and peace . It is ,  --  under Him who only giveth the increase ,  --  it is , the noiseless but effectual care of mothers alone , rising betimes and sowing the good seed , sleeping even with the eyes open , nipping vice in the early bud , and not waiting till the sun is risen to find the enemy 's tares already sprung up , commending the right by their own bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause and their own , and , by an ever-present and absolute but just and // reasonable authority , defending their children 's best and truest interests for all duration , against their present short-sighted wishes ; - it is this , and this alone , that lies at the foundation of all effectual instrumentalities for the temporal and eternal salvation of the race . All this , we are entirely sensible , is nothing new . The doctrine is as old as the world , and as wide as common sense . The most superficial observer of men and manners can see it . If it be nowhere fully carried out , the deficiency is one that will at best be but poorly supplied by theoretical lessons from the sex which can not know the responsibilities and duties of maternity . One such woman as Miss Lyon is worth a worid full of men , to train young ladies for that retired , if you please , but all-important sphere to which the God of Nature and of the Bible has appointed them . Doubtless gentlemen are , and will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and science . With their greater advantages , it would be strange if it were otherwise . But who except a woman ever taught , or will think of teaching , or if he thought of it , would succeed in the attempt , to teach young ladies that domestic virtue and economy , in the best sense of each term , on which , as on two fast and strong pillars , the whole fabric of social and public welfare must forever rest ? Great and invaluable was the influence of Miss Lyon in training up a class of active and efficient women . It was great while she lived . It is still great , now that she is dead . There was no idle blood in her ; and if there was any in those about her , it was apt to be shamed into a quicker flow by her voice and action . She had life enough , and to spare ; and there were many who drew from her urn both light and fire that will never go out . All her plans of school-management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them feel the value of time , and provided for its fullest occupation and improvement . By precept and example she showed the duty and dignity of labor . She poured just contempt on all idlers of whichever sex they might be . Few , if any , of her pupils live the useless life of a gay and fashionable lady . Most of them are both able and willing to understand and to manage any kind of business , that may properly fall to a woman 's lot . Herein consist the respectability and happiness of woman . " She is the excellent wife , " says Gdthe , " who , when her husband dies , can be a father as well as a mother to his children . ' . ' A woman dependent in her habits , though mistress of a fortune , is a blank in the great lottery of life , and should , every morning , think of the fate of him who laid up his talent in a napkin . She whose education and habits make her independent , who has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain herself , and can do good to others besides ,  --  such a woman , without dowry and fortune , is a prize , rich beyond measure in herself , and every way enriching to him who wins her . It is hardly necessary to say how near a country is to physical and moral ruin , when its women have become equally idle and luxurious . The crime and ruin of Sodom was , that , pride and fulness of bread and abundance of idlen* ss were in her and in her daughters . Can life come out of Jeath ? Can inertia in one generation become energy in the next ? Can intelligence come of stupidity , vigorous health of sickness and infirmity , and the fair lineaments of noble and virtuous manhood of inanity ? The active habits of England 's daughters are one most essential condition of her prosperity and greatness . Miss Lyon saw and understood all this ; and with far-reaching wisdom she planned for the health and life , for the activity and energy . for the usefulness and independence , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils , but , as far as in her lay , of the race . If any one is disposed to object to such a training , as unsuitable and injurious to the natural delicacy of the " weaker sex , " he is respectfully informed that there are still females enough whose hands and heads are equally innocent of toil , and who , therefore , are as inane , sickly and dependent as his own fond heart can possibly wish . There is no danger but that spheres of labor will open to all who are trained in Miss Lyon 's way , where they will be something higher and better than mere ornaments . They will be all that , and more . They will be polished and substantial pillars in many a house , and many a community . A mere ornament is for the sunshine only . It sinks in your esteem as the storm rises . At the top of the tempest you throw it overboard as of no value . She is the virtuous woman , of price far above rubies , who shines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness and despair . What a reproof , then , is the example of Miss Lyon to a multitude of her sex , who grow up and pass their days in indolence , or in occupation that is not a whit better , if it is not even worse . Almost her whole life on earth was spent in the most strenuous exertion . From the early morning of her days till its sunset , she wrought with all diligence . She gathered together the treasures of useful knowledge betimes . She disciplined her powers . She polished her armor . She made herself ready for the battle of life . Her spring time had its common share of temptations . There were flowers seducingly scattered beside her path , as there are beside the path of others . She might have lingered to gather them . She had her own world // of fancy , sentiment and passion , and , as many young ladies do , she might have given herself up to revelling in it . Her heart was as warm and susceptible to the beauties of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the imagination , as her intellect was keen to discern the silent harmonies of truth . She might have thrown away her time and talents in reading tales and romances , in building castles in the air , and in a round of empty amusements and frivolous engagemerbts . But she fixed on a higher aim and fully did she attain it . She put herself under high pressure in early life , and scarcely did she relax that pressure for even needful seasons of repose , till nature , originally of the strongest type in her , suddenly and irreparably gave way . Her life is a whole , which one views with a pleasing sense of its completeness . Answering well to her mind , it fails neither by deficiency nor by excess . Both were fulbin all their parts , nothing present in either that should be absent , nothing absent that should be present . The case of Miss Lyon shows what good may often be done by a discerning liberality applied in the education of young ladies . But for the counsel and aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have accomplished her mission of good to her sex , her country , and the world . They saw her promise . They knew her power , and her integrity of purpose . They counselled her ; and she corrected her defects , enlarged her views , and elevated her aims . They cheered her ; and she ran in the paths of knowledge and opening usefulness , with eager steps and great joy . They assisted her ; and she was borne upward and onward , when otherwise she might have sunk in fatal depression . A share of such a crown as she has won and wears no doubt , belongs of right to those who stood by her and befriended her in the early and untried beginnings of her career . It is but little to hold a light and lend a hand to ingenuous youth who feel a quickening power and purpose within them to do good in their day and generation . But that little often leads the young aspirant forth into a broad land of shining usefulness which the world will not willingly let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dateless ages of eternity . Ye whose feet are planted in secure places , and whose hands are full of means to bless , breathe hope and give help to the struggling disciples of religion and science below you . Give it in the hour of need ; while it is passing , before it is past . If you hold dear the name and cross of Christ , seek out and lead forward to places of usefulness those whose lips he has touched with fire and adorned with grace , whose eye he has made clear to see truth , and whose hearts he has suffused with his love . // The example of Miss Lyon illustrates the nature and secret of the highest success in teaching . It is not the whole of true success to make a pupil 's mind thoroughly expert in all its intellectual exercises , as the bodily organs may be made expert in their several offices by gymnastic exercises . Nor if you add to this all knowledge , were it God 's perfect measure , have you yet reached the true idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even realize what is fabled of Apollo , and what is true only of Him whose inspiration giveth understandingcould you bestow on your pupils at will the gifts of divine philosophy , of commanding eloquence , and of true poetic firecould you make every pupil a Plato , a Demosthenes , or a Homer ,  --  still you have not reached the goal-you have not touched the prize . He is the teacher of teachers and winner of the race , who is favored of Heaven so highly as to be enabled to mould the characters and shape the moral course of his pupils aright for both worlds . As all attainments for one 's self are nothing without charity , so in the upshot and issue of things , the teacher 's work and service to his charge will be found shortcoming and deficient , unless he shall have done what in him lay to train them unto that same celestial and never-failing charity . It is not the mere theory of morals , it is not the whole of theology , that is wanted . It is the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that listens to his voice , and patterns after the example of his Son ; the love whose work is doing good , and its rest , the happiness found in doing it ; that cleaves to the right , though it be weak , and shuns and withstands the wrong , though it be popular and mighty-it is commending and instilling such love , it is being the channel and instrumentality through which it descends to the heart and penetrates and moulds the character of others that constitutes the teacher 's highest success and brightest crown . The secret of lVIiss Lyon 's winning this was not a mystery . She was instant in prayer for this very thing . She felt that if she failed here , she failed essentially . She was a woman of great faith , and saw divine things without a cloud . Her faith was not idle and quietisti* , but wrought in her unto hope , and labor , and success . She was herself filled with the charity that suffers long , and is kind . The secret of the Lord was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Her knowledge of human nature , in its various phases and characters , was profound . She understood theology and the Bible to better purpose than many ministers . Her whole character was consistent with her profession . Every one knew what was uppermost with her . The moral power of her life and character seconded her instructions . Her earnestness was a fixed cer // tainty to all . She meant and expected to convert and save souls ; and her idea of conversion and salvation was full and large . She meant and expected to train pupils for glory , honor and immortality . Is it any wonder that she so remarkably succeeded ? Will not similar success always follow the use of sirnilar means in a like spirit ? A marked feature of Miss Lyon 's plan was the manner in which she administered the government oF her school . She made her pupils administer it on themselves . This she did by calling daily for each one 's account of her fulfillment , or nonfulfillment , of her required duties . Thus each one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , to herself . Miss Lyon removed all espionage and all vexatious penalties from her school , as far as the east is removed from the west . She exerted a moral and religious influence , so wholesome , so powerful , and so pervading , that in the experience of years under the same system , she found no occasion to regret , but every occasion to rejoice in , its adoption . It had , indeed , been tried with complete success before , in Miss Grant 's schools at Derry and at Ipswich . Not but that she truly and effectually governed her school . Never was a school more thoroughly governed . Miss Lyon beheved in constant care and supervision of pupils in school and out of school . She knew that idle hands and idle minds easily fall into mischief . She , therefore , took it upon her to determine the employment of every waking hour . Her maxims on this head seem to have been these ; a time for every thing-every thing in its time  --  and for all waking time some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way required great moral power . It required her laws , and God 's law , to be written on the hearts of the controlling majority of the school . She took care to write them on her pupils ' hearts , and they did not depart from them . She trusted them , when enlightened and converted to her authority , and she was not ashamed . They obeyed her , and thought they were governing themselves . With pupils , stiff-necked and rebellious , such a system must , of course , be a failure . But is such a temper in the members of a school a dire necessity , any more than it is in the members of a family ? Must teachers and pupils , while they in reality have but one , and that a priceless interest , yet forever seem to have different and opposing ones ? Can not the hearts of pupils be turned to their teachers , and the hearts of teachers to their pupils , so that the instruction and the kindness of the one shall be requited with perpetual respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
