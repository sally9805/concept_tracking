txt ART . ITh-NATURE OF EVIDENCE IN PRACTICAL MEDICINE . MEDICINE *5 at the present day one of the staple subjects of conversation in all circles . The merits of remedies , and modes and systems of practice , and of physicians , are discussed and pronounced upon , as if there were no deficiency of knowledge on these subjects , and as if there were no difficulty in coming at a proper decision . There has indeed always been an especial freedom in the discussions and decisions of both the ignorant and the learned , in regard to medicine . Dr. Beddoes , an English physician , once remarked that " there are three things which almost every person gives himself credit for understanding , whether he has taken any pains to make himself master of them or not . These are : 1 , The art of mending a dulifire ; 2 , Politics ; and , 3 , Puvsic . " But although this has always been true , there never was such bold and busy speculation among all classes on the subject of medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine was left , to no inconsiderable extent , to the physician ; and educated wisdom could speak with some measure of authority on this as well as on other subjects . But these days are past , and now the privilege of sitting in judg // ment both on the theory and the practice is assumed by everybody , and the distinction between educated physicians and pretenders is to a large extent obliterated in the eyes even of the intelligent portion of the community . While non-medical men in all classes pronounce their opinions on medicine thus freely and authoritatively , as if there were no doubt that they understood the subject , there is no subject in regard to which they perpetrate so many and so gross errors . There is a strange misapprehension on their part of the application of the rules of evidence . They pretend to examine the evidence for themselves , but come to conclusions widely variant , sometimes wholly opposite in their character . All the pathies and isrns now before the public are claimed by their several advocates to be founded on undoubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sure that all the rest of the world are in utter darkness on this subject . Such being the state of things , and even among a large portion of the intelligent in the community , it will not be unprofitable to look at the causes of the erroneous judgments which are so commonly formed by the public mind , and to some extent by the professional mind also , on the subject of practical medicine . For this purpose we invite the attention of our readers to the nature of the evidence in relation to the influence of remedies , the principles which we should observe in collecting this evidence and in investigating it , and the errors which arise from a disregard of these principles . The grand difficulty in the investigation of the , evidence on this subject lies in its complex character . So many influences are at work in conjunction with the remedy which we administer , that it is difficult , sometimes impossible , to estimate its exact effect . Let us look at this point by comparing this subject with some other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are experimenting with two or three substances-examining their action upon each other . You know what these substances are , and the quantities of them which you use ; and they are few in number . Under such circumstances there is commonly no difficulty in coming at definite results . And then you know that if you ever make similar mixtures of these substances , these same results will be realized . But it is not so with the experimenting of the physician with his remedy . The remedy acts in connection not only with many agencies , but agencies that vary in the different cases , and that vary also in the different stages of the same case . While in the chemical investigation you know the quantities of // the substances which you use , the physician is often puzzled in estimating the quantities or forces of the agencies affecting the patient under his care . That we may fully appreciate this point , let us observe what these agencies are . They are , the operations of the disease under which the patient is suffering  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of constitutional peculiarities  --  the action of all the various external agencies , air , food , temperature , electrical and other states . Observe that each one of these many agencies is in itself complex-it is really a set of agencies . Take , for example , the operations of the disease . This is far from being a simple agency even in the most simple cases . For even if the disease be located in a single organ , it can not be insulated there . The sympatliies linking it with other organs light up . disturbances here and there in the system . No organ can be sick by itself . This is true even of what are called simple uncomplicated cases . But the great majority of the cases which come under the care of the physican are not of this character . They are complicated from the outset . It would be interesting and profitable to show by many illustrations in what various ways cases of disease are made complex . But one or two illustrations must suffice . When disease appears to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be going on in some organ in a secret manner a morbid process , the result of some previous disease ; and in the progress of the case , unexpected developments may arise from this source . Or , while the physician supposes that he is attacking a disease of some single organ , disease may be gathering , or be actually in progress , in some other organ , or in several organs . Even when the complications of disease , arising from such causes , plainly show themselves in the symptoms , it severely taxes the skill of the physician to meet them appropriately with his remedies . We see then how complex is even one of the agencies mentioned . And when we look at all these agencies , and observe how they in all their variations affect the case , and vary it by their mutual influences , intermingling with each other in all modes and quantities , we can have some idea how exceedingly complicated are the considerations which must be kept in view by the physician , if he desire to treat disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case . From this brief and hasty view of the subject it must be obvious that there is a constant necessity for sifting and comparing evidence in the practice of medicine ; that no conclusions require more caution and discretion , and a wider range of view , // than those which the physician is obliged to make in his common daily rounds ; and that therefore nothing calls for greater skill in observation than Therapeutics . But although this be so , there is no subject on which so little caution is observed in arriving at conclusions . The profession , as well as the community at large , seem to be little aware of the difficulties which attend medical investigations . Inferences are made in relation to the agency of remedies in the most facile manner , as if the subject were a simple and uncomplicated one . Medical experience , therefore , both in and out of the profession , is ever busy in embracing and discarding errors . The world is full of mistakes in regard to practical medicine ; and so it ever has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annals of what is termed regular medicine , as well as in the annals of quackery . The practical errors of medicine are not as numerous , nor as gross , as those of quackery ; but they are similar in kind , and they arise from the same cause-viz : a disregard of the complicated agencies which mingle with the action of remedies . We might trace here in full the analogy between regular medicine and quackery in this respect . But we will only allude to the resemblance which the reports in medical journals in relation to the efficacy of some favorite remedy sometimes bear to the representations made in regard to quack medicines . Case after case is given in which the remedy appears to have conquered the disease in question ; and if the record be a true one , a great discovery has certainly been made in medicine . But physicians in various quarters try the remedy in the same disease , and do not meet with the same experience , with the exce p tion of some here and there who are as eager for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy , therefore , though from the influence of these enthusiasts it may acquire a temporary , noisy reputation , is soon discarded and forgotten . It is unnecessary to show how the same process is gone through with by the quack remedy with the multitude , as the remedy vaunted in the scientific medical journal experiences with the profession . The evil of which we have spoken , existing alike in the profession and in the community , though in different forms and degrees , is a serious obstacle to the progress of practical mcdi cine . If a habit of forming hasty and therefore false conclusions in medicine were confined for the most part to the uneducated , it would be comparatively a small evil . But it is not thus confined . Far from it . The habit is inveterate in the // educated and refined , and has a strong hold upon the great body of the medical profession itself . Observe just what the evil is . The great failure with thinking men , *both in and out of the profession , is a disregard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the real facts in the case ; and yet they do not dream that they fail in this point . They are very sure that they are right . They have seen for themselves , and therefore can not doubt . It is this apparently actual , clear , decided , undoubted experience , that is constantly appealed to as sanctioning conclusions of the most diversified and incongruous character . V*That is the explanation of this ? It is to be found in the very prevalent disregard of the complicated and difficult nature of the subject , and the co*sequent neglect to sift sufficiently the evidence . In other words , it is the lack of a discriminating observation -- an observation which takes into view all the agencies which can have any bearing on the results , and tries to weigh their comparative influences . Here we will remark incidentally , that the defect of which we have spoken as being so prevalent in observation in practical medicine , is the grand defect in observation on all subjects . Conclusions which are false are drawn from narrow premises . Circumstances which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . It is in this way that statistics are made so often to support false conclusions . And another remark proper to be made in this connection is , that true acumen in observation is a rarer accomplishment than is commonly supposed . What is called the ingenious reasoner is more easily found than the good observer . This is eminently true of medicine , but it is true of all science . But let us inquire more particularly how we are to judge of the influence of remedies upon the cure of disease . In order to get a clear idea of their influence , we will divide remedies into two classes . The first class is a limited one . It includes those remedies which have a definite , perhaps we may say specific , relation to some disease ; but the nature , the mode , of its relation we do not understand . Quinine , in its application to the treatment of intermittent fever , is an example . Ve know that it arrests this disease , but we know nothing of the modus ojoerandi by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applicability of any of them to any case that presents itself . The remedies which are in *o // common use , Calomel , Opium , and Antimony , belong to this class . So , also , do all the various kinds of evacuants , stimulators of the secretions , relaxants , astringents , stimulants , &amp;c . Let us look at some of these by way of illustration . Calomel produces certain known effects upon the secretions . These effects are relied on by the rational physician in deciding the question of its applicability to any case . It is ordinarily through these known effects that he expects it to act upon the disease . Opium produces also certain palpable effects-relief of pain , the quieting of restlessness , sleep , &amp;c . Whenever it is used it is because some of these effects , or all of them , if produced , will have a favorable influence upon the morbid condition . The relaxant and depressing effects of antimony are sometimes called for in the treatment of disease . Whenever these effects are deemed desirable in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence in regard to the remedies of the first class , is both limited and empirical. * The question in relation to their influence is a simple , uncomplicated one . In deciding upon the efficacy of any remedy alleged to belong to this class , the question is merely as to the reality of the alleged relation between it and the disease . It is not only a simple , but a direct enquiry . We are not obliged to examine a wide range of effects , in order to see what the relation of the medicine is to the malady . The question simply is , does it arrest or remove a disease which would otherwise go on . It may require a large number of cases to decide the question satisfactorily ; but in observing these cases the mind is directed to a single point . Then , if it be decided that the remedy has the relation supposed , the questions which come up in regard to its use are ordinarily far from being complicated . First , we are to decide whether in the case before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulates it . If it be the disease , our course is a plain one , that is , provided that the case be not encumbered with complications . We are to administer the remedy in such * The word empirical , though ordinarily applied to quackery , is used also in medicine with a different and better meaning attached to it . It is used in opposition to the word rational , in relation to the treatment of disease . Treatment is said to he empirical when it is hased upon simple experience in regard to the effects of remedies , without any attempt to reason about their mode of operation . Rational treatment , on the other hand , is based upon reasoning in regard to the modes ojierandi of medicines . And as the remedies of the secon ( l class in our division are such , that we reason about their effects , that is , observe their modus operandi , in jndgin0 of their applicability , we say that the evidence in relation to them is rational , while the evidei*e in relation to remedies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to overcome the malady . If the case , however , is not a simple one , but the disease has other derangements connected with it , there is need of the employment of remedies of the second class ; and the questions in regard to treatment multiply and become complicated . A question also arises , which it is sometimes difficult to solve , whether the main disease shall be attacked at the same time that we endeavor to remove the complications  --  a question which must be decided very differently in different cases , according to the circumstances of each individual case . In regard to the remedies of the second class , the evidence is rational , in opposition to empirical , and is also complicated . For a just appreciation of the applicabiJity of the remedy to any case must be based upon an accurate knowledge of its effects upon the system . And it must be a knowledge of these effects as they are modified by the mingled play of the many agencies , both internal and external , both natural and morbid , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be from this cause a complicated and extended knowledge . But this is not the extent of the complication . If it be properly decided that a remedy is applicable to a case , the question arises , to what extent and in what manner it shall be administered . This question is sometimes an exceedingly difficult and delicate one , and it is very apt to be decided erroneously by the incautious and undiscriminating practitioner . The complication does not ordinarily end here . We seldom administer one remedy alone . And the several remedies are not only modified in their influence by the agencies which we have mentioned , but they modify the influence of each other . The routine practitioner often loses sight of this important fact . But sometimes even this is not the end of the complication . Though the nature of the malady may indicate most clearly the applicability of the remedy , and the general aspect of the case may even be such as to force on us the conviction that it is imperatively demanded , yet to the physician who scrutinizes narrowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view takes in all the circumstances of the case , there may be some circumstances which lead him to doubt whether it be best on the whole to administer the remedy . And a further consideration of the case may decide him to withhold it . Fearfully momentous , as well as exceedingly perplexing , questions often arise under such circumstances . The thorough consideration of such questions has saved the life of many a patient , which an undiscriminating routinism would have destroyed . // We see then how extensive and involved are the considerations which should govern the physician , in the administration of the class of remedies of which we have been speaking . And as these are for the most part the remedies upon which he is to rely in his contest with disease , we see the imperative necessity for both a comprehensive and an accurate observation in medicine . Necessity , we say-that is , if the physician regard his duty to his patients , and aspire to success in coping with disease . But the necessity does not exist , if he desire merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained , even with the wealthy , the refined and the learned , without the labor and perplexity that we have indicated , with an easy and stupid routinism , especially if it be under the guise of a showy system of doctrines . But true success in the difficult and complicated art of medicine is not to be obtained by anything but comprehensive , scrutinizing , patient , honest observation . The nature and the amount of the evidence required to establish the efficacy of any remedy varies very much in different diseases . The greater the tendency to a spontaneous recovery , the greater is the difficulty in estimating the influence of remedies . Some diseases are self-limited , as it is termed . That is , they go through with a certain succession of processes , and then they are ended . Small pox , scarlet fever and measles , are familiar examples . When a disease of this character has been passed through , unless the system has received fatal injury during its progress , the restorative tendency , the vis medicatrix naturce , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , this restorative power has been at work through all the progress of the disease , restraining its violence , and making its preparations for the expulsion of the intruder . The cure in such cases , effected in the great majority of them chiefly , and often wholly , by this restorative power , is very apt to be attributed to some particular remedy or course of practice . The difficulty of judging accurately in such diseases of the influence of remedies is increased by the fact , that the disposition to spontaneous recovery varies much at different times and in different localities ; and this disposition is not always proportionate to the apparent degree of severity of the cases . We have a striking illustration of this remark in scarlet fever . Various remedies and modes of practice have gained a temporary celebrity in the treatment of this disease , from having chanced to be employed when the disease had a stronger tendency to a spontaneous recovery than is usually the case . The same disposition to spontaneous recovery appears in the vast majority of cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definite self-limited character . And the same remarks can be made in regard to the difficulty of estimating the extent of the influence which remedies have in their cure . To determine this a wide range of rigidly compared observations is obviously necessary . But , on the other hand , if the question be in relation to a disease which is very apt to end fatally , the efforts of the vis medicatrix natural being almost always baffled , should a successful termination follow the use of any remedy or any particular course of treatment even in a small number of cases , the evidence would be quite conclusive in favor of such remedy or course . The question in this instance is a simple one , and no wide range of compared observations is needed . The agencies here being all adverse , or at least failing to do good , the influence of any added agency is easily determined . But in diseases where the agencies work variously , sometimes well and sometimes adversely , it is not so easy to estimate the influence of any added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( lung fever , ) when the restorative power is ordinarily prominent in the movements of the case , and is generally competent to effect a cure without assistance on the part of the physician , accurate and varied observation is required to estimate the efficacy of any remedy . But , on the contrary , in such diseases as tetanus or hydrophobia , which are so apt to end fatally , any remedy which is truly efficacious in their cure would require obviously but a limited observation to establish its claims . We have a good illustration of these principles in the cure and prevention of hydrophobia . While , as we have said , it would be easy to establish the claims of any true remedy for this disease , it is not so with preventives . For it is found that not more than one in twenty of those who are reported to be bitten by mad dogs have the disease , whatever may be done by way of prevention . It would therefore require a large number of observations to establish the claims of any real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proclamation from time to time of numerous sure preventives . The State of New York purchased in 1806 the prescription of One of these preventives From its discoverer , for one thousand dollars . The ingredients were , an ounce of the jaw-bone of a dog burned and pulverized , the false tongue of a newly foaled colt , dried and pulverized , and one scruple of verdigris , raised from the surface of old copper , by laying in moist earth  --  the coppers of George I , or II , being preferred as most pure . If this prescription was read to the legislature after its vote of purchase , the // assembled wisdom of the people must have been both enlightened and astonished . It is very seldom that any one thing cures disease . The recovery is ordinarily effected by a great variety of remedies and measures , suited in the different stages of the case to the varyin* conditions of the patient . And foremost among the means placed in the power of the physician , is the restorative tendency of the system . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is nature 's means , and not that it is ours . But it is our means quite as much as are the drugs that we administer . It is ours just as the wind is the mariner s means of propelling his vessel . As he arranges his sails and governs his rudder in such a way as to get all the help that he can from the wind , the physician so manages all his appliances as to give full play to the action of the vis medicatrix naturce . The analogy may be followed out into various particulars , without incurring the charge of being fanciful . We will not stop to do this , but will simply say , that as when the mariner has arrived at the place of his destination , we say very properly that he has brought his vessel safely to port , although the wind that has filled his sails has done it ; so we may say of the physician , when his patient recovers , that he has cured him , although the restorative power of nature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit of skillful guidance belongs to both . The amount of interference required in the treatment of disease , varies exceedingly in the different cases . While in the great majority of cases a recovery would be effected spontaneously , yet a judicious interference makes them recover more speedily , and with less damage to the system . Then there are some cases in which little if any interference is needed , the duty of the physician being to watch the movements of the case , and to see that the patient shall not harm himseW nor get harm from his friends . But there are other cases in which a sturdy conflict with disease is demanded , and a timid course would prove injurious , perhaps destructive . It is a very common error to suppose that skill is needed only when there is something to be done . But no truth is more emphatically and abundantly uttered by medical experience than this-that it requires as much knowledge and skill to determine what shall not be done , as to determine what shall be done . And no stronger exhibitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the uncalled for interferences which have been so common in medicine . The temptations operating upon the physician to induce him to put forth such interferences are powerful even at the pres // ent time . For , besides the natural fondness in man for producing results by his own direct agency , and his disposition to attribute effects to some antecedent without the labor of rigid enquiry , the demand on the part of the public is very generally for active interference . We see this in the modes of expression which are prevalent on this subject . Searching medicines are olten spoken of with peculiar approbation , and the importance of reaching the disease and expelling it is dwelt upon , while palliative and quieting remedies are generally spoken of quite disparagingly . The idea that opium ever cures disease is commonly scouted as preposterous . And when much has been done , and the counsels of ' many physicians , and perhaps some quacks , have been brought into requisition , but without avail , the friends of the patient speak of it as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that could be to save him* not dreaming of the possibility that too much may have been done . Perhaps the disposition to demand of the physician an active medication in all cases exists to a greater degree in this than in other countries . We are preeminently an energetic and enterprising people , and therefore the bold " heroic " practitioner is apt to meet with favor from the public . Even in the case of those who rely upon infinitesimals , the disposition alluded to is manifest . For their faith rests on the new and mysterious power claimed to be communicated by minute division , trituration , and succussion  --  a power which enables the remedy , as it is supposed , to interfere most effectually with the disease , by penetrating to the very fibres and cells where it has its seat , and casting out the intruder . And some of the swallowers of globules go so far as to believe with Ilahnemann , that nothing but " downward shakes " will impart this power . The same disposition is shown in other ways also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic power of infinitesimals are very ready to applaud and to adopt in their own case the practice of Ilydropathy , which is certainly rather positive , generally quite " heroic " in its attack on disease . And further than this , it is no uncommon thing to see globules temporarily exchanged for the gross administration of other forms of quackery , even the parboiling and rending medication of Thompsonism , without a suspicion that there is any inconsistency in such changes . The demand , so common in the community , for active medication , obliges the physician who is guided by an accurate and discriminating observation to engage in a struggle against the notions of many of his employers , or to resort to the expedients // of evasion and concealment . In the present state of the community , the welfare of patients requires of him a mixture of the two plans . Sometimes he must boldly resist , sometimes evade . But evasion , let it be remembered , should never be practiced at the expense of real honesty . Much less should the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with honesty or honor . The current is now setting more strongly than ever before in the profession in favor of cautious and discriminating practice . The disposition to form hasty inferences in regard to the influence of remedies , though still abounding , is decidedly lessening among physicians . It is not so in the community at large , not even in its most intelligent and learned portion . The profession is getting more and more impressed with the truth of the axiom of Chomel , that it is only the second law of Therapeutics to do good , its first law being this-not to do harm . Cautionary measures , and the regulation of the circumstances , both mental and physical , which may affect the patient , are coming to be considered as having as much importance as positive medication . The disposition to investigate narrowly the alleged efficacy of remedies , rather than believe in it on limited and flimsy evidence , is increasing among medical men , and promises a rapid improvement in general Therapeutics . Some idea can be formed of the extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we observe the difference in practice between some one undiscriminating overdos ing physician and one who is discriminating and cautious . In the case of the former we see effects continually attributed to remedies without any just regard to the other agencies which are at work . His views are as indefinite as they well can be . Ingenious theories of the modus operandi of medicines he may have , but he has no accurate knowledge of their real effects , as modified by other agencies . Much of the time , in the midst of his continual doing , he knows not whether he is doing good or harm . And perhaps when he thinks that he is making his most successful onset on the disease , he is inflicting a blow on the patient from which he may never recover . The ridiculous nonsense of doing nothing with the show of doing would be better on the whole , for this would at least do no positive harm . The vis medicatrix natura* , left to itself , will cure more patients than an undiscriminating over doing practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one established general rule is , to give medicines only with definite views of their applicability , based upon evidence both sufficiewt // in amount , and properly sifted . He wishes to see his object clearly before he takes his aim . As a physician of homely common ser*se once expressed it , he is willingto fire if he can see something to fire at . He is not disposed to rush into a sort of meh*e with the various agencies that are struggling in the battle of life with disease , and make confusion worse confounded . He watches the movements of the case narrowly , rendering assistance in effecting the desired result only when he sees that the opportunity clearly offers , and withholding interference when he sees that it will do no good , and being especially careful to do no harm . Let us not be understood to mean that in no case must there be any venturing upon doubtful ground in the administration of medicine . This is sometimes allowable , nay , demanded by the exigency of the case ; but the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general rule . So competent , and so almost ever present is the restorative agency of nature , that the physician should not ordinarily do anything positive , unless he can clearly see that it will be of service . Neither let us be understood to mean that the watchfulness of the physician is to be intermitted when there is no positive medication called for . The case may in its progress require this ; and even if it do not , the patient may need negative directions to prevent harm being done to his case by himself or his friends . And further than this , the feeling on the part of the patient , that he is under the watch of one who knows when and what to do , is of great advantage as a curative influence . While this confidence calms the troubled nerves , and even sometimes acts as a cordial to exhausted power , and thus has no small agency in the recovery , the Jack of this confidence sometimes does manifest harm by its agitating and depressing influence . The practitioner who pursues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ractice that we have indicated , will be all the time acquiring a positive knowledge of the action of remedies which can not possibly be attained by the undiscriminating doser . He will not only have more and more definite views of the effects of remedies as compared with each other , but he will acquire great skill in adapting the remedies in their quantities , forms arid combinations to the endlessly varying morbid conditions which he is called to treat . This skill will enable him to effect recoveries by well directed gentle impressions of medicine in cases which baffle undiscriminating skill And on the other hand , it will enable him , by its keen discernment of the right time , mode and point of attack , to achfrve von . xi . 71 // many more cures by an occasional " heroic " medication , than others do by their constant fierce and somewhat hap-hazard onslaught upon disease . The knowledge and skill of such a practitioner will enable him to make conti'ibutions from time to time to the stores of the profession 's experience . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue the same course of observation , most of the incongruities which now disgrace the records of medical experience would be speedily removed , and consistency and exactness would characterize medicine , in spite of the difficulties which embarrass its investigations . The views which we have presented show how entirely out of place routinism is in medicine . No subject requires so much variety and comprehensiveness in its investigation ; no art requires such constant and endless change in its appliances . A clear , wide-awake , industrious mind , is eminently demanded in the practice of medicine . But indolence and a lack of appreciation of the rules of evidence are apt to lead the physician into routinisrn , and there is very commonly in the profession little grappling with the essential difficulties of the science . This routinism shows itself in various forms according to the character of the mind that indulges in it . In one it puts on a scientific guise ; and ingenious theorizing , developing a system of doctrines , gives to him the self-satisfied feeling and the bearing of science , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even with the profession . Another it leads through the round of ideas and practices which he gathers from association with brother practitioners , either through direct intercourse or through books . Another catches eagerly every novelty that is proclaimed in medical journals , and is danced by it through a temporary routine of practice , which is soon to be succeeded by some other that may be of a totally different character . The public do not deem him a routinist , but he is one of the worst kind . It is routinism all the whileit is only every now and then changing its phases . Another still adopts some speciality , and pursues his round of routinism in that little circle . Certain remedies and modes of practice are all in all with him , and as he proclaims his devotion to this particular branch of medicine , the public think that he is of course skillful , and he is laigely patronized . The present fashionable treatment of what are called throat difficulties furnishes a good example . It is manifestly much easier to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of doctrines , than to engage in the labor of the strict and cautious observation of which we // have said so much in this article . For however scientific the system of doctrines may make the routinism to appear , the ideas are fixed and have but a narrow range . And it is easy to let the mind run in the same channels of thought , and none the less easy because the channels are better than some other channels . In the views which we have presented we can find a ready explanation of the fact , that any medicine , or measure , or course of practice , can be made to acquire a reputation for success entirely irrespective of its merits . Of the fact we have examples every day . Every quack establishes to some extent a fame for his nostrum ; and the extent of its fame depends not in the least upon its efficacy , but upon a skillful use of the means of bringing it into notice . Precisely the same can be said of any system that is broached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , and with medical sects , which , though contending with each other , are affiliated in their enmity towards the medical profession . Though these systems are of the most opposite character , each claims to be the only true system , and establishes its claim with its adherents by an appeal , iet it be observed , to its actual preeminent success in its practical operation . The appeal is the same which every quack makes in regard to his nostrum , and by which he so surely gains the public ear and favor . It is not necessary to go into a full development of the manner in which this show of success is made out . But we will briefly consider two facts on which it mainly depends . One is the fact that other agencies beside the remedies used have so much to do with the cure of disease . Among these may be mentioned the regulation of the diet , air and exercise , the omission of labor , especially mental labor , the substitution for it of recreation , but above all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the human system were no longer to have any tendency to restore itself , and no cures were hereafter to be effected except by sheer medication , nostrums and systems of medicine would forever disappear , for the source of their borrowed , or rather stolen , glory would be no more . The question in relation to the efficacy of any remedy would then be so simple and uncomplicated , that there would be little difficulty in the decision of it . The narrowness and the falsity of the various exclusive modes and systems would also be easily demonstrated , by their failure in their practical operation . But whiN* this abolition of the restorative power of nature would enable us to test more easily the virtues of remedies and // modes of practice , and therefore to distinguish more readily between good and bad practice , and between judicious physicians and the unskillful and quackish , the abandonment of the system to sheer medication would by no means be for the good of the patient . The vis medicatrix naturce is in most cases , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of cure , and any contrivances of man would altogether fail to supply the deficiency , if this means were lost . I-Iahnemann expresses himself as having a poor opinion of the efforts of the " unintelligent vital powers , " and berates the " vulgar practice " for its imitation of the bungling operations of nature in its contest with disease . But if these curative operations of nature were suspended , the dynarnized globules would at once be seen to be powerless , and something which has a positive , and not a mere imaginary power , would be demanded . In such a state of things Jlomcoopathy would be the first to die among all the isms and path ies that are now flourishing in the world . It may be remarked here that Homzvopathy has gained its popularity in a somewhat different manner from the systems of positive medication , such as Hydropathy and Thompsonism , which are rival claimants with it for the public favor . Take , for example , Thompsonism . It is obvious , that while the infinitesimals absolutely do nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other agencies which we have mentioned , and especially by the vis medicatrix naturce , Thompsonism sometimes actually breaks up disease by its active interference , ( for it is competent to do this in some cases , ) and in other cases when a cure is effected it is done by the restorative power in spite of the treatment . We know of no more striking illustration of the efficacy of the vis medicatrix naturce , than is furnished by the fact , that Thompsonisrn has acquired such a reputation for success , for its violent medication is certainly very inappropriate in the great majority of cases . An agency which can so often effect a cure in opposition to such treatment , must be one of no inconsiderable power . The other fact to be noticed in explanation of the show of success attending rem&amp;ies , and modes , and systems is , the concealment which is practiced in regard to what goes to prove a want of success . The unsuccessful cases are studiously kept out of view . This is sometimes done from absolute dishonesty . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not generally . Self-deception is a large source of the concealment practiced by the believers in systems , and even sometimes of that which is practiced by the arrant quack . The attention is apt to be fastened upon the facts which seem to favor what one wishes to // believe , while it is apt to be withdrawn from those of an opposite character . These two facts of which we have spoken furnish an explanation of the grounds of that reputation , which some men have maintained during all the time that they have been engaged in various and even opposite modes of practice . We know of some who had as wide a popular reputation when practicing after the ordinary regnlar mode , as it is termed , as they now have in practicing what they claim to be almost infiniteiy better , Iomceopathy . Clearly if one mode be good practice , the other can not be , as it is so wholly opposite in its character ; and reputation for success can not pertain to both , if it be based upon true grounds . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these individuals to whom we refer should have acquired a large increase of reputation when they embraced this system . The fact that they have had the same reputation under both systems , shows conclusively that the reputation is entirely irrespective of real success . In other words , it is a false reputation . It is built upon trickery , and it matters little with them what modes of practice they adopt or what remedies they give , at least if they be only fashionable . But the same causes which are seen so extensively at work producing the results that we have indicated in the community at large , appear also to some extent in the profession itself . They may be seen giving a brilliant and sudden reputation to new remedies . We need not stop to show that this reputation is generally to be attributed to the two causes on which we have remarked , viz , the losing sight of the agencies which concur with medication in curing disease , or cure it in spite of the medication , ( which happens oftener than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the facts , the unfavorable as well as the favorable . The chief difference between the profession and the medical pretenders abroad in the community in regard to this matter is , that while dishonesty predominates among the latter , self-deception predominates in the profession , in producing the false conclusions in regard to the efficacy of remedies . And this remark applies as well to the quacks who dignify their quackery with all the pomp and circumstance of a system , as well as those who peddle nostrums . The same causes have a large influence also in building up the reputation of many physicians . Every physician has two kinds*of reputation , a popular one , and a strictly professional one . And they are often very far from coinciding with each other . A physician may be in very low estimation with the profession , and yet , from the very causes of which we have // spoken as giving popularity to remedies and modes and systems , he may acquire a brilliant reputation with the community . Even the physician who resorts to no cunning arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hands of the public a reputation which is far from being wholly based upon those true grounds on which rests his reputation with the profession . It would hardly be wise in him however to attempt to set the matter right , and modestly disclaim merit which is not his due . For , though he may have credit bestowed upon him at one time , that he does not deserve , at another he may not only fail to get credit which is largely due to him , but may receive instead of it blame and even abuse . It is proper therefore that he should take the credit awarded to him by a capricious public , even when the award is based upon insufficient or perhaps false grounds . There is commonly no danger that the modest and true man in the medical profession will receive more credit on the whole than is his due , and therefore a correction of any misapplication in his favor in this respect is not called for on his part . The physician who resorts to cunning and deceptive arts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon false grounds . The reputation for success , it is well known , can be manufactured by the cunning practitioner , although he be really unsuccessful , while he can at the same time by the same cunning fasten the unfounded reputation of a want of success upon a competitor of vastly more merit as a judicious physican . Success in the treatment of disease , it has come to be a well known fact , is far from being the same thing as success in obtaining the public favor and patronage , even when the contest lies among the refined and intelligent . Great tact is often exhibited in accomplishing this latter purpose by men who have really little good judgment in the treatment of disease , and who could be proved , if the facts could all be known , to be unsuccessful practitioners . We said in the beginning of this article that there was a great and universal interest in the community at the present time in regard to practical medicine , and that it furnishes some of the prominent subjects of conversation in all circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very desirable that intelligent men should be so informed on this subject , as to be able to mould aright the opinions of the many over whom they exert an influence . And it is for their information that we have thrown out the suggestions contained in this article . We hope that they will give them the consideration which they deserve , and as a practical result of such an examination , they will do // what they can to deliver the community from the errors which so much abound in relation to medicine . We know of no class of men who can do so much in this respect as clergymen . We speak of them particularly here , because they constitute so large a portion of the readers of the New Engiander . Their habits of investigation , their position , the extent and character of their intercourse with their fellowmen , give them great power over the prevalent opinions of society . There is no class of men who can so effectually coöperate with the better portion of the medical profession in their efforts to enlighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rests upon them in relation to these efforts is a great one . And they should therefore seek for correct information on this subject , and by familiar conference with intelligent physicians should endeavor to set themselves right , and to exert their proper influence upon the community . At the same time , ye would remark , there is a duty incumbent upon physicians in relation to this subject which they are very apt to neglect . They are too much inclined to assume that they are to be taken altogether upon trust , and that confidence is to be placed in them almost without enquiry . They therefore generally take little pains to explain to the intelligent the points on which they have erred , and the grounds of their own opinions . They are too much disposed to leave men to work their own way out of their errors , and are accustomed to say that they never knew any one to be talked out of quackery . We believe that they err on this point . We believe that the intelligent in the community can judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . The difficulty is that the evidence does not come to them in the right manner , and they are not made aware of the peculiar difficulties which embarrass the investigations of practical medicine . Truth on these points , we know from personal experience , can be appreciated by sensible men ; and we believe that physicians can do an important work in this respect if they will undertake it in their daily intercourse with the community . But we wish to have it distinctly understood whom we mean by the intelligent . We do not mean the learned and talented , for such may be exceedingly destitute of what is properly called intelligence , and we know of no more inveterate and incurable dupes of quackery than some who belong to this class . We mean by the intelligent , those who , in whatever station they may be , possess good judgment , and have acquired a considerable amount of information upon which they have exercised this judgment . They may have learning and genius , but these are not essential to intelli // gence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on the whole community , for such have much to do with moulding the opinions of their fellow men . In endeavoring to correct the errors of the community in regard to practical medicine , it must be always kept in mind that the cause of these errors is to be found , as we have stated , in a misapplication of the rules of evidence . And it is to be distinctly understood , that all remedies and modes of practice are to be tested by actual experience , and are not to be estimated by any doctrines or theories which we may please to apply to them . The taunt is often thrown out by the advocates of the new systems of the present time , that the medical profession shrink from the test of actual experience , and will not receive new facts because they do not correspond with a set of time-worn and musty principles or doctrines , to which they are charged with being obstinately attached . We have not time , nor is it necessary , to refute this slander . Suffice it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quackery , and who desire a reputation based upon merit , wish to have every thing tried by the strict rules of evidence , irrespective of doctrines or theories . But they desire that the evidence should be suflicient in amount , and that it should be properly inv&amp;stigated . They are utterly opposed to forming hasty conclusions from limited , loosely gathered , and ill-digested evidence , whether it be done in the profession or out of it . The general attitude of the community in relation to medicine holds out inducements to tempt The physician to neglect the strict investigation of evidence , and to rely upon false issues in acquiring a reputation for success . It is therefore only by a virtuous struggle against temptation that he gives himself to the work of an honest and thorough study of disease and its treatment , in place of practicing arts to gain favor and patronage . And this untoward popular influence does not come merely from the masses , but also to a great extent from the intelligent and the influential . In proof of this we will allude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We refer to the fact that those followers of specialities who ply all the arts of quackery to gain celebrity , so uniformly succeed in obtaining patronage from the best classes of society . Such being the state of things , it becomes thinking men to look at this subject , and to inquire whether some better means and rules of judgment can not be *adopted by them , in estimating the merits of physicians , as well as of remedies and modes and systems . There are some subjects somewhat allied to medicine that // have from time to time excited much interest in the communitv , in relation to which there has been a similar disregard of the strict rules of evidence , it would be interesting to remark on them in this connection , did our limits permit . But this article is already too long , and we will only cite one example of the loose application of the rules of evidence , which has characterized the investigation on the part of the community of the class of subjects referred to . It is a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was published . Colonel Stone gave a clairvoyant in Providence a sealed packet with a very odd sentence enclosed in it , and then left for New York . A day or two after the packet was sent to him with the seals apparently just as they were , and with it the reading of apart ot the sentence . The colonel inferred that the clairvoyant read the sentence without opening the packet . The inference was an unwarrantable one . The true test evidence in the case was lost sicrht of If she could read the packet without opening it , why did she not do it in Col. Stone 's presence ? There is not a particle of evidence offered to show that any one saw her do it . The true test was an easy one , but it was not applied . Thei'e is such a thing as skill in opening seals and replacing them , so that it is not easy to detect it ; and until we have proof that this was not done , we are not called upon to believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the sentence was undoubtedly a mere feint to make a show of honesty . It was successful , for even so shrewd a man as Col. Stone was most effectually cheated . We might go on to show how in like manner the defects in all the evidence in favor of animal magnetism , and other kindred delusions , have failed to be appreciated even by intelligent men . But it would occupy too much time and space . We would simply remark in passing , that no one of these wonders seems to occupy the public attention for any great length of time . Animal magnetism , although it made a great stir , and although prominent men in the community , even lawyers and clergymen and physicians , gave it their credence , and sometimes even with the formality of acting as a committee , has passed away , and has given place to spiritual rappings and table movings . If it ever comes up again , it will probably be with a different name and in a different form . It has already assumed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit each name ; and so we have had successively Mesmerism , Pathetism , Electro-Biology , Hypnotism , and Psychology . In conclusion we remark , that it is of gre at importance to // the cause of truth in general , that the principles of evidence should be well understood in their practical application to the various subjects that interest the community . A loose application of them on one subject leads to a similar application of them on other subjects . All varieties of truth theretbre have a common bond of interest . Religious truth is thus linked to all other truth . And we accordingly find that the loose habits , which have been allowed in the investigation of certain exciting subjects of late years , has undermined the foundations of religious truth to a great extent in the community . A belief in specious falsehood always tends to weaken belief in solid truth . Credulity is very apt to engender scepticism . And we therefore see that those who have run the most readily after the pseudo-scientific novelties , that have appeared so abundantly in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree all steady and rational beliefs , and some have made shipwreck of all religious faith of a scriptural character . A certain mental condition , making the mind incapable of appreciating the strict rules of evidence , and disposing it to seek for the fanciful and the wonderful , seems to be induced . We accordingly find that persons thus affected are not the subjects of one delusion alone , but are commonly ready to welcome the various novelties that may be presented , whether they belong to medicine , or theology , or mental science . The evil of which we have just spoken is a great one , and it behooves the good men who have unwittingly contributed to this state of things , by the easy credence which they have given to fanciful novelties , to consider well the bearings of this subject . If they will do so , they will find that the remedy for the evil is in an appeal to the strict rules of evidence . The community are largely at fault just at this point in relation to all subjects in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not carefully distinguished . Absolute proof is not the thing sought after . Defective evidence glossed over by ingenious speculation is too often satisfactory . A reform is needed in this particular , and the intelligent lovers of truth must lead in this reform .
