The Works of Win . E. Channing , D.D . Eighth edition . 0 vols. , l2mo . Boston . 1845 . Tuss memoir has been highly praised in periodicals which ad. ' vocate or sympathize with Unitarianism . We can not , however1 speak of it in teram of unqualified commendation . That it ha* merits of a certain kind in a considerable degree , we freely admit . It is well adapted to please the admirers of Dr. Channing in his own denomination , especially the transcendental portion of them . Beyond that circle of his friends , we do not think it will be accepted as a work which meets the demand that has long existed for an extended biography of a man who has attracted so much attention at home and abroad . To satisfy this want , a narrative of a more sober , judicious and critical character was required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , we think everxr candid and unprejudiced reader will admit that this work is marked by several serious faults . In the first place , it is much too long . Three duodecimo volumes , of four or five hundred pages each , constitute a biography altogether too protracted of a man in whose life there Were so few striking incidents , and whose days were chiefly passed in his study , or in the discharge of the ordinary duties of a Christian minister . It is true that the work is , to a great extent , made up of extracts from Dr. Channing 's unpublished writings and letters , and is designed , in this way , to be a kind of autobiography . Yet these selections do not often contain any thing very new or interesting . They do not commonly throw much new light on either the interior life , or the external history of the man . // All the information they afford might have been much better given in a few condensed , well written pages by the biographer . The work , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to the end . We have no doubt that Dr. Chanuing was a man of great ability , of unusual purity of conduct , and of a remarkably benevolent disposition . But it would have been much better to have allowed the reader to infer this from the narrative of his life , than to have obtruded it upon his attention , on almost every page , in the form of profuse praise . As a biography it is deficient also , in a definite , distinct delineation of Dr. Chanfling as a preacher and a literary man . There is a vagueness of language and description , . runniug through the whole of it , which prevents us from obtaining any such clear and vivid idea of its subject , as we gather of Robert Hall from reading his life by Gregory , or of John Foster from the memoir which has been published of him since his death . We should like to know what books he was fond of reading , what departments of knowledge he cultivated , what were the general topics of his preaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other particulars of this nature . But the author affords us little satisfactory information on these points . It is true that he often makes the attempt . But instead of giving a plain , unvarnished statement , he uses such vague , general and indefinite language that we are unable to form any very clear idea from the description he has drawn . He frequently composes a picture of beautiful colors , but without any distinct , well-defined outlines . If our readers wish to test the truth of this opinion , let them read the delineation of Dr. Channing as a preacher , in the second volume , or a " Day in Newport , " in the third . The latter description is much better than the former . Yet it reads more like a descriptive poem in blank verse than a sober , unambitious narrative . We can not , in dismissing this work , characterize it better than by saying it is just such a book as might have been expected from a man whose mind , though of a greatly inferior calibre , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who has formed his style and habits 0g thinking from the writings of his relative whom he so enthusiastically admires . With these few remarks on the biography of Dr. Channing , we proceed to give a brief sketch of his life , gathering the materials chiefly from the volumes before us . WiLLIAM ELLERY CHANNING. was born at Newport , Rhode Island , April 7th. , 1780 . His father was a lawyer in that place , of superior talents and extensive practice in his profession . His mother was a woman of excellent native powers and of remarkable energy and activity . Of his early childhood nothing particularly worthy of notice is recorded , except that he was regarded as a very interesting , and remarkably beautiful boy . At an early // age , the moral qualities for which he was so much noted in manhood , began to develop their existence , a kind , amiable disposition , a deep sense of moral obligation , an instinctive abhorrence of whatever is mean and little , and a warm admiration of every thing that is noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of his moral character in the later periods of his life , and they strongly marked his opening youth . In this respect , with him , as with most other men , " the child was father of the man . " His youth , like that of others in the same condition of life , was passed ii* acqidring the rudiments of knowledge , and in preparing for a collegiate education . Besides the appliance of books and teachers , the powers of his mind were greatly strengthened and developed by inercourse with intellige nt persons , who vesorted to Newport as a watering place , and spent much of their time at his father 's house . From the conversation of these visitors , among whom were eminent statesmen , distinguished professional men , and leaders of the revolution , Channing derived many opinions on liberty and politics , which very materially colored his views of these subjects through the remainder of his life . His early education was also carried forward by frequent contemplation of the noble ocean scenery of his native place , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in forming his subsequent character , he eloquently describes in a discourse delivered at the dedication of the Unitarian church in Newport , in 1836 . When he had reached the age of thirteen his father died . Mr. Channing 's death left his family in narrow pecuniary circumstances . For though he was a man of extensive practice in his profession , he had accumulated but little property . His widow , however , found means to carry on the education of her children . In 1794 , William , then in his fifteenth year , was sent to Harvard College . His academical career was a brilliant one . The stimulating influences to mental cultivation , which are always found in a college , and which were then in unusual activity , rapidly developed and matured his superior abilities . Before he graduated he was universally allowed to be the best writer , debater and scholar in his class . High expectations were already entertained of his future eminence . The studies to which he devoted most attention seem to have been general literature and moral philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hume , Priestley , Hutcheson , Ferguson , Butler and Price . The last four writers were especial favorites with him . They exercised a powerful influence in forming his opinions on morals , literature and religion during the rest of his life . From Price he derived that peculiarity , which pervades all his works , of writing such words as love , duty , right , &amp;c. , with a capital letter . // During most of his college course it had been his expectation to study law or medicine . But before he graduated he concluded to enter the ministry . As he was now dependent on his own exertions for a livelihood , and was still very young , he determined before he commenced his theological studies , to spend two years in teaching . For this purpose he went to Virginia asaprivate tutor on the estate of Mr. Randolph , near Richmond . In this situation there were many things fitted to render school teachlug pleasant . But the time spent in this employment seems to have been the most unhappy period of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was ever afterwards an invalid . He was dejected and melancholy , and his body was well nigh worn to a skelton . The causes which reduced him to this unhappy condition , and threw so dark a cloud over his residence in Virginia , were excessive study , in which he spent the greatest part of the night after the severe toils of the day ; and " ascetic desires of curbing the animal nature and of hardening himself for difficult duties , " which led him to practice the most rigid austerities . There was another cause , however , more influential than either of these , and that was a religious conflict in his soul . The account which he gave of himself as he then was , in a letter written many years afterwards , vividly describes his intense mental sufferings . After months of agonizing excitement , he obtained a settled peace of mind . His views of spiritual religion , and the change through which he passed in his feelings respecting this subject , are clearly and fully detailed in a communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such a definite and satisfactory statement of his religious experience , that we would present it to our readers did our limits permit . We recognize in it the elements of a genuine conversion . It is true that there is but a slight reference to the great fundamental principle of evangelical piety , entire dependence on the intervention of Christ as the only ground of justification in the sight of God . Yet when we consider his subsequent life , the purity and moral beauty which adorned his general conduct , the ardor of his zeal in the cause of hniinanity , the deep sense of duty under which he always acted , and the warmth of pious feeling which pervades his writings , we can not but think that he was the subject of that spiritual renovation whereby old things pass away and all things become new . " By their fruits ye shall know them . " Judging by this test , we must conclude that the man who takes the Bible for his rule of action , who follows the idea of duty wherever it leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker and the good of his species , and who leaves behind him an example radiant with the beauty of goodness , is a Christian , however faint may be his recognition of some of the leading doctrines of Christianity . All // this and much more was true of Dr. Channing during the remainder of his life . After he had completed his engagement in Virginia , he returned to Newport . Here he commenced his theological studies , pursuing them by himself unaided by the instructions of any living teacher . When he had spent some months in this manner he was appointed to an office in Harvard College , with the title of regent of the university , an office which was little else than a sinecure created on purpose to assist worthy but indigent theological students in studying their professions . After having spent about two years at Harvard in preparing for the ministry , in the same manner as iii his native place , he was licensed to preach . Of his theological opinions at this time , there is no very clear or certain account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preaching of Dr. Hopkins , and as all his family connections were strong Hopkinsians , it was expected that he would embrace the same system of theological tenets . He did , indeed , adopt some of the doctrines of this distinguished divine . But his system as a whole he rejected with abhorrence . He was , probably , at this time , and during the remainder of his life , an Arian . He affirmed some years afterwards respecting himself that he never had been either a Trinitarian or a Calvinist . How he could have obtained license to preach when holding such latitudinarian views in theology , it is not difficult to explain if we consider the state of religion at that period in New Ji*ngland . The union of church and state , the half-way covenant , the long dearth of revivals , the troubles and disorders growing out of the revolution , had for a long while reduced evangelical piety to a very low ebb . Spiritual religion had nearly died out of the churches in many parts of the land . No inconsiderable portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ignorant of the gospel as an inward and spiritual l ) oxver . In this state of things it was very natural that both ministers and people should gradually slide into the belief and practice of a mode of Christianity more in accordance with their spiritual condition , than the stern , severe , uncompromising creed of their Puritan forefathers . In swinging loose from the orthodox system , they first embraced low Arminianism , next Arianism , and some of them did not halt till they reached the verge of infidelity . Hence at the time when Dr. Channing was licensed , the leaven of Unitarianism was already working in the churches of Massachusetts . A large portion of the ministers in the eastern part of that State , were deeply infected with it . Such being the state of things in religion , Dr. Channing , though an Arian , found no difficulty in entering the ministry . Nor indeed would he , whatever might have been his religious opinions , if we may judge from his examination . For , after he had read a *ermon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , we believe , related to one of the dogmas of Hopkinsianism . Of the reasons which induced him to reject Calvinism for the new theological opinions then beginning to be prevalent in New England we are not informed . Many we presume , will attribute his preference of the one system to the other to the books he read , and the religious society in which he mingled , while engaged in studying for the ministry . We have no doubt that these had much influence in determining his choice . Yet if he had been placed in entirely different circumstances we do not believe that he would have been a Calvinist , or if he had become one , that he would have long adhered to the Calvinistic interpretation of Christianity . The whole structure of his mind unfitted him to sym pathize with the religious system which passes under the name of Calvinism . The predominant quality of his mental constitution was exquisite sensibility to beauty in all the varied aspects of its universal presence . Anything that would have pleased him , whether in religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have presented itself clothed in the radiant colors of beauty . To a mind of such a cast , Calvinism has few attractions . It is a system , sharp , angular , and perhaps , homely . Every thing in it is more for use than ornament . rUhe truths which it embraces are clearly stated , well defined , well proportioned , and stand out in severe , bold outlines . Strong , robust , logical minds are pleased with its solid foundation , its finn massive structure , and the harmony and proportion of all its parts . But to the sentimentalist , the poet , the man who is governed by the esthetic quality of his nature , it has no form nor comeliness . Men of this class commonly turn away from it with indifference or disgust , and cast about for some system of Christianity more congenial with their taste and sensibility . Hence we think that if Dr. Channing had embraced the Calvinistic creed he would not have retained it long . The same cause which carried Isaac Taylor in England from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have induced him to swing loose from Calvinism , harsh and rough as it then appeared in the various theological writers who had undertaken its illustration and defense . We can not easily conceive how a mati of so peculiar a turn of mind , could have sympathized with Calvin , Edwards , Bellamy , and Hopkins , highly acceptable as their writings are for the most part , to the philosopher , the true theologian , the thoroughly evangelical Christian , and to every one who prefers truth in its naked simplicity above all the showy ornaments in which it can be dressed . After Dr. Channing was licensed , he made the first trial of his powers as a preacher in Boston . He at once attracted warm admiration . The " fervor , solemnity , and beauty " of his discourses drew forth high applause from all who heard him . He soon meceived // calls to the pastoral office from two churches in Boston . He accepted the invitation of the Brattle street church , and was installed over it in 1803 . This church was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new pastor commenced his labors is prospects began to brighten . The congregation rapidly increased . The eloquence of the young picacher drew crowds to hear him . The characteristics of his preaching at this time were much the same as those which marked his pulpit ministrations during the subsequent periods of his life . As a preacher , he bore but a slight resemblance to the mass of celebrated pulpit orators . He had , in fact , but few of the striking , showy qualities of manner which captivate the majority of hearers . But he was well fitted to please highly the intelligent portion of the community . His person was slender and diminutive , yet well proportioned , and his countenance decidedly handsome , and intellectual in its expression . His voice was small in its compass , but clear and beautiful in its tone . He used very little gesticulation to enforce his sentiments . The peculiar *nd distinguishing characteristic of his delivery was calm , subdued earnestness . He left on his audience the impression of a man having solemn , weighty thoughts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im-. pressive manner , keeping himself in the background , and directing the attention of his hearers as much as possible to his sentiments . The matter of his sermons , we presume , was like that of those printed discourses of his which may be taken as specimens of his ordinary preaching , ..  --  the common duties of life enforced with much beauty of thought and elegance of style , exhortations to the practice of a sublime , stoical virtue , and declamation on those somewhat mystical subjects which were always favorite topics with him , such as likeness to God , the essential dignity of human nature , and the indefinite perfectibility of man . Entering on his professional life in such favorable circumstances , he made rapid advances in public estimation . The reputation which he gained by his first efforts in the pulpit constantly increased . He was soon regarded as the first preacher in Boston and continued to hold that high rank during the rest of his life unless we except Mr. Buckminster , Dr. Griffin , and Dr. Beecher , each of whom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Channing . Soon after his settlement he removed his mother 's family from Newport to Boston , and gave them a residence in the parsonage of his society . To place them in a comfortable position , and to give his brothers and sisters good advantages of preparation for life , he remained unmarried ten years , devoting nearly all his salary to their support , and occupying one of the poorest rooms in the house . At the end of that time he married his cousin , a lady of wealth , whose mother owned the fine estate near Newport // to which he was so fond of retiring during the heats of summer to recruit his wasted strength . After he was well established in Boston and had entered on his work in the ministry , no incident of importance occurred for many years to disturb the even tenor of his life . The reputation which he acquired when he began to preach was well sustained , and was increasing , lie was laborions in the discharge of his duties as a Christian minister . His devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the poor , the pnrity and general excel* lence of his conduct , won him universal love and admiration . His studies were various and extensive . He took a deep interest in the revolutions of Europe and the political affairs of his own country . On such occasions as fast , election , and thanksgiving days , he preached sermons on these secular subjects , which attracted great attention , and , when published , were widely circulated . In this manner twelve years of his life as a clergyman rolled quietly away . rpheI* came an event which gave a new com* plexion to his history ,  --  the separation of the Unitarians , who called themselves " liberal Christians , " from those who adhered to the old orthodox faith of New England . The immediate oc ' casion of this separation is well known . There was published in England , in 1812 , by Rev. Thomas Beisham , in his Memoirs of Lindsey , an account of " the progress and present state of the Unitarian churches in * This account was compiled from documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and William Wells , Jr. , Esq. , of Boston , and other Unitarian gentlemen in this country . This book , either from care on the part of the Unitarians , or for some other reason , did not come to the knowledge of any among the orthodox till about two years after it reached Boston . In 1815 however , an orthodox minister obtained a copy of it , and extracted from it , and published in a pamphlet , with an effective preface , the account of American Unitarianism . The disclosures made by this pamphlet produced among the orthodox an outbreak of feeling which had long been gathering and was ready to burst forth . They felt that they could no longer hold communion with those who so manifestly denied ihe cardinal doctrines of Christianity . A formal separation was immediately effected ; and a controversy between the two parties was at once begun , which was carried on for many years . In this theological warfare , Dr. Channing , from his high reputation and the peculiar circumstances in which he was then placed , naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manfully did he battle with his opponents during a large part of the remainder of his life , in the pulpit and through the press , on every occasion when the opportunity was fairly preserited . Of the ability with which he acquitted himself in this theological controversy , widely different opin ions are entertained . // Among the Unitarians he acquired from this source no inconsiderable share of the great estimation in which he is held by them . They regard him as having gained a complete triumph over his opponents , and given a blow to Calvinism beneath which it still staggers . From this opinion we , of course , entirely dissent . We think there never was a man more completely vanqnished on the field of argument , than was Dr. Channing by Professors Stuart and Woods , and some others against whom he contended in this theological conflict . In 1822 , Dr. Channing visited Europe . Of his travels in the Old World and the impressions made on his mind , no record is given in his biography . We learn , however , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm commendation in England . Coleridge in particular spoke highly of him . One object which Dr. Channing had in visiting Europe was the improvement of his health . For many years he had been an invalid struggling against bodily infirmities . His travels for a while partially invigorated his exhausted constitution . But at length he gradually relapsed into his former feeble state . Incapable of discharging the duties of his office , he partly relinquished his connection with the church to which he had ministered , and preached at first but half a day on the Sabbath , and afterwards as his strength diminished appeared in the pulpit only at distant intervals . Yet , although withdrawn to a great extent from the active duties of the ministry , he was busily occupied as far*as his health permitted . He published several reviews in the Christian Examiner which awakened much interest both in this country and England . He wrote also most of the occasional discourses which are printed in his works . In 1835 he was brought prominently before the public by the interest which his treatise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some years , agitated the land , from its commencement strongly arrested his attention . Ever since his residence in Virginia he had cherished a deep abhorrence of slavery . He published nothing on that subject however , till 1835 . Then the solicitations of friends , and the intense excitement on the subject prevalent through the whole country , induced him to appear before the public in a treatise . After this period till the close of his life he continued , at intervals of two or three years , to publish his views on this and kindred topics , such as the annexation of Texas and emancipation in the West Indies . This portion of Dr. Channing 's life has greatly endeared his name far beyond the circle of his literary and Unitarian admirers . It is generally acknowledged by the friends of philanthropy and freedom , that he rendered by his efforts a very important service to their cause . His anti-slavery publications , glowing with the // most intense hatred of wrong , injustice and oppression , inculcating the loftiest views of right and duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , helped materially to swell the tide of feeling against slavery which had already begun to rise in the northern and western portions of the country . The influence of his great name was thrown on the side of the abolitionists , and it served to dispel much of the prejudice and contempt which had been infused into the public mind against them and the object which they aimed to accomplish . We have already mentioned that Dr. Channing was an invalid during most of his ministry . After his health , partially recovered by his journey to Europe began again to decline , he grew feebler every year , till in the latter part of his life he was seldom capable of any protracted effort either in speaking or in writing . In 1842 he rallied his strength and made one of his best addresses at the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the West Indies , held August 1st , in Lenox , Mass . A few weeks afterwards he attempted to return home by the way of the Green Mountains in Vermont , hoping that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded as far as Bennington when he was attacked by a typhus fever . In three or four weeks his exhausted constitution sunk under it . He died , October 2nd , 1842 . His end was calm and peaceful . Sustained by the consolations of religion , he met his summons into the future world , assured of a happy immortality . It has ofte*i been said that in the latter part of his life his religious opinions underwent a material change , and approximated much nearer to the orthodox system than they had ever been before . This is a mistake . It is true , indeed , that he declared at this period , " I am little of a Unitarian , I have little or no interest in the Unitarians as a sect . I have hardly any thing to do with them . With Dr. Priestly , a good and great man , who had most to do in producing the Unitarian movement , I have less sympathy than with many of the orthodox . " Yet there is no reason to believe that his creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the middle of his ministry . As the evening of life began to close around him , the asperity of his feelings against the orthodox , engendered in the heat of theological warfare , was greatly softened . The mists of prejudice which had obstructed his vision , were partly scattered by the clarifying power of Christian charity , and he saw more in their whole system to love and admire than he had seen before . For the same reason the strength of his sectarian attachment was much abated , and he could not confine himself in the narrow circle of Unitarianism , but " stood aloof from all except those who strive and pray for clearer light , who look for a purer and more effective manifestation of Christian truth . " Still he was no more of a Trin // itarian or a Calvinist than he was at the outset of his Christian life . He was still what he always had been , a moderate Arian . Dr. Charming 's personal appearance and pulpit ministrations we have already described . In his habits , manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he . was very reserved in his social intercourse , and it was not easy to become acquainted with him . We are told that " intimacy with him was a rare thing ; and even where it existed it was attended with restraints not usual in the closest friendship . Where there was perfect freedom of mind in intercourse with him , there was not the perfect freedom of manner that ordinarily follows it . " Yet notwithstanding his reserved manner , his conversation is said to have been remarkably interesting . It was fully equal to his preaching and writings , and was marked by the same beauty , calm , subdued earnestness , and fervid thought , by which they were characterized . On the moral character of Dr. Channing we need not dwell . It is universally allowed by all who were personally acquainted with him , or who have read his biography , that in all the relations of life he deserved unqualified praise . His conduct was a daily exhibition of the characteristic evangelical virtues , purity of heart , ardent love to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those amiable qualities which shed a constant sunshine through the breast of their possessor , and strongly endear him to all within the circle of his friendship and acquaintance . We willingly concede him a place among the men who by the union of great talents with great virtues have forcibly illustrated the power of Christianity to produce the highest style of both intellectual and moral character . From the life of Dr. Channing we pass to the consideration of his character as a literary man and a writer . To estimate him duly in these respects must be accounted no easy matter , if we are to judge from the widely different opinions that have been expressed of the qualities and order of his mind , and of the merit of his productions . We know of no writer who has had more various and contradictory verdicts passed upon him at the tribunal of literary criticism . It would be easy to collect all sorts of opinions respecting him , from all sorts of persons . Some have affirmed that he was only a poet , giving utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a philosopher , divesting things of the drapery thrown around them by the imagination , and contemplating the many colored scenes of life in their naked reality . His warm admirers have placed him in the highest rank of intellectual greatness . His opponents on the other hand , regard him as the idol of a day , enjoying a transient homage , but destined speedily to pass away and be forgotten . // To pass a judgment upon a writer who is the subject of so many contradictory opinions , may seem hazardous . We think , however , that we have succeeded after much reflection , in forming a correct estimate of both his mind and writings , and we give the following summary of the conclusions to which we have arrived . In estimating Dr. Channing , as in estimating every other superior man , two questions are to be answered ; first , what was the governing , predominant quality of his mind ; and next , what place does he hold in the class of intellectual men to which he must be assigned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not belong to the ordinary class of superior minds in England and America . The elements of their intellectual character we take to be an understanding logical rather than intuitive , sound common sense that is not easily led astray by what is specious and showy only , a preference for what is practical and useful and even homely over what is ideal and addresses itself to the esthetic part of our nature , and an aversion to whatever can not be expressed in clear and definite propositions . Dr. Channing in the structure of his mind was directly the reverse of this class of men . In reasoning , his mind was intuitive rather than logical . He described what he felt , rather than gave the conclusions to which he had arrived by a process of logic . Hence we so often witness but a slight connection between his sentences . They frequently appear more like independent , isolated thoughts than successive links in a chain of reasoning . Although he was on the whole a man of sound judgment , yet a strict , impartial examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social reform , will lead to the conclusion that this quality of the English mind was not a predominant element in his mental constitution . In almost every view he took of life and nature he was a poet , a sentimentalist and an idealist . He contemplated the world more through the medium of taste and imagination than in the homely aspect in which it presents itself to the philosopher , and what is commonly called the practical man . Or if he was a philosopher , he belonged , as has been said , to the " poetic order of philosophic minds . " Hence , while his delineations of human nature , of man , individually , or in his colk*ctive capacity , are replete with truth and beauty , they are frequently , and perhaps generally , only onesided pictures . The fair , the beautiful , and the good , which the poetic eye sees stamped brightly on all the varied aspects of human life , stand out on his canvass with marked prominence ; while the disorders and repulsive deformities produced by moral evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background . For this reason many of his opinions seem vague , mystical , and destitute of any real foundation , to those who have no sympathy with his peculiar turn of mind . They find no echo in // the experience of the great mass of even the highly intelligent and reflecting part of his readers . We have often thought that in these respects Dr. Channing bore no slight resemblance to Milton , as he appears in his prose writings . Both of them were fond of ascending in to a region of thought where it is sometimes difficult to follow them on the ladder of logic , and where everything presented to the view of ordinary observers appears in a dim , hazy light , or else clothed in too dazzling colors to be distinctly perceived . Both were eloquent declaimers , and were prone to indulge in lofty , high-sounding , but vague discourse upon whatever subject they wrote . Both of them expressed views of the practical affairs of life which , though to some extent founded on truth , were yet so ideal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of men , that they seem fitted for a different world from ours . When we indicate this resemblance , bet*veeri Dr. Channing and Milton , we have no reference to the latter in his poetical character . Milton in his poetry , and Milton in his prose writings , are two different persons ; and between the author of Paradise Lost and the author of the Miscellanies referred to at the head of this article , of course no comparison can be instituted . Having considered the predominant features of Dr. Channing s mind , we next proceed to show his rank among the class of intellectual men to which he must be assigned . In classifying great minds , it is customary to arrange them in three divisions-those who originate new truths-those who originate new arguments for the defense of truths  --  and those who by their clear expositions render truths popular with the multitude . Dr. Channing , unquestionably , belongs to the third and last mentioned class . He did not originate anything . He possessed nothing like genius or inventive powers . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light by the arguments with which he illustrated and defended them . His Unitarian admirers , it is true , claim that many of the ideas which he has advanced on religion , morals , and the social reforms of the age , are new and original , or if not original , owe their prominence and popularity to the new light which he has shed on them . But whatever he has written on these subjects that is worth anything , is as old as the Bible , and has been uttered by almost every great religions writer with equal if not superior power . Yet if he is not an original writer , or a great logician , he is undoubtedly an doquent expositor . He possesses in a considerable degree the same kind of talent by which Dugald Stuart , Paley , Hazlitt and Macaulay , and many other similar men , have won a wide spread and durable reputation . We called him , in comparing him with Milton as a prose writer , an eloquent declaimer . In that one term we are not sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // miiid as far as the practical exhibition of it is concerned . By calling him a declaimer , we mean to use the term in its best sense . We are not sure of being in the right , but we believe that the word is sometimes employed in the sense in which we design to use it . We mean to denote by it one who makes a favorable exposition of thoughts and sentiments , which , in order to be rightly felt and duly estimated , do not so much require to pass through a formal process of logic , as to come forth from the furnace of a glowing intellect . Using the term declaimer in this sense , we think that Dr. Channing was certainly one of the most eloquent writers of this description in the nineteenth century . Give him a topic suited to this peculiarity of his mind , and where shall we find his superior ? On the character of Bonaparte , and on the evils of war and slavery , there are passages of his which in point of earnest , effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom equaled . But while we allow that he was an eloquent expositor , we can not place him in the highest rank among writers of this description . We can not place him quite on a level with the most distinguished of his contemporaries whose minds were of a similar order with his , and who were engaged in pursuits like those which he himself followed . He is not equal to Robert Hall , either in style or in matter . It is generally allowed that the English language has never been set forth in a more perfect form than the style of Robert Hall ; while in justness of thought , clearness and force of reasoning and beauty of illustration , he is rarely equaled . In both of these respects , Dr. Channing is much inferior to his English contemporary . His style , whatever may be its excellencies , has never received unqualified praise at the highest tribunals of literary criticism . And a large portion of his admired sentiments are little else than ordinary common-place thoughts dressed up in an ambitious manner . Compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the mind of the latter was of a more robust and masculine cast . Indeed between the intellects of the two men there was as great a difference as between their bodies . Chalmers was large , powerful and healthy in his bodily frame . Channing was delicate and small in his stature , yet ethereal and strikingly handsome in his countenance . And the Scotchman takes the precedence in all that goes to constitute a great writer or thinker . With Foster , a man of an entirely different order of mind , and one of the most profound and original writers England has produced , Dr. Channing can not favorably compare . When the great Scotch preacher , to whom we have just alluded , was once asked by a distinguished foreigner what Foster was then doing , he replied , " writing at the rate of a sentence a week . " If one of those sentences contained one of Foster 's original and brilliant thoughts , // we would not give it for whole volumes by Dr. Channing . Isaac Taylor , between whom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown more constructive talent than he , and greater force of mind . Out of the materials furnished by other men he has reared fabrics which if they do not bear the marks of a creative , original genius , demonstrate the skill of a great architect . But if we can not put Dr. Channing on a level with those of his distinguished contemporaries with whom we have compared him , we certainly would not place him far behind them . He deserves , both from the qualities of his mind and the merit of his writings , to be classed among them , althongh sequitur non passibus a*quis . If he is not one of the greatest lights of the nineteenth century , he is undoubtedly a brilliant luminary . He has made a powerful impression on his age . He has received high praise from some of the first men in literature on both sides of the Atlantic . He has gained , we are inclined to think , more popularity at home and abroad than any other American writer . The man who has done all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his line of writing , must yet have been endowed with a forcible and brilliant intellect , lie can not be the mere idol of a day , owing his reputation to adventitious circumstances , and destined to be forgotten when the mists of prejudice are scattered , and the public mind soberly and impartially weighs his merits . From the intellectual character of Dr. Channing we pass , finally , to the consideration of his writings . His works contain no very extended treatise on any subject , bitt are a collection of miscellaneous pieces on a great variety of topics . They may , however , be easily classified . They may be divided into reviews , first published in the Christian Examiner ; sermons and tracts on Unitarianism , on war , slavery , and other kindred evils ; a series of sermons on the ordinary topics of the pulpit ; and lectures before lyceums , &amp;c . Of the reviews , the first which he published is the criticism on Milton . Respecting the merits of this performance , widely different opinions have been expressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essay of Macaulay on Milton ; while Hazlitt and Lord Brougham , in the Edinburgh Review , speak of it in very disparaging , if not contemptuous terms . To us both of these opinions seem to come far short of the truth . Macaulay 's critique on Milton is undoubtedly one of the finest pieces of composition in the English language . It is replete with almost every excellence , marvelous felicity of style , extensive learning , brilliant imagination , glowing eloquence , nice critical acumen , just discrimination that duly weighs Milton 's poetical merits , and genial sympathy with the great poet , and with his position in the evil times // on which his lot was cast . With this superb performance the criticism of Dr. Channing can not be brought into comparison . It is generally ambitious , and sometimes even turgid in its style . It is greatly deficient , as has frequently been said , in analysis , the first requisite of criticism . Its matter , though wearing an aspect of profundity , contains nothing very new , or very much above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Milton that often appear in the periodicals . It is indeed rather an eulogistic and rhetorical composition than a weighty , discriminating criticism . Yet we can not think so meanly of it as do Hazlitt and Lord Brougham . The former speaks of it as only a common place eulogy , and the latter attacks it with the same savage fury with which he often demolishes his opponents in parliament . It is certainly something more than a common place performance . If it is greatly inferior to Macaulay 's brilliant essay , yet it has considerable merit . It is a glowing , eloquent tribute to the memory of Milton ; and no impartial judge can read it without feeling that , faulty as it is , but few men could have written it . It attracted much attention at the time it was published , and has since received high praise from men whose judgment passes for something in the literary world . Lord Brougham has handled it with much greater severity than Hazlitt . He pours out his wrath in no measured terms . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in criticism , which he can not endure . But his opinions on most subjects are to be taken with much allowance . He is a great advocate in whatever sphere of action he appears , whether at the bar , in parliament , or in the walks of literature . But he is only a partial and one-sided judge . In the condemnatory verdict which he passed upon Dr. Channing , this mental obliquity , which unfits him to deliver a just decision at the tribunal of literary criticism , manifests itself in unusual virulence . It is a scorching , withering exhibition of the acknowledged defects of the work , without any admission at all of its merits . We admit that many of his objections to it are founded in truth , particularly his condemnation of its style . Still we are confident that if any one will candidly compare the two pieces , the review of Milton and the criticism upon it , he will feel that Lord Brougham has misrepresented and pushed far beyond their legitimate and intended application , the critical opinions of Dr. Channing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next publication of Dr. Channing 's which attracted much attention , was a review of Scott 's Life of Bonaparte . This , like the criticism on Milton , was attacked with much severity in England . The opposition , however , to the views advanced in it has now nearly died away , and it is very generally acknowledged to be a just estimate of the moral character of the greatest conqueror of modern times . In our own estimation , it is the best thing // Dr. Channing has ever written . The subject was admirably suited to the peculiar cast of his mind . To set forth Bonaparte 's moral character in its true light , did not require , as in the case of Cromwell and some others who have figured largely in history and have left an ambiguous reputation behind them , profound investigation , coolness of judgment , and intimate acquaintance with the rules of historical inquiry . It needed the combination of a heart glowing with love to the human race and hatred of every species of wrong and oppression , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning words . These qualities Dr. Channing possessed in a high degree . And he has used them very effectively in his portraiture of Bonaparte . He stripped from this idol of military ambition its halo of false glory and laid bare its hideous features , at a time when it was the object of almost universal homage . He drew a picture of Bonaparte 's desolating selfishness and oppressive tyranny in colors so true and glowing , that it contributed in no small degree to excite that deep abhorrence of his character and conduct which now so generally pervades the friends of humanity all over the world . Against the judgment pronounced by Dr. Channing on the great modern conqueror , the only defense of him now set up is that the reviewer s stand-point is not that of the historian ; that Bonaparte was only the exponent of the military ambition of France , and that his wars and unrelenting tyranny were the result of the circumstances in which he was placed . This apology for Bonaparte may satisfy his French historians and their admirers . But it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any one who loves the welfare of his race to read Bonaparte 's history from the period when he seized the reins of supreme power at the commencement of his consulship till they were wrested from his grasp by the combined armies of Europe , without coming to the conclusion that he was in the appropriate sense of the term a tyrant  --  a man who remorselessly trampled the rights of his fellow beings under foot , and in accomplishing his s cherries of selfaggrandizement made no more account of their lives than if they had been so many insects . The question will be inevitably forced upon his mind , if Bonaparte is absolved at the tribunal of history , what name in the annals of human guilt can be condemned ? Besides the reviews of Milton and of Scott 's Life of Bonaparte , Dr. Channing published one also of Fenelon 's writings . We pass over this last production without offering any remarks upon it , as it contains nothing very interesting , or which the author has not repeatedly expressed in various portions of his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of sermons and tracts on Unitarianism . With this class of his works we have no sympathy whatever . His delineations of Calvinism // are generally mere caricature and gross misrepresentation . We look in vain for a fair exhibition of the doctrines and arguments of his opponents . There is in all these polemical tracts a harsh , bitter spirit of invective , which seems utterly alien from the usually kind and benevolent disposition of the author . Moreover , Dr. Channing was only an indifferent reasoner , especially on subjects which in order to be successfully investigated demand nice discrimination and close , protracted , subtle argumentation . His mind , as we have already said , was intuitive rather than logical in its cast . He was an eloquent writer , a good declaimer , but not a great reasoner . Hence in his controversial works we have plenty of sentiment and declamation , but no great amount of forcible , consecutive reasoning . Yet this class of his writings is not without considerable merit . They are productions well adapted to make a popular impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unitarianism . These are written with all that earnestness of thought and vigor of style which have made their author such a favorite on both sides of the ocean . They are , therefore , well fitted to prejudice the mass of readers against orthodoxy . The Unitarians are busily engaged in circulating them through the land . In this they act wisely . For they have produced nothing else that can compare with them in fitness to accomplish the object they have in view . From the polemical writings of Dr. Channing we pass to another class of his works ,  --  his essays and sermons in behalf of those philanthropic enterprises of the age which aim at the extinction of war , slavery , and other kindred evils . These form decidedly the best part of his writings , with the exception of his article on Bonaparte . In these productions Dr. Chanuing appears altogether to the best advantage as a writer and a Christian . We know nothing of their kind in the English language superior to them . There is none of that mystic sentiment and vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of his other writings . His thoughts and language are those of a man bent on speaking in the most effective manner . Fine writing and ambitious flights of oratory are lost sight of , and the wrongs and sorrows which man inflicts on man occupy his whole attention and call forth his withering indignation . To the works of no author can the oft quoted lines of Grey , " thoughts that breathe and words that burn , " be applied with more propriety than to many passages in these productions of Dr. Channing . Nor is their ardent , effective eloquence their only merit . rphey are infused throughout with the spirit of a tender and Christian philanthropy . They seem to flow from a heart and mind filled with the benevolence of the New Testament . While they breathe the deepest abhorrence of the oppressor and the destroyer of his species , they manifest the warmest desire for his rescue from guilt arid his restoration // 1850 . William Ell*ry C/tanning. 363 to innocence and happiness . They are remarkably free from that harsh censure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of so many other works which of late years have been published on the same subjects . With one of these publications we are particularly pleased , his largest treatise on slavery , which was published in 1835 . There have been many books written on this subject , which , regarded as specimens of close logical reasoning , are greatly superior to this . But in point of adaptedness to secure the object at which it aims - to awaken the public mind to a clear perception of the injustice and misery of the evil on which it had so long looked with indifference or complacency , to overwhelm the slaveholder with a sense of his guilt , to show that the slave , degraded as he is , is yet a man and entitled to the rights of a human being ,  --  it stands at the head of antislavery publications . It is , indeed , one of the best books that have ever appeared in our country . It will hide a multitude of Dr. Channing 's theological and literary sins . Another portion of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary course of his ministry . With some of these we are much pleased . The sermons on the character of Christ , the evidences of Christianity , the evil of sin , self-denial , immortality and a future life , are beautiful compositions . Of course there are many sentiments in them that an orthodox man must condemn in unqualified terms . Yet considered in a literary point of view , they are productions of great merit . They possess in a high degree simplicity and elegance of style , beauty and correctness of thought , and are fine expositions of the subjects they are intended to illustrate and enforce . Still , it must be confessed , that like nearly all the sermons of Unitarian preachers , they are deficient in warmth of feeling , vigor of imagination and whole-souled earnestness , *efects which , in the case of the author , are undoubtedly to be attributed more to the frigid , negative system of Christianity he embraced than to a naturally cold temperament . There are also some occasional discourses among the works of Dr. Channing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry for the poor , and those on the deaths of Drs . Tuckerman , Follen and Worcester , are deserving of high praise . The three last are beautiful tributes to the memory of men whose names will be long cherished , not only by their immediate friends , but by multitudes in every part of our land . The remainder of Dr. Channing 's writings consists mostly of lectures which he delivered on various occasions before Lyceums and other similar literary associations . These discourses were received with high commendation when they were delivered , and since their publication they have deservedly increased the fame of their author . Some of them have been reprinted in England , // and have been received there with warm praise by that class of society for whose benefit they were designed . Many authors of celebrity owe their reputation almost exclusively to their style , and many great thinkers from their deficiencies in this respect are unknown out of the small circle of a few select admirers . Dr. Channing 's style is the cause of much of the praise he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been bestowed upon his writings . If candidly examined , it will be found to afford good reason for both . In many respects his style is a very commendable one . It is forcible , brilliant , and often eloquent . It is uniformly elegant and refined , and never runs into coarseness or vulgarity . Neither does it ever flag and become tame and common-place . Through the whole of his writings there is a sustained vigor and earnestness of language which few writers could maintain so long . As in the case of all authors of real merit , his style is the very image of his soul , and often seems well adapted for the subjects upon which he wrote . But while it possesses these commendable *jualities , it has equal deficiencies . It is too uniformly on an elevated key , and hence from its want of repose often wearies the reader ' * attention . Aiming too much at elegance and refinement , it sometimes runs into mysticism and obscurity . It is altogether too ambitious and rhetorical in its structure . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too artificial to please . Occasionally it becomes even stilted , reminding us of the remark which has been made respecting him , that he aims to speak on a high key , but does not strike it with much power . It is , moreover , greatly wanting in that naturalness and those picturesque , idiomatic expressions , which form the charm of the style of Burke and Macaulay , and in fact , of most of the great writers of England . Instead of making the common language of life , divested of its vulgarities , the groundxvork of his diction , the author employs those smooth beautiful words , both of foreign and native origin , which sound harmoniously to the ear , and which for a while may please , but , finally , pall upon the taste , and become as tiresome as a banquet of honey . hi reading for any great length of time Dr. Channing ' s productions , the remark is often called to mind which Sir James Stephens made respecting the style of Isaac Taylor , " the sense aches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking their proper places. **
