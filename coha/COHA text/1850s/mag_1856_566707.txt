" New York : IMI . W. Dodd . 1856 . Gun readers will excuse us for not copying the whole titlepage of these massive volumes , as we intend to give , in the course of our remarks , the most important part of the information with which that page is crowded . The work is designed to be a repository containing the best sermons of the best preachers of all ages . Its selection is confined to deceased divines . Eighty-two eminent preachers are introduced , from // 345 the various nations where the eloquence of the pulpit has flourished ; and one of the most celebrated discourses of each is given . These are so arranged that the preachers of any country are placed together in the order of their birth , and that country comes first in order which furnishes at the earliest date some prominent preacher whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have the Greek and Latin Pulpit represented by eight of the most distinguished of the Greek and Latin Fathers , beginning with Tertullian , and ending with Augustine-Tertullian 's treatise on Patience , Cyprian 's exposition of the Lord 's Prayer , one of the orations of Athanasins against the Arians , a beautiful sermon of Chrysostom on excessive grief at the loss of friends ; and a characteristic homily of Augustine-characteristic both of the times and of the man , with other interesting and valuable matter . The selection is judicious , and sufficiently ample and varied to give us a taste of the best things which the Fathers have left us , and a glimpse of their modes of thinking and of preaching . After Augustine , almost a thousand years passed away before another preacher arose who has left us a discourse , which the author has thought worthy of a place in his volumes . The fact is significant . During the whole interval between Augustine and Wickliffe , comprising more than half the time which has yet elapsed since Christ bade his disciples preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has come down to us deserving to be ranked among the master-pieces of pulpit eloquence . There was no pulpit of the middle ages . The pulpit had been crowded out by the altar . The sacrifice of the mass had taken the p lace of the sermon ; and a corrupt , worldly and ignorant priesthood had superseded that ministry , pure , disinterested , thoroughly instructed in the principles of the gospel , and deeply imbued with its spirit , which Christ established . Such a ministry would have dissipated the darkness of that long night . During this millennium of ignorance and superstition , there were indeed preachers , who , protesting against prevailing corruption and error , deeply stirred the hearts of the men of their generation ; but their influence was overborne , and their protest was silenced by the dominant power which had usurped the name of the Church . At length Wickliffe arose , " the morning star of the reformation . " He was himself a preacher of great influence and power , and in the latter part of his life he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itinerancy which moved the heart of England . Selecting from among his converts YOL. xiv . 23 // those who were best fitted for such a work , he sent them forth throughout the kingdom ; and in churches , in cemeteries , in the market-places , at fairs , wherever multitudes were congregated , these poor priests , braving , like Christ 's first disciples , threats and persecutions , preached the truths of the Bible . With Wickliffe begins the history of the English Pulpit . It is true that , for almost a century and a half after his death , the voice of the gospel was stifled by persecution ; but the truths which he and his followers had spoken were swelling in the English mind , like seed during the frosts of winter , ready at the warm breath of spring to start up and produce an abundant harvest . Then came the reformation ; and with it , preachers whose names will be held in everlasting remembrance started into life . It is curious and instructive to notice in the score and more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the changes which have taken place in the forms of English preaching since the days of Latimer . First , we have the strong , manly good sense of the reformers thoroughly penetrated with the evangelical spirit , and dealing like men in earnest , in plain language , with the errors of their day . Then we have the massive strength , the majestic movements of thought , the quaintness of expression , the tedious divisions and subdivisions , and the intense fervor of the age of the Puritans - then the copious ethical discussions , and the frigid correctness of the preachers that followed the Puritans ; then the glowing evangelical earnestness , the plain , simple , scriptural appeals of Wesley , Whitefield , and their coadjutors ; and , finally , a class of preachers , who combine in some , but not in the highest degree , the best features in the preaching of all the preceding eras . Their chief defects are of the freedom of the reformers , and the majestic strength of the Puritans . The *erman pulpit is represented in these volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ending with Theremin . Here , too , a remarkable change has taken place in the style of preaching . The sermons of the German reformers were not very unlike those of the English reformers . We find , indeed , in each class , the characteristics of the national mind ; while in both we discern the same sturdy sense , the same earnest boldness , the same vigorous reasoning , the same rough eloquence ,  --  but after the lapse of three centuries , the German sermon has become what it is , a blossom , and a most beautiful and fragrant blossom , of the affections . Of the French pulpit , we have eleven specimens , and among these are some of the finest illustrations of the art of preaching . If we regard the sermon merely as a literary production , it // reached its perfection in France , during the age of Louis the Fourteenth , when such preachers as Bossuet , I3ourdaloue , and Massillon among the Roman Catholics , and Claude , Abbaddie , Superville and Saurin among the Protestants , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eloquence . But that age passed away , and with it , until very recent times , the glory of the French pulpit . Those famous Catholic preachers , who had felt the quickening influences of the Protestant movement , which had shed its light upon France , were in their graves . The edict of Nantes had been revoked , and the Iluguenots , who might have saved France from the horrors of its many revolutions , and carried it forward in a steady career of improvement in everything great and good , were driven out to enrich and to embellish other lands with their industry and their genius . It was not in France , but as ministering to congregations of refugees in Holland and England , and other countries who welcomed these exiles , that the French Protestant preachers of that illustrious age won their greatest triumphs . The Huguenots had no longer a home in France ; their descendants became citizens of the countries where they dwelt ; and the Catholic Church , unsound at heart , and wanting the stimulus to learning and to exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised up no successors to the brilliant preachers of the age of Loui* the Fourteenth . " She felt herself ; " says Robert Hall , " at liberty to become as ignorant , as secular , and as irreligious as she pleased ; and , amid the silence and the darkness she had created around her , she drew the curtains , and retired to rest . The accession of members she gained by suppressing her opponents , was like the small accession of length a body acquires by death ; the feeble remains of life were extinguished , and she lay a putrid corpse , a public nuisance , filling the air with pestilential exhalations . " So it came to pass that for a century , no preacher , Protestant or iRomanist , arose in France , whose voic&amp; will be heard sounding along the course of ages . But though at the present time a large proportion of the pulpit influence of France is on the side of error , yet among the evangelical Protestants there are some brilliant exceptions , which remind us of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagery-what elegance of diction-what depth and subtilty of thought-what philosophic breadth-what warmth of feeling-w a insight into the human heart , and into the doctrines of the gospel , are seen in the discourses of Yinet ! Yet they . lack that adaptation to the common mind , which always belongs to the best pulpit eloquence . They are // too far removed from ordinary modes of thinking ; and it is only a select class of minds that they can deeply move . IMI . Adolphe Monod-now , alas I to be classed among deceased divines-has left discourses , which , in all the elements which can give a sermon power and render it useful , deserve as high a rank as any of iMlassillon s . Next in order comes the Scotch Pulpit . Nine preachers are selected , beginning with John Knox . His sermon on the Sources and the Bounds of Kingly Power , is here given , and may give us some idea of the manner and the spirit of that preaching , which had so irresistible an influence on the fierce , rough men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the character of the Scottish people , and on the character of its preaching . We find until the reign of " Moderatism " in the last century , the strength , the power , the fervor , which characterized that wonderful man , in the sermons which were preached throughout Scotland . The preachers took their position at the heart of Christian doctrine-at that point when one sees at once the sin of man and the grace of God-man 's fall and ruin , and man 's recovery . They spake most weighty doctrine ; they must sometimes have wearied even Scottish patience , and perplexed the long heads of their Scotch hearers by their numerous doctrines , heads , divisions , subdivisions , uses , applications , and exhortations ; they reveled in vivid and sometimes grotesque imagery ; their hearts were often fired with their theme . Then came the times of Moderatism . Preaching became correct , tasteful , and cold , and void of that vivifying power which is found in the rougher and weightier , and warmer discourses of those earlier preachers . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickened so many churches , wherever the English language was spoken , about the middle of the last century reached to Scotland ; but for about one hundred years , such was the general character of Scotch preaching-correct , tasteful , and cold . Its best representative is Blair . Since that period , there has arisen in Scotland a new school of pulpit eloquenee . Chalmers seems to have left his impress as deeply on the Free Church as John Knox had left his , almost three centuries before , on the Kirk which he founded . Some of the Scotch preachers of the present time are distinguished for an oratorical and impassioned style of pulpit effort . Logic , perhaps , underlies and pervades their discourses ; but it is brilliancy of illustration and earnestness of feeling , which gives them their peculiarity . Of American preachers , sixteen sermons are given . Thomas Hooker , first pastor of the First Church in Hartford , is selected // as the representative of the first age of American history ; and Cotton a her of the second , and Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later days , we have to represent the Dutch Reformed Chnrch , Dr. John II . Livingston ; the Associate Reformed Church , Dr. John M. Mason ; the Episcopal Church , Bishop White and Dr. Gregory T. Bedell ; the Baptists , John Leland , Dr. Jonathan Marcy , and Dr. William Staughton ; the Methodist Church , Dr. Stephen Olin , and John Summerfield ; the Congregationalists , Dr. Edward D. Griffin , and Dr. B. B. Edwards ; and the Presbyterian Church , Dr. Albert B. Dodd . It is not onr purpose now to dwell upon any of the characteristics of the American Pnlpit . We may take some future opportunity to consider its condition , its influence , and its responsibilities . We only say here that some of these sermons by American divines , are surpassed by no others in these volumes , in that blending of strength , of logic , of energy , of warmth , and of pathos , which gives power to the eloquence of the pulpit . There are also four discourses by Irish preachers , and three by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar characteristics-their vivacity , their passion , their imagination , their graphic powers of description . In selecting these discourses , the author has displayed fine taste and judgment . We have here the master-pieces of pnlpit eloquence . These are among the best sermons that have ever been published . We are g a , however , that Mr. Fish proposes to select another volume ; and doubt not , that among the sermons of deceased divines , he can find enough of a very high order , to fill a volume equal in size and to either of these . , not inferior in value , The chief value of this work lies of course in the discourses which it contains . If it contained nothing else* its worth , especially to the young preacher , would be inestimable .. ilere he has the best models of sermonizing , and these models are so various , as to prevent him from becoming a servile imitator of any one . Let him blend , as far as he can , the excellences of all . By the great differences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of merit , he learns that no one style is best for every preacher , but that is best for each which grows most naturally from his intellect , his heart , and his history-that he preaches best who best improves the talents , the affections , and the opportunities God has given him , and then uses his powers most freely in the great work of promoting holiness among men . We have , too , in these discourses , an illustration of the changes which have taken place // in the art of sermonizing-how the character and history of a people , as well as of an individual , modify the form of the sermon-how the present forms of pulpit eloquence have grown up , and what are their excellences , and what their defects , compared with those of other times , and how they may be improved , so as better to suit the exigencies of the passing age . These discourses are also hill of quickening thought and emotion . No preacher can study them without deriving much from them , which will fit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him than scores of volumes of ordinary sermons . But the author has done more than give us this excellent selection of discourses . He has also furnished for us a history of pulpit eloquence in each of the countries in which this eloquence has flourished , and a brief sketch of each of the preachers , whose sermons lie has selected . We wish his limits had allowed him to make this part of the work more full . We feel that we would like to know more of the personal history and character of these distinguished preachers than these very brief sketches furnish . The similarity of plan and of subject between this work and that of Professor Goodrich on British eloquence , suggests a comparison between them . The sketches of the lives of the orators and the criticism of their oratory , constitute a very interesting and instructive part of the Professor 's very interesting and instructive volume . But , in the work before us , the sketches are so slight as to be of comparatively little interest and value . They are , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely be given ; for the biographies of more than eighty preachers would , if much more extended , have unreasonably swelled the work . We notice , too , some marks of haste and carelessness . The date of Wickliffe 's death is said to be 1382 ; it occurred at the close of 1384 ; he is said to have finished his translation of the Bible in 1388 ; he published it in 1380 . The complete separation of the Church from the State in Connecticut is said to have taken place in 1816 ; the Constitution of that State , by the adoption of which the separation was made , was adopted in 1818 . Such errors as these may he errors of the press , and are of small importance . The following are due to the author . In the history of the English Pulpit , a passage is quoted from Robert Ilall , in which that distinguished writer , after characterizing the morals of England subsequent to the Restoration , and speaking of its effects on the preaching of the times says , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . introd uced a new sort of preaching , in which the doctrines of the Reformation were supplanted by copious and elaborate disquisi // tions on points of morality . " Mr. Hall evidently refers here to that class of preachers of which Archbishop Tillotson was the most distinguished representative , and who flourished during the latter half of the seventeenth century . He proceeds to say , " Their fame and ability emboldened THEIR SUCCESSORS to improve upon their pattern , by consigning the articles of the Church to a still more perfect oblivion , by losing sight still , more el ) tirely of the peculiarities of the gospel , guarding more anxiously against every sentiment or expression which could agitate or alarm , and by shortening the length and adding as much as possible to the dryness of their moral lucubrations . From that time , the idea commonly entertained in England of a perfect sermon was that of a discourse upon some moral topic , clear , correct , and augmentative , in the delivery of which the preacher must be free from all suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion in his hearers . This idea was successfully realized ; this singular model of pub pit eloquence was carried to its utmost perfection , so that while the bar , the parliament and the theatre frequently agitated and inflamed their respective auditories , the Church was the only place where the most feverish sensibility was sure of being laid to rest . . . . The consequence was that the creed established by law had no sort of influence in forming the sentiments of the people ; the pulpit completely vanquished the desk , piety and Puritanism were confounded in one common reproach ; an almost Pagan darkness in the concerns of salvation prevailed , and the English became the most irreligious people on earth . " This is a graphic description of the condition of the IL*nglish pulpit and people in that period which intervened between the death of the Puritans and the rise of Wesley and Whitefleld-that dreary half century when the spiritual life of the nation was almost extinct , and when the few men , who pursned their devout and sequestered walk with God , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age , from which all soul , all faith , and all earnestness seemed to have departed . This was the age of which Hall was writing , in the closing sentences of the paragraph just quoted . Yet our author , after quoting those sentences , goes on to say , " It is plain that honorable exceptions to this humiliating record must be made in favor of some preachers . . . For to these times belong Leighton and Baxter , and Bates , and Bunyan , and Owen , and Flavel , and Beveridge , and Howe , and Charnock , and others deserving of honorable memition . " But it was not of the times in which these preachers flourished that Hall was *riting . All of them but Beveridge belonged as well to the times that preceded as // to the times that followed the Restoration . At the date of that event Leighton was forty-seven , Baxter was forty-five , and Owen was forty-four years of age ; and Howe , who , with the exception of Beveridge , was the youngest , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them can be classed with the preachers that " arose " after the Restoration , much less with their successors . They belonged rather to that class of preachers who were trained up under Puritan influences , two thousand of whom left their livings and their preferments for conscience ' sake , when the act of uniformity went into operation . A nobler race of Christian ministers has never existed . England never has had greater or better preachers than those of that earnest period which witnessed the lovely example , and heard the beautiful sayings of Leighton , so like the example and the sayings of the disciple that Jesus loved ; and was moved by the holy earnestness of Baxter , as he passed on without resting by the way , towards the everlasting rest of the saints ; and was charmed by the silvery sweetness of Bates ; and impressed by the calm majesty of Howe , and instructed by the profound wisdom of Owen . These preachers lived to witness the boisterous irreligion and unblushing licentiousness of the triumphant royalists under the last Stuarts ; but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at work among the people ,  --  did the whole nation lose so utterly the life and the p ower of godliness as in the times that immediately precede d the great Methodist revival . In his history of the Scottish pulpit , the author informs us that " about the opening of the nineteenth century there was a decided decline of Moderatism , ' which with the great religious awakenings under Whitefleld and others that then occurred , contributed much to the elevation and strength of the pulpit . " The plain meaning of this is that the " religious awakenings " in Scotland under Whitefleld occurred about the beginning of the current century . But they began in 1741 and were most powerful in that and the succeeding year . Whitefield himself seems to have visited Scotland for the last time in 1763 . He died in 1770 . In the history of the American pulpit , there is an attempt " to reproduce the scene of that lovely Spring day Sabbath-the first spent by the newly arrived settlers upon the banks of the Connecticut-in April , 1638 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given , appended to which is a note which informs us that " this description of the first Sabbath on the Connecticut river is drawn from Bacon 's Historical Discourses . The sermon preached by Davenport on the occasion was from // Matt. iv , 1 , on " The temptation in the wilderness . " Now , Dr. Bacon describes the first Sabbath of the settlers at New Haven , on the harbor at the mouth of the Quinnipiack . It was there that in April , 1638 , John Davenport preached his sermon on the temptation in the wilderness . It is news to our New Haven friends that their beautiful city is on the banks of the Connecticut . Besides , in April , 1638 , Thomas Hooker had been preaching for nearly two years to settlers on the banks of the Connecticut , to say nothing of the points on the river , where congregations of devout men met weekly to worship God . Mistakes like these may be regarded as of little importance , but they evince carelessness and haste . This part of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so well that we could not but expect something better than we have in the biographical , historical and critical portions of the work . We now offer to our readers some thoughts suggested by reading these volumes . The first respects the power which the pulpit has excited . It would of course be impossible , even with much more ample materials than we have , to estimate the comparative influence of this among the forces , which have been acting upon every interest of humanity during the last eighteen centuries . What would have been the condition of what is now Christendom , if this force had been wanting , we can not tell . Perhaps it would have resembled the present condition of India , or China , or Japan . Perhaps the admixture of the northern tribes with the decayed racee of the South would have evolved from the ruins of the ancient civilization , new forms of society such as the world has never seen . Conjectures are vain . But this we know-that this would have been a very different world from what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its prospects . Preaching has been fitly styled " the central instrumentality in human history . " It is so , for it is ordained of God to be so . It is so , for it has in the truths which it deals , in its aims , in the human sympathies which aid it , and in its alliances with God 's spiritual energies , a fitness to move individual souls and to shape the character and destiny of the race . The very discourses in these volumes over whose glowing paragraphs our eyes have just been passing , thrilled , in their delivery , the hearts of thousands . Here is one of the homilies of Chrysostom , which fourteen centuries and a half ago so deeply impressed the citizens of Constantinople , perhaps were the means of fitting some of them for Heaven , but which could not arrest the progress of the worldliness , the effeminacy and the superstition with which the Christianity of earlier days had already begun to be corrupted. // Here are sermons of Luther , of Calvin , of Knox and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in France , in Scotland and in England , the pulpit was regaining its legitimate power . Here are sermons of Wesley and of Whitefleld , which a century ago were to great numbers , the power of God unto salvation . Here is that sermon of Massillon on " the small number of the elect , " of which it is recorded , that at the delivery of one passage the whole congregation started to their feet and interrupted the preacher with their exclamations of despair and of terror . Here is that sermon of Edwards , entitled " sinners in the hands of an angry God , " which when preached at Enfield , caused , as Dr. Trumbull says , " such a breathing of distress and weeping , that the preacher was obliged to speak to the people and desire silence , that he might be heard . " ITere is the great discourse on " Modern Infidelity , " by Robert Hall , under which , when preached , it was not uncommon for the whole congregation to rise from their seats and gaze upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sermon on " the expulsive power of a new affection , " which , in the rapid and fiery energy of its delivery , bore along as by a resistless flood , the thoughts and the emotions of his hearers . Here is Mason 's sermon , " the Gospel preached to the poor , ** often delivered to crowded audiences who " first listened with interest , then gazed with admiration , and then covered their faces and wept . " Other discourses are here of scarcely less power ; and these are only specimens of what their authors have done ; and their influence was but a fraction of the influence which these great preachers exerted , as from week to week , and often from day to day , they spoke like thrilling words . The power which such men as Luther , and Whitefleld , and Edwards wielded by preaching , is not to be estimated by reading a single sermon and its history . That sermon was one of hundreds . Nor were these men alone in their generation ; each of them was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar in spirit and but little inferior in power to themselves . The reformers who gathered round Luther and Knox ; the preachers who co*5perated with Wesley and Whitefleld , and those who were fellow-laborers with our own Edwards , were some of them but little behind those great leaders . And beyond these there was a still more numeirous class , whose names and whose deeds are only recorded in the book of life , but who in the narrow spheres for which God made them , spake and acted bravely and efficiently for the Gospel . It is safe to say that though the pulpit has never done all it should have done , though but few preachers have ever made full proof of their // ministry-pntting to the test its utmost capacities for doing good-yet it has done and is doing more than any other instrumentality-the press not excepted-for the welfare of man . Another thought suggested by perusing these volumes has respect to the variety of powers needThl for the production of a sermon of the first order . There are no productions of the human mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these discourses . Here are logical acumen , intuitive insight , compass of intellect , imagination , illuminating and adorning the path of argument and passion , penetrating the whole and giving it animation and fire . The man who could compose some of these sermons could do in any department of science or of literature , whatever man can do . Take , for instance-in these volumes  --  the sermon of Bossuet , of Sanrin , of MeLaurin , of Edwards , of Hall , of Mason , or of Olin , and see what a combination of faculties , and all of high order , are employed in the production of such a discourse . This harmony of the mental powers is essential to the highest order of excellence . There may be power  --  but never the highest powerwhere but one class of faculties is brought into action . The basis of all true eloquence , whether in the pulpit or elsewhere , is in the logical faculty-reasoning on great themes , conforming to the principles while dispensing with the forms of logic . Even in calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sermons of Emmons with untiring interest . IRejecting some points of his theology , we admire the ingenuity , the clearness , the logical acuteness of his sermons . They flow right on toward his object-right on like a crystal river , deep , yet revealing every pebble in its course But we should like them better if there were more of the light of an illustrative imagination and of the heat of kindling emotions ; and this would be perfectly compatible with their clearness and their logic . It might add to both . An illustration , a parable , a comparison is often the best of arguments , revealing , like a lightning 's flash , the path of reasoning . The imagination often sheds a flood of light upon a truth ; and when it skirts the line of argument with beauties , without leading one aside to admire its creations , it makes the hearer content , yea , delighted to accompany the preacher through a long course of reasoning which would else be tedious . But passion is of more value to the preacher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion . There is an earnestness about them which is always contagious , and sometimes almost fearful . We must " ignite our logic ' * to make eloquence of it . A good sermon is not a J*brication , it // is a growth . It grows , not simply , as Tholuck says from the feelings of the heart , but from the quickened intellect , the kindling imagination and the glowing affections of the preacher , He must be interested in his theme and intent upon effecting that for which alone sermons ought to be preached . It is not enough for him to take an intellectual interest in his subject , though his sermon should be alive throughout with the animation of excited intellect . This will give him a sort of power , but not the greatest and the-best power of the preacher . If he has the natural talents of the orator , improved by cultivation , he may make under this excitement what shall move his audience when he delivers it and pass perhaps for many a generation for a great sermon ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true end of preaching , viz : to reconcile men to God and guide and stimulate them to Christian duty , is a great impertinence . And that a sermon may be adapted to that end , it must glow not only with the fervor of excited intellect and of natural emotion , but also with the deeper and more penetrating fervor of holy love . It must grow from a heart in which Christian affections are in lively activity , in which the Holy Spirit dwells , and from a personal history the most important incidents of which are the deep experiences of the soul in its conflicts with sin and its cordial reception of the grace of God , and in its " spiritual discernment " of the great doctrines of sin and redemption . It requires both these sorts of fervor  --  the intellectual and the spiritual  --  to give to a sermon its highest power ; but spiritual fervor awakens intellectual fervor when the capacity for the latter exists in the natural structure of the mind , so that the best aid in producing or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every faculty and kindles every sympathy and every emotion of the soul . It is this which gives the awful earnestness of style and of manner that characterizes some preachers and makes them effective in spite of what many would call defects or blemishes . President Edwards ' style is rough and unpolished-almost destitute of gracefulness and of beauty . His range of language is limited ; is repetitions are sometimes wearisome ; his phraseology is often barbarous and uncouth . Yet , the style of some of his sermons is better fitted for the pulpit than that of many a man who is master of the most varied and elegant diction , and can construct the most flowing and musical sentences ; for there is an earnestness  --  a living force-as well as clearness about it , which must have impressed every hearer , and does impress every reader , with the thought that this man is intent only on this one thing , to impress the great truth which he has // in hand upon the hearts and consciences of his hearers . To this , every argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid illustration , every power of a mind in which imagination vied in strength with his imperial reason , was made subservient . A few years since a British writer expressed his surprise that the number of sermons destined to live is comparatively so inconsiderable , that of the millions and upwards preached annually throughout the British.empire , there are so very few that are remembered three whole days after they are deliveredfewer still that are committed to the press , scarcely one that is not in a few years absolutely forgotten . This does at first sight seem surprising , but a little reflection will show reasons for it . There are , and from the nature of the case there can be , but few preachers who are endowed with that combination of faculties-all of a high order-which is necessary for the production of a sermon that will live from age to age . God has not made men enough of this stamp to meet the demands of his Church . He has made men enough , who have talents that fit them for usefulness , and whose labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of their hearers , are yet greatly useful . Their sermons lost from memory , live and will live for ever in their effects . There are thousands of such men laboring to-day , and it is owing in a great degree to their efforts that there is so much of piety , and so much of intellectual elevation , and so much of moral and social virtue in the world . But it requires talents of a far higher order than theirs to produce sermons having vitality enough to live after their authors have gone to their reward . The very reason why a sermon becomes celebrated , is that it surpasses inexcellence the millions that are ordinarily preached . If ordinary sermons were equal to Saurin 's , those that survived more than a few years would have to be much better . If the general character of preaching should rise , the sermons singled out for preservation would be better than now , but not more in number . Besides , even those preachers who have superior talents , have not the time to elaborate many sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare every week , or even one besides the ordinary duties of a Christian pastor in a large parish , can not make all his discourses , or even a large portion of them , sermons of the first order . Let the experiment be tried by any other public speaker . Let him try to make from fifty to a hundred great speeches in a year on different but kindred themes , and let him continue these attempts from year to year-does any one need to be told how he would probably // succeed ? It requires time to elaborate a sermon so as to give it a permanent value . " The editor of Massillon 's Lent Sermons regards it as a prodigy that he finished a discourse in so short a time as ten or twelve days . This eminent preacher sometimes re-wrote a single sermon fifteen or even twenty times . " But a preacher , with the care of a parish , with all its multifarious duties to perform , can not do this . He must content himself with doing the best he can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . Chahners however had a plan which might be adopted by others for the purpose of giving a higher and more permanent value to some of their productions . " Besides that weekly amount of composition which was necessary to meet the demands of each succeeding Sabbath , he had always a discourse in preparation upon which the occasional efforts of a whole month were expended ; the two sets of sermons , from the different characters in which they were written , being described in his own vocabulary as his short handers and his long handers . " It was doubtless on his " long handers " that his fame as a preacher mainly rested . It is these that are yet full of vitality , and will continue so for ages to come . Let then the preacher elaborate with special care-with long and intense mental effort some of his sermons  --  and though the demands of the present crowd upon him , and he must meet them , for it is in the present that he is called to act his part , let him still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary gifts , prepare a few disconrses with such labor that they shall preach to distant congregations , and to coming ages . We are also impressed , in reading these volumes , with this feature of the discourses of all ages , viz : that , whatever their forms , the same great fundamental principles pervade the whole . These principles are applied to different states of society-they are modified in the manner of their presentation by the style of thought belonging to the age , and the country in which the different preachers flourished . A sermon of the fourth century differs in many respects from a sermon of the nineteenth century . A French sermon differs from a Scotch sermon , a German sermon from an English sermon , and an American sermon , in some respects , from all others . Each bears its mark so completely , that a skillful reader can detect the country and the century of its origin from internal marks alone ; from its allusions , from its style of thought and expression . And yet , pervading all of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their various forms , if there is life in them , are these same vivifying principles  --  the central doctrines of the // gospel of Christ . But how various are the application of these principles ? As they have come along down from age to age , they have shown , by all the experiments of the past , their adaptation to meet all the shifting forms of error , and of wickedness . They have been seen and felt by every truly great preacher , to be the weapons of his warfare with which he was to assail the strongholds , not which frowned over the Church in a former generation , but which in his days were most perilous to souls , and most hostile to the Church of Christ ; and every true preacher has expected to find these weapons divinely furnished for his use-weighty through God that furnished them , to the pulling down of those strongholds . Robert Hall began his sermon on modern infidelity , with this remark : " As the Christian ministry is established for the instruction of men , throughout every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to the ever-shifting scenes , of the moral world , and stand ready to repel the attacks of impiety and error , under whatever form it may appear . " And the preachers , whose efforts have most moved and shaped their own age , and whose sermons have passed on , diffusing light and heat through succeeding ages , have ever acted in the spirit of this maxim . They have prepared their sermons for their own time , but ' have so animated them with eternal principles , as to give them a life and a power for all time . They have recognized the militant character of their ministry-militant not against dead , but against living foes ; not against absent , but against present foes-foes that were then and there assailing the church and ruining souls . It requires no great boldness to assail forms of error which bygone generations have buried , or to assail sin in the abstract , while its concrete and living realities are left without rebuke . Something less keen than the weapons of our warfare would answer for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils , lest he should do some harm , has forgotten , or has never known , the true nature of his office . It will defeat all the ends of prudence and of wisdom , to abandon that aggressive position which Jesus has assigned to his ministers . They may be so afraid of doing harm as to fail to do good . They must try at times to make Felix tremble , even at the risk of enraging him . They must be less careful of their own safety and of their own reputation , than of the welfare of souls and the honor of Christ . They must stand up boldly for truth and for right , though they should stand alone , deprived of all that support which comes from human approbation and human sympathy , and though from every quarter they should hear the shout , " These men are // beside themselves , " - yet let them use in this holy warfare , those eternal principles of the gospel which are the same for every age , and the efficacy of which has been tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the best preachers ever spoken for Christ . Like Paul , they have determined to know nothing but Christ , and Him crucified  --  but like him they have applied the doctrines which have their center of attraction , of order , of light , and of warmth , at the cross , to the sins and the errors of their times . Paul stands before a sensual and unrighteous judge to speak of the faith of Christ ; and he reasons , and reasons on principles which that Christian faith furnishes , of righteousness and temperance and judgment to come . Chrysostom takes the same principles-less clearly seen , less firmly grasped by him , but still the same , and applies them to the vices that prevail in his days in the court and among the people of Constantinople . luther searches the Scriptures , and finds there the doctrine of justification by faith alone , lays hold upon it , as a weapon of heavenly keenness and temper , and aims it at the enormous evils with which the Church of Rome has cursed the nations-at indulgences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessional and the monastery ; and the weapon is found to be mighty through God , against all these evils . It was when Jonathan Ed wards exposed , in the light of the gospel , the follies and the licentiousness that prevailed among the young people of Northampton , that his people gazed at him in astonishment , and the tide of wickedness began to roll backward . It was when that same eminent preacher delivered his sermons on justification by faith alone , to meet the corruptions of doctrine that were then threatening the interests of piety , and the faith of the Puritans , that the great revival commenced , which has been regarded with wonder ever since . Nor have these discourses , though aimed at the errors of that day , lost any of their value . They have a permanent interest , and will be consulted by theological inquirers , while the world shall stand . And so the sermons which meet the exigencies of one age and of one people , are fitted , by their discussion of fundamental principles , to interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed away . Thus , forms of error and of wickedness which are local and temporary , become the occasions of advancing the interests of truth and of holiness everywhere , and through all time . The lights which were kindled to dissipate a momentary gloom , burn on as enduring lights of the Church . In order to meet the exigencies of his own times , it is often // necessary for the preacher to look far below the surface of things . Where the careless eye sees only bubbles on the deep swift currents of thought and feeling , he needs to know the course of those currents and whither they are tending . He must be familiar not only with the general questions which at all times naturally agitate the human mind , and which can never be put to rest , but will rise up before every generation and demand a solution ; but also with the great questions of his day , which are pondered and discussed by his hearers . ITe needs to be familiar with such questions in their underlying principles . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of his age . Error is to be met in its principles , or it is met to no good purpose . It is of little use to prick a bubble as it floats on the rushing stream of thoughtother bubbles will rise and the stream will still rush on to its destiny . Its course must be changed . It has often been said of late that the pulpit , as compared with other agencies , is losing much of its influence . We do not think this is so . We think , on the other hand , that preach . ing has been steadily advancing . The sermons of the nineteenth century are superior in almost everything which gives value to a sermon , to the sermons of the third and fourth centuries . The latest sermons in these volumes are , as a general fact , the best ; and if Mr. Fish shall fulfill , as we hope he will , his purpose to select another volume from the sermons of living divines , we do not doubt that that volume , though selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be equal in value to either of these . Not that the latest preachers have been greater and better men than their predecessors , but that they have learned from the past , have been borne along by the influences which have come on from the past , and have availed themselves of its garnered treasures . Still the pulpit ought to have more power than it has . If it has , as we believe it has , more efficiency to-day than ever before , it has not yet all it is destined to have . It ought even to be in advance of society , and to take the lead of all the influences that are borne to the hearts of men as God 's plans of mercy hasten to their fuhillmnent . Preaching will gain power , first through more of the accompanying energies of the Holy Spirit , and secondly by a constant improvement in the modes of presenting truth . The first the preacher is to pray for ; the second he must strive to attain by every means in his power ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can I best present the truth to the men of this nineteenth century  --  the men with whom I have to deal-so as to arrest their attention , to remove // their errors and lead them to renounce their sins and become the sons of God . " To effect his ob , ject , he has the same old truths of the gospel which have stood the test of centuries , apd which , though old , are ever new , as mighty now as when apostles and reformers spake them , and destined ere this dispensation of the Spirit shall close , to evolve a power which shall destroy all the forms of human error , superstition and sin . With these great principles he is to render himself perfectly familiar in all the varying forms in which they are manifested and illustrated in the word and providence of God . He can do nothing without them ; and the better he comprehends them , and the more he iinbibes their spirit and feels their power , the better fitted is he for his work . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to study also the age in which he lives-its tendencies , its modes of thought and feeling . It is not enough for him that he knows man , he must know men , the men of his generation  --  the men whom he seeks to influence , and among whom he holds his dread responsibilities . He must know how to apply the truth to them , and if he would give his preaching its full power , he must manfully and boldly apply it to all the shifting forms of impiety . He must show himself in sympathy with God , and fearful of no harm to himself while he speaks the truth of God . He must construct his sermons too , not on the model of any bygone generation-not in the traditionary forms which he has received from his ancestors , but learning what he can from the best models of all times and all countries , and * doptin g this as his controlling rule , that that is the best sermon which is best fitted to answer the true end of a sermon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in form , as shall be best adapted to save the souls for whi5ch he is to watch and to give account .
