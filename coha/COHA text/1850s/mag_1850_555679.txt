txt ART . VIII . - A History of Jesus . By XV . H. FuRNEss . Boston : Crosby &amp; Nichols . 1850. l2mo. pp. 291 . To most minds , historical personages and events appear under two widely different aspects , as viewed through the medium of the judgment and of the iniagination . The judgment contemplates them objectively , as through a colorless lens , and thus its conclusions must be virtually the same in the minds of all , who reason from the same data and have access to the same facts . But through the imagination , the objects of knowledge are conceived subjectively , as if seen through a many-colored lens , and are so variously modified by the idiosyncrasies of the individual , that similar pictures hang in no two " chambers of imagery . " It is these paintin gs that constitute fictitious literature , while the judgment and the cognitive faculties are chiefly concerned in writing history . But there are persons , who seem to possess but one of these media of intellectual vision , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some in whom the imagination has never come to life , - who see only outlines and diagrams , never pictures . There are others , in whom fancy usurps the office of reason and judgment , - who draw in colors and paint their diagrams- To this class belong those very ignorant persons , in whom the innate ideas which are the matrices of all accurate knowledge remain undeveloped , and whose imagination , in caricaturing persons and events , uses for its pigments the commonest earths and coars // est ochres . To this same class belong also some minds of the highest order as to capacity and culture , so exclusively introspective in their habits , that they can take no just cognizance of external facts , can not extend belief beyond the limits of experience , and are incapable of discriminating between what may have taken place in the outward world and the accidental modes or limitations of their own consciousness . In the hands of such persons , history is fiction , or rather autobiography . Carlyle 's French Revolution is a specimen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed an accurate chronicle of characters , motives , and events . It makes his readers well acquainted with the author ; but it does not begin to open to them the momentous chapter of European history , from which it derives its name . The book now under review is a work of this sort . The author is a man , whom to know is to love , who is deeply penetrated with the spirit of Christianity , and whose whole life and character have grown from intimate heart-communion with the objects of his religious faith . He is a man of a rich , active , and fruitful intellect , of the most liberal culture , of warm enthusiasm and glowing fancy . But he is neither a logician nor a critic . ? sthetic considerations weigh more with him than historical proofs , and vividness of conception than demonstration . So far is he from needing facts to verify his theories , that he is ready to reject the best authenticated facts , if they would not flow necessarily from his a priori reasonings . With no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of its own native resources ; on none should we less rely for the interpretation of the thoughts of others . In none should we expect to trace more manifest marks of the direct influence of the Supreme Being in the heart and character ; on none should we less depend for a fair understanding of the records of a past revelation . Though one of the most modest and unpretending men , he can not help covering all external themes of thought with the shadow of himself and then portraying that shadow under the name of whatever lies beneath it . " A History of Jesus " is a title worthy of the author 's honesty . The definite article would have been sadly out of place ; for the work is not an exposition of the Gospels as they are , but an original Gospel , embracing and endorsing // such portions of the record of the evangelists as accorded with his notions of what must and should have been , and telling the rest of the story as the evangelists would have told it had they belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , we believe , entirely original and peculiar . It is naturalism in a form so irrational and untenable , that we can hardly conceive of its ever finding a second advocate . The position of the naturalist , who entirely rejects the miracubus narratives of the New Testament , is easily maintained , and plausibly , though sophistically , defended . The enlightened and virtuous Deist can hardly fail to recognize sincerity , earnestness , and wisdom in the teachings , purity , sanctity , benevolence , and devotedness in the life of Jesus . Indisposed to admit the supernatural element , he may account for its intrusion into the evangelic narrative by the disposition of the early Christians to assimilate the author of their faith to the demi-gods and heroes of classic mythology , and to appeal to the prevalent love of the marvellous in their labors of proselytism . This theory , indeed , encounters a seemingly fatal objection in the indubitable fact that the first preachers of Christianity endured obloquy , persecution , and martyrdom in attestation of whatever story of the life of Jesus they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have thus suffered for what they knew to be in part a figment and an imposture . German ingenuity has obviated this objection by representing the Gospels as accretions rather than compositions , as the growth of the first three centuries , not as the original works of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John . Thus , the primitive confessors and martyrs may have reported only the acts of Jesus as a good man , and his sayings as a preacher of righteousness , while . the miraculous portions of the narrative owe their origin to an appetite for the marvellous in subsequent generations . It is a sufficient refutation of this view , that the universal reception of the Gospels as the works of the men whose names they bear , and their diffusion through the then known world as the only authentic narratives of the life of Jesus , are of too ancient date to leave time for this process of accretion . We have , in behalf of their genuineness , the explicit testimony of Papias , who flourished early in the second century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John in his old age ; and from his time // downward we have an unbroken chain of attestations to our Gospels in their present form , as the never-disputed productions of the apostolic age . But Dr. Furness 's naturalism is of a different stamp . He admits the genuineness and the essential authenticity of the Gospels ; hut maintains that the laws of nature , ( commonly so called , ) are supreme , irreversible , and essential ; that a miracle is an absurdity , and that no evidence whatever can substantiate a fact that can not be made to harmonize with the sequence of natural events and phenomena . What then is to be done with the marvellous narratives of the Gospels ? Such of them as can not be tortured into harmony with the order of nature are to be set aside . The miraculous birth of the Saviour is intrinsically incredible . The circumstances attending that event rested on the testimony of his mother . She , filled with the then universal hope of a great deliverer , and with the natural longing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so illustrious a personage , had several remarkable dreams , which she interpreted as the visitings of angels . The imagination of his earliest disciples supplied the links that were wanting in her narrative , and Matthew and Luke were not sufficiently practised historical critics to detect the inadequate grounds of the current persuasion that one so godlike had been in a peculiar sense Godborn . The appearances from the spiritual world , related in the Gospels , are disposed of in a similar manner . The voice from heaven at the baptism was an inward sense of the divine approval ; and a dove hovering near was hailed by the selfconsecrated , the Baptist , and favoring spectators , as a symbol of the spiritual influence that attended the outward rite . The angels that ministered to Jesus after the temptation were " his own thoughts , " the conscious strength of his spirit , " the deep joy which flowed into his heart as through the ministry of angels . " The sublime scene of the Transfiguration was a dream of Peter , broken at a critical moment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrection , the appearance of the " young man in a long white garment " was that of Jesus himself , still wrapped in his grave-clothes , and not yet wishing to be recognized ; while those sitting in the tomb , " the one at the head , the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain , " were the grave-clothes which he had // then laid aside , and which eyes , filled with tears , magnified into celestial forms . There remain , however , the marvellous works wrought by the Saviour in his own person , which Dr. Furness admits as facts , yet denies that they were miracles in the common sense of that term . There is among men an almost boundless diversity of natural endowments , both mental and moral . It could hardly be that , in the lapse of ages , there should not have been born a human being of peculiarly delicate spiritual organization and susceptibility , to whom the discernment of divine truth and prophetic insight into the hearts of men and the undeveloped future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and virtuous , whose tendencies should all be Godward and heavenward . A man thus organized would be endowed with an unprecedented command of the resources , and control over the agencies , of external nature , so that it should be as easy and natural for him to cure diseases with a word , or to awaken his fellow-mortals from the death.slumber , as for common men to perform the ordinary functions of daily life . Such a being was Jesus . His singular powers were not conferred , but innate , - exercised , not by divine commission , but by the necessity of his nature . Being what he was , he could not have done less or otherwise . He became conscious of his gifts only by having spontaneously exercised them . He made no account of them , laid no stress upon them , because they were the inevitable results of the inherent laws of his being . Yet there was another essential condition to their successful exertion . Even he could do nothing for the unbelieving . He could only place himself in a peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawn to him by sincere sympathy of spirit . Those whom he cured of blindness , palsy , and leprosy , were restored by the joint energy of their own longing faith and his intense love . Even the maniacs had enough of method in their madness to know from rumor , or to divine from his benignant countenance , that it was no ordinary man in whose presence they stood . The centurion 's son had caught his father 's faith ; " and we readily see how the expectation of seeing or hearing the wonder-worker must have acted on the susceptible mind of the youth . He must needs have got well . " We dare not abridge , we will not trust ourselves to give , // in our own words , our author 's exposition of the resurrection of Lazarus , of Jairus 's daughter , and of the widow 's son . It is an unique instance of the honest and sanguine extrava-. gance into which an otherwise sound mind may he hetrayed , when it will neither gainsay undoubted facts , nor relax its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lazarus had fallen asleep in Jesus , and with the image of his venerated friend cherished in the innermost shrine of his life . He had died with that living principle of faithful affection in his heart , which is out of the reach of all physical changes . He was in close and vital sympathy with Jesus . We know nothing of death , except in its effect on the body . We can mark the instant the physical functions cease . But we do not know at all bow death affects the intellectual being ; whether the connection of that with the body is severed irrevocably when the heart ceases to beat , or whether the interior life retires gradually from its fellowship with the physical frame . " Believing the resurrection of Lazarus to be a fact , I infer from it that the connection of the body and the mind is not so entirely and instantaneously destroyed by what we pronounce death , but that , under such conditions as were fulfilled in the case of Jesus and Lazarus , the mind may be remanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeless body . Lazarus had sunk into the last sleep , with that confidence in his revered friend , by which Jesus himself had just said that , though he were dead , he should yet live again ; and which caused the loud command of that beloved voice to reach Lazarus asleep in death , and be heard by him and obeyed . And it was on account of this faith in him , which Lazarus cherished , that Jesus thanked God that he had heard him . It certainly was not merely for the opportunity of raising a dead man that he gave thanks . If he had sought such an opportunity , he could have had it at any time . But , as I conceive , he rejoiced that , in God 's good provi. dence , the dead man was one who had died in faith , and whose faith rendered it possible for him to be heard and obeyed , even in the realms of death . Jesus was always praying for opportuni. ties to manifest and deepen the force of Truth ; and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated by the power of a faith which had Truth for its object and end ; and not mere power , but the power of faith , would be seen ; and for this he thanked Heaven . " It may be asked how this explanation meets the other cases of the raising of the dead . Jesus raised two others . There is no mention of any faith which they cherished in him . No , but 40* // they were both young persons ; one was a little girl of twelve years of age , and the other is represented as a young man . How young we do not know . But we know this , that Jesus spoke in a peculiar manner of the young ; describing little children as the representatives of the kingdom of God ; and his words were never without meaning . Between him and the young , then , there was a living sympathy . They were in the same sphere . They were related to one another by indestructible ties . And we may believe that the widow 's son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor yet , before he died , buried so deeply under the materializing influences of the world , nor , when Jesus met his bier , so long dead , but that the voice of Jesus , expressive of the mighty power of faith , could reach him and summon him back . " Our Saviour 's own resurrection is admitted , without an expression of doubt , and is referred to the native energy of his spirit , his unconquerable love for his disciples , and his consciousness , that , if he did not reappear upon the earth , the memory of his teachings must needs grow obsolete , and the benefits of his ministry be lost to the world . Of course , this theory , which makes the promulgation of Christianity not a specific plan or purpose of the Deity , but only an incident that happened to occur among the other possible happenings in the spiritual universe , excludes prophecy as a department of the Christian evidences , and sets aside not only the miraculous character , but even the authenticity , of all ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jesus ; for no similarly endowed mortal has ever appeared upon earth . The wonderful traditions with regard to the Exodus of the Israelites had for their basis the exalted energy , faith , and religious wisdom of Moses . The Hebrews , as a race , had a peculiar genius for religion , as the Athenians had for art , and the Spartans for arms . The predictions of the Messiah grew from a trust in the continued favor of the Almighty to the Jewish nation , founded on their rich and varied experience of providential guidance and deliverance in the earlier ages . These predictions , though they pointed to a temporal vindicator and conqueror , helped inflame the patriotic self-devotion manners and morals , their political restoration and aggrandizement were impossible . His own foresight was not the // result of divine communication , but of a keen religious instinct , - of intuitive reasoning , as to the results of the spiritual causes which he put in operation . He discerned too plainly the seeds of corruption in the heart of the Jewish state not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own views of truth and duty . But , with regard to the rapid diffusion of those views among the nations of the earth , he was too confident . It was the enthusiasm of a reformer , elated by unexpected success at the outset of his mission , that showed him " the fields already white for the harvest . " As to his repeated predictions of his own death , he early became too well aware that he must needs fall a prey to the bigotry of the sincere and the malevolence of the self-seeking , among the religious leaders of his people ; and the same love which could not rest in the grave while his disciples were scattered and his teachings disallowed , gave him the assurance that he could and would rise from the tomb , and reanimate his forsaken body . Singular as is the theory , the outlines of which we have now presented to our readers , we find full as much ground for surprise in the form in which it is offered for general acceptance . There is no attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The volume is aphoristic in its character , separating incidents that belonged together in the order of time and of causation , and grouping events and discourses , sometimes by a discernible order of suggestion , and sometimes by laws of association peculiar to the author 's own mind . The style is eloquent , but careless , - generally beautiful , often grand , but not infrequently lapsing into colloquialism , and presenting some undeniable specimens of bathos . The author betrays the most ingenuous confidence , not only in the truth , but in the easy credibility , of his views . It is evident that they are very dear to his own faith , and identified with his own religious experience ; and he writes as if he had only to cry Eureka , to command the unanimous assent of Christendom , - as if the simplest and most artless statement of his own convictions carried with it primd facie evidence complete and irresistible . The first thought that suggests itself , on the review of this volume , is , that its theory is untenable on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men should , for eighteen // centuries , have taken Jesus for the central object of their faith , reverence , and allegiance , and that none should have made an approximation to the true theory of his nature , character , and life , till now , is intrinsically incredible . But we are wrong . This objection rests on the inveterate idea , that Christ bore a special commission from God , was ordained by him to stand in an official relation to mankind , and himself understood the secret of his own being and the source of his own power . If his birth was fortuitous , and not " in the fulness of the times , " - if his development was spontaneous , and his influence the result of natural causes , - there was no reason why he should have been better understood than other great men have been , in their own and immediately subsequent times ; and it is no more unlikely that it should have been reserved for a divine of the nineteenth century to give expression to the true formula concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first have relieved from the obloquy of ages , or lightened of unmerited fame , the names of distinguished citizens of the Roman commonwealth . If there was nothing peculiar in kind in our Saviour 's position , with reference to the world and the ages , no law of the Divine consistency and veracity made it necessary that the common mind should have access to reliable records of his life and character . But it is a valid ground of objection to this theory , that , so far is it from resulting , by induction , from the facts in the case , that it is made to usurp the office of testimony , in determining what the facts are . But , as re* , ards external facts , testimony can not be set aside by any form of speculative belief , except atheism . The atheist may consistently reject such alleged facts , as can not be accounted for by human or material agency . But if there be a God and a spiritual universe , no man is competent to define what things God can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a priori grounds , what phenomena of the spiritual world may be placed within the cognizance of human beings . Experience is , of necessity , subordinate to testimony ; for the common experience of mankind rests solely upon testimony . Moreover , so far are supernatural facts from being opposed to experience , ( except to individual experience , on which , if taken as the test of fact , we must , most of us , disbelieve the reports of earthquakes , // volcanic irruptions , and water spouts , ) that the recorded experience of all nations bristles with miracles , portents , and signs from heaven . Our belief in the general uniformity of the processes of nature is founded on testimony ; - how , then , can similar testimony be inadequate to establish particular exceptions to that uniformity ? But Dr. Furness admits such departures from the common order of nature as he can bring within a larger cycle of natural phenomena , hypothetically constructed , to meet the demands of the Gospels upon his credence . The evangelists , he maintains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses , of the facts that they relate . On what tenable ground can he discriminate between some and others of these facts ? The story of the miraculous conception must have come from Mary ; that of the resuscitation of Jairus 's daughter from Pet*r , James , or John . Is the mother 's testimony less reliable than that of the apostles ? Or is there any reason to suppose that her testimony reached the evangelists by a more circuitous route than theirs ? Or was theirs any more likely than hers to be weighed and sifted by a careful and judicious biographer ? The appearance of the angels at the sepulchre was reported by the very same witnesses that saw the risen Saviour . Both were equally unexpected , unless the former led to the expectation of the latter . Both were beheld with equally tear-dimmed eyes , and with equal tumult of emotion . On what ground can it be asserted , that the one was an imagining , the other a fact ? It is evident , that the cycle of ordinary human experience was greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birth to his ascension . To what extent it was enlarged , they are the only valid witnesses ; and the credence which we give in part to their report of such facts as never occurred before or since , rightfully belongs to whatever they had equal means of observing or ascertaining . The theory under review rests on the supposed existence of genera*l laws . This is a wholly gratuitous assumption . Uniform modes of Divine operation in the outward universe undoubtedly prevail to a certain extent ; and , did they not , there could be , on the part of man , no foresight nor calculation , no hopeful industry , no responsible moral agency . But who can say that this uniformity extends beyond that order // of proximate causes , within which human calculation and accountability are confined ? The more remote orders of causes lie beyond human cognizance ; and how know we that they have any existence , apart from the ever renewed fiat of a discretionary Providence ? But if , behind the physical causes which man can calculate , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more probable than that it should , at intervals , have broken in upon the usual sequence of cause and effect , and wrought anomalies in the order of nature , that it might draw away the regards of men from that order , in itself so beautiful and beneficent , to the omnipotent love which ordains and guides it ? If there be a God , not one way , but all ways , of operation are open to him ; and dull , leaden uniformity , in the administration of the universe , is the least probable of all hypotheses . For ourselves , we find it much easier to believe in miracles than to doubt them , and feel much more inclined to regard such marvellous facts as have occurred at marked epochs of man 's spiritual history , as exceptions to the uniformity of nature , than to refer them to the mechanical laws of cause and effect . When we consider the infinity of resources that must reside in the Divine mind , we should expect the history of the universe to reveal events neither similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - events , which the finite mind can not classify in its philosophy of nature , but which proclaim , " All power belongeth unto God . " But the uniforrnitarian theory is not only a hypothesis incapable of proof . It is contradicted by admitted facts in the history of our own planet . Numerous successive creations have broken in upon the previously established order of nature . In recent ages , indeed , no violent catastrophes have taken place over any large portions of the globe , - no old species of plants or animals are certainly known to have disappeared , * - nor do new species now appear . But science need go back but a few thousand years to fix the time , when animals of the torrid zone were pastured in the now frozen wastes of Siberia , when the waters covered the mountains , when our present higher animals , and man him- // 475 self , had not sprung into existence ; but the world , still reeking with the residuum of an universal deluge , was trodden by marvellous and gigantic forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same science carries us back to a period , when the earth had no inhabitant and bore no form of organic life , and when darkness brooded over the face of chaos . With these undoubted facts in view , how can one regard the present order of nature as something sacred , essential , constraining , as an inviolable law to the Creator ? That order , the beginning of which we can trace , which has left records of its frequent change in the strata of every bluff and hill-side , - is it not in the highest degree probable , that the Almighty has at times suspended or reversed it , for the guidance and instruction of his intelligent children ? The probability of miracles is enhanced by our conscious need of a positive revelation from God . Without miracle there is no revelation . Jesus may have raised the dead , or have risen from the dead ; yet if he did so through the power of his goodness , through the warmth of his sympathy , through the might of his love , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond his own observation and experience . He may have been sinless , yet fallible . If he over-estimated the success of his ministry in the nearer future , the same sanguine temperament may have created or exaggerated the celestial future promised to his disciples . There are certain subjects , the original cognizance of which must reside in the Divine mind , and which can be known only as God makes them known . Foremost among these subjects is that of pardon for the guilty , involving the complex relations created between man and his Maker by the intrusion and prevalence of moral evil . Was Jesus the only sinless child of man ? Then least of all had he any thing in his own consciousness or experience , which could solye the problem of the sinner 's destiny . Human immortality , too , is not a necessary fact , and , though ren** dered probable by analogies in external nature , is incapable of demonstration . The longing for continued existence could hardly fail to spring up in the hearts of reflective , progressive , and virtuous men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisest and best of mortals than in any of his brethren . // But if Christ only embodied this longing in his words of eternal life , his testimony is no more valid than that of the dying Socrates . All questions of this class are questions of fact , and can be answered only by the testimony of one who does not merely speculate or desire , but who knows . Now , miracle , in its usual sense of a departure from the common order of nature , is the only conceivable mode in which the testimony of God can be conveyed to man . Let such an event , or series of events occur , in connection with some specific statement of truth , or some professed teacher of truth , man can not help regarding that statement or that teacher as divinely authenticated . To deny the possibility of miracle is to deny the possible attainment by man of certain knowledge on the very subjects , on which , beyond all others , he most needs to be enlightened . We pass to other considerations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we think , with less expense of argument , be refuted by common experience . The theory is , that the pre*iminent goodness of Jesus gave him extraordinary power over nature . Why , then , have there been in this regard no semi-Christs ? Why has not superior moral excellence been always attended by superior sagacity and skill in the control of physical agencies ? Why have not good men , as such , exerted peculiar power in assuaging pain and relieving sickness ? But , unless Jesus be an exception , physical science and moral goodness have always wrought their respective works , each in its own sphere . Virtue has refreshed men 's souls , reformed their vices , comforted their sorrows ; mechanical , nautical , medical skill has fed and clothed them , sailed their ships , healed their wounds , cured their diseases . When we are ill , we ask prayers , not prescriptions , of the saint ; while a bad man may administer the effectual remedy . If , in that one case , goodness assumed control over the forces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an exceptional , anomalous case , answering to our definition of miracle . Again , our Saviour ' s own professions are fatal to our author 's theory . Much of his language , with regard to his own wonderful works , is inconsistent with the idea of their spontaneousness , and shows that he regarded them as tokens of a special commission from God . We could not desire // declarations more explicit than these : " The works that I do bear witness of me , that the Father bath sent me . " " The works that I do in my Father 's name , they bear witness of me . " " If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not ; but if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works . " It is to us equally evident , that he did not consider himself as a man like other men . He employs , with regard to himself , terms which denote an official relation , not selfassumed , but divinely appointed , with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though another sinless being should tread the earth , no second could claim his place or share his functions . Could he , merely as conscious of a sinless heart and a blameless life , claim " power upon earth to forgive sins , " or say that " the Father had committed all judgment into his hands , " or term himself " the bread of life that cometh down from heaven , " or arrogate to himself a mysterious preeminence , as the " only-begotten Son of the Father " ? Unless he was conscious of something widely differing from , and immeasurably above , mere human excellence , such language is arrant blasphemy , and must entirely destroy our reverence for an outward virtue , which was more than oveAalancecl by the spirit of insane self-praise and self-exaltation . And what a heaven-wide contrast and incompatibility is there between these professions and his meek and lowly walk among men , unless we regard the former as the utterance of simple , literal facts , that defined his office , province , and mission ! We think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the production of this strange book . Jesus of Nazareth is presented to the faith of the world in a double aspect , as equally the Son of man and of God , equally the faultless model of human virtue and the perfect image of the Eternal Father ; in fine , ( to borrow a compound word , which expresses our own belieg though it is chiefly used by Christians with whom we might not sympathize , ) as the God-man . Gross errors of doctrine are chargeable , as we think , on those who ignore either of these aspects of his character . Yet there have been , at every epoch of religious inquiry , those who have overlooked his humanity , and those who have lost sight of his divinity . Dr. Furness has dwelt so intensely , and with such devout admiration , on the per VOL . Lxxi. - NO. 149. 41 // feetness , beauty , and loveliness of his human manifestations and relations , that he has no heart-room left for the sublimer view , in which he stands apart from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " - as God 's vicegerent in the spiritual kingdom , as Sovereign , Mediator , Redeemer , and Judge . We have spoken freely of the hook ; - the author himself loves truth and freedom too well to have wished us to do otherwise . We sympathize so deeply with the spirit of fervent piety and of conscious communion with the Saviour , which pervades equally his hook and his life , that we feel almost humbled hy the attempt at criticism . We close by quoting his closing paragraphs ; and , did we suppose that others could find what he has found hy the route on which he has sought it , our pen should have lain still , or been wielded in panegyric . " My chief aim , in the foregoing pages , has been to give expression to a simple sense of Truth .

Like Mary , I have thirsted to know whither he had been carried . At last , he has come forth from the dim , cold sepulchre , and I recognize him , glowing in all the fresh and breathing beauty of nature , in this YOUNG NAN , ' clad in the white robes of Innocence and Truth , whose wondrous story I have here endeavored to tell .
