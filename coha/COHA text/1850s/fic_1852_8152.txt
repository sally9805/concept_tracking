Boker , George H. ( George Henry ) , 1823-1890 : Love-lorn Lucy from The Podesta 's daughter ( 1852 ) Love-lorn Lucy On a bank sat sighing , Welladay ! ah ! welladay ! My fickle love has flown away , And left me here a-dying . False , false pledges  --  Why did I receive them ? Vows are but words , and words but air , And air can blow both foul and fair : Oh ! why did I believe them ? Ah ! light-hearted , Would thy fraud might slay me ! Would thy scorn might end my pain ! Or would that thou might'st come again , And again betray me ! Boker , George H. ( George Henry ) , 1823-1890 : TO ENGLAND . from The Podesta 's daughter ( 1852 ) Lear and Cordelia ! ' t was an ancient tale Before thy Shakspeare gave it deathless fame : The times have changed , the moral is the same . So like an outcast , dowerless and pale , Thy daughter went ; and in a foreign gale Spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nations . Days of shame Are close upon thee : prophets raise their wail . When the rude Cossack with an outstretched hand Points his long spear across the narrow sea  --  " Lo ! there is England ! " when thy destiny Storms on thy straw-crowned head , and thou dost stand Weak , helpless , mad , a by-word in the land ,  --  God grant thy daughter a Cordelia be !
