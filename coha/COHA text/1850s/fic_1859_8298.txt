Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : CRAWFORD 'S STATUE OF WASHINGTON . from Crawford 's statue of Washington ( 1859 ) Footnote : 1Kb They raised his statue to its throne , ' Neath fair Virginia 's sky , The noblest hero of the earth , Whose memory can not die , And there , upon his day of birth , In his loved native clime , He towered , as in his manhood 's morn , Majestic and sublime . But he , who with Promethean power Could mould the shapeless clay , And wake the chiseled bronze to life , Where was his life that day ? He stood not ' mid the gallant throng , To answer to his name , Nor on his temples bind the wreath That genius wins from fame . Yet one we saw with pallid cheek , And ever-dropping tear ,  --  Dwelt she not in his heart of hearts ? Why comes she mourning here ? She led her children by the hand , Their father 's work to see , And hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prayer arose , Which none but mothers know , That all his virtues in their souls Might root , and heavenward grow ; Though o'er her spirit darkly hung , Like curtaining pall of dread , The shadow of a foreign tomb , The image of the dead . True wife !  --  True mother !  --  Noblest hearts With tenderest pity stir , And soften even the exulting shout , In sympathy for her ,  --  While at the glorious Chieftain 's feet , Twined with the laurels , lay A leaflet of that holy love , Which can not fade away .
