ART . II . - Political Philosophy . By HENRY , LORD BROUGHAM , F. R. S. Published under the Superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge . London . 1846. 3 vols . Svo . THE Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge was intended to effect a revolution in the moral and social condition of Great Britain . It was composed of men of spirit and ability , and we believe they might claim the originality , or at least the original application , of the idea that knowledge , if rendered easy , attractive , and general , would prove a panacea for the evils of society . That they have not succeeded entirely according to their expectations , is owing to a difficulty which they did not take sufficiently into account , but which has troubled others in the execution of the same project , and was never more pithily stated than in a criticism of their proceedings . XThen , in the commencement of this enterprise , with all its glories thick upon it , Lord Brougham expressed a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day would come when every peasant in England would read and enjoy Bacon ,  - -  Cobbett replied , that the time must first come when every peasant could eat bacon , and that it would be well if his Lordship should set himself toward bringing it about . Though we admit the correctness of the criticism , there are few to whom the application of it would not be more pertinent than to Lord Brougham ; the good time would be far nearer , if each one of us were half as ardent and faithful a laborer in one sphere of action as he has been in many . As political science is not only one of the most important and serviceable branches of knowledge , but *ilso one whiclt those who get an opportunity have always shown the greatest alacrity in dispensing , it was clearly within the Society 's province to provide for its diffusion , and Lord Brougham was naturally selected to prepare the means . Of course , he was ready . The work before us is in three large volumes , and claims not only to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of government are systematically expounded , " but also " to comprehend a full account of all the // constitutions in ancient and modern times . " We are also told that " the discussion is kept quite free from all party and all national bias . " These are bold words to be spoken of a book which bears on its face the evidence that the only part of it which possesses any vitality , that which treats of the modern , mixed and democratic governments , was written by an Englishman and a Whig , and could have been written by nobody else , - not to say , only by Lord Brougham . The general correctness and faithfulness of the historical portion are beyond question ; and we vouId particulc rly commend the practical and business-like character of the account of the Roman constitution , which is made to appear like a system that might really go into operation at the present time , and is evidently the work of an experienced statesman . But to be truthful and correct in regard to the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no surprising merit , when the means of information exist , together with the ability to use them ; because , in this case , there is little temptation to be othe*wise . Exactness is purchased by indifference . On the other hand , for a partisan and an actor in questions yet undecided , instantly and at will to stop the current of fIfty years ' feeling , and out of an eager combatant to make himself at once an impartial observer , is an undertaking so difficult that it may as well be set down as impossible . In that part of the work which relates to English affairs there are , certainly , no remarkable signs of its accomplishment . A green arid vigorous old age has not yet so cooled the fire of Lord Brougham 's blood ; and we are not desirous that it should . We do not know that anybody would be the gainer by the change , and we are sure that something would be lost which is well worth the having . For the rest , as the work goes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest births of time , and from Eastern despotisms to Western republics , it certainly contains the result of a vast amount of reading and reflection , and many wholesome truths and materials valuable for reference . But they are , in general , too vague to satisfy a genuine spirit of inquiry , for which the minuti and practical vorkings of political systems are indispensable aids to their comprehension . // o An eager and patient seeker of knowledge rnigbt think that the matter is prepared too exclusively Vith an eye to its diffusion . For , after all the explanations that can be made , there are some things which refuse to be made plain , and others to which some difficulty of access gives a peculiar zest . Books written for one purpose are not likely to he very serviceable for another . Lawyers ' briefs are poor materials for Judges ' decisions ; and authors who are writing specially for the diffusion of knowledge are quite as much interested in making their productions attractive and pleasant , as serious and valuable . But the germ of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit , is the Preliminary Discourse , in which the object and design are set forth in the style of those essays for which Lord Brougham is so famous , and vhieh he has written so well , - elegant , copious , and plausible , even when not convincing , - distinguished for an easy handling of the subject , and for variety of remark and illustration . It is on the advantage of political science , and is devoted to the proof and illustration of the importance of knowledge as a political element in society , setting forth the benefit of some sort of provision for its extension among the great body of the people who are to profit by it , and exposing the evils which they are said to suffer on account of their ignorance of affairs of state . The pleasant picture which it presents of the future , when the miseries of war , the folly of bad measures , the violence of party , the injustice of prejudice , and even the narrowness of patriotism , are all to be cured by the prevalence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it vould he impossible to exhibit so effectively as it appears in this discourse . As we hardly feel called upon to reproduce the whole essay , we will only refer to it as containing the brightest and best stored magazine of implements for those who have occasion for that line of argument . One part , however , we can not bear to pass over , in which the common propensity to indulge in political speculation is considered , and a multitude of advantages deduced from the practice . In the first place , the science of politics is represented as capable of being one of the most certain of sciences , - which is contrary , we confess , // to the prevalent opinion , - and , as a natural consequence , the conclusions of the philosophers may be expected to be of the greatest use in the construction and working of governments . Various objections , such as that of the danger of weakening the attachment of the people for existing institutions , arising out of the contemplation of conflicting forms of polity , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut decidedly , put aside ; and knowledge , particularly political knowledge , is exalted as the palladium of the State . An extraordinary and particular enjoyment is attributed to the pursuit of political speculations , quite sufficient to satisfy any of those practical utilitarian American skeptics , who might be inclined to push their inquiries too far as to the value of such lncubrations , even including those with which we propose to edify our readers . We only hope that the pleasure extends to the reading , as well as to the making , of such reflections ; in that case , the advantage on which Lord 3rongham dwells Vill not fail to be recognized . In one respect , the importance of knowledge as a political element is not only not exaggerated , bat not even fully appreciated ; we mean that knowledge of the opinions of others , and that general and mutual action and reaction of one mind upon another , which results in and accompanies the formation of Public Opinion . The division of governments into aristocracies , monarchies , and republics was welt enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any consequence is that relating to the nature , the existence , or the possibility of a Public Opinion in communities , and its means of making itself known . Differences in this respect are those which appear to travellers and spectators as practically the most vital and important in the condition of different countries . They shape the policy of governments , and determine the means by which political action is carried on ; for these means , when Public Opinion exists and is free to manifest itselfl are substantially the same . Whatever the form of the government , this is its essence . Whether it is a government of the few or the many , depends upon the extent to which a Public Opinion is established in any community , and known to exist by those who entertain it . Ideas always become more intense // by being shared by many minds ; and especially in politics , it is all important that it be known that ideas are backed by numbers . Oppression is easily exercised over multitudes , so long as the resistance it excites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling of each one is known to all , it becomes impossible . That a Pnblic Opinion , worthy of the name , exists at all in a nation , that is , that the whole or a large portion are disciplined into harmony of feeling , is a sure sign of a high state of civilization ; and it proves the exist . ence of good government . Such a union , and the knowledge of it , are the most powerful of all political instruments in the bands of government or people . But the union which is predominant in politics is a union of interests , and of interests alone ; for the nature of political association reprcsents nothing more . Very little instruction is needed to give men a knowledge of their own interests . Whether this union of opinion is wise or foolish , based on knowledge or ignorance , truth or falsehood , whether its objects arc just or unjust , provided it exists and is known to cxist , it must prevail in politics , for there is nothing but itself to coutrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other departments of education and action . But farther than the mere knowledge , we think it very doubtful whether that information which can be acquired by any process of education is , or ever can he made , an element of such first-rate importance in polities as it is very generally supposed to be . The love of knowledge is indeed one of the most ardent and generous feelings that takes possession of individual minds . it is ordinarily favorable to the growth of virtue , and prompts occasionally to great sacrifices . But it is not a general passion , or one which stimulates enthusiasm and union in action ; and without one or the other of these , political consequence is impossible . Then , again , education and the possession of knowledge are usually distributed upon a certain scale , as it were , through the ranks of society . If one part is advanced , the rest are apt to be advanced likewise , so that much the same proportion of power is preserved between the different parts . If greater skill , greater information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-b informed people , there are also better means of obtaining // them , and we see no reason why they should not be supplied . We do not see that there is , in fact , any insufficiency in the statesmen of modern times in relation to the people . The Websters , Peels , Guizots of our time , are as much in advance of the Walpoles and Cobbetts , as we are of the people whom they governed . To represent knowledge as the only source of political power , is to take it for granted that it is only necessary for men to know their best interests in order to induce them to pursue these interests . How far this is from the truth , those who have had most experience of mankind can best determine . Knowledge is a power which is capable of being turned to the worst , as well as the best , uses ; and the roused passions of governments or people care little for the instruction that is offered to them , except as it adds fuel to their flame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no denial of the doctrine of progress to suggest that the progress takes place principally outside of the operation of government , which , within its own sphere , remains always substantially the same . That sphere may be enlarged or narrowed by external causes . The means of applying principles , and the modes of exercising power , change with the course of time and increase of knowledge . Special measures pursued in our age are outgrown in the next ; and in this way , great improvements are made in government . But the new measures were not neglected so long because nobody knew of them before ; nor are they introduced solely because they have been found out by a great number . When interest is opposed to knowledge , the latter finds no better foothold now than formerly . We do not hear that the moralists are gro *n better satisfied with the doings of politicians ; their standing quarrel still remains . There has been an evident advance in general knowledge among civilized nations during the last century . Has there been any corresponding moral change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a question which we hardly dare ask , because xve are aware how prevalent the opinion is , that a great change has come over the spirit of power , and a new era of peace and good-will commenced 011 earth . It is indeed a time of peace and dearly bought exhaustion ; a time in which all kinds of moralists , philosophers , // and reformers are at liberty to occupy the public stage , while it is vacant of other performers . As against them , the daring , active , and worldly spirits who touch the springs and hold the traditional authority of government keep their own secret because they are confident of their strength . They know that whenever they please , whenever the time of that success arrives which justifies crime and silences remorse , they can blow away these public delusions at a breath . In every society , as in every heart of man , there is a hell that can be unloosed . The time of little wars and aimless battles is past ; but great systems of war and empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , and vast enough to bewilder the imagination and affect the interests of the world , are possible still . Is not Europe a camp of hostile armies ? Does England attach less importance than formerly to her empire of the seas ? Is France kept down by moral suasion ? Are not the United States plainly striding towards the dominion of this continent ? And what hand can save us from the fate of greatness and power ? After more than half a century of the largest political education , under the most favorable constitution that was ever enjoyed by any nation ; after having our political life developed and intensified certainly to an extraordinary preponderance among our social interests , and , in the opinion of many , so as to threaten to absorb and extinguish every other liberal inclination ; after having prodneed so many great men , and placed them in situations of influence and honor , from which their spirit and instructions have descended upon the whole body of the people by means of the widest circulating press which the most unlimited freedom and universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create , - how much nearer are we to that happy condition which is presented in this Discourse as the natural result of the diffusion of useful knowledge ? And although our knowledge and cultivation increase daily , it is by no means the general impression that our politics are improving , either in the details of practice , or in the scope and character of their objects . The effect of such arguments as those of this Discourse , when applied to real life , is the same as when one undertakes // to convince us of the beauty of virtue and the desirability of perfection . It is better that men should be virtuous and nations just ; but when we have learned this , we have not learned how to make them so . No philosophy has yet invented the method to prevent force from governing , or to establish government on any other foundation than force . It is called by many other names , and attempted to be disguised , both by governors and governed ; but they all amount to the same thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing by consent of the people , government without power is nothing ; and power , whether recognized or not , is the government . This does not refer to brute force alone , or to the mere visible machinery of government ; for these are only a part of the means by which those governments which are most dependent on them are supported ; but we include all those tendencies and elements of combination and influence existing in every society . These , although they do not always affect its political complexion , are still its moral and intellectual law , and determine its spiritual condition and direction . The more unconscious they are in their operation , the more effective they frequently are ; and although this is only another way of saying that , in politics also , persuasion is better than force , we venture to repeat the lesson , because , under any form of government , however often repeated , it is still oftener forgotten . The forces upon which the march of communities depends have their own life , and subsist by their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality . How they succeed and supplant each other , how one is developed from obscurity and another falls from power , is the problem of society and the secret of history . As they do not originate in human calculation , they continually stretch beyond its reach . For politics is not philosophy , and although Mr. Burke is against us , we believe politicians have something else to do than to reduce philosophy to practice . Among these political elements , we are afraid that ignorance holds as high a place as knowledge , and that it is as capable of maintaining its ancient rank , and as much disposed to do it . It is far too important a power to be suffered to die out of politics . Rather than that such a fate should befall them , ignorance and dul // ness may call in aid from the highest quarters of intelligence . For so far as knowledge is a political instrument , it is taken hold of and employed , like other such instruments , for political purposes . It is not strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as long as courage , will , and energy bear sway in human affairs . These are the qualities which finally determine the position of individuals and nations . Power is their birthright , and it is the burden of history , that neither private knowledge nor public opinion has been able to extend or allowed to flourish , when opposed to their domination . If not able to prevent the spread of knowledge and the existence of public opinion , these are inevitably moulded to their purposes . The political education of a people is always in the interest of its most powerful element- always tends to the strengthening of the strongest . Emancipation is impossible . The well of political truth is never undetiled . No despotism is so hopeless and unrelenting as the despotism of intelligence ; and it is only through the operation of secret and unfathomable instincts of humanity , leading mysteriously towards freedom and light , that mankind are ever able to break loose from this formidable oppression . There are periods when the destiny of nations seems to hang in suspense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolingbroke quotes from IDavila the maxim that , in order to insure the duration of governments , it is necessary for them , from time to time , to return to the original principles of their constitution . He does not , indeed , tell us how it is to be done ; and although this is an omission , we should not think of finding fault with Lord Bolingbroke for so small a matter . But we refer to it to show that it has been observed that , at intervals , the fate of nations seems to be deliberately submitted to their own choice . The present seems to be one of those occasions with us . The dogs of party are hushed for the moment , apparently because they are so completely at fault that none dare open the mouth for fear they will be found baying at the wrong quarry ; and the tiiue is favorable to the expression of some ideas which , we hope , are applicable to the present state of our affairs , and which , at least , have been excited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain ourselves , we have no fear that the first one of our flights will be impeded by party network or popular breezes . The study of politics , which Lord Brougham represents as so attractive , is , in this country deprived of half its legitimate interest , and even of its natural field of inquiry , because there is among us no question of the fundamental principles of government . We are so imbued with the liberty of republicanism , and so much accustomed to its operation , that it has come to be regarded as an element of human nature , like liberty of thought or conscience . Our institutions are so firmly fixed in the traditions , habits , and opinions of the whole nation , that any other form of government seems like a violation of our social instincts , and as the necessary accompaniment of force and fear . Because these institutions exhibit only one fundamental political idea in operation , we are in haste to conclude that there is no foundation in reason for any other , and no field for its exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to be tiresome , but our politics are certainly so . There is neither temptation nor opportunity to diversify them by the study of different forms or principles of government , when only one is possible . The most important measures are considered in regard to their consequences , more or less immediate , and hardly at all in relation to the principles of government which they indicate , or in which they originated . In Europe it is all different ; there , all political principles are in conflict ; there is as much variety in their development and application , and the question of superiority between them is still as vital and undecided , as among the towns of Greece , when Aristotle described their hundred constitutions . It is impossible to withhold the imagination from the contemplation of remote and original principles of society and government , when they are constantly appealed to in support or attack of political measures , and when they are sufficiently alive to preside over the composition of parties . All the necessary elements of any of the principal forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any moment , set either of them in operation . There is none of them which is not particularly adapted to make head // against some of the evils that oppress European society . Aristocracy is insolent and defiant ; but it is energetic and compact , and is still a power over the people . Democracy is encroaching and dangerous ; but it is strong in numbers , and it has abuses to assail which deserve no quarter ; while despotism is a still harbor of retreat , which offers a shelter not unacceptable to many from the storms of life . When all these elements are fermenting , political speculation becomes interesting , vigorous , and profound ; but its most devoted admirer would hardly think it worth paying such a price . It is vain to suppose that our country is to be forever out of the reach of vicissitude , and the experience of the rest of the world without any application to ourselves . When the impending alteration of our foreign policy has brought us into close connection with other nations , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and upon what elements their governments repose , and what sort of opposition they have to contend with ; as we act upon them , they will be sure to react upon us . The human heart , which has been hitherto so variable , has not exhausted all its variety . As long as government , at the best , is so imperfect an instrument for the establishment of the right , which is the ultimate object of human effort , it is to be expected that changes will be made in it and experiments tried . The business of government , however carried on , does not satisfy our best impulses and affections , or fulfil the destiny of the highest order of minds . These desire neither to govern nor to be governed . Their spirit demands unlimited expansion ; and although the field which government opens to the exercise of their powers is wide , it can not fill the place in the soul of God , duty , or art . They are never entirely at peace with government , because they continually struggle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are disquieted , be ever at peace . On the other hand , the first desire of the people is for justice between man and man . While this is secured to them , they are satisfied with the form of government through which it is administrated ; as justice is a gift of that character which can be accepted from any hand . Popular caprice or oppression is not a whit more palatable than royal . It is proper for us to // remember , that , as long as the Institutes and the Code remain not only monuments of imperial power , but also the highest expression of practical morality which mankind has been found capable of producing , there is an argument in favor of that constitution of government and society out of which they arose , and evidence of its adaptation to indestructible elements of human nature . And the establishment , among a population taken from our own bosom , of the oldest forgotten form of absolutism - the sacerdotal - as among the Mormons at the Salt Lake , and its eminent success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation which promises the experiment a full trial - ought to make us aware of capacities not provided for in our government , and tendencies which it can not satisfy . It appears to us to indicate the possibility of future changes in our political condition not usually contemplated . Our first difficulty , however , proceeds from an opposite tendency . The unrestricted influence of the single political idea of representative democracy naturally exposes it to exaggeration ; and we apprehend that a confusion is gaining ground among us in regard to the true relations of government and people . That government is instituted for the sake of the people , that it is responsible to them , and that they exercise a righ tful control over it , are the cardinal points of our system . But it is a step further to suppose that the distinction between them can be obliterated , and their parts and characters interchanged or blended into one . Yet something like this appears to be the drift of the popular theories and the tendency of opinion . We are mistaken if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been remodelled under the idea that the more immediately the whole body of the people can be admitted into the administration of the government , the better will be the provision , and the greater the certainty , that it is to be conducted to the general advantage . With this view , offices are multiplied , and the terms are shortened ; means are taken to make them be regarded more and more as sources of livelihood or profit , and less and less in the light of duty or honor ; and , generally , the business of government is put on a level , as far as possible , // with all ordinary avocations . As to the term of office , we shall have more to say in the sequel ; but the idea that government is to be absorbed and lost in the body of the people , and merged in the common pursuits of industry and trade , we believe to be fraught with mischief , and shall undertake to expose it . It is less an idea , we are aware , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle which we rely on in our opposition is so plain that , whenever expressed , there is no inclination to question it . But since the disposition we refer to works unsuspected beneath its protection , we shall express our views at some length . Our principle is this ; - that under any form of government , in all circumstances , the action and functions of the government and the people are universally , invariably , and necessarily distinct and different . At any moment of time , there is always a government and a people ; and however rapidly the persons composing the government are changed , or in whatever manner appointed , as long as it exists in their hands , they are invested with a certain authority over the people inherent in the nature of the office . XVhether the power is forcibly assumed or voluntarily conferred , it is parted with by the people . The formalities under which it is exercised , however important with respect to the objects which a government is capable of accomplishing , do not affect this inherent quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted ; and it is evident that all degrees of slavery and freedom may exist under all sorts of constitutions . All government is a public corporation , formed by all , or submitted to by all , for the accomplishment of objects in which all are more or less interested . The objects vary , it is true ; but they vary according to the means and powers which the government has at its disposal . It is a favorite fancy of ours , that government , which is now so fragmentary and disjointed all over the world , one thing here and another there , was everywhere , in the beginning , as it is still in communities which have continued in the stage of infancy , the evidence and the first exertion of the social instinct of mankind , and included , as yet undistinguishable , all the elements of power and influence which men possess in and over each other ; and that it was sustained by all // the means that could be made to affect the feelings of a common nature . The spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , music and poetry , and all the offshoots of the infant imagination , were within the province , and the legitimate instruments , of the only apparent system of connection among men . Influence of every sort was called by the same name , and great natures ruled by divine authority . Government has been gradually despoiled of portions of its power , as different associations and relations have grown up in the progress of civilization ; and it has been found that many subjects , originally grouped together under the *Eegis of governmental authority , are better provided for , if left to the operation of voluntary and moral combinations and motives . Indeed , it would almost seem as if the extent to which this process has been carried is a measure of the progress of civilization and the advancement of a people , and that that is the ideal of a government , which , if not the most restricted in its functions , still allows the greatest latitude of moral and voluntary cooperation in relation to subjects which fall within such influences . The independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects , is very various , and does not practically appear to depend very much upon its forms . And for our part , we do not see how a government , which finds itself in possession of power over them , is called upon to resign it or can help exercising it . But there is one system of means by which the power of all governments is exerted , - by physical pains and penalties ; and there is one object which these are calculated to accomplish , - the protection of persons and property . Whatever other business a government may have to do , this one object , therefore , is common to them all . And although our own government is by no means destitute of moral authority beyond this , yet the machinery by which it acts peculiarly confirms and adapts it to this single purpose , for which it is found to be singularly efficient . But is not its action the same in kind and substance , so far as this matter is concerned , as that of the governments which are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the object is obtained , in both , upon either that class of the community which is protected in // the rights which the government recognizes , or that class which is restrained or punished for violating them ? The nature of the rights established by the law has no immediate connection with the method of enforcing them within the sphere in which it acts ; the same course of proceedings may end in justice or injustice , in tyranny or the suppression of tyranny . Opposite laws are enforced , and with the same effect , by the same system , and even by the same persons . The hand that to-day collects taxes , may to-morrow be set to distribute alms ; the officer who commits a prisoner , may be ordered to discharge him ; or he who has set over property to one party , to transfer it to another . These changes in the laws take place under all forms of government , and without affecting those forms . There is no question of the existence of a government over the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , in one case , why the fact of the same thing being done in the same way , does not prove the existence of the same cause . The thief who is sent to prison , is just as effectually punished , whether he ever had an opportunity of voting for the magistrate who commits him , or not . It makes little difference to him whether the officer who hales him along is called constable or gensdctrme , or , if he escapes , whether he is retaken by the New Police , or the ancient posse cornitcttas . It undoubtedly appears to him that the people have nothing to do with it either way . Nor , we confess , are our eyes sharp enough to see their share in the transaction . That the real actors , the ministers of the law , claim only to act by the authority of a delegated trust , is proof that the power has really been committed into their hands . That precautions are taken against its abuse , and that they are held to a strict accountability for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it exists , it is administered within its proper sphere ; it is not to be controlled nor interfered with by those from whom it proceeded . We are disposed to be the more particular in expressing our views upon this topic , because we are aware that we are in danger of trenching upon some of the formuke under which this government is carried on . It is said to be a government of the people - the people are said to govern themselves . Now , so far as these expressions are used as convenient rhetor // ical figures - SO far , indeed , as they express the truth in drawing the distinction between our government and almost all others , which distinction appears , and is naturally expressed , differently , according to the quarter from which it is approached , or so far as they are employed for political purposes , we have nothing to say against them . Indeed , he ought to be sufficiently warned , who sees how powerful an instrument such by-words have been made in the course of our history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact , or for a philosophical generalization , we insist that they are not correct . We know they have been employed by great men , and are sanctioned by long usage ; but we are persuaded that , if those who invented these forms of speech , and who have continued to use them , had been less honored by the confidence of the people - if they had been more in opposition and less in office - they would have seen more clearly a difference between those who carry on the government , and those for whose sake it is carried on . It would be too much to expect that such things should be very plain as long as one unites the functions of representative and constituent in his own person . He is too much occupied in keep . ing his place to spend time in defining its character . There is as much elation , in this country , in feeling ourself to be the people , as , in some countries , in feeling ourself to be above the people ; and it amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence upon the government ; and so they have in all countries where they have influence over each other . Acknowledge the government to be the representative of the people , no matter how perfect , and that it faithfully reflects their views and fulfils their wishes , it is still none the less an instrument set apart and specially appointed to that end . But it is safe to say that , at no time , is the government in exact accordance with the feeling of the country ; and sometimes they are widely asunder . Even under our forms , it is sometimes a matter of time and trouble for an immense majority to accomplish their will , and there are some things which we never can accomplish . To say that this is a government of the people only , or that the people govern themselves , is , taken literally , to deny the existence of any government // over us ; - a state of things which , whether desirable or not , is very far from the fact . The word government , applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . If every one of us xviii examine what share he really has in its administration , be xviii readily allow that , in his case , there is a government over him ready and able to regulate his conduct ; and that which is over each is over all . Under our forms , the part of the people which is the most important of all is not in the administration , but in the foundation and direction of the government ; they prescribe the purposes towards which it shall generally he directed , but the execution of them they are obliged to confide , and have confided , to appointed hands . The history of the Mexican war , the acquisition of California , and subsequent events , all of which took place without consulting the people , or an opportunity for them to form or express an opinion , ought to satisfy all men that we have a government , and that , if necessary , it can stand alone . Monarchical governments generally claim to exercise their authority by divine appointment . In abrogating this form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the principle in which it pretends to have its origin , and which it uses as an instrument of its support . Making the people the starting-point and foundation of government , we have had no occasion , in our theories against monarchy , to make the distinction between the action of the people in establishing the government , and the action of the government after it is established . In the question between us , the matter is sufficiently put in issue upon either point . But for our own part , we are unwilling to grant the advocates of other forms of government even a claim of advantage derived from any such difference in either their origin or their operation . If any constitution of society is of divine authority , ours is ; for it reveals the unity of human convictions , which is , at any rate , the divinity of politics . Those instincts and sentiments which form society and are the basis of government , and which exist in every human being , are the only vehicle for divine manifestations upon such things ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Politics is an experimental science , and the best government is therefore the most // sacred . According to our view , there is no foundation for an argument in favor of other forms of government , growing out of the necessity or the existence of an authority above the people ; for , in reality and in theory , it exists in one case as well as in the other . The spirit of this tendency of our politics , which we have spoken of as existing in some quarters , would be to make every one an office-holder and partner in the administration of the government . The idea held out is , that , in that case , each would be in a situation to take the best care of his own interest , which would be consistent with providing for the interest of all . Since the officers of the government , and the government itself , promote the general interest , they are a species of property in which the people have invested , and of which they ought to divide the emoluments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not share it among all concerned ? Now , in our opinion , offices are not , and can not be made , property in the hands of the people , or of any portion of them . Property is a possession , something subjected , belonging to one , for which he is accountable to no other . So far as it is to be accounted for , it is not property , but a trust . Such are offices ; sometimes an honor , sometimes a duty , always a trust . Nobody has an absolute right to get a living by governing others , nor has anybody such a right to confer . And nobody can get a living by governing themselves , neither the people nor anybody else . They receive their share of the emoluments of office , in the benefits which the discharge of its duties produces ; if the office does not produce them , it ought not to exist . In the matter of government , there are certain things to be done ; the people require that they should be done efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . They appoint some to do the things which they desire to have done , and they retain in their own hands the security against the perpetration of such as they wish to avoid . They do not require to do any thing themselves . They have provided against it . They have taken care that the bounds of each separate authority , each office , shall be accurately defined , and that they shall not be outstepped . IDoes any one suppose that a government formed upon the // plan of a universal partnership could answer the purpose , or would exist for a single day ? Such a government would be a sentence of barbarism . Society could not make a step in advance under such a constitution . What is everybody 's business is nobody 's ; and the nearer it comes to being anybody 's business , the less is the chance of its being well done . And whatever the share assigned by the theory of the constitution to the people , government is not here , more than elsewhere , a mere matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality and necessity . Special education and experience , talent , energy , and decision , and natural superiority take up the business of government , and sustain it ; and whoever desires it , it is impossible to dislodge them from their post . But the people love to avail themselves of such qualities , for this is the natural order of things . But their own life is elsewhere . Governing each other is a very small part of the business of mankind upon earth . We have all of us objects far dearer to our hearts ; and political liberty is valuable only as the means of accomplishing other things in the existence of individuals and nations - their moral elevation , the spread of civilization , the diffusion of comfort and content , and the maintenance of national honor . To obtain . such results , perhaps no amount of political labor is too great ; . but when it is dignified by no such objects , and sweetened by no such enjoymeiits , it is hard to find a way of life more hollow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren sceptre , and its apples are of ashes ; no heart is so cold* no mind so insensible to all that adorns and beautifies human nature and hurhan life , as his who runs after the embraces . of this cloudy goddess . Whenever the political element is developed to such an excess in a nation as to absorb its whom disposable activity , instead of being a blessing , it becomes an intolerable burden . The nation no longer makes any advaw. ces in those things which the consciousness of each individual declares are only truly desirable , and life among them losen not only its happiness , but its strength . Where there * nothing worth having , there is nothing worth laboring or fighting for . Such a people is not only preparing itself to fall under a master , but it invariably welcomes the hans // which relieves it of the unnatural labor of governing itself . There are countries , at this moment , in Europe , so exhausted with the confliet of parties , so weary of political warfare , as to be equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first faction that catches the reins of power . But whatever attention politics have attracted among us , we are far from such a state . Indeed , the real life of this people is as much apart from the affairs of the government as that of any people under heaven . In no other country is there such an exuberance of animation in aU other departments of thought and activity , away from official encouragement or control . It is not the government which has made our roads , our mills , our cities - which has felled the forest and extended the area of civilization , whatever it may have done for that of freedom . These things are the results of the spirit and energy of the people , and they are what really occupy their hearts . No doubt , this unexampled activity has been stimulated by our political institutions ; but it is because politics have been kept in their place . They have been , and are , for the great body of the nation , an instrument and not an object , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carried so far , that our great men of business , the characteristic production and personification of the American system of culture and society , are in the habit of looking down upon politics and its concerns as beneath their attention , and scornfully abandon them to an inferior order of men . We are sorry for it ; for if , in consequence of this abandonment , the political direction should ever be brought into conflict with our industrial interests , we should be in a situation like that of France before the late events which brought on an imperial constitution . If there is a class in the community whose interests , and whose alone , are promoted by the dissemination of the idea that the people and the government are the same thing , there can be no great risk in charging it upon them ; particularly if they are powerful enough to put it in vogue , and if their influence is known to be excited in this general direction . There is such a class - the class of candidates for office - a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // incessant warfare against enemies above and below , the instinct of ( liscipline has drilled them into order and prescribed for them a plan of operations . For the interests of the holders of office are not their interests , and as for those of the people , they enter not into their connsel . The offices are few , but candidates many . Some ability , some merit , or at least good luck , are necessary to obtain office ; but candidatures are open to everybody . Great are the labors of canvassing , and greater the uncertainty of success . In such circumstances , it is according to the best mercantile principles and practice to contrive some way to equalize the gains for the sake of escaping the losses . Good business men insure ; cunning gamblers hedge their bets ; few of us put trust enough in fortune to risk our all upon the hazard of a single die . Acting in the spirit of these sound calculations , the jointstock company of office-seekers has gone into operation , whose object is , by shortening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office practically ineligible for a second term , and establishing a course of succession by turns , to multiply the chances of success and reduce those of failure for each member . It is true , the success is not so great when it comes ; but it is sure to come in time . A small certainty is obtained in place of a great possibility ; and those are the safest lotteries which offer the most prizes . Besides , the calculations do not extend to the highest places in politics ; to hold these requires different stuff from what office-seekers are made of . The situation is too airy , too hard for them to climb to or to keep . The storms and whirlwinds of passion which play about those elevated regions are not precisely to their taste or their capacity . Some quiet , sheltered nook , or fruitful spot , is the mark of their aim and the summit of their low ambition . And not even the fear of disturbing the security of their own places can prevent them from pursuing their object with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally shortsighted , they never imagine that he who is strong enough to get , may find himself unable to keep ; and for all the rest of the world , it is only " Sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petar . " // It is not the fashion to be sparing of epithets when officeseekers are iii question . On all hands , they are called a hungry , impudent , conscienceless set . We seorn them , we abuse them , we laugh at them , but we let them carry their point , and elect them . The only way we know of to bave good government , is to resist and prevent bad ; and if the people do not do it , there is nobody else who can . The natural tendency of power is to corruption , and the people are the only remedy . That is their business . According to the provisions of our constitutions , they have the entire revision and ultimate control of the government ; and if they neglect their part , who is to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as good a right to rule as any other privileged class , and that power is as respectable in their bands as in those of a more magnificent aristocracy . If the people of this country are so benumbed and powerless as to submit to their ascendency , - if these are really the steel-clad barons of this age , whom we can not resist , and the character developed among them is the one fitted to obtain authority over ought us , we may expect to fall into tutelage , and we to know it . We do not wish to exaggerate the extent of this influence ; we are well aware that there are depths of impulse and instinctive forms in the great parties in our country , which are not to be reached by the earth-born spirit of sordid interest . But it is matter of common consent that it has usurped a control over the machinery of party and the manufacture of public opinion . It is powerful enough to make its action everyxvbere felt , arid its voice is the first , the loudest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jugglery by which it is able to persuade the people , that , to turn one person out of office simply for the sake of putting in another - a course of action of which they reap the whole advantage - is taking their rightful shire in the government , and such an awful apparition of sovereiga power as can not fail to frighten their executive servants into propriety . And whatever produces an irnpression on the public mind is already an element in the government ; for even the laws and constitution are nothing more than a public understanding . Written laws are a // record of the state of parties and opinion at the time when they were made ; however faithful and just , they cast no spell over the encroachments of time and the laws of political gravitation . The real constitution of a free country is continually changing under the hand of parties formed upon the questions in vllich its life is concentrated , and whose solution determines its character and progress . Dead forms of government will not long resist the living spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to correct the spirit of parties , it is necessary to arouse these feelings in the bosom of the people against which its predominant influence is arrayed , and which it has already lulled to sleep . They arc the original sources of that virtue , which , according to Montesquieu , is the condition of republican constitutions , and the parties are the conduits by which it is conducted to the gushing fountain of government . Office-seeking represents , in public affairs , a sphere into which ought not to be allowed to enter that pursuit of private interest which has been fostered among us by the circumstances of a new country , and which , among private citizens , is jnstiflable and conducive to the public good . Bnt the best system for the management of our own concerns , where the object is our own advantage , is not applicable to affairs of honor and trust , when we are called to look after the interests of others . Althongh the evil is already great , we do not despair ; for if it were ten times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human heart which , once brought into exercise , is able to overthrow it . Good government is not to be expected unless it is established on good principles . The principle on which this system relies , and the only one it admits , and which , we are sorry to say , is the only one not often appealed to in our current political philosophies , is that of fear , disguised under the name of responsibility . But responsibility is a virtue in governments which fails exactly when there is most need of it : it punishes the peccadilloes of weakness , but is only an empty sound when directed against the abuses of power . Besides , although extremely usefnl among the minor motives , it is incompetent to awaken profound emotions or ideas , or to excite those great resolutions or actions , on which the fate of nations 5* // sometimes depends , and whose effect endures for ages . Excellent as a regulator , it is good for nothing as a motive power . It suffices for the routine of administration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle to be present with the greatest characters , in the moment of high resolve , to enkindle all their faculties , to animate them to lay out all their strength for the common good , and , descending from them , to propel the whole machinery of government . Such a principle is the principle of honor . It co6perates with all minor safeguards ; and , continuing its influence beyond the point where they cease to operate on the will , it is equal to all the exigencies of good government . The essence of government is a distinction between men ; some govern and some are governed . The attribute of government is by nature an honorable distinction . To the meanest of men is given a power over the most exalted , which may be quickened into the supreme motive , because , in giving or withholding his approval or applause , he gives or withholds one of the keenest sensations of which we are capable . With a fair field of display , the love of honor is at the same time the strongest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human motives . No deruand is too great for its resources , particularly when it appears on the public stage of government . It can make the extremest effort the rule , and the greatest sacrifices courted . Properly touched , it is the only chord that ever need be touched in order to build up the strongest of all governments - that in which the numbers are impelled to their duty by the strongest incentive . The danger is not the lack , but the excess , of strength in its operation ; the point of honor is always unmanageable . Associated with any employment , men will always be found to spend or lose their lives , and every thing that is dear to them , in its pursuit . For its sake , armies are proud of slavery , and hunt after death in a thousand forms . The elevation it inspires , raising those who are possessed with the sentiment above the ordinary level of humanity , is the chief cause which gathers power into the hands of the few ; and no government can exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment which has overturned , and can overturn , // all opposition . We have only to enlist it in the service of a government whose object is not the supremacy of a class , but the good of the whole , and the problem of politics is solved . A government is formed which can be no further perfected . It is useless to say that this is not the highest class of motives which can be applied to the conduct of public affairs , or which mankind can be brought to . The highest motives of our nature do not belong to politics , but to morals and religion . We now speak of the motives which have their particular place in government , and which make men active and self-denying in the things of this world . It is necessary that government should be powerful , and honor is a principal element of power . And when provision is made for the maintenance of honor , all the other blessings of government flow naturally forth from this reservoir . Wherever there are gradations of rank , if promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to be forthcoming . But wherever the process is inverted , and men attempt to found government upon merit in the first place - upon what ought to be , instead of upon what is , upon motives inaccessible to those who are to be acted on by them the phantom is soon displaced by reality . It is unnecessary to show that the system we have been commenting on is at variance with the principles of honor . They are different in their origin , their operation , their objects and results . The rise of one is the destruction of the other . Now the love of honor , although capable of becoming the most imperious passion of the soul , is also the most sensitive and delicate , and requires the most tender treatment . The fairest opportunities are necessary for its healthy development , and its noble returns are obtained only at the price of continual encouragement . We are arrived at such a pass that there is no danger of exciting too keen a rivalry of honor , or of applying too powerful a stimulant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to avail ourselves of every resource within our reach to revive that antique spirit which once flourished among us , and shone in the front of our government . Since it is the studied purpose of the policy which we have to contend with , to abuse and degrade these // sentiments in regard to the distribution of public office , we ought to make office a point of honor . And the first thing to be done , to take the office-seeking interest out of the control of the great parties , is to restore universal eligibility to office , and to take efficient care that the liberty which we possess in theory is not lost to us in fact . It makes no real difference whether the exclusion of a particular class is written in the laws , or impressed upon the ideas and habits of the people ; it equally proscribes those against whom it is levelled , and is equally profitable to those who supplant them . Republican equality before the law is flagrantly violated in either case , when both a privileged and an incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The offices of government might as well be distributed by lot ; they are really so distributed when apportioned according to the favorite rotation of second-rate politicians , to one locality after another , to each person in turn , generally preferring the location to the man , and the fact of success at any time disqualifying the recipient for its continuance . All idea of merit or honor is banished from such an arrangement ; and the rapid depreciation of our politics , under its influence , painfully shows that those who possess the one , or are influenced by the other , have been in haste to follow . But , whether in office or out of office , the people have a right to the advantage of the highest attainable capacity ; and there can not be a doubt that the greatest capacity is attracted into office when the most unlimited competition makes its attainment the highest honor . The course open to talent ' was the motto under which Napoleon called forth his prodigies . The most astonishing results , in the moral elevation of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admission of soldiers from the ranks . The standard of performance is instantly raised as soon as emulation is awakened , and as far as it extends . To hold office by prescription , after it has ceased to be maintained by desert , is evidently contrary to the public interests ; but to place one in a worse position for holding office , on account of having once performed its duties , is not only contrary to republican principle , but a wound upon the idea of justice and the sense of honor . Notwithstanding the reproach of ingratitude , addressed to po // pular governments , the noblest spirits love to trust them and throw themselves into their service . There is no comparison between the honors which flow from royal favor and those which are the gift of a free people , in respect either to the avidity with which they are sought , or the value and extent of the services with which they are gladly purchased . Nothing is wanted to make office attractive , and even more honorable among us , but the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious greatness trusts to make itself felt , and by whose decision even patriotism is willing to abide . Even for those who obtain the prizes of public life , the flatteries and illusions of hope are as necessary as for their less fortunate competitors ; for the disappointments of power are no match for the allurements of ambition . But however confident and aspiring the pride of individual merit , it xvithers and retires , as things are now , before the power of organization , even though it is only organized mediocrity . There must he something peculiarly fatal in a system which is throwing the best talent of the country away from the service of the government at a moment when the nation is so rapidly expanding , and the most magnificent field of action in the world is opening before it . Nothing can be so dangerous to the integrity and security of our institutions as to separate the sentiments of the people - that love , honor , and reverence which they can not help feeling for great personal endowments - from the administration of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one we have been commenting on . It is impossible that so artificial and unnatural a system should endure - we certainly think it is not desirable that it should . Character and capacity are not mere illusions ; they are a power created by nature herself , whose hold upon the human heart is not to be thrown off by arrangements purely conventional . If deprived of their natural place in government , they will find a sphere of action elsewhere . They have already found one in party . Although it has become almost certain , that those who direct the policy of the great parties of the country are to have no irrimediatc part in carrying out their own designs , the posts of command in them are objects of a far more generous and intense ambi // tion than those inferior places in the service of government , whose occupants are paid for the sweat of their brow . For the power of the parties , and the relative situation of the members , are founded upon the imagination and the feelings ; and the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought into play , and under no other limitations than those which each individual genius lays down for itself as being the fittest for its ends . Such a contest is attractive for the nobler class of minds ; and they feel no disappointment when , after the summit of their hope is reached , they find it has to be defended by unflagging effort and attention ; for it thus becomes an indisputable proof of supremacy , and is the reality of that dominion over human thought , which is the last possible aim of ambition , and of which government itself is only the external emblem . It is true that interest is the natural , perhaps the sole , bond of party ; but upon the mass in its entirety , it operates blindly and unconsciously . Unless some higher motive of action can be substituted in the individual mind , out of which to draw at least an occasional support , it is never lifted into the region of heroism . Betxveen government and party , when all the great motives are on one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no fair comparison or contest . Their functions are not precisely the same ; but we hope and believe , that a government may be so constituted and so administered , as to he served with some part of the zeal and devotion which are now spent in the service of party . Thus far we have been obliged to use our liberty of faultfinding . That our views may present a proper critical balance , we propose to subjoin a short confession of faith . We fully believe that the government of this country is the best government on the face of the earth , by which any large community is held together . We believe that it best provides for the best purposes which government can accomplish , and for which it ought to be instituted ; that is to say , to give protection to the people according to the laws and their natural sense of justice , and an opportunity for their moral elevation . We believe that its freedom promotes manliness of character and expansion of intellect in all ranks of society , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged and educated , by constant exercise and comparison . We believe that the manner in which the business of our government is carried on is such as to give a better chance for reason to prevail than under any other . If the discipline of party is sometimes an obstacle , the discipline of an army is worse ; if it is sometimes hard to carry a just measure through legislatures , it is harder still to push it through courts . We believe that our government allows the greatest liberty of thought , expression , and action to the individual , together with the greatest facility of combination in the prosecution of matters of public and private concern ; that it adapts itself most readily to the changes of time and the necessities of national existence ; that it hangs with least weight upon the movements of society , and lends itself most perfectly to the expression of its natural disposition ; so that , after having astonished mankind in the first stage of our national career by marvels of labor which it has enahled the people to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence , for the display , hereafter , of equally unexampled magnificence and refinement . At the same time , we believe it is so much the strongest government in the world , that only one , the English , is worthy to be named in comparison ; and that is next to it , because it possesses most of the same popular elements of strength . Our government has a method of dealing with traitors and putting down rebellions , which might be the despair of absolute sovereigns , and is as much heyond their reach as their comprehension . It extinguishes them utterly , leaving not even the seed of discontent ; while despotism , in spite of armies and police , is never out of danger from thou saiids of visible and invisible enemies . Compare the disposable forces of this government with that of countries in which one half of the population is employed in keeping down the other half , - which are rent with factions , henumbed with jealousies of rank and caste , and demoralized with hostile pretensions in government , morals , religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering and injustice can breed madness and despair , - and we shall make out of the immensity of their preparation of fleets and armies , the true signs of weakness rather than of strength . That our institu // tions are supple and strong enough to endure forever , would be too much to predict ; but we are persuaded that such a fate as the future ensures for us has never yet been written or acted out elsewhere ; and that , as our existence has been thus far , it is destined to be still more emphatically , a new chapter in the history of mankind .
