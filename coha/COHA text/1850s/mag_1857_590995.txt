txt POLITICO-COMMERCIAL CONVENTIONS . THE excitement attending the recent Southern Commercial Conventions having subsided , it seems now an auspicious time to consider coolly and dispassionately the effect of their deliberations on the interests they were convened to promote , and the impression left on the public mind by a movement unquestionably designed to evoke a spirit of commercial enterprise among a people with whom other departments of business appear to have been more successfully prosecuted . In reviewing the subj ect of these conventions , it would be desirable to confine our remarks to the simple matter of trade and commerce ; and we should gladly do so , had their members restricted their actions and deliberations within the legitimate sphere of promoting commercial enterprise , and as a necessary consequence , the general prosperity of the country . For twenty years past , an occasional " Southern CommercialConvention " has been held in some one of these states , for the purpose of promoting commerce within that section . In one of these conventions the great Calhoun named the lakes and rivers inland seas , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obj ections to internal improvement by the Federal Government . However this may be , since then these conventions have increased in importance , if not in beneficial results . The two recently held , respectively at Old Point and Knoxville , claim more especially our present attention . The last named being-although somewhat varied-merely a continuation of the first , where the programme of the movement was adopted , and the rules govei'ning the future course compiled , the thoughts devoted to its proceedings will be equally applicable to the other , except to the resolution divesting its successor of a sectional character , to which we propose to pay special attention ; and , perhaps , to all similar conventions that may foll@w it , as they are pertinent to those preceding the two under discussion . // qwq // Politico- Connnercicd Convention8. 301 whole nation was invited to partake of the feast by New York , no one was heard to reproach the South or the North . No spirit of sectionalism or local selfishness found a place among the assembled multitude ; and the great Clinton rejoiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its benefits to the entire country , as the immortal Washington did over the prosperity of his own beloved Yirginia , but who , as well as Jefferson , has been misrepresented by the Old Point Convention , a swill presently appear . It will not be denied that many sound and just views were advanced in this convention , but they were neutralized by the preponderance of untenable opinions and inconsiderate action . To analyze all the speeches made and letters read on the occasion in question would be unnecessary ; suffice it to say , that with few exceptions , they breathed the same spirit as the resolutions , and the address of the originator of the project , which , considered connectively , undoubtedly embody the views of the convention . The resolutions unanimously adopted at Old Point , as the 30th of July , are as follows " Resolved , That in the opinion of the Convention , the citizens of the slaveholding States should make every honorable exertion , and especially avail themselves of every adventitious discovery of science to free the South from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the other sections of our confederncy , and that it is idle to talk of the full development of her vast resources unless she does her own exporting and importing , and divert from the maelstrom of the North the hundred millions of dollars which are drawn from her people to build up and support that portion of our country . " Resolved , That the projected ocean ferry of iron steamships between the Chesapeake Bay and Milford Haven , as originated in the letter of the Hon. A. Dudley Mann to the citizens of the slaveholding States , dated London , August i2th , I 556 , is practicable , and can , in our opinion , accomplish the result so much desired , and not only ameliorate our commercial , but strcngthen the political condition of the South . " Resolved , That in the opinion of this Convention this grand American enterprise is peculiarly deserving the support of each and every citizen of the South , and that immediate and active measures should be taken in every city , town and county in the Southern States to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Resolved , That this Convention recommend this plan for establishing direct trade to the favorable consideration and support of the Southern Commercial Convention , to assemble at Knoxville , Tennessee . " Resolved , That each of the counties , cities and towns of this State , and of such other States as may feel an interest in the success of the objects of this Convention , he and are hereby requested , as early as practicable , to meet in primary assemblies and adopt such measures as may be deemed proper to accomplish said objects , and also to appoint a correspondent to correspond with the Hon. A. Dudley Mann in r5gard to the objects of this Convention . " Resolved , That the Hon. A. Dudley Mann be requested to convey the senti. meats of this Convention to the Southern Commercial Convention , to assemble at Knoxville on the i 0th proximo. // qwq governing the convention . What would be thought of an unsuccessful farmer who should speak enviously of his more prosperous neighbor , and endeavor to " divert " or to impede his success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thns compete with his friend iii the comitmon field of useful enterprise ; or of the merchant who exerted his energies to " divert " the len-itimate business of many years ' standing , from an adjoining tra*esman ? Honorable competition in all departments of business is desirable , but should any man attempt to augment his trade or increase his profits , by " divcrtino* " business from his competitors , through detraction or misrepresentation , he would be considered mean and selfish . The evil is increased and // becomes more objectionable when a collection of men pursue a similar course . We know it was not the purpose of a majority of the convention to place themselves in this false attitude before the country ; and we are aware too , that these gentlemen spurn and reject in their hearts , everything that approximates to meanness , and yet they have inadvertently allowed those who controlled their proceedings to compromise in this manner themselves and their friends . This humiliating admission is extorted from us by the applause which greeted the following portion of the address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitorous than a commercial fortification of the South against the political encroachments of the North . When the slaveholding States rise in their commercial majesty , and manifest unmistakably that they can act as well as talk-that they can execute as well as resolve-that they know how to appreciate natural commercial allies abroad , and are prepared to dispense with intermediate agencies at home , which eat out their substancethen will venomous freesoilism be subdued and abolition fanaticism itself brought to a sense of right . Thus honorable union to the South may be secured . " Now , sir , if this be Union-destroying doctrine , then am . I bold to avow that I shall never desire more honorable distinction than to be found in the front rank of the army of the destructives . ( Applause ) . I should despise the existence which I cherish if I could entertain or express sentiments on the subject differing from those which I intended for general circulation , for I should regard nwself as meanly faithless to right and a poor craven in principle . ( Applause . ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South , then was Washington a Union-divider . The steam ferry project aims at nothing more than a complete development of the policy which that God-like personage himself distinctly initiated immediately after the achievement of our national independence . " It is somewhat surprising that the language employed by this speaker is very similar to that used by ilepublican orators mu their public gatherin*s* and that the position of Wasbin ton is as much distorted , in regard to his views on commerce , as his political opinions were by the American party during the late political campaign . To prove this it is only necessary to make a few extracts from his writings on internal unprovemneuts and commerce . In a letter to Mr. Jefferson , dated the flrst January , 17S8 , Washington wrote as follows " The accounts generally agree as to its being a flat country between the waters of Lake Erie and the Big Beaver , but differ very much with respect to the dist anee between their sources , their navigation , and the inconveniences which would attend the cutting of a canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to obtain of that country , the sources of the Muskingum and Cuyaho* , a approach nearer to each other than the Big Beaver river , but a communication through the Muskingum would be more circuitous and difficult , having the Ohio to a greater extent to ascend , unless the latter could be avoided by opening // a communication between James River and the Great Kanawha , or between the Little Kanawha and the west branch of the Monongahela , which is said to be very practicable by a short portage . " To the Earl of Buchan he wrote " To evince that our views are expanded , I take the liberty of sending you the plan of a new city , situated about the centre of the Union of these States , which is designed for the permanent seat of the government ; and we are at this moment busily engaged and far advanced in extending the inland navigation of the river Potomac , on which it stands , and the branches thereof ; through a tract of as rich country , for hundreds of miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained that in ten years , if left undisturbed , we shall open a communication by water with all the lakes northwest and westward of us , with which we have territorial connexion , and an inland navigation in a few years more from Rhode Island to Georgia inclusively-partly by cuts through the great hays and sounds , and partly between the islands and sandbanks , and the main from Albemarle Sound to the river St. Marys. * ' The Old Point orator read some six or seven other letters in not one of which a sectional sentence occurred , from Washington 's correspondence to sustain his position , and to prove that their views were identical . He also attempted to use Jefferson , but to no better purpose , for neither of these illustrious statesmen could be guilty of entertaining the circumscribed sentinients , most unjustly attributed to them , by one who could seek " commercial allies abroad , " in his anxiety to " divert " this branch of business from his countrymen at home , who rebuked the enemies of the Constitution , at the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sectional candidate , who boldly proclaimed that the South should have no interest in the public domain . And is this the Southern reward for Northern friendsaip ? Is this returning justice for justice ? We think not . A conviction exists everywhere , that this speaker places more value on the " dollar subscription , " than he does on " securing an honorable union to the South , " or what is more important , union and prosperity to the country . It is to be deeply regretted that the Southern statesmen do not frown down all such transparent attempts to build up sectional prejudices , for it is obvious that the " solid men " of the South regard with profound contempt every such effort ; and we believe a large majority of the members of the convention , in their reflecting moments , disapprove of the direction given to its deliberations by a few members who assume to control it . That the head of this movement may see himself in his own mirror , and appreciate the injury he has inflicted on a 20 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional remarks are inserted from his oration . He said " When , sir , about two years ago I first contemplated the proportions of the Leviathan Steamship , I could not refrain from exclaiming to the friends who were with me : - Here is the interpretation of the purpose for which such a water as the Chesapeake was created . Here is the principle in ship architecture which will hoist New York out of the advantages which she enjoys in commerce and nasigation . Here is the instrument which will make the South its own carrier and importer , and thus consolidate the Washingtonian policy . ' Let us , sir , promptly and vigorously employ the principle which is in this instrument in our service , and it will strangle the serpent which has stealthily entered from the dark recesses of the North our political paradise . " * * * * If we supposed it possible that the South were capable of accepting and adopting these sentiments , we should regard the institutions of the country in more danger from this quarter , than from all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is not so ; the views of this speaker are not the sentiments of the South . Charity induces us to believe , on the contrary , that he had in view simply the " dollar subscription " to meet expenses already incurred ; and the appeal was made to the low prejudices of his more ignorant friends , in the hope that passion might accomplish for the hour , what reason would fail to do for the future  --  a permanent establishment of a great commercial enterprise . One more quotation , and we will pass from this silly feature of the proceedings " I may , sir , " says Mr. Mann , " be regarded as an extremist . I care not if I am so regarded , when I state that as desperate diseases require desperate remedies , so would I rejoice to see the citizens of the South registering in their hearts a vow , a solemn vow , that from and after the 31st December , 1860-thus allowing to their merchants sufficient time to make their arrangements accordingly , and therefore inflicting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not imported directly through a Southern port from the country of their origin . Such a resolution , faithfully adhered to , would be more efficient than any legislative enactment upon the subject . " * * * * His proposition reminds ns of a resolution adopted some years since , at a meeting of the " Friends . " It is well known that this religions sect always opposed slavery , but finding all other ex p edients failed of success , they solemnly resolved " to wear no clothing manufactured from cotton produced by slave labor ; nor use any sugar or molasses obtained by the same means . " The result was , the " Friends " grew both woolly and sour , and it is doubtful whether they will recover from this self-inflicted evil , for all these articles have respectively in- // 307 creased in value ever since they decided not to use them . This record is commended to the extreme members of the " Southern Commercial Convention . " iBut a few words of a practical business nature will set this matter right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appreciated by those who possess the means and the enterprise to build up commerce wherever a foundation exists upon which it can securely rest . The exports of the United States for the fiscal year 1856 amounted to $327,000 , ooo ; $16,000,000 of this was of domestic production , leaving in round numbers , $317,000,000 as the exports . About one-half of this amount was shipped direct from Southern ports . To this add the amount of Southern produce shipped from Northern ports , and it will be found that about two-thirds of all the exports come from the South . This immense carrying trade is done by Northern and by foreign vessels . They amounted during the same fiscal year to $314,000,000 . New York received about two-thirds of this sum ; all the Southern ports one-tenth , and Virginia $690,000 . In 1856 the nuLnber of ships and barks built in the United States was 306 . The whole amount of tonnage was 469,393 tons . A little over 40,000 tons was built at the South . The State of Maine built a fraction over one-half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one-third of the whole tonnage . Virginia built vessels to the amount of 3,147 tons . Some three years since about a thousand men from that same State of Maine , were cutting ship timber in Virginia , all of which was shipped North , there to be put together , and no small part sent back to transport Southern produce . While this flourishing business is being transacted in Maine and New York , in ship building and commerce , Virginia and South Carolina are equally prosperous in the culture of cotton , sugars , rice , and tobacco . At the same time the hardy freemen of Maine were cutting ship timber in the shady woods of Virginia , and constructing vessels out of this material on the cool shores of their mountain homes , the colored laborers of Virginia were engaged in the low lands , under a scorching sun , in cultivating cotton , to be shipped by New York , and manufactured by Massachusetts into clothing , for the use of the Southern producer .
