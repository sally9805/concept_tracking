AMERICAN WIJIG- REVIEW , No . XXVIII . FOR MAY , 1850 . REVIEW OF THE REPORT OF HON. THOMAS BUTLER KING ON CALIFORNIA . THE government of the United States can not be said to have a colonial system , unless the movements of such a system are to be seen in the constant acquisition and organization of new territories . The expansion of the Republican Empire requiring the constant addition of new regions to receive the overflow of population and emigration , the policy of annexation ,  - -  peaceful and constitutional annexationby treaty and by purchase , may be regarded as the settled policy of this government . The population of the United States , " consists of natives of Caucasian origin , *id exotics of the same derivation . The native mass rapidly assimilates to itself , and absorbs the exotics , and thus these constitute one homogeneous people . The African race , bond and free , and the aborigines , savage and civilized , being incapable of such assimilation and absorption remain distinct , and owing to their peculiar condition , they constitute inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disturbing political forces . The ruling homogeneous family , planted at first on the Atlantic shore , and following an obvious law , is seen continually and rapidly extending itself westward , year by year , and subduing the wilderness and the prairie , and thus extending this great political community , which , as fast as it advances , breaks into distinct states for municipal purposes only , while the whole constitutes one contiguous , entire , and compact nation . " * This population , is now 22 millions . In fifty years it will be 80 millions , and in an hundred years 200 millions ; equal to nearly one fourth the present aggregate population of the globe . The problem for statesmen of the present day , is , therefore , not how they shall confine this irresistible and wide spreading tide of life , but rather how they shall , with sufficient expedition , provide a soil for its feet to rest upon , and extend over ita government at once cono*e free . * nial , powerful and The government of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a sound colonial policy . There are legislators , otherwise men of weight and wisdom , who have no faith in the expansive power of republican institutions , who sigh for the narrow and manageable limits of the old thirteen colonies , and amuse themselves and the people with predictions of the incapacity of a republican government to extend itself over a continent . These are men of the past ; doubters , and faint hearted . Such should not be the spirit of the rising statesmen of this age ; they who are to live through the coming thirty years of republican aggrandizement-who are to shape the destinies of the coming tim e ; it is theirs to make themselves sure of what will be , and must be ; and then , by reason 29 *Mr . Seward 's speech in the Senate , March 11th , 1850. // and a just and universal legislation , guided by the constitution , and by the advice of history and experience , to provide governments for these expanding millions ; not dilatorily and factiously , but with a great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always kind , because it is the very brother and friend of Providence ; and by obeying the great laws of events , becomes itself a law . And now , when the necessity of adopting a broad and liberal system of colonization has forced itself upon the attention even of the most reluctant and bigoted admirers of narrow limits , the force of the national legislation is wasted in the hateful strife of faction . Instead of providing , with a paternal care , for our new colonies on the Pacific , to confirm and strengthen them in affection and respect for the mother country the leaders of faction are consuming week after week in profitless recrimination . Let us turn away from this wretched strife , and refresh our eyes and our hearts with new indications of the vigor and the power of our name and our laws ; let us see how beautifully and peacefully they can expand themselves in new and untried regions . The empire of freedom has now within its geographical boundaries every element of power ; a hardy and enlightened ruling race , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , proper , spreading rapidly over a continent to which the Crer*or has given every natural advantage ; of vast , but not sterile nor wasteful extent , lying between two mighty oceans , far removed on the one hand from the barbarism of Asia , and on the other from the old tyranny of Europe . On the North boundless forests , affording the materials of structure and habitation , whose removal leaves such fields as produce the best and healthiest food of man : out of these , rivers gathering their floods and flowing toward the South , East and West , navigable almost from their sources to the sea . In the South , rich plains producing every luxury in such abundance , that the meanest and the poorest may poss , ess and enjoy them . ln the West a land mountainous and rude , but teeming with the precious metals , with silver and with gold . In the East , nourishing a population qualified by industry and sagacity for every handicraft , and with an ingenulty and enterprise which converts the very stones beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this great , this select and wonderful region , to supply everything that is needed for the densest , and the most numerous and civilized population . It is not broken by impassable ranges of mountains , nor by sandy , illimitable deserts : from one part to another the traveller passes easily , and with safety . He may sail through the land , from end to end , by natural and artificial streams ; he may traverse it , driven swiftly along , with the speed of an eagle , by the force of machinery . Frem place to place , over prodigious distances , he may send messages with the speed of lightning . The people of this continent have a common law , a single code or constitution , which makes every man the friend , the fellow , and the equal of all others of his nation . No country so favorable has been inhabited by the human race : none of such extent , and of so useful and delightful a variety . No people so free have ever been so numerous and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language is embodied every thing that is useful or important to be learned . Such a people , feeling their own destiny , must become the proudest , and the most dignified , the least jealous , and the most contented and happy among nations . The thoughts of a cit*en , in such a nation , should be too grand and general for local heat and prejudice . Let him think of his country and her destiny , and he can not fail to be magnanimous in his thoughts . There is a narrow and unphilosophical , an unbending spirit , among a certain class of legislators , which is astonished and offended at every turn in affairs , and sees a crisis in every difficulty . Let us make up our minds to it , and quietly take up with this proposition , that as in the youth of an active and ambitious man , so in the first century of a rising and powerful state , every moment is a crisis . The day is critical , the year , the age , the century is critical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually springing into life ; new powers are rising on all sides of us , new necessities , new exigencies ; our legislation must consequently take its departure from certain grand and simple principles such as suffice for the 444 May , // government of Empires , and the rule of multiplying millions . The liberty and equality of the American people , and of those of their race who blend with them and with their children , man for man ; that is our first principle . A solid and efficient governmental organization , wherever men enough are met to- , gether to form a town , a county , a municipality , then a state ; and for the rapid fusion of states into the one great Empire of freemen , maintaining , at the same time , with a most jealous care , the liberty , and sovereignty of the members , by granting them their separate honors ; by honoring their equality in the council of the nations Here are points of departure for liberal legislation ; from which , if we rightly take our observation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those novel false lights which have appeared in the Southern horizon , Balance of Power , Extension by Conquest . To doubt the expansive power of the American governmental system , is to doubt the existence of any universal principles of government ; nay , it is to doubt the universality and efficiency of the moral law itself , from which that system , together with the law of nations , is immediately derived . True it is , the importance and weight of each particular state is somewhat lessened as the number of all increases ; but the efficiency of the principles which govern all and each , is neither changed nor diminished . That law of gravitation which controls the revolution of two planets with their satellites , and harmoniously regulates their times , and subordinates each body to the common centre , rules with greater power , and with equal facility the movements of an entire system . When the principle of the movement is universal , the number of the bodies whose motion is regulated by it , may be indefinitely increased , and thereby there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new State which is asking adm*sion into the Union requires only a formality to become one of us ; it is our jealousy only which delays its admission , and not any other reason ; if jealousy be a reason we can not , constitutionally , lay political conditions upon California ; we can exact nothing from her that she will be bound to fulfil . She does not aak to b* admitted to the North *r to the S6uth , but to the confederacy of the whole . Were it possible for us to make certain political stipulations , to exact certain promises , to force into her Constitution certain provisions , for our sake or for her sake , it might be sound policy to keep her ambassadors waiting in the antechamber , with their hats in their hands for the sake of humiliation ; or to mortif ; their friends in the House or in the Senate . It was not to insult the South that she incorporated into her Constitution a provision against the holding of negroes in bondage ; but wholly to exclude the negro from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possession for that free and energetic race who are deriving wealth from it . The higher the grade of industry and intelligence brought in immediate contact with the earth 's surface , the more willingly and rapidly it yields food and clothing , and comfort , to its cultivators ; and , therefore , it is , the new State of California , ( for we insist on calling it a State , as it has the natural members and properties of a State ) has legislated for the exclusion of the inferior races . No sooner had the gold region of the Pacific coast become a part of the American territory , it began to be occupied by American citizens ; their numbers increased with extreme rapidity ; but they found them*elvcs subject to the uncertain and oppressive operation of laws written in a language which they did not understand , and founded on principles which they did not . recognize . The native judges of the country were not fitted either by talent or education to arbitrate their differences , or confirm them in their private rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. King , " containing the laws of the country , as far as I know , or believe , in the whole territory , except , perhaps in the Governor 's office at Monterey . " The American citizens , the masters of the soil , already more numerous than the native population , found themselves without protection in their lives and property , saving by a rude military justice , and the force of public morals . Titles to property could not be with certainty established , and were necessarily taken without a possibility of ascertaining their validity . Without charters , or any legal right of organization , towns and cities were grow1850. 445 // ing up with all their municipal necessities of police , of taxation , and the protection of life and property . At the custom-house , duties were exacted by the general government , to a large amount , in return for which , the people themselves received none of the benefits of the government which exacted them . " In obedience , therefoFe , to the extraordinary exigencies of their condition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities elected members to form a legislature , and clothed them with full powers to pass laws . " Their laws and liberties they did not derive from charters , they had them in their minds and in their hearts ; they were traiaed citizens ; they knew how to organize a State . They were already , de facto , members of a State ; they had no gradations to pass through , they were not pioneers , backwoodsmen , or barbarians . " Other territories had been , at first , slowly and sparsely peopled , by a few hunters and farmers who penetrated the wilderness or traversed the prairies in search of game or a new home , and when thus gradually their population warranted it , a government was provided for them . They , however , had no foreign commerce , nor anything beyond the ordinary pursuits of agriculture and the various branches of business which usually accompany it , to induce immigration within their borders . Several years were required to give them suffic*nt population and wealth to place them in a condition to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not so with California ; the discovery of the vast metallic and mineral wealth in her mountains , had already attracted to her in the space of twelve months , more than 100,000 people . An extensive commerce had sprung up with China , the ports of Mexico on the Pacific , Chili and Austrillia . Hundreds of vessels from the Atlantic ports of the Union , freighted with our manufacturers and agricultural products , and filled with our feliow*citizens had arrived , or were on their passage round Cape Horn ; so that , in the *nonth of June 1ast , there were more than 300 sea-going - vessels in the port of San Francisco . " " California has a border on the Pacific of more than 10 degrees of latitude , and several important harbors which have never been surveyed ; nor is there a buoy , a beacon , a light-Irnuse , or a fortification on the whole coast . " " There are no docks for the repair of mercantile vessels nearer than New York , a distance of some 20,000 miles by sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper regulation of the gold region , the cuick* silver mines , the survey and disposition of the public lands , the adjustment of land titles ,  --  the establishment of a mint , and of marine hospitals , required the immediate formation of a more perfect civil government than California then had , and the fostering care of Congress and the executive . In a single year California had become a state of great commercial importance of equal , if not superior importance to any of those which have recently been admitted into the Union as States . Her citizens , . therefore , with unexampled unanimity and promptitude , resolved upon the only course , which lay open to them the immediate formation of a State Government . To have waited the action of a Congress paralyzed by a balance of factions , would have shown a degree of patience and pusillanimity on their part unworthy of a people whose greatest glory , in the eyes of the world , is , the capacity which they exhibit for prompt , and efficient , and permanent , civil organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would be subjected to ruinous delays had they to wait on the action of Congress . In regard to that question which was , shaking the Union to its centre , " and had thus far deprived them of a regularly organized civil government , " they believed that they had an undefeasible right to decide for themselves , if not as a chartered State , then , as individual citizens , and in maintenance of that very doctrine which is so jealously maintained by the South . Was it for them to suppress any portion of their Constitution ? To sneak it out and make a secret of it , with the intention of sneaking it in , after their reception into the brotherhood of States ? It had been argued and established , say the friends of Mr. Calhoun , in the celebrated resolutions of 1847 , concocted by that much lamented statesman , " that it is a fundamental principle in our political creed , that a people in forming a Constitution , have the unconditional right to form and adopt the government which 446 May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prosperity and happiness . " President Polk , in his message of 1848 , declares that " whether Congress shall legislate or not , the people of the acquired territories , when assembled in Convention to form State Constitutions , will possess the sole and exclusive power to determine for ' themselves , whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limits . " * Mr. King states that the date of his arrival at San Francisco was on the morning of the fourth of June . General Riley 's proclamation , calling a convention to form a State Government , was dated the day previous to his arrival . Mr. King declares that he had no secret instructions , verbal or written , from the President , or any one else , what to say to the people of California on the subject of slavery . There was no party organization ; there could be no secret influences : the people were ripe for the formation of a Constitution , and when the question of slavery was submitted to them by those who were opposed to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission . All the influence of which we find any testimony that it was exerted by Mr. King , was such as his age and experience , as a practical legislator , entitled and compelled him to exert , with or without executive instructions ; that is , to advise a reduction to order of the chaotic Society of California , and to begin that work , which it was the first and paramount duty of the people to perform ,  --  the organization of their society for the protection of life and propcrty ,  --  to show their capacity for self-government , and to test themselves in that particular , before they should apply for admission into the Union . The Convention , ** says Mr. King , " was sitting 130 miles from the place where I was ; my illness was a sufficient proof that I did not , and could not , had I been disposed , exercise any influence on the Convention ; no rhad I anything to do with selecting or bring'ing out candidates . " In a word , it is understood that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did exert was advisatory , and for this , even , We have only the testimony of newspapers . A very large portion of this lucid and important report consists of a geographical and economical description of California . It may be interesting to the reader to learn , from this authority , that the population of California in 1802 did not reach a total of 17,000 ; and that in 1839 it fell short of 24,000 ; of which 18,000 were converted Indians . In 1838 began the emigration from the United States , and in 1846 , Colonel Fremont found it not difficult to raise an army of 500 fighting men . At the close of the war with Mexico there were estimated from ten to fifteen thousand Mexicans and Californians , exclusive of Indians . The emigration of American citizens in 1849 was estimated at 80,000 ; of foreigners , 20,000 . Thus , it appears that California is , strictly , an American State* more so , than several other States of the Union . It is impossible to ascertain the number of Indians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their villages at the feet of the mountains , show that they were once a numerous population . Americans who penetrate too far into the interior , not unfrequently fall im*i with hostile tribes ; and a number have been killed by them . Emigration parties have been frequently attacked . These hostile tribes chiefly occupy the mountains , and range over the deserts of the interior . Mr. King says that the small parties of Indians which he met , scattered through the lower portions of the footholds of the Sierra Nevada , seem to be almost of the lowest grade of human beings , living on roots and acorns , with occasional fish and game . These , he says , have never pretended to hold any interest in the soil , and have not the slightest inclination to cultivate it . They were too indolent to be profitably employed . He supposes that they will disappear from the face of the earth , as the settlements of the whites extend over the country ; but that , at present , a very considerable military force will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of the territory . Mr. King 's description of the geographical peculiarities of California and the 1850. 447 * All the quotations thus far given , are from the Report , either quoted by Mr. King , or in his own words . // sea which borders it , are extremely interesting ; but to give even an abstract of them would expand this article beyond the limits which are assigned to it : a few particulars is all that we are able to extract . The forests of California , west of the Sierra Nevada , and below latitude 49 , consist only of some scattering groves *of oak on the values and along the borders of the streams ; and of " red-wood , " on the ridges , and in the gorges of the hills . With these exceptions , and a dwarfish shrubbery upon the hills , which can be used as fuel , the whole territory presents a grassy surface , varied with wild oaks , which grow in the valleys most luxuriantly . As the summer advances , this slender vegetation perishes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each day , a cold , cutting wind begins to blow from the mountains , loaded with vapor ; which , with the dry heats , render the climateat San Francisco , more uncomfortable in summer than in winter . A few miles inland , however , the climate is moderate and delightful . The best climate of California prevails in the vallies , along the coast range . On the vast plain of the Sacramento and San Joaquin , the sea breeze loses its influence , and the alternations of heat and cold are intense and afflictive to the stranger , the thermometer frequently ranging much higher than is known on the Atlantic coast of the same latitude . A ew months of acclimation , however , reconciles the stranger to the climate of California , and he pronounces that of the values which are situated between the great plain of Sacramento and the coast rang3 of bill , " as healthful and pleasant , as it is possible for any climate to be , which possesses sufficient heat to mature the cereal grains and edible roots of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitudes , are divided into wet and dry , and will excite no surprise in the inhabitant of a southern State : the winters being *xtremely mild . The soil of the vallies which are situated parallel to the coast-range , and those which extend eastward , in all directions among the hills , is deep and black , and of unsurpassed fertility . There is said to be a rich belt of well tii*mbered and watered country extending the *hole length of the gold region between it and the Sierra INeva , some twenty miles in width , but it has not been surveyed , nor accurately described . Mr. King represents that he considers the plain of Sacramento and San Joaquin covers an area of between fifty and sixty thousand square miles ; and capable , under a proper system of cultivation , of supporting a population equal to that of Ohio or New York at the present time . It is , of course , to be understood that a system of irrigation would have to be adopted for this region , dui'ing the hot months . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Californians were a pastoral people , and that grains enough for home consumption only , were obtained by the cultivation of the soil . Formerly there was a very great exportation of hides , but the destruction of cattle for their skins and tallow has now ceased , in consequence of the demand for beef ; and the increase of population , and consequent demand for food , is so rapid , it is computed that the entire stock of cattle , supposed to be about half a million head , will be absorbed before 1854 . The supply of beef will then be of necessity from the Atlantic States of the Union . " No other country , " says Mr. King , " has the means of supplying so great a demand . By the regular increase of her population , at the present rate , California will require 100,000 head of beef cattle per annum from some quarter , to supply the wants of her people . " This demand can not be met by the salt provision commonly put up for mariners . It is found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive diseases . There is no climate , says the Report , where flesh meat and vegetables are more essential to human health . To meet this vast demand for live-stock , sheep and cattle will be driven from NewMexico and from the western states , and after grazing for a time upon the rich pastures of California , after their journey , they will become acceptable food . In regard to the cultivation of grains , Mr. King argues from evidence which he considers sufficient , that in the rich alluvial values of California , every species of vege .. table food may be produced , excepting perhaps , the maize , or Indian Corn ; and without that irrigation which is essential // upon plains subject to the continued heats of summer . There is no species nor amount of vegetable production , however , which can not be obtained from the soils of California by attention to drainage and irrigation . As long , however , says the Report , as laborers can earn 15 dollars or more pe* *em , in collecting gold , they can very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages of labor are only 50 cents , or one dollar ; and this brings us-to the most important part of the report , namely the commercial considerations and prospects suggested by a view of the present and future aspects of California , as a country to be supplied by the products and manufactures of the Atlantic States . The cultivatible land , south of latitude 39* , and west of the valley of Sacramento and San Joaquin , is claimed by such persons as are reputed proprietors of it , under what purport to be grants from the Mexican government . The boundaries of some of these properties , contain two or three times as much land as the grant conveys . In most of the grants the minerals and metals are reserved to the government , which will perhaps explain the reason why larger discoveries of the metallic riches of the country were not made previous to its possession by Americans , and gives a hint of the true policy to be pursued by the government of the United States . It will be necssary to depart in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to precious substances found in the earth . The Mexican law requires that grants made by a provincial government shall be confirmed by the supreme authority in Mexico . Very naturally this requisition has been disregarded ; not only because of the distance from California to the Capitol of Mexico , but because the claimants or proprietors , having no particular value for the soil except for grazing purposes , did not think it worth their while to examine into their land titles . There was room enough , says Mr. King , for all . These grants are enormously extensix*e ; bounded by mountains , bays , and promontories , and since the discovery of the precious metals , they have become consequently , of enormous value . - " By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo the United State&amp; purchased all the rights of Mexico to and in California ; " a purchase which includes not only the land , but the rights of mining , and all that might accrue from the forfeiture of grants of which the conditions were not fulfilled , or through imperfection in the grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the appointment of competent Commissioners , with a power to confirm all rightful titles . The gold region , which is the same with the foot hills of the Sierra Nevada , some 500 miles long and 60 broad , requires also to be brought under a general system for use and settlement . The report suggests the necessity of a new survey as a matter of very great importance , both to the miners and agriculturalists , and , in general , to all land owners and purchasers . The public are not generally aware , that in the interior , even of the Atlantic States , millions of property and years of litigation are lost through the uncertainty of boundaries . We venture to say that an expenditure of $10,000,000 upon an accurate trigonometrical survey of the entire Union , would , in a very few years , save the expenditure of much more than that amount in law suits , and the bungling work of county surveyors . Much more then , is a complete and thorough scientific survey needed of a country like California , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of the Report Mr. King suggests the employment of a system of - drainage and irrigation for the great plain of Sacramento and San Joaquin , which , he says , when agriculture shall have become a pursuit in California , will make this valley one of the most beautiful and productive portions of the Union ; but while the hireofadaylaboreris3 dollars perdiem , and grain can be procured from Oregon at 50 cents the bushel , there is no likelihood that the people of California will expend any capital in drainage or irrigation . Under the head of " commercial resources , " Mr. King takes notice that the precious metals are the only products of California ; a state of things that must remain as long as the pursuit of gold continues profitable The gold , as it is taken from the earth , weighed in ounces , is the medium of domestic and foreign exchange Vessels departing from all other ports 1850. 449 // bring food and manufactures to the Californians , who pay for them in gold . These vessels , says the Report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their cargoes in California . On the arrival and discharge of cargoes , they will become willing carriers of goods sent from California , at very moderate freights . Mi . King supposes that these tendencies will make San Francisco a ware-house for the supply , to a certain extent , of all the ports of the Pacific-American and Asiaticand for the Islands . He adds that the establishment of a mint in California will bring thither more than ten millions of silver bullion , from other parts of the Pacific coast , to be assayed and coined . Gold is worth a dollar more the ounce measured by the standard of silver , in New York than inSanFrancisco ; if , therefore , a merchant of Valparaiso receives m payment for lumber , or other produce , ten thousand ounces of gold in San Francisco , and desires to purchase goods from the United States or Europe , he will gain $10,000 by sending this gold to New York , and purchasing with it there . To carry this illustration farther than it is carried in the Report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to California , to the value of $17,000,000 of gold , paid for them at San Francisco . This $17,000,000 of California gold will purchase in New York $18,000,000 worth of goods in that market. ; a process to be repeated indefinitely in favor of the exporters , so long as the abundance of gold in California shall continue to reduce its price , and the rapid increase of population keep up the demand for foreign products . Our Report shows conclusively what we have always contended for , that it is not the gold diggers of California who reap the advantage of the mines . " Those who purchase and ship gold to the United States , " says Mr King , " make large profits ; but those who dig lose what others The Report argues that San Francisco will become the mart of all exports from the countries on the west coast of America ; these finding no markets in China or other ports of Asia . The products and the manufactures of India , which are required in exchange for them , have to be paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be re mitted by the Indfa merchant to New York . It can not be sent to China , gold in China being not used as currency , and valued at only $14 the ounce by the silver standard . The China trade will , therefore , still centre in New York . Manufactures and products of India , carried to San Francisco for the supply of South America and the Islands , will be paid for in gold ; the gold will be sent to New York , ( according to our report , which is founded on the best mercantile authority , ) and , with it , there will be purchased sterling bills , payable in London . " These bills , sent to London , will be placed to the credit of the firm in China , from whom the merchandise had been received , and who , on learning of the remittance having gone forward to their agents , will draw a six months ' sight bill for the amount , which will sell , in China , at the rate of four shillings and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reader unacquainted with mercantile transactions need only understand that by an imperative necessity of trade , founded on permanent differences of prices in the precious metals , the greater part of the gold of California employed in striking the balance of the Chinese and India trade , will flow through New York , and from that port to Europe ; saving what remains , through superiority of demand , in the United States . If the reasonings of Mr. King and the experience of the New York merchants are here correctly given , the harbor of San Francisco will have the control of the commerce of the Pacific , and the merchants of New York will become in future the principal operators between Europe and Asia . A full examination of this part of the Report would have to be accompanied with a treatise on the laws of trade . The Report dwells , especially , upon the importance of that commerce which is growing up between California and the older States of the Union . Every necessary and luxury has to be imported into California , a country which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can supply only a small portion of these . Every species of manufacture that requires an expenditure of capital and ingenuity must come to California from the older States of the Union . The great distances over which they have to be carried already 450 May , // give employment to a fleet of merchant vessels . The public have heard enough of California prices ; we need not dwell upon them here . In the sole article of lumber , in consequence of the demand for houses , it is supposed that the demand will not be less than 20,000,000 feet per annum , at a not less price than $40 the thousand . With a population of 200,000 , that is to say before the close of the present year , California will require near half a million of barrels of flour to be supplied of necessity from the Atlantic States ; and allowing only $20 worth of clothing to each person , which is not half enough , she will require four millions worth . These estimates are exceedingly rude . The entire value of the trade between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , says Mr. King , fall short of twenty-five millions , and in five years may reach an hundred millions per annum , at the present rates of emigration . We give the following quotation from the report without comment . " It is difficult to imagine or calculate the effect which will be produced on all the industrial pursuits of the people of the State of the Union by this withdrawal from them of half a million of producers ; who , in their new homes and new pursmts , will give existence to a commerce almost equal in value to our foreign trade . Let no one , therefore , suppose he is not interested in *ae welfare of California ; as well may he believe his interests would not be influenced by closing our ports , and cutting off intercourse with all the world . " Mr. King shows , conclusively , that even the article of coal will be powerfully affected . He supposes that the coal from the United States will compete successfully with the coal from Vancouver 's Island and from New Holland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama will secure the market for these articles against all competition . With the railroad , communication between New York and San Francisco can be effected in twenty days . Mr. King 's description of the gold region agrees very nearly with the information which has already been conveyed to the public through the news writers . He supposes that the average earnings of the gold diggers axe about an ounce , or seventeen dollars the day ; which will give an amount of $40,000,000 , collected during the gold digging season of 48 , 49 ; one half of which was probably collected and carried out of the country by foreigners . Mr. King advises that a system of licences to gold diggers be adopted , the property of the soil remaining in the nation that ; each man , on the payment of a certain sum , say $16 , be permitted to dig for one year : a tax which would give a revenue from 50,000 miners of $800,000 . The entire country will have to be surveyed and laid out ; the system will involve the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its enforcement . During the mining season of 1849 , more than 12,000 foreigners , mostly Mexican and Chih*nos , came in armed bands into the mining district , defiance to all opposition , and finally carrying out of the country some $20,000,000 worth of gold dust , which belonged by purckase to the people of the United States . We are glad to perceive in the above language of the Report , a clear recognition of the true and only title by which these territories are held . By whatever right , to use the word right ' in the technical sense , is possession may have been acquired ; by that same right it must be held . If the acquisition is a conquest and founded upon force , it must be maintained by force ; and there is no violation of any right or title in it , bythe attempt of its former possessor to reconquer it . It is barely possible that these armed bands of Mexicans are as ignorant of the true foundation of our title to California , as these Democratic Senators and Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive that neither the Mexican invaders who have carried away the gold from the mines , nor their democratic orators have a right appreciation of the means by which the territories of California and New Mexico came into the possession of the United States . According to our understanding of the matter , the war with Mexico was gotten up for the express purpose of wresting these , and as much other territory as might be seized upon , from their ancient possessors , without even the pretext of a bargain or equivalent . Their 1850. 451 // grand attempt to involve the entire nation in the disgrace of so deliberate a piece of wickedness met with a most signal failure . Public opinion rose against them , and by the steady opposition of the Whigs , they were obliged to cover their retreat put of this villainy by offering such terms as Mexico might reasonably accept , and without disgrace to herself . The new territories , it is to be eternally remembered , are by no means a conquest , but a purchase ; and the right and title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is founded upon value received , and is good in the eyes of the law . Mexican and Chilinean invaders , have therefore no pretext nor precedent , thanks to Whig influence , for carrying the gold , by main force and arms , out of the territories which have been purchased by the people ; and if the Mexican government itself abets such proceedings , we shall by and by have a casus belli for the war faction , which they will doubtless enforce , as becomes them , with the arguments of a very hightoned morality . The report continues : " They may with as much right gather the harvest in the valley of the Connecticut , . the Ohio , or the Mississippi . No other nation , having the power to protect its treasure would suffer it to be thus carried away . I would not allow them ( the foreigners , ) to purchase permits , or work vein-mines , because the centributions , proposed to be required , are so moderate they will not cause the slightest inconvenience to the miners , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , would willingly pay their small sums for permission to collect and carry away millions of dollars in value . The object is not only a suitable revenue , but to preserve , for the use of our own fellow citizens , the wealth of that region . The system of permits will make all who purchase them police officers , to aid in excluding from the mines all who are not entitled to , or who do not procure them , and to prevent deserters from the army and navy fro*m being protected in the mines . Sailors belonging to the mercantile marine would be thus prevented from violating their engagements , and the commerce of the country preserved from the disastrous consequences of the abandonment of ships by their crews . " The report concludes with several important suggestions . Mr. King shows the necessity of a powerful military force to be established in California with the least possible delay ; of an efficient harbqr defence , in case of war ; of the establishment of a mint ; and completion of the rail way across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards as of great importance to draw to San Francisco the 10,000,000 of silver bullion which are annunlly sent from Western Mexico to Europe . At San Francisco it would then be advantageously exchanged for gold coin , or would be coined itself to fit it for the Chinese and American markets , to aid in substituting Chinese and American manufactures for those of Europe . Mr. King estimates that 50 millions of gold will be dug during the current year . He supposes that the entire difference in the price of gold between New York and San Francisco , will be saved to the miners by the establishment of a mint ; but it is clearly impossible that mere coinage should make gold at $16 , worth $18 the ounce , or that the coinage should add even five per cent . to its value . At the very lowest estimate , the increase of emigration in California will create there a population of at least 100,000 of American citizens during the year 1850 , if , indeed , there is not already as great a number to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we allow for each man an outfit and expenditure of $500 ; by which it will appear that more than 50,000,000 of personal property have been carried out of the United States into that colony . An equal amount must be added for the sustenance of the population during the year 1850 ; and as much more for the expenditure of the previous year . The expenses of the colony have then already reached the enormous sum of at least 150,000,000 . It will be safe to add at least 5,000,000 more for the employment of sailors and shipping , and the various contingencies and losses attending such an expensive adventure . If the entire cost of the war , including the purchase money of the territories be estimated at 75,000,000 , and one third of it put to the account of California , the price of that colony has risen , within two years , to 180,000,000 . But if the 100,000 citizens 452 May , // who have gone to California , had remained at home , they would have remained here as producers . Let us suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , which is certainly not too high an estimate ; that is 20,000,000 of actual production , lost in time and labor ; and the new colony of California will noW have cost the United States , in the brief space of two years , 200,000,000 . The remittances of gold to the United States have not , if we are rightly informed , much exceeded 15,000,000 , and that sum is , by many , thought to be too large an estimate . Let us suppose , that in addition to this , 5,000,000 of profit have been realized by exporters and traders ; there is 20,000,000 for the first year , to the credit of California . Now , by Mr. King 's estimate for the current year , 50,000,000 of gold will be dug in California during the year 1850 . There is 70,000,000 to the credit of California . But no , this estimate is too large ; it is not to be supposed that more than 30,000,000 of the proceeds of the current year will be sent to the United States ; leaving only 50,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two year . It is impossible to come to any other conclusion than this , that this new colony of California has cost the United States 150 millions in personal property and the labor of its citizens , for which no return or profit was been received ; that is to say the colony has cost $1500 per man . We have sent away 100,000 men , and with each one of them $1500 . It is impossible to escape from the conclusion . A great deal has been said and written in ridicule of English colonial economy . It is a fair subject of doubt , however , whether England ever sent out a colony more costly for the time of its duration than our Californian one . We are , therefore , to conclude , and our conclusion is well fortifieil by facts which have been communicated to us t*rough several adventurers who have sought their fortune in California , that the rapid fortunes made there are , by no means , as some have imagined , taken out of the earth with spade and pick-axe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in any other , sudden augmentations of the value of land , and of professional servides , give opportunities unknown in other countries for the rapid accumulation of wealth . This accumulation is by the transfer of the wealth of many into the hands of a few . The usual causes of inequality existing with far greater intensity than in other communities , their effects are increased by the carelessness and ignorance of new comers , whose property slips easily through their hands and falls into the purses of those who stand ready to appropriate and use it . It is only after severe losses and bitter sufferings , for the most part , that the poor and inexperienced colonist is able to establish himself in tolerable comfort . As California is described to us by eye witnesses , nothing can exceed the waste and reckless profusion of those who meet with a sudden turn of luck in the great lottery of the mines . Their fortune is shared with them by their brother adventurers , who have had the wit to engage in easier but more ingenious kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miracle , thee atire population of California , together with the one hundred and fifty millions which have been sunk during the two years enterprise of that colony , could have been converted into an agricultural community , and transported to the interiorlet us say , of Ohio , or Pennsylvania . One hundred thousand farmers , with each a capital of $1500 ! Each one of them might safely undertake to put the one-half of one hundred acres of wood.land in good order for cultivation , and in five years to convert fifty of those acres into rich and full bearing cornfields and meadows . Five millions of cultivated acres , producing each $20 worth of produce . There would be already created an annual income , to this agricultural colony , of 100 millions ; needing only to have suitable roads to convey the surplus of their products to market , and the establishment of manufactures with a portion of that surplus among themselves , to convert them into one of the wealthiest communities in the Union ; living , not as our unfortunate Californian brothers now live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every species of natural accident ; deprived of home , comforts , and all the aids and consolations of a. peaceful society ; but living , as men should live , civilized , organized , and in peace . 1850. 453 // The spirit which possesses a large porlion of the American people at this time , seems to possess it , like an eccentricity of genius , or like the blindness of a Samson ; by its own folly it grinds in the mill of poverty and destitution , and he who grinds is not responsible for himself alone ; he compels others to suffer with him . He compels others , by the share which he bears , as a practical legislator in the affairs of his country ; he legislates practically by his vote ; by his vote he throws down those natural protections and barriers , peaceful , but insuperable barriers , which may be erected by the laws against the hostile enterprise of other nations , more adroit , and steadfast , and far-sighted than his own . And by this perverse spirit he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness to fall a prey there to the harpies that haunt untilled lands . With agriculture alone , such is the eternal law of progress , begins the enduring prosperity of communities . Upon the shoulders of that Atlas the sphere of civilization rests with its full weight . He and his tribe must go into the wilderness , because at home they have shut their eyes and set their teeth against the only means of prosperity . They will be free traders ,  --  they , or to ruin they will go . *They are martyrs , forsooth , for a principle . Let us now suppose that , by an opposite system . of legislation to that which has been now , for twenty years , pursued , not one hundred thousand unfortunate adventurers , but ten times that number had been suffered to find employment for their strong hands , their free and ready genius , and their quick wits , in new modes of industry , m the heart of the old States . In two years , by the imposition of 25 millions upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not four times that amount of value have been created , by new shapes of industry protected , and springing up vigorously in all the towns and villages of the Union ? whereas now , under our free trade legislation , and our sad and teyrible spirit of Ishmaclitism , of desert wandering , of gold hunting , and robbery , and conquest , we have incurred already some 75 millions of unavoidable taxation , with intexest , and as much more , at the last estimate , in personal property taken away from us to be sunk , and forever buried and consumed on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada . Barren , deceitful , burning country , the country of diseases , wasteful , unfortunate country ; cursed , like a young heir , with an inheritance of gold , which it must waste , and spend , and devour , until all is gone , before it can assume the garb and the habit of severe , honest , and saving industry ? Such , however , is our fate . The steed will run away ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since extension is the rule , let us make the best we can of it . If , by a false and injurious system of legislation , we have driven our brothers into the wilderness , let us do all we can for them where they are . Let us make their fate bearable ; infuse into them a spirit of humanity , and of kindness ; extend over them the protection of the happier and more powerful States ; give them every assistance in their attempts to organize themselves , and encourage all their efforts to build up a secure and peaceful State . They must come into the Union , sooner or later ; every man knows that they must be brought in , with or without their antislavery provision ; it makes no difference . Legislation is the highest act of which men are capable ; it should , therefore , as its effects are the most momentous , be the clearest , and the least doubtful . It is certainly unfortunate , not only for California but for the nation , that the question of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded with other , and wholly irrelevant matters . What we desire to see accomplished , during the present session , is , first , the admission of the new State , not with reference to any system of encroachment upon the rights of the South , - for the admission is no part of any such system , nor can be made such a part ,  --  but simply , because it is right and necessary for the prosperity of California herself . The next thing which we desire to see accomplished is the immediate and effectual abolition of the slave traffic in the District of Columbia . Were it our part to do so , we would bend every effort toward the removal of this sore and canker on the body of the State . We would not suffer that question to be entangled with*any others . Thirdly , and as insubordinate in importance , we would endeavor to accomplish the establishment of an effective government for the tern-454 May* // tory of New Mexico ; not with any reference to the question whether she should become , or should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because it is just and necessary that such a government should be established . We would not revoke the ordinances of the Mexican Government , but leave the law as it is , and give th' people full liberty , and every advantage for the formation of a new State , under such a Constitution as might please themselves , and not us . The settlement of the boundary question between New Mexico and Texas , ought not to interfere , and can not interfere with the duty of the general Government . Let an arbitrary line be drawn , and all without that line be left under the protection of the Texan Government . If a line can not be agreed upon , let one be assumed as debateable , and subject to litigation before the Supreme Court ; let the bill be so framed as to leave open the adjustment of the line ; let the territorial government be merely a protective and temporary government ; but still effective , and sufficient for the purpose ; let the bill by which it is established be unencumbered by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its own reasons and necessities , and separately enacted into a law . The present policy of the Southern Senators is , to hold up continually , and to reiterate , the constitutionality of the designs of cert*n Northern agitators . They agitate in every shape certain propositions and principles as well known to , and as deeply rooted in , the minds of Northern politicians as their own . The North does not need to be informed of what the South is continually assuring them . Resolutions to the effect that Congress has no power to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia ; that Congress ought not to abolish slavery in the ports and dock-yards of the United States , serve only to waste the time of the Senate and to exasperate the passions of both parties . To become a portion of the fundamental law , they must pass through both Houses , under the conditions requlred by The Constitution . And unless such an enactment could be accomplished , they are of no value , except to such agitators in the North as will use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party lines and engage the IrfGre ignorant part of the people in a crusade against Southern institutions . It is a pity , it is a thing deeply to be deplored , even if it can not be helped , that Southern Legislators should insist upon this hashing together , and making an indistinguishable mass of things , which , by their nature , refuse to be conjoined , and which have a separate importance and interest , and require to be treated* each , from the view of its own facts and its own consequences . If it is admitted to be a desirable thing  --  and who denies it ? - for the new State on the Pacific to be made a member of the Union , the admission of that State does not become a precedent against the South . The nature of the necessity is such as to put aside every species of compromise . We can not draw a line through California , dividing her population into slave-holding and non-slaveholding . We can not identify her citizens with those of New Mexico . We can not fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit slave-holders , as a condition of being themselves admitted to the Union . If , however , it is impossible by any other course to pacify the heat of the two factions , let us , at least , move expeditiously and promptly in the course adopted , using the greatest care in this new kind of legislative joinery , to unite only such parts as will adhere . A bill , boldly constructed , and forced through the Senate , may be rejected by the House ; and then , we are no better off than at first . Indeed , we are worse off than at first ; the political effect would be worse . Were a bill simply for the admission of California rejected by the Senate itself the blame would rest , where it belongs , and there would be no charge against us for temporizing , or mincing , and encumbering the question . It seems to be a very general opinion , among those who have kept an eye upon the proceedings of Congress , that no sepa-. rate and independent bill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate at this session ; that every bill for the admission , of necessity , will be encumbered , previous to , or during its passage through the Senate , with a provision for territorial governments in New Mexico without 1850. 455 // any clause for the prohibition of slavery . In the House on the contrary , the intention of the anti-slavery proviso prevails so far , it is held certain by some that every encumbered bill of that character will be rejected , and that , consequently , California will not be admitted into the Union as a State , during the present session . The results of such a course of legisfation , or rather of non-legislation , or refusal to legislate , when the spirit from which it rises comes to be considered , will be disastrous not only to the South in particular , but to the tone and harmony of the nation . As for its effects upon the people of the territories and the West generally , their alienation can not be doubted . In Califorida , as well as in Ohio , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , the effects of such a conduct are equally certain . In the South itself it can not fail to produce , in time , a violent reaction against itself . In a word , it will everywhere arouse and fortify that spirit of innovation and of hostility to Southern institutions which has lately appeared in such a formidable shape , but which might have been annihilated , and may yet be annihilated , perhaps forever , by a single act of magnanimity on the part of the Senate . At the end of this long and idle session , during which not a single measure of national importance will have been adopted , a feeling of disgust will spread itself over the c*untry , and a sense of the necessity of sending other and more forcible men to do the work of legislation , will take strong possession of the people 's mind . In every village , throughout the entire Union , there will be a struggle . In two-thirds of these , there will be a visible decline of favor to the South , and a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people is not yet fully made up ; they are willing to concede to Southern Senators , those qualities of magnanimity and that spirit of liberality in legislation to which they have hitherto laid so exclusive a claim . Let thi*feeling of involuntary respect for Southern men and their ways , which has come down to us from the days of Washington , be once fairly eradicated from the popular mind , in the North and West , and there will ensue such an overturning , such a sudden inequality and change in the much desired balance of power as will give a shock to the entire system of the Union . The stone will roll along the other slope . Political power will cease to emanate from Southern centres . The heat of the Northern will then exceed and subdue that of the Southern fire ; and we have fixed the date of a new epoch in party history . Opposition to slavery is by no means a fluctuating , but always a steady and increasing motive in our national politics . It can not be extinguished ; it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minutest fraction of a thought . Every word that is spoken contemptuously of it , infuses into it a fresh life and vigor . Every opprobrious epithet heightens its crest . As it is fanatical , it is thick-skinned and dangerous . As it is allied with superstition , it is popular , and pervading . As it is a perpetual leaven , it is used on all occasions to leaven every species of agitation . Like the Greek fire , it burns in all elements : it burns in the Southern as well as in the Northern element ; there is no condition of society which refuses to wear it , or which does not imagine that in assuming it , they have won a new claim upon the favor of God . Its movement is the Crusade of the day . Viewing these things in such a light , the opposition of some injudicious legislators to the free introduction of California , because of that one clause which she has incorporated in her constitution , sounds to us like what is sometimes vulgarly called a tempting of Providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mischief which these noisy partizans are pulling down upon her head , we have confidence . enough to believe they would be silenced by their constituents . A committee of thirteen of the most experienced and respectable members of the Senate has probably by this time been appointed to take into consideration not the expediency of admitting the new State , ( for upon that point the majority seem to be agreed , ) but of joining to the instru* ment of admission certain other legislative provisions . Mr. Clay will doubtless be made chairman of this committee , as the movement originated , or , at least , is mainly supported , by him . At former epochs , the most severe and dangerous , he has identified himself with the policy of peace and na 456 May , // tionalization , and by his skillful management of the most dangerous controversies , has well earned the title of Pacificator of the Union . Let us make a rapid survey of a part of the ground which would have to be occupied by such a committee . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , by the removal of the causes of aggravation . This we understand to be the object of such a committee . It would be a committee of conciliation , and not of sacrifice . Those who are opposed to the extension of slavery over the new countries are not expected to bate a particle of their opposition . They will have indeed to be reminded , that by the terms of her annexation Texas received no boundary ; and that she has a right to ask for such a boundary as wrn enable her to carry out the other conditions under which she consented to blend her nationality with our own-namely , the condition of forming two or more slave States out of her territory . If the demands of California for admission are pressed by one side of the committee , the conditions of Texan annexation will be offered by the other . The attitude of the committee is the attitude of the entire nation . The entrance of Texas into the Union was opposed by the people of the North from no very refined consideration , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California is favored by the same party for the opposite reason , namely , that she is not a slave power . From this injurious eagerness and strife of factions may be derived a conclusion as solid as the Constitution itself , namely , that the particular condition of a certain portion of the inhabitants , blacks or aborigines , in any new State asking admission to the great fraternity of States , makes nothing Jor or against its admisswn . " The African race , bond and free ? and the aborigines , savage and civilized , being incapable of such assimilation and absorption remain distinct , and owiiig to their peculiar condition they constitute inferior masses , and may be regarded as accidental if not disturbing political forces . " The presence or absence of such a dfsturbing political element can not be made a ground for the expulsion ' of a State from the Union , or for the refusal to admit one . A committee of the entire nation , they would concede at once the propriety of admitting a new State , without regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferior races . An unsettled boundary between nations is usually , sooner or later , a cause of war . Had the boundary between Texas and Mexico been settled by the peaceful arbitration of the United States , previous to the act of annexation , there would have been no war with Mexico . California and New Mexico might have come peacefully into the the Union by treaty and purchase , after the precedent of Louisiana and Florida . It is a part of wisdom , therefore , to weigh well the contingencies of every measure of annexation , before it is adopted , even of this favorite admission of California . Unless the admission is accompanied by measures of conciliation on the part of the Northern faction it will be regarded by the South as a political conquest  --  a victory by the power of numbers , and will breed bad blood , and strengthen and intensify the factious hatred of the Southern party . Were the measure one of vast and obvious benefit to the North , it might be carried vi et armis on the plea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered . It is merely a triumph of the non-slaveholding States , beneficial to them only by the remotest contingencies . To the nation as a whole , on the other hand , the admission of the new State is to be regarded as of the first importance . A committee of the entire nation will look upon the admission , in itself considered , as a measure of national necessity . As a national measure it must be accomplished in a spirit of peace , of union , and of nationalization ; and , consequently , as it carries with it the odium of a political or factious victory , enough of concession and compromise would be demanded by the Southern half of the committee to annul and do away with all factious advantages on the other side . To effect this end , there would doubtless be an effort to join with it:lst , An acknowledgement of the claim of Texas to a share of territory sufficient for the accomplishment 1850. 457 // of the terms of annexation . All that is desired by the Southern half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as will suffice for the fulfillment of these valid and binding conditions , so as to put them beyond the reach of violation. 2d . The establishment of a territorial government in New Mexico . The extreme party of the North wish to have a law passed by the General Government , prohibiting the introduction of slaves into the new territory ; they wish to extend the protection of the ordinance of 1787 . The majority of the inhabitants of these territories are , it is well known , opposed to the introduction of slaves ; upon them the responsibility ought to rest . Let them have a territorial organization , as the first step toward the formation of a State . Once organized they will act their own pleasure in regard to the introduction of slaves . In view of those future annexations of territory which must follow rapidly upon the settlement of such as we already possess , it is highly impolitic for us to attcmpt any direct legislation upon this point . All that is demanded by the South , namely , that the territory of New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safely granted by the Northern party . Once a territory , New Mexico will rapidly become a State , and her admission will add no strength to the faction of th' extreme South . There is hardly a possibility of her coming in as a slave State , and by her free entrance and that of California and Eutaw , the precedent is forever established , as the basis of our future " colonial system , " of admitting new States upon the original footing , as free colonies , bringing with them their own colonial institutions . By this policy we es tabljsh forever the system of independent sovereignties , the system of the constitution and of union . The prohibition of slavery by law in New Mexico , would stand , upon a turn of parties as an infallible precedent for its establishment by the same authority in Cuba , or in some other new State . Let us never lose sight of the contingencies or rather of the certainties of our future . State after State will have to be admitted , until the continent is absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we adopt the temporary strength of faction , as the guide of our colonial policy Abiding , on the other hand , by the free policy of the old thirteen colonies , by which every member of the nation was brought in sovereign and independent , how peaceful and glorious the prospect of that future Such , if we have rightly surmised , would be the considerations that would actuate a committee of the more moderate and patriotic statesmen of both parties , assembled for purposes purely pacificatory and national . Other considerations would , of course , be submitted to them . They will be required to report upon the expediency of abolishing the slave traffic in the District of Columbia , a measure purely advantageous and calculated to stifle perhaps one half the anti-slavery agitation . Other difficult questions would be submitted to them to be discussed and reported on , in a spirit at once constitutional and conciliatory . But it would avail nothing to connect them with those more important and momentous ones which have passed under our view . Such forced and unnatural alliances would serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature and retard their accomplishment for another year .
