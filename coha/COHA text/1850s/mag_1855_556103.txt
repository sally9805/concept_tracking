" Jr costs him no sacrifice or self-denial to be generous , " is our first thought in abatement of the praise bestowed on a rich man who is free and bountiful in his charities . But observation has shown us , and persons who have made trial of both narrow and large fortunes have assured us , that the willingness to give is wont to decrease with growing wealth , so that those who have little more than a competence are ordinarily the most beneficent . We are in no danger of ascertaining by experiment , and can therefore only claim our birthright privilege of conjecture , what it is that clenches // the full hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that a sincere fellow-feeling is essential to the development of the benevolent instinct , and that it is almost impossible for Dives so to lower the flight of his fancy as to get a lifelike view of Lazarus at his gate . Or it may be that beneficence , in order to be spontaneous and active , must flow from a thankful consciousness of dependence , as the beneficiary of the Supreme Giver , and that wealth detaches man from his fellows by first isolating him as regards his Creator . However this may be , we have learned to look with peculiar veneration on the almsgiving of the very rich , as involving severer trial of principle , and demanding sterner self-discipline , than the benevolence of poorer men . Yet , were liberal giving a habit first taken on with the acquisition of great wealth , and were it the only seeming virtue , we should doubt its genuineness as a virtue , and should be disposed to regard it as a mere whim , fortunate indeed for the community , but of little significance or worth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its setting , to trace its natural growth and its harmony with the rest of the character . For these reasons , we are thankful for the volume before us . It carries us back to the farm-house of Mr. Lawrence 's birth , and the village store of his first apprenticeship . It exhibits a charity noble and active while the young merchant was still poor . And , above all , it reveals to us a beautiful cluster of sister graces , a keen sense of honor , integrity which never knew the shadow of suspicion , candor in the estimate of character , filial piety , rigid fidelity in every domestic relation , and all these connected with and flowing from steadfast religious principle , profound sentiments of devotion , and a vivid realization of spiritual truth . We thus cease to be surprised by the constancy and magnitude of his contributions to the cause of humanity and piety . He could not have done less , and yet remained in other respects the man he was . His character opens upon us as singularly symmetrical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the higher grades of moral excellence are attained by few . Amos Lawrence was born in Groton , Massachusetts , in // 1786 . His father had served in a company of minute men during the war of the Revolution , and for the residue of his life was a substantial farmer , often employed in municipal affairs , and universally respected by his fellow-citizens . Both his parents were Christians worthy of the name , and their house was one of those genuine New England homes so fruitful in men of healthful example and commanding influence in church and state . He acquired the rudiments of his literary education at the district school and the village academy , and at thirteen years of age commenced his clerkship at a small store in Dunstable , whence he was , after a few months , transferred to a larger store in his native town . Almost at the outset of his apprenticeship , he manifested his independence and his strength of principle by the then unprecedented resolution to abstain from the intoxicating liquors he was compelled to vend , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were permitted and encouraged daily to prepare for their own indulgence . He at once acquired and maintained the undivided confidence and respect of his employer and his customers ; " and the character for probity and fairness which accompanied him through life was here established . " On becoming of age , Mr. Lawrence went to Boston , and after a few days received and accepted the offer of a clerkship in a respectable house , in which he was soon invited to become interested as a partner . This tempting proposal he declined , from disapprobation of the principles on which the business was conducted . The firm shortly afterwards failed , and he was appointed by the creditors to settle their affairs . This work accomplished , he hired a small store in Cornhill , and commenced business on his own account . He was without property , having left Groton the possesspr of but twenty dollars . It tells volumes of the character of both father and son , that his father at this time , unsolicited , mortgaged his farm for a thousand dollars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outset of his career ; and that Amos , too conscientious to involve the family at home in the risks of his new enterprise , declined making use of the money at first , loaned it where it could not be lost , invested it in his // own business only when he became able fully to secure it , and repaid it as soon as the mortgagee was willing to receive it . His success , moderate during the first year , was afterwards rapid almost beyond precedent . One of his first steps , after he became firmly established , was to take as an apprentice his brother Abbott then a lad of fifteen . On Abbott 's majority , the brothers became partners in business , at first sole and subsequently senior members of the firm of A. &amp; A. Lawrence &amp; Co. , which was dissolved only by the death of the elder brother , on the day preceding that which had been assigned for its legal dissolution . The mercantile life of Mr. Lawrence is worthy of our special and emphatic comment . His own estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still greater amount of property in the possession of his copartners , grew from the legitimate profits of a regular business , - from value actually conferred on goods in one stage of their transmission from the producer to the consumer . There were no gambling speculations , no attempts at monopoly in any department , no arbitrary or underhand measures for securing the control of the market , no operations of business that could provoke the censure or disesteem of the most jealous rival . The transactions of the firm were characterized by perfect openness and fairness ; those in its employ were liberally compensated , and often permanently provided for ; and debtors were treated with the full measure of forbearance and leniency which their cases respectively might demand or merit . In fine , the controlling influence of Christian morality was conspicuous in all things , as if the express purpose had been to reverse the sacrilege of the old Jewish traders , and to invest the " house of merchandise " with the sacredness of a temple , at least of Justice and of Charity . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the admission of all , they have given character , no less than name , to the firm , ) their prosperity was owing , in part , to an urbanity which invited , and a fidelity which justified , implicit confidence ; in part , to that intuitive judgment , that simultaneous feeling of the pulse of markets near and remote , and that executive tact , which , combined , constitute mercantile genius , and confer prerogaVOL . Lxxxi. - NO. 169. 44 // tives analogous to those which await poetical or artistical genius ; in part , to the habit referred to by Mr. Lawrence himself in the following terms : " The secret of the whole matter was , that we had formed the habit of promptly acting , thus taking the top of the tide , while the habit of some others was to delay until about half-tide , thus getting on the flats , while we were all the time prepared for action , and ready to put into any port that promised well . " It is often alleged that business can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by men of rigid , minute conscientiousness . And this statement has in it an element of truth ; yet " the greater the truth , the greater the libel . " There are no doubt many members of the mercantile profession , whose only prospect of success is by meanness and trickery , who yet may crawl into wealth , and grovel into chief places at the stock-board ; for low cunning can command numerous resources which an honorable spirit would spurn . In the world of mind , the Creator has dispensed natural endowments and capacities with the thrift of omniscient wisdom . He has fitted for mercantile pursuits no greater number of men than the world needs to conduct its exchanges . But in the prevalent disgust for manual labor , unqualified men , untrained men , men incapable of being worthily trained for commerce , rush into its ranks , impede its circulation , arrest goods in their passage between the termini of production and consumption , and levy black mail on the community . Indolence that would rather starve than labor , stolidity that would preclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rongings that could not be satisfied with frugal gains , are often the sole qualifications for what is miscalled a mercantile life , and in such cases what terms itself commerce is merely swindling sheltered by the imperfection of the statute-book . But men of this class are no more rightfully assumed as the exponents of the avocation they disgrace , than are the pettifoggers that infest the wharves and hang about the police-offices of some of our great cities legitimate types of the profession that has been adorned by the severe sanctity of a Jay , the profound wisdom of a Marshall , the versatile genius of a Story . Nor yet is // commerce chargeable with the sordidness of a somewhat more honest , yet hardly more honorable , class of men , whose self-consciousness relates wholly to their property and their mercantile position , and who never think of themselves as rational , moral , accountable , and immortal beings , but simply as representatives of certain sums or agencies in the street or on Change . Commerce is intrinsically a noble profession . In the physical universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters , by which the treasures of the ocean reservoir float in clouds , fall in showers , roll in torrents , flow in streamlets and rivers , refresh the field , clothe the forest in robes of praise , make the wilderness to rejoice , and throw around the vast globe their zone of gladdening ministries . The same office is performed by commerce in human society . Man , limited by the resources of his own sp6t of earth , is savage , brutish , and wretched . Before he can begin to adorn or to enjoy life , he must say to the North , " Give up , " and to the South , " Keep not back . " He needs the products of every climate and soil , while they , in their profusion , crave consumers all the world over ; and it is only by their circulation , as in a life-tide , from shore to shore and from land to land , that the gifts of God can be made availing . For this end the world has been fashioned ; - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth of nations ; the bays , inlets , and rivers that indent the rock-bound coasts , as avenues of access for the food that sustains , and the varied appliances of taste and comfort that adorn and elevate , human life ; the very stars of heaven , as finger-posts and milestones on the else trackless path . He who ministers in this grand system of distribution holds a priestly office , nor is there a trait of character which can make human nature venerable or lovely which does not sit easily and naturally on one who bears this priesthood . Thus has it been ennobled and made illustrious by leading merchants in our own city , - the dead and the living ; and they have shown , too , that its highest prizes were to be won without the sacrifice of uprightness , probity , or generosity , - of liberal culture , the amenities of home , or the courtesies and hospitalities of society . It is believed that , // with hardly an exception , distinguished mercantile success in our community has been achieved where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoyed so moderately , and used so munificently , as to remain unenvied . Mr. Lawrence continued in active business till the summer of 1831 , and had then been for many years at the head of his profession in New England , both as regarded the magnitude and extent of his operations , and his reputation for sagacity and energy , - exerting powers which in a leading department of public finance or administration would have insured for him a national and enduring fame . " At this period , " says his biographer , " the manufacturing interests had become of vast importance in this community ; and the house of which Mr. Lawrence was the senior partner had identified itself with the progress of many of the great manufacturing corporations already created , or then in progress . With such pecuniary interests at stake , and with a sense of responsibility for the success of these enterprises , which had been projected on a scale and plan hitherto unknown , it may be supposed that his mind and energies were fully taxed , and that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full tide of active life , and , as it were , at the crowning point of a successful career , the hand of Providence was laid upon him , to remove him , for the rest of his days , from this sphere of honor and activity to the chamber of the invalid , and the comparatively tame and obscure walks of domestic life . Ever after this his life hung upon a thread ; and its very uncertainty , far from causing him to despond and rest from future effort , seemed only to excite the desire to work while the day lasted . The discipline thus acquired , instead of consigning him to the inglorious obscurity of a sick-chamber , was the means of his entering upon that career of active philanthropy which is now the great source of whatever distinction there may be attached to his memory . His business life was ended ; and though he was enabled to advise with others , and give sometimes a direction to the course of affairs , he assumed no responsibility , and had virtually retired from the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather being very warm , Mr. Law . rence , while engaged in the business of his counting-room , drank moderately of cold water , and soon after was seized with a violent and alarming illness . The functions of the stomach seemed to have been destroyed ; and for many days there remained but small hope of his recovery . Much sympathy was expressed by his friends and the public , and in such a manner as to afford gratification to his family , as well // as surprise to himself when sufficiently recovered to be informed of it . He had not yet learned the place which he had earned in the estimation of those around him , as a merchant and a citizen ; and it was not unlikely a stimulus to merit , by his future course , the high encomiums which were then lavished upon him . " - pp. 72-74 . From this period Mr. Lawrence was incurably an invalid , for a large part of the time able to take moderate exercise daily , but liable to frequent attacks of sudden illness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration followed by extreme debility . His digestive functions were so far impaired , that life was preserved only by a degree of abstinence which seemed to threaten its extinction by atrophy . The following letter , written in 1852 , will show how scantily one whose bounty daily spread the table for many a thankful family , all the country over , was compelled to furnish his own . " My own wants are next to nothing , as I live upon the most simple food , - crusts and coffee for breakfast ; crusts and champagne for dinner , with never more than three ounces of chicken , or two ounces of tender beef , without any vegetable , together eight ounces ; coarse wheat-meal crusts , and two or three ounces of meat , in the twenty-four hours , - beginning hungry , and leaving off more hungry . I have not sat at table with my family for fifteen years , nor eaten a full meal during that time , and am now more hale and hearty than during that whole period . " - p. 269 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in private charities , had , from the commencement of his mercantile career , kept even pace with his growing wealth ; but , when relieved from the cares of business , he commenced a course of systematic beneficence , employing all of strength that he had in the discharge of the large stewardship made his by the blessing of Heaven on the enterprise and industry of his earlier years . After the year 1842 , he would not suffer his property to increase , and his expenditures were not infrequently in advance of an income ranging from sixty to more than one hundred thousand dollars . Unostentatious of his alms though he was , and most ready to give where no echo of his benefaction might reach the public ear , yet his private memoranda now render it certain that he bestowed at least 44 // seven hundred thousand dollars in various charities . But not indiscriminately . He sought out worthy objects , examined claims for relief , and knew how to dismiss with needed advice or merited rebuke the undeserving mendicant . But did he inquire after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into decay as to his worldly estate ? The next express carried him a substantial memorial of younger days . Did he hear of a straitened country pastor , or a self-denying home missionary ? The good man was forthwith gladdened by the receipt of apparel for himself and his family , books for his library , and a bank-note to replace the deficit of salary . Did tidings reach him of a bereavement that left a widow or orphans penniless ? Though the dead and the living were alike unknown to him , except by the obituary record , a letter of kind condolence with immediate relief was not infrequently followed by the supply of pressing needs at regular intervals , or by permanent provision for the education and establishment of the children . Was he told of a young man struggling for an education , with a stout heart , against penury and manifold discouragement ? He dispensed to him aid at once prompt and kind , yet so wisely stinted in measure as never to compromise his manliness , or to supersede the necessity of self-help to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distributor of good books , often procured the printing of editions of religious tracts for his own sole use , and one favorite tract , on the theme dear to his thought above all others , - the awakening to the recognitions of heaven , - he kept constantly in type , and , through his numerous friends , dispersed many thousands of copies over the whole country . His carriage was daily stocked with books adapted to every mode of taste and capacity , which were handed from the windows to friends and acquaintances , dropped among groups of children , or left at some of the numerous schools at which he was a welcome visitor . " Two rooms in his house , and sometimes three , were used principally for the reception of useful articles for distribution . There , when stormy weather or ill health prevented him from taking his usual drive , he was in the habit of passing hours in selecting and packing up articles which he considered suitable to the wants of those whom // he wished to aid . On such days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack and tie up the small haycocks ' ; and many an ill .. ness was the result of over-exertion and fatigue in supplying the wants of his poorer brethren . These packages were selected according to the wants of the recipients , and a memorandum made of the contents . In one case , he notifies Professor - , of - College , that he has sent by railroad a barrel and a bundle of books , with broadcloth and pantaloon stuffs , with odds and ends for poor students when they go out to keep school in the winter . ' Another , for the president of a college at the West , one piece silk and worsted , for three dresses ; one piece of plaid , for M. and mamma ; a lot of pretty books ; a piece of lignumvita* from the iNavy Yard , as a text for the support of the navy ; and various items for the children : value , twenty-five dollars . ' " To a professor in a college in a remote region , he sends a package containing dressing-gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pins , neck-handkerchiefs , pantaloons , cloth for coat , History of Groton , lot of pamphlets , ' &amp;c . " Most of the packages forwarded contained substantial articles for domestic use , and were often accompanied by a note containing from five to fifty dollars in money . " - pp. 62 , 63 . One of Mr. Lawrence 's most interesting and beautiful charities is described in the following paragraph . " During the autumn of this year , 1846 , Mr. Lawrence purchased the large building in Mason Street , which had , for many years , been used as the Medical School of Harvard College , with the intention of founding a charitable hospital for children . He had heard of the mode in which such institutions were conducted in France , and believed that a great benefit would be conferred on the poorer classes by caring for their sick children when their own poverty or occupations prevented their giving them that attention which could be secured in an institution of this kind . The great object was to secure the confidence of that class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to the care of others . The plan had not been tried in this country ; though in France , where there exists a much larger and more needy population , the system was completely successful . Although but an experiment , Mr. Lawrence considered the results which might be obtained of sufficient magnitude to warrant the large outlays required . He viewed it not only as a mode of relieving sickness and suffering , but as a means of exercising a humanizing effect upon those who should come directly under its influence , as well as upon that class of persons generally for whose benefit it was designed . His heart was ever open // to the cry of suffering ; and he was equally ready to relieve it , whether it came from native or foreigner , bond or free . The building which had been purchased for the object , from its internal arrangement , and from its too confined position , was found less suitable than another , in the southerly part of the city , where an open view and ample grounds were more appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prejudice , which , it was found , existed toward the project in the situation first thought of . With characteristic liberality , Mr. Lawrence offered the Medical College , now not required , to the Boston Society of Natural History at the cost , with a subscription from himself of five thousand dollars . The offer was accepted . An effort was made by the Society to raise by subscripti6n the necessary funds ; and the result was their possession of the beautiful building since occupied by their various collections in the different departments of natural history . The large house on Washington Street was soon put in complete repair , suitably furnished , provided with physicians and nurses , and opened as the Children 's Infirmary , with accommodations for thirty patients . The following spring was marked by a great degree of mortality and suffering among the emigrant passengers who arrived at this port ; and consequently the beds were soon occupied by whole families of children , who arrived in the greatest state of destitution and misery . Many cases of ship-fever were admitted ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the service became one of considerable danger . Many now living in comfort attribute the preservation of their life to the timely succor then furnished ; and , had no other benefits followed , the good bestowed during the few weeks of spring would have compensated for the labor and cost . This institution continued in operation for about eighteen months , during which time some hundreds of patients were provided for . The prejudices of parents , which had been foreseen ; were found to exist , but disappeared with the benefits received ; and the whole experiment proved conclusively that such an institution may be sustained in this community with vast benefit to a large class of the suffering ; and it is hoped that it may one day lead to an establishment of the kind on a larger scale , and with a more extensive organization and means of usefulness . In this experiment , it was found , from the limited number of beds , that the cost of each patient was much larger than if four times the number had been provided for , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money could be made to afford relief to much larger numbers of the same class of sufferers ' applied in some other way . He was a constant visitor at the Infirmary , and took a deep interest in many of the patients , whose varied history had been recited to him ; and in after-years , as // he passed through the streets , many an eye would hrighten as it caught a glimpse of the kind friend who had whispered words of consolation and hope in the lonely hours of sickness . " - pp. 175 - 178 . Mr. Lawrence , in his assiduous attention to the daily claims upon his bounty , was not unmindful of the institutions and enterprises on a larger scale that proffered just demands on public munificence ; but as to these , he was solicitous to bestow his gifts , not in the currents of popular charity , but where the streams lagged or ran low . His donation of ten thousand dollars was essential to the completion of the Bunker Hill Monument . His brother William having commenced in his lifetime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Groton now Lawrence Academy , at which the brothers had all finished their school education , he bestowed twenty thousand dollars , in part for land and repairs , in part for library and apparatus , in part for aid to poor students , and in part for four scholarships at Bowdoin and four at Williams College , to be filled by meritorious scholars from the Academy . In addition to the scholarships thus permanently endowed , he subscribed four thousand dollars to a fund raised for the establishment of Bowdoin College on a surer foundation as to its means of permanent usefulness . His interest in Williams College was first called forth by its straitened pecuniary condition ; and , besides building its beautiful and commodious library , which bears his name , he for a series of years met its needs as they came to his knowledge , till he had become its benefactor to the amount of between thirty and forty thousand dollars , and virtually its second founder . Mr. Lawrence 's life was saddened by frequent bereavements , which he met with serene resignation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearness to death , contributed to sustain a sense of close and happy communion with the spiritual world . His sorrows , while they found relief on the one hand in his sight-like religious faith , on the other hand sought added solace in the fresh exercise of sympathy with the needy and afflicted . We have never met with a more touching epistle , and nothing could be more characteristic of the writer , than a note to his partners a few // days after the death of his only daughter , called away in the bloom of womanhood and the maturity of spiritual beauty and excellence , leaving twin children on whom she had hardly looked when her summons came , and sending him her hasty farewell , - " Give my love to father , and tell him I hope we shall meet in heaven . " " Dear Partners , - The weather is such as to keep me housed today , and it is important to me to have something to think of beside myself . The sense of loss will press upon me more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . All is ordered in wisdom and in mercy ; and we pay a poor tribute to our Father and best Friend in distrusting him . I do most sincerely hope that I may say from the heart , Thy will be done . ' Please send me a thousand dollars by G. , in small bills , thus enabling me to fill up the time to some practical purpose . It is a painful thought to me that I shall see my beloved daughter no more on earth ; but it is a happy one to think of joining her in heaven . " - p. 144 . Mr. Lawrence 's charity was not confined to almsgiving , but , as fully as can be looked for in one not wholly free from human frailty , covered the entire ground of St. Paul 's unrivalled description of the queen among the sisterhood of the virtues . He was slow to think evil , hopeful for the race and for the individual , thoughtful of the rights and the sensibilities of others , fond of diffusing happiness in the thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which are often a truer index of character than mere pecuniary munificence . He was comprehensive in his sympathies . Consistent and persistent in his political creed , he yet maintained the most friendly relations with persons at the widest variance from him . Devotedly attached to the church of his first choice , he numbered among his intimates members and ministers of all our leading denominations , and entered with the warmest interest and the most cordial co-operation into whatever might tend to the growth and honor of our common Christianity and the harmony of its disciples ; and many were the friendships cemented through his agency , and the mutually kind opinions established by his mediation , among those whose ecclesiastical positions were related to each other as Jerusalem and Gerizim. // He was a man of distinguished native ability , and his talents were kept bright , and were perpetually multiplying , by assiduous use . In his mercantile life , he was always equal to every emergency , and wielded an influence over others which could have been maintained only by decided and recognized mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious than benevolent , reading characters at a glance , weighing deliberately the plans commended to his furtherance , and asking counsel of a calm judgment before he yielded to the first impulses of a kind heart . With few early advantages of education , he attained by extensive and thoughtful reading a truly liberal culture , and often surprised 4*iis friends by the keenness and justness of his opinions on such books and subjects as seemed exclusively under the cognizance of professed scholars . He had not a logical mind , and seldom entered into the details of an argument ; but his intuitions were singularly clear , profound , and accurate , indicating a higher reason than ratiocination , a moral nature in harmony with immutable laws and eternal truth , and the possession of such definite convictions and beliefs as afforded safe tests for new opinions and measures submitted to his consideration . He was by no means fluent in speech , but held the pen of a ready and graceful writer ; and many of his letters of advice and consolation are models in their kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scholars , and divines , with distinguished foreigners , with his beneficiaries , with the young , with the afflicted ; and it did equal honor to his head and heart . As a fair specimen of his epistolary style , we may quote his letter to Robert Barnwell Rhett , Esq. , of South Carolina , under date of December 12 , 1849. " *y dear Sir , - Your letter of Nov. 30 reached me in due course , and gave me unfeigned pleasure in seeing my hopes confirmed , that the practical common sense of South Carolina was returning , and that the use of their head and hands was getting to be felt among the citizens , as necessary to their salvation as common brethren in the great family of States . Without the use of those trusts placed in their hands by our common Father , the State will not be worth the parchment on which to draw the deeds fifty yenrs hence ; and I most earnestly pray God to guide , guard , and save the State from their childishness in their // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the winter of 1819 in Washington , and heard the whole of the debate upon admitting Alabama and Missouri into the Union . Alabama was admitted , Missouri rejected ; and I made up my mind then that I would never interfere until requested by my brethren of the Slaveholding States , which resolution I have carried out from that day to this ; and I still hold to it . But I would not have admitted Alabama then or Missouri on the terms they were admitted . We of the North have windy , frothy politicians , who hope to make capital out of their ultraism ; but in the aggregate , they soon find their level . Now , of the point to which I desire to come , I do earnestly desire your State to carry out your prophecy , that , in ten years , you will spin all your own crop of cotton ; for we of Massachusetts will gladly surrender to you the manufacture of coarse fabrics , and turn our industry to making fine articles . In short , we could now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse fabrics , and turn one half of our machinery into spinning and weaving cotton hose ; and nothing will help us all so much as specific duties . The whole kingdom of Saxony is employed at this moment in making cotton hose for the United States from yarns purchased in England , and made of your cotton . How much better would it be for you and for us to save these treble profits and transport , by making up the cotton at home ! Think of these matters , and look at them without the prejudice that prevails so extensively in your State . A few years ago , I asked our kinsman , Gen. , of your State , how the forty.bale theory was esteemed at that time . His answer was , We all thought it true when it was started , and it had its effect ; but nobody is of that mind now .

" - pp. 217-219 . We should do injustice to the subject of this sketch , did we not speak emphatically of his religious character . Profound reverence for the Scriptures , a loving sense of the Divine presence , affectionate trust in his Saviour , and the constant recognition of the Christian standard of obligation , were // manifest , in no ostentatious profession , but in those thousand ways in which sentiments nearest to the heart continually betray themselves in the kindling eye , the beaming countenance , unstudied words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who seemed to live in closer intimacy with the unseen world , or whose departure from the scene of earthly duty seemed more literally a " going home . " In this connection , numerous as our quotations have already been , we can not forbear adding a portion of the letter to his son , announcing the decease of the daughter already referred to . " At three o'clock , on Monday morning , the 2d instant , her pure spirit passed out of its earthly tenement to its heavenly home , where our Father has called her to be secured from the trials and pains and exposures to which she was here liable . It is a merciful Father , who knows better than we do what is for our good . What is now mysterious will be made plain at the right time , for He doeth all things well .

We have had the sympathy of friends ; and the circumstances have brought to light new friends , that make us feel our work here is not done . I feel called two ways at once , - S. beckoning me to come up ; the little ones appealing to the inmost recesses of my heart to stay , and lead them , with an old grandfather 's fondest , strongest , tenderest emotions , as the embodiment *of my child .

Some touching incidents have occurred , which are a better monument to her memory than any marble that can be reared " This morning opens most splendidly , and beautifully illustrates , in the appearance of the sky , that glorious eternity so much cherished in the mind of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence 's death was the fitting close of such a life . No lingering decay , no sad appendix of weary infirmity , was suffered to intervene between his career of active duty and the hour when it was said to him , " Friend , go up higher . " December 30th , 1852 , was the last day of his life . In the evening he talked of death , and of the needed preparation for it . He led the devotions at the domestic altar . His last words were kind inquiries about a poor family that he had recently relieved . He was seen in his bed in the attitude of silent prayer . " The voice at midnight came . " He was suddenly seized with one of his usual attacks of disease , and from the quiet sleep of nature passed , with but the interval of a few moments , into the sleep in which he rejoined those previously translated from his earthly household , and was united with the company of the redeemed in heaven . The volume before us is compiled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diary , and memoranda , with the needed connecting thread of narrative . It is a beautiful memorial of filial affection ; and may it prove for more than one generation a pledge that the record shall be often rewritten in virtues and charities worthy such a parentage and ancestry . Since we commenced this paper , public demonstrations of sorrow , fervent eulogy , and the deep grief of many hearts , have borne witness how noble , how strong , how true , how good a man was called to his reward when Abbott Lawrence died . The leading traits of the two brothers were the same* in the elder mellowed , and , it may be , at some points touched to finer issues , by the discipline of illness and affliction ; in the younger , energized , and developed in hardier proportions , by more stirring scenes , by the collisions of the political arena , the excitement of foreign travel , and the grave responsibilities // of diplomatic service . But Abbott Lawrence , in his brilliant successes , in his arduous trusts , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conscientious , Christian man . His keen and commanding intellect was under the control of lofty principle and benevolent purpose . Our country has had no more worthy or more honored representative abroad , no more loyal office-bearer in her councils , no more faithful and exemplary citizen in the relations and duties of common life . Our University is indebted to him for an endowment , for which coming generations must revere his memory ; and to him chiefly do we owe it , that the first name of the age in natural science is enrolled in its corps of professors , and is to be for ever identified with the exploration of our lakes and mountains , and the analysis of the types of animated nature peculiar to our Western Continent . His life-work was well done ; and the serene peace , and the " hope full of immortality , " which irradiated its closing hours , affix the attestation of a more than human approval to the unanimous voice of a bereaved community .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
