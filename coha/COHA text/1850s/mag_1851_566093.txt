txt ART . 11. - DR . ISAAC BARROW . The Thorks of Isaac Barrow , D.D. : To which are prefixed , a Life of the Author , by ABRAHAM HILL , and a Memoir , by JAMES HAMILTON , with the Notes and References carefully revised , and Indexes prepared expressly for this Edition . In three volumes . New York : John C. Hiker , 129 Fulton street . 1845 . IT has been often remarked , in substance , that the great wealth of English thought may be compacted into a comparatively small space ; a shelf of no great length will contain it nearly all . It is true , the scholar needs many books ; rather , however , as tools and material , by and upon which to shape his thought , than as aliment to the thought itself ; but the works which afford leading ideas , and abound in those productive hints that become the sources of thought in others , are not many . And yet it is upon this fruitful and fruit-making few , that the great labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be expended . Probably one great defect in the courses of reading and study usually pursued by American students is , that we neglect the masters , and apply ourselves to popular , and of course diluted expositions of thought . One quality , worth almost all others , which is possessed by the greatest writers , and seldom to any considerable degree by those of an inferior order , is that of suggestiveness ; the power of scattering intimations of deep truths along the path of their discussions . The object more directly aimed at , may be local and temporary ; but the argument constantly alludes to far underlying principles , and the writer , like a great military tactician , brings the whole art of war and the utmost stretch of reason to bear upon a skirmish of hundreds , hardly less than he would upon a battle between hemispheres . Of this , Milton 's Areopagitica will always remain an eminent instance . Respectable thinkers bring you good thoughts , well coined , and enough for your pre // sent use , if not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine , into the tho*ight-**orid itself . Now it can not be claimed for Barrow that he belongs emphatically to this high class of elect thinkers . He is not the peer of Bacon , of Milton ( considered simply as a prose writer ) , no , nor , in our estimation , of Hooker either . It would be enough to shut him out from these , that he does not possess the property of suggestiveness in any eminent degree . He gives , it has been often said , an exhaustive treatment to every subject ; and this is high praise ; but it is the characteristic of great thinkers to make every subject inexhaustible , by overpassing the limits that ordinarily inclose it , and showihg us to what an infinite distance its relations and congruities extend . Barrow seems to us to display the very bloom , vigor , and , as it were , eloquence of common sense . He is a man of capacious , rather than creative mind ; he has many thoughts , weighty , sound and good ; but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-eminently a thinker . As a writer , however , or deliberative rhetorician , he exhibits rare excellences ; for he is what so few can be , at once amazingly copions and truly forceful throughout ; he possesses the singular power of compressing the sense while he spreads out the expression . No man gives you either better words , or more of them ; and his words are good because they have a solid meaning in them , anddo most effectually bring it out . The thought itself though always of right genuine and unmistakable worth , has , however , no surpassing richness dwellino* in it lik be named in English * e that of some few that miott vigorous and literature ; but the language , as in all truly masculine writing , has often a n9ble picturesqueness , a wholesome flavor , which makes it relish wonderfully to a healthy and manly taste . But , perhaps , we shall easiest come to a nearer and more specific consideration of him , if we begin by enumerating some of the classes who will not readily make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of a strongly dialectic turn of mind . There are minds which have a natural and insuperable fondness for subtle , we do not say useless , distinctions ; which like always to see the lines of difference sharply drawn and defined . Such , by eminence , was the native bent of Baxter 's genius . Now though this tendency indulged to a great extreme runs out into scholasticism and vaimi hair-splittings ; yet such minds have their proper work to do , and it is often a work most needful to be done . But it is easy to see that such men will be apt to read Barrow with a degree of dissatisfaction , perhaps of displeasure , and sometimes with a disposition to think him an over-estimated writer . For // he ever takes things in their broad scope and bearing ; his strokes are all large and weighty , looking towards the general effect upon human conduct . Every subject represents itself to his eye in a certain general and common consistence , and is represented by him in like manner ; so that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seems always , even under different heads , to be dealing with it somewhat as a whole ; but all this , be it understood , without any confusion ; his thought is large and unprecise , but not confused . So in the composition of his sentences there are no nice balancings of opposites , no precise exactitude of meanings mathematically set over against each other in sharp antithesis ; but the members branch out like the limbs of a tree , abundant , irregular , waving . 2 . We name also those of the very opposite tendency ; those who love above all things to discover subtle and interior resemblances ; these may not readily take to Barrow . We do not speak of men of wit , unless the word be used in a very large and now unusual sense ; for though wit is said to consist in the perception of unlooked-for resemblances , yet the resemblance there intended is one opposed to congruity ; and it is in this opposition that the wittiness consists . The persons whom we here mean are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who , by consequence , are always delighted when they have discovered an interior oneness where is the greatest outward dissemblance . It is a noble faculty ; and when existing in large measure , and combined as it may be with a good degree of its opposite , constitutes an intellect right excellently endowed . This is one of those great gifts , which Bacon possessed beyond almost all others ; as will appear to any one who , having read the " Advancement of Learning , " remembers what is said upon the " Philosophia Prima ; " indeed will appear to one who has closely observed his style of thought anywhere in his writings . And , whoever has a faculty like in kind to his , however it may fall short in degree , will always find a delight in reading Bacon . But Barrow exhibits no eminence in this kind , more than in the former . He stands in the broad middle ground between the two ; takes about the same view of things as is taken by sound-minded men at large , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gives it a more energetic expression . 3 . Those who are possessed with admiration of the modern smart style can not be expected to relish Barrow . These care not so much what sort of Pegasus a writer mounts , or whither he journeys , to Heaven or to Hades ; provided only that when he does mount he puts the creature into a clattering gallop , // and tears along with an immense demonstration of speed . This is the taking style of writing at present ; perhaps was measurably so in old times ; only it happened then ( as it does now ) that there were some who had the good sense not to fall into it , and also happened ( as it will again ) that those who did fall into it were a little while cried np , and then vanished out of the world , works and all , perhaps with no loss to the world ; leaving the truly great and sober writers to come down to onr time . This style of writing , we say , is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose native tastes would have taught them better , are misled by the rage for it , and the applause that awards success in it . We consider it the especial bane of American literature . There are among us a number of writers , who mounted their steed too early , rode him too hard , and broke his wind before he was fairly grown ; and now , though they do not cease to urge him on , the miserable animal can not accomplish a sorry canter without hoarse pantings and agonizing sobs . The school of smart writers , indeed , embraces many varieties ; of which the French gene rally are the most vicious ; indeed so utterly vicious that , in our estimation , there are few of them who are less than contemptible , and even that few are no favorites with us . The anthor of " A Discourse of Matters pertaining to Religion " exhibits the smart rhetoric in a somewhat forcible and effective phase . But it is in Macaulay that this style has reached its perfection ; freed from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the utmost of such beanties as it admits , and grounded upon the genuine British sturdiness and sense . Macaulay is what all such writers are forever trying to be ; and no man looks down with more contempt upon the unfortunates who are jerking their limbs out of joint in the endeavor to do as he does , and to gain the applauses that are lavished upon him . He is a master in his way ; his sentences come off with a crack like a coach whip . It is this , in our judgment , which gives him twothirds of his popularity ; and it is this which insures his writino ' against ever becoming classic English . His thought , t 00 , 15 no less smart than his style ; indeed must in the nature of the case be so , else it could never accommodate itself to such a style ; and this after all is the great objection to that manner of writing . Johnson 's " rolling and sonorous diction " has been sufficiently censured , in part justly ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp , pert style is utterly unfit to bear the burden of a large and generous thought . Now persons who are greatly carried away with admiration of this modern smartness , coming to Barrow will certainly find hinm a very heavy , cumbersome and nupleasing writer ; they will not // fail to be offended with the slow sweeping movement of his sentences , each spanning over wide spaces , like the sweep of very long oars ; they will miss the fierce twang , with which in their favorite authors the thoughts are wont to be shot off ; and the conclusion from all this , ( for what reader was ever known to take the blame to himself ? ) the conclusion will be highly unfavorable to Dr. Barrow . So ( would they tell truly ) it would in a like case be to Milton . But Barrow must be peculiarly uninteresting to such ; for while no writer is more truly nervous and masculine , none is less smart than he . Those sharp affirmations , each constituting a period , following each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smite upon the ear with a smart percussion , like the sound of strokes with a hammer , are all wanting here ; and instead we have the long-drawn notes of a great organ , or better , the sound of the sea-swell falling on the shore . Not that Barrow is a truly rhythmical writer ; he has not , he is far from having , the grand native , yet artistic , rhythm of Milton , or the sober cadences of Hooker ; but he has what is next best , a true depth of tone , and that variety , sometimes rugged , but always welcome , which is to the ear what the native woods and pastures are to the eye . Not to push any further this enumeration , we may consider positively some things which distinguish Dr. Barrow as a writer . And , 1 . His great copiousness usually furnishes to his critics a topic of remark . It must be acknowledged that he pushes this to the verge of redundancy ; into which , however , he never passes ; for it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has not a good and solid meaning in the place where it stands ; and redundancy consists not in the copious amplification of one 's meaning , but in the use of words which , where they stand , mean nothing , everything which they could express having been said before . This copiousness we might at first be disposed to attribute , in good part , to that wonderful and vast wealth of words ,  --  sohid , significant words5 too , worth a man 's having ,  - -  which he possessed almost beyond any other writer in the language , unless Milton be the exception ; but upon a closer examination we shall see that it proceeds still more from the power he has to specify and draw out all the lesser contributory meanings which go to make up a general one ; of which his definition of wit is a notable instance . And all this without any appearance of nicety , without ever losing the air of largeness in his thought . He is like an oak , which is commonly a tree of wide-spreading top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sturdy trunk to hold them up . Were he a man of less siiiewy and com // pacted sense , we might think him redundant and top-heavy : as it is , one likes to see him spread out his boughs ; they become him well ; there is vigorous wood in the least of all his branchlets , and it would take a hard gale ( of criticism ) to break one of them o1l*. 2 . We may also note , as a matter of more consequence than might at first appear , the absence in Barrow of everything like prettiness : a property arising from an attempt at beauty , or rather at the conscious beautifying of one 's style . No writer can be farther remote from this . Even those fine qnirks of speech , which so great a writer as Coleridge does not always disdain , could by no possibility creep into the style of Barrow , he remaining Barrow . lie makes no more attempt at beauty than a pine tree does ; and yet reaches a genuine , thongli not indeed artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of nature . There is , . indeed , a beauty which is a truly spiritual idea , and there is a genuinely artistic style of writing , against which we have nothing to urge ; only we think it extremely dangerous for a young man to fancy himself one of those few who are qualified to write in that way ; neither indeed do we think it desirable that many should write so , even supposing many could . But in this case the beauty resides in the thought , sprang into being with it , and constitutes an inseparable essence in it , without which it would no longer be the same thought . And aside from this , there is a bold , picturesque expression , a leafing out into words that have the life and hues of nature ; which will almost always take place where a writer has the real sap of meaning in him in any abundance . If one has livimfg , working roots running down into nature , that is , into the soil of thought , be sure there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comes to pass because he vigorously means something , and has by right of sound , earnest and fearless thinking a privilege to mean it ; so prettiness comes by one 's being scant of meaning , while at the same time he has a foolish eagerness to write finely , and get praise thereby . Now the ground idea of prettiness is not beauty , but ornament ; a very different thing . And as a woman may sometimes be secim to hang flaring ribbons about an insipid and meaningless countenance ; as a dan dymay , by use of the curling tongs , come to wear the locks of Apollo , ( if Apollo 's had been oiled , ) upon a skull which hath not much good sense within it ; so the pretty writer tags his artificial fineries to that which has extremely little significance in itself But even good writers may be , by evil influences , or some unhappy weakimess , betrayed into expression , which is not precisely finical indeed , but is yet a little too curiously nice to be quite manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Coleridge sometimes is . It is a dangerous thing to seek after the " curiosa felicitas " in expression ; it is a dangerous thing to indulge in too far , even where it does not have to be sought . We allow , indeed , that true art is not to be despised ; we are aware that Nature herself has her flowers of exquisite finish ; and if one has the real beauty in him , if by spontaneous creation , nay , if by careful culture , be can produce thoughts that have a native grace and words that are true blossoms ; we will call his a most rare gift , and honor him accordingly . But the pretty writer gives you , not roses on the native stalk , but French flowers , made of cloth , hung upon thoughts , ( we must , perhaps , call them thoughts , ) which have no better similitude in nature than those dry stubs sometimes seen in our forests , in which the sap has long ago done circulating . Now , Barrow is alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , no touch of the artist in his composition ; but we know not where one could go to get afeeling of what nervous , manly writing is , better than to him . And one who has much read him ,  --  or indeed read any of his peers ,  --  in the true love of him , will , as we conceive , be in small danger of ever becoming one of your pretty , finical sort of writers . The truth is , however , that the disease of prettiness is deeperseated than in mere style ; unless you consider style as a revelation of the whole man , a manifestation of what he really is . We have already said that it proceeds from a poverty of meaning , to which is unfortunately added an itching for literary distinction ; that is , it proceeds from a total misapprehension of what the right end of all writing is , and also from a lack of all that which qualifies and privileges any man to write . The function of Writer is a true office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain excellent peculiarity , grounded in what he is as a man , which favorably distinguishes , and as it were , secludes him from the ina*s of men , and constitutes in him a fitness for right worthy things . Good writing is not a trick , to be caught by any cunning handicraftsman ; pretty writing , fair writing perhaps is ; but not good . ile who is fit to be a writer at all will be rendered incapable of prettiness by that very thing which constitutes his fitness . The true author is a master , not of arts perhaps , but of thought , of truth ; he is one who has within him deeper meanings and richer significances than dwell in the most ; else how is he fitted to authorize anything ? And it is the inevitable workings and seekings of this inward fountain which should make it pierce the crust , and flow forth into a rill or river , of written speech . In fine , one should write because there is that in his mind which he , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veritably need8 to utter , and which the world as truly needs to hear . And it a man , with any genuine sense of what he is about , assumes office as one of the priesthood of thought , be sure he will find something better to do than to be always tagging ornaments to his robes . It will corroborate this view to observe that all the great prose works in our language were written soberly and sincerely in answer to what was felt by the writer as an imperative call for them . We instance Bacon 's great treatises , Milton 's iReformation ' and Areopagitica , ' Hooker 's Ecclesiastical Polity , ' and we think one may refer with not less appositeness to most of Barrow 's sermons . This fact is significant , and will instruct us what works in our own time may be expected to abide ; for those which were written not in answer to any great need , but with mere ambitious aims , can not help being ephemeral . Now , this need is commonly not conspicuous , not apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , or those few , in whose souls lie the deep meanings that constitute the elements of a fit response ; they apprehend it , and know that , however for peace sake they might wish to be still , they can not choose but speak . Barrow answers to , and illustrates all the conditions we have mentioned . He wrote because there was something which ought to be said , and which he felt it in himself to say . He wrote because he well apprehended the deepest moral wants of his time ; wrote sincerely and courageously , with an inward fullness and force of meaning which made his words , like the leaves of trees , green , odorous and wholesome ; and in consequence of all this , what he has written is apposite to the moral wants of many times . 3 . Lastly , as a quality of the man , which had much to do with his worth and eminence as a writer , we name his courage . We give this the last place by way of emphasis ; not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named in English literature , but because , while he exhibits it in such eminence and modesty , both as makes him a safe model and illustration ; it is in itself , if we mistake not greatly , a matter most worthy of consideration . And as we might not otherwise be able to set forth its application to Barrow in the light that it appears to us , it may not be out of place to enter upon a slight discussion of the abstract subject . But we have an interest in it beyond any special applications of it . Indeed , if there be one thing , which more than aught else in the present article , we would be glad at once to call the attention of others to , and ourselves to consider , balance and pronounce upon justly and wisely , it is the relation of courage to excellence in thinking and writing . // For there is a legitimate , and also a bastard courage ; the former is a vital property in all living thought and all worthy speech ; the latter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . iL3ut , assuredly , without courage nothing great was ever accomplished in any province of human affairs . And the writer , so far from being able to dispense with it , needs it more than any-more than even the soldier . For , he who solves the problems and writes to the deepest wants of his time , must dare beyond the measure of facing physical danger . That is , indeed , a well-upborne and valorous mind , which can preserve the prompt and just working of its thought amid the shock of armies and the thunderous din of martial strife ; but there are influences vastly more disturbing than those of battle ; things apter to make the eyes blink than the near flashing of a sword ; and many a man , to whom the roar of cannon and the clash of steel was a bracing music , has sunk down in helpless and blank dismay when he heard the low , under-ground rumbling of enraged public opinion . Now , if one can be altogether frightened from the propriety of his thought at the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growlings ; if he turns pale at the imagination of standing alone , the world fronting him ; if he has not that sustaining faith in the power of Truth to work her own way , which alone qualifies one to be the minister of Truth ; better he should never assume the pen . For the author who is worthy of his vocation must make up his mind to utter some things , which not the largest half of the world will presently thank him for saying ; which possibly , he must wait for even his own , and the truth 's , best friends to accept . Otherwise , if he will say nothing till he can find that it has been humanly authorized before , nay , till he can be sure that it is already generally received , especially by those whom he is to address ; then in a vain and pusillanimous attemPt to please everybody , he sinks into moral , as well as literary , nothingness . Intellectual and moral timidity is synonymous with intellectual and moral weakness . The over-timorous intellect sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enrich it ; it dares not push out and push down its roots into the soil , and drawup the virgin strength of it , but seeks about on the surface for some old hole made by a former root , into which its stiff and sun-dried fibers may creep . Then , too , it must have , not only thoughts , but phrases also , made to its hand ; and so all sinks into a mean mimicry ; and in the end such a mind either becomes a retailer of goods bought and sold with profits for its own pockets , or , supplied with a goodly heap of authorities , and shrunken to unimaginable minuteness , disappears finally in the paths of a petty // and dastardly criticism , lost in the lumber it meant to se against all who were not as commonplace and servile as itself . On the other hand , there is a headIoi*g and intemperate boldness , which violates the modesty of truth , and which , though often rewarded with the huzzas of the multitude , truly deserves nothing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This presumptuous and over-officious bravery , however , has certain invariable tokens , by which an observant eye may detect it . And first , it is thoroughly immodest , treating with irreverent slight and contempt beliefs , which have received the not hasty nor ill-considered assent of almost all the wise and good , and fancying that the mere whims , raw notions and rank steams of its own brain are worth more than the deep-studied and slowgrown thought of all the ages . Secondly , it is obtrusive , thrusting itself forward without occasion , and seeking opportunity for the display of its bravery and wit . Now , those persons who in momentous times have stood foremost , and done service for which mankind will not let them be forgotten , were never forward persons ; they waited sometimes without even knowing they were waiting , until occasion came , drew them forth and unequivocally pointed out to them a place . Finally , this bravery dares for the sake of daring , or for the reputation of boldness , not for truth 's sake . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ; and if truth will not afford it an opportunity to indulge its vein , it will by no means on that account forego the indulgence . Its great object is to use expressions that no one else would use , to say things that others are afraid , commonly nobly afraid , to say ; and to astonish the multitude thereby ; a profane , and not a holy boldness . ' True courage we may consider in its relation , first to thought , and secondly to speech ; as a help to the acquisition of ideas and principles , or as a furtherance to expression . Intellectual courage , or courage in its relation to thought , enables the mind to asser ; its standing and uprightness against the invisible tide of prevalent opinion ; enables it in its retirement to meet and confront notions that visit it with the lordly air of authority without due show of reason ; and teaches it to venture out in remote excursions , following trains of thought variously suggested , and pursuing them on to their distant results and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy of all such radical meditations . He wills to abide in the safe atmospliere of authorized notions . Now it undoubtedly is the duty of any one to think long and severely before definitely making up his mind to depart from the received opinion of his time , or even of his locality ; it as undoubtedly is the duty of each thinker to test such // opinions impartially and courageously in his thought , in order that , though he may not be led to differ , he may , by compliance with the laws of reason , receivp into his mind intellectually what the most must receive in part traditionally , and in part from a moral satisfaction in it . Doubtless also he should not upon the first affirmation of reason conclude the common opinion wrong ; but lie should be withheld from instant decision only by reverence for truth , and for that opinion as the exponent of truth , not from fear to allow free scope to his understanding , and to abide by its last and sincere judgments . So that intellectual courage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable to the most candid and careful investigation , and the most prudent suspense of judgment , so long as suspense is truly prudent . While without it , the individual reason dares not assert any rights of its own , nor to lift its voice at all otherwise than in reiteration of what , some nobler reason having had the courage to utter , and so far authorize it first , has now become the common converse of men ; it ventures not to betake itself to any untried element , but only swims imitatively upon a table ; and so , like a subdued and spiritless people , sinks into a tame and emasculate dependency , in the end seeking only , like a good dog , to obtain the approval of its master ( the public ) , by barking always according to his bidding . Courage in respect to speech is two-fold , moral and rhetorical ; courage in matter and courage in manner ; the first leading one upon due occasion to put forth and publicly assert his convictions of truth , the second to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized artificialities and rhetorical fashions of the day . The moralist , preacher , or thinker , who is possessed of any great power of thought , will often need to encounter the current of public opinion or public affection in his time , at more or less risk of injury to himself ; and in proportion to the depth of his thought and his faithfulness in uttering , also to the violence of popular attachment to the current sins , errors , or prejudices , this encounter will be rude and jostling ; so that if one be bold in thinking , but morally timid ,  --  as Erasmus , for instance ,  --  he is sure to be speedily alarmed , and perhaps silenced . Hence comes a perpetual " staggering between conscience and the pope , " with bad results to himself , and possibly no good ones to the world . Again , rhetorical courage ; a pouring of native force and sturdiness into expression ; a freedom and boldness in the ordering of phrases and the use of words , tropes , and metaphors ; is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , that this quality should be under the control of good // taste ; but the taste itself , however chaste , however cultivated , must be courageous and one 's own . This sort of courage is , indeed , that which most easily recommends itself and becomes popular . It has ever characterized , and ever must , all distinguished writers . Macanlay has it in high degree ; Carlyle still more ; Johnson , Burke , Milton , all possessed it eminently . We come now to consider Barrow more especially as an illustration of this quality . And if of the first named species of courage , that is , of intellectual , he seems not to exhibit an extraordinary share ; it is because his genius did not require him to make this conspicuous . He is not a man of speculative mind ; he attempts not , as Hooker , the solution of any great problem , not , indeed , from lack of heart to grapple with such , but because his thouahts were otherwise employed , and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditations he is borne towards the more common moralities and average duties of our daily life . But here he exhibits a courageous rectitude of thought , a deliberate and resolute thoroughness in the discussion of his subjects , which is not very noticeable , to be sure , because never speculatively startling , yet not the less worthy of praise . Of the other species of courage , in both departments of it , he is a notable instance . A devoted adherent of the court , there was the strongest temptation for him to blink over the vices to which that court was especially given , and which its example had made prevalent , and to expend his strength , as South did , in brazen and servile denunciation of the defeated and disgraced Puritans . Yet to Barrow we owe the most impartial discussion and the weightiest condemnation of several of those vices , which has come down to our time . And it is an eminent instance of the manner in which Providence , through the instrumentality of faithful and courageous men , is wont to compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the levity , impiety , and profane license of the court of Charles Second gave occasion to those sermons of Barrow , beginning with the thirteenth , and constituting a series of some twenty numbers , in which the morality of speech is so boldly and thoroughly discussed . Of rhetorical courage Barrow is even a still better illustration . It exhibits itself in his manfulness and freedom ; in the fact that he made a style for himself in which he yet stands alone ; in his being able , while admiring Aristotle so greatly , even excessively , yet to depart from him so utterly in manner of speech . It does not indeed prompt him , as Burke , to flame out in flashing , startling oratory and metaphor , simply because lie is not an imaginative man ; but it is the np-braced and valiant habit of his soul that puts him upon time use of those sinewy terms , which crowd and enrich his // pages . And if one will know how great a wealth of right manly and muscular speech our language contains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain words may be wrought into , when employed by a writer who manfully means somewhat ; let him study the sermons of l3arrow . To all students , theological or otherwise , we say , read him ; not exclusively indeed , by no means ; there are others as worthy , sonic few worthier of attention ; yet read him thoroughly ; it will do you good ; you will find it , like conversing with the woods and breathing the open air , a cure for many sentimentalities and affectations , which come upon us from dwelling too much in the hot and close atmosphere of modern literature . You will also , if you have not before , thereby gain a feeling of how it is that a man writes , and so will not be content yourselves to write in other than a manly way . And this will lead to serious thoughts ; you will come to see that it is not by trick , not by ambitious striving , but by preparation of the soul , by becoming rich in the inner man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have an abiding significance , and therefore will not be suffered to die .
