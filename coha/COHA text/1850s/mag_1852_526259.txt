AMERICAN REVIEW . No . LXXXIX . FOR MAY , 1852. - .4- .  - -  -  THE PRESIDENCY . ALThOUGH the official election of President is to be made in November next , ( if made by the popular vote , ) the effective choice will take place in the course of the next two months , at the nominating Conventions . However objectionable in theory these extra-constitutional assemblies may be , they have their convenience , rather let us say , their necessity . They are a very important part of the machinery by which alone the preferences of a constituency composed of millions of voters , and scattered over a vast extent of country , can be concentrated . They have entirely taken the place of the old congressional caucus , which sank , never to be revived , under the odium of the attempted minority nomination of 1824 . They are congenial with the habits of the people ; they are approved by experience . It is not easy for any person to get the nomination of one of these National Conventions who does not , in point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party to which he belongs . His popularity may spring up in the night like a mushrcom ; his nomination may take every body by surprise , and himself moi7e than any body else , as Mr. Polk 's did in 1844 ; but still , at the time and under the circumstances , the individual nominated is fairly entitled to be considered as the head of his party , and as their preference for the Presidency . There is something altogether in the spirit of the Union in these national VOL . Ix . NO . V. NEW SERIES . meetings , and they can not but exert a salutary effect in resisting the unhappy centrifugal tendencies of the day . It is rather a curious fact in the working of our political system , that the constitutional , arrangement of the electoral colleges , which was intended to remove the choice of President and Vice-President from the direct action of the people , and place it in the hands of small bodies , meeting separately on the same day in the separate States , and who it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the designed operation . It has worked well in other respects , and has some advantages over a direct popular election , but not those advantages which caused it to be adopted . On the other hand , these voluntary Conven tions , which are wholly unknown to th4 Constitution , do , in an irregular but efficient way , powerfully influence the election . These are features of our system which foreigners can not thoroughly comprehend . They show how much of the powers which actually govern great societies is exterior to the letter of the law . We have made a business of pointing them out , by way of impressing upon the public mind that the Conventions about to be held , however wanting in official character , are in reality of great moment . No Whig will have done his duty to his country who has not , within his sphere of action , done every thing in hi 25 // power to promote a full representation of the friends of the Constitution at the approaching Convention ; nor will the delegates who attend it meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnitude of the trust confided to them . It will be their important duty , from the candidates to whom the attention of the party has been turned , to select the individual who , in their judgment , enjoys in the highest degree the confidence of the Whigs throughout the Union . This result , of course , can only be attained by faithfully reflecting , each for himself , the public oJ ) inion of the district which he represents . Several of the delegates will go to the place of meeting with specific instructions , which , however , from the nature of the case , must be subject to that comparison of views which it is the express object of the Convention to produce . If every delegate is to adhere finally to the first choice of his constituents , there can , in the present state of the public mind , be no nomination . The Convention itself , on that basis , is a farce . There must be mutual giving way ; and we venture to hope that every Whig who goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of the country demands harmonious action , and that when the nomination is made , it must go forth to the people with the moral force of the whole body . Compared with the importance of such a result , all questions of indi ' *iduals are insignificant . The severe rejrobation of all true patriots , who look to the Whig Convention to represent them in reference to the election of a President , will fall upon the delegation or the individual who shall do aught to distract or paralyze the action of the body . But to insure this unanimous concurrence , the utmost pains must be taken , in the most entire good faith , to direct the choice of the Convention to the individual who really concentrates upon himself the greatest strength of popular preference ; and it can not be denied that pretty formidable difficulties in this respect are to be overcome . Three eminent Whigs have been long in the eye of the public , " the observed of all observers . " The Convention will take place in a few weeks ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respect of the whole party ; they have each received local nominations entitled to great respect ; they are preferred* each by warm personal friends , and they stand upon the same political platform . It is of course unnecessary to name them for any purposes of information . It is our purpose , in the following pages , to state the case fairly between these eminent individuals ; and if in this attempt we shall contribute to the harmony of the Convention and the party , and aid in the choice that will be most consonant with sound principles , and at the same time be most certain of success , we shall have done all we aim at . For it is our desire to merge all personal predilections for men , in that of the cause . We shall support to the best of our ability the nominee of the Convention , whichever it may be . If our present preference should be apparent in what we say , we can conscientiously affirm that it arises from ho personal or factional motive , but is the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cause . We remark that the three eminent Whigs referred to stand upon the same political platform . This is a point quite important to be borne in mind , inasmuch as injustice has been done to Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Webster , in their own States respectively , by that portion of the Whig party who , at the time of their passage , disapproved of the Compromise measures . There was a disposition in New-York to withhold support from Mr. Fillmore , and a similar disposition in Massachusetts with respect to Mr. Webster on the part of Whigs of this class , with a preference for General Scott , more or less distinctly based on the assumption that , with reference to the Compromise measures , he stood on different ground from his distinguished competitors . It is now asserted by friends of the General , not merely that he warmly approved the Compromise , but that it was carried through the House of Representatives of the United States under his personal influence . This statement , though not before the public directly from the General himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been if destitute of foundation . It is , on the contrary , publicly made by zealous friends of General Scott , for the purpose of placing him rectus us curia in the South . This is quite right on their part , although it would have been fairer to have made the statement eighteen months ago , when successful efforts were making in the North to create a prejudice against Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Webster // on the ground of their support of the Corn- 1 promise , which prejudice directly accrued to the benefit of General Scott . It may be said , it is true , that in the same proportion in which the General was benefited by this course in the North , he was injured in the South ; and that the injury done to other candidates has in this way been compensated . Such , however , does not seem to be : the case . If Mr. Stanley 's recent letter represents accurately the feelings and views of Southern Whigs , they are disposed to regard the explanations made by General Scott 's friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all to diminish the confidence reposed in the General by some Northern Whigs , as uncommitted , if not opposed to , the Compromise . We ask for nothing but open , manly dealing on this or any other pout , and the gallant General , we are sure , himself desires nothing else . And here we may make a general remark , not out of place in reference to all the candidates . In a country where discussion is as free as air , and newspapers , political meetings , and every other mode of communicating with the public so greatly abound , it is to be expected that warm personal and political friends , urging the claims of a favorite candidate , will be occasionally unjust to his competitors , though of the same party . We trust , as the canvass advances , that patriotic Whigs throughout the Union will prepare themselves for this ; and while they abstain themselves from every thing iv+mich can give just offense to brethren engaged in a common cause , not let their feelings be wounded by the injustice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . Let it be remembered that an earnest attachment to one , involves of necessity some want of cordiality toward others ; and that it is only by mutual tolerance , even under some provocation , that harmony can be preserved . Let us not , because wrong is done by some indiscreet partisan to the candidate of our preference , be guilty in turn of the same wrong to others . Two wror*s do not make a right ; on the contrary , they multiply each other . Every one ndmits that without discussion and comparison of opinions , the choice can not settle upon one ; and all political discussion is subject to mistakes of judgment , excitement of feeling , and infirmity of temper . The blunderbuss must have his say as well as the man of sense . Serious men , who wish well to the country , must not allow their equanimity to be disturbed by a hasty word or a pointed sarcasm against the candidate of their choice , or an injudicious assumption on behalf of a competitor . The great contest lies between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be brought forward respectively to support the policy of the present Administration , and the policy which is to be brought in upon its ruins . To enlighten the public upon the real difference of the parties in this respect should be the great object of the Whigs . And here we must go beyond the mere surface of party names , neither of which is very happily chosen . When the Democratic party , ( so called , ) during the Bank controversy , bowed down before the dictatorship assumed by General Jackson , who dismissed one Secretary of the Treasury after another for exercising his discretion in a matter left by statute , not to the President , but the Secretary ; the friends of the Constitution , dropping the expressive designation of " National Republicans ; " in order to adopt a new name , which would embrace those adherents of General Jackson who were disgusted with his assumption of autocratic power , called themselves " Whigs . " It was an appropriate name , endeared by revolutionary associations , and eminently characteristic of a party devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its correlative , " Tory , " accurately described at the time the nature of the warfare going on . It was a struggle between the friends of the people 's rights , as protected by the Constitution and the law , against the friends of Presidential prerogative . But there is no resemblance between our constitutional party and the party of the English liberal aristocracy , who have borne for more than a century and a half the name of " Whig ; " and unless the opposing party accepts , as it does in England , the name of " Tory , " that of " Whig " loses its significance , if it does not even become a term of reproach . Still less appropriate to a party is the name of " Democrat , " a name nearly unknown in the best days of the republic , and never , we believe , applied by Jefferson or Madison to those by whom they were supported . A Democracy , in its true sense , // as defined in the noble passage cited the other day by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in which the power has passed from the hands of the few to the hands of the majority ; in other words , it is a government of the people , in distinction from a monarchy or an oligarchy . The Grecian democracies , being established in small states , were *carned on by assemblies of the whole people ; and the word Democracy is sometimes used to designate a government of this kind , as distinguished from a representative republic . We presume that our American Democracy do not wish to be regarded as enemies of that representative system which is established by our Constitution . It is not in that sense that they call themselves Democrats . If , by taking that name , they mean that their opponents are desirous of establishing an oligarchy or a monarchy , that the Democratic party are better friends than we are of popular representative government , we can only say that they give countenance to an electioneering calumny of the lowest order . No party is unfriendly to the representative republican system established by the Constitution . Although the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of the Constitution , and still oftener as to the proper mcde of applying and executing provisions of which the purport itself is plain enough , yet no individual in the country has any better claim than his neighbor to be called a democrat , in the proper meaning of that term . It is not only true , as Mr. Jefferson said in 1801 , that " we are all republicans , " but it is equally true ,  - -  and the words , in fact , in our system mean the same thing ,  --  " we are all democrats . " It was in this true and proper sense that the venerable and persecuted pontiff ; Pius VII. , used the word , when , in the early years of the French Revolution , before a democrat of that country had assumed the imperial purple , he used an expression with which he was afterwards so unjustly reproached , " Be good Christians , and you will be good deruocrats . " The sentiment , however misrepresented , is just ; that equality of right which lies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular government . That we are right in this is sufficiently apparent from the following consideration . Many of the great Democratic leaders were Federalists in their youth , or reared at the feet of Federal Gamaliels . Such is the case , to name no others , with General Cass and Mr. Buchanan . They are now very careful to designate themselves as Democrats . Do they mean that in former times they were friendly to an oligarchy or a monarchy ? We presume not . Do they mean now that they are in favor of abolishing our constitutional representative system , and transacting the business of the country in General Assembly of three or four millions of voters ? This also is quite out of the question . They mean , therefore , that they are friends of popular representative government . In this sense they are Democrats ; and Mr. Fillmore , and General Scott , and Mr. Webster are full as good Democrats . Neither General Cass nor Mr. Buchanan can name a single principle justly called Democratic-that is , essential or rightfully incidental to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republican government-which he more firmly believes or consistently acts upon than the great Whig leaders . We might with truth go a step farther . It is notorious that the Democratic party ( so called ) has at all times been distinguished for its close adherence to party discipline ; that is , it has at all times subjected the individuality , or , in other words , the liberty , of each and every citizen , to the iron rule of the collective whole , acting by some central organization . This is not true but false democracy , breathing under an honored name the spirit of despotism . The Whig party , on the contrary-that is , the Constitutional party , under the different names which it has borne since its present organization took place-has been far more notorious for those schisms and subdivisions ; for those departures from the party track ; for that proneness to adopt abstractions , which are the natural , honest , unavoidable results of independent thought on the part of independent men . When our Democratic brethren boast of their superior unity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they sacrifice more than others to the dictation of the mass that right of thinking each for himself ' which is the glory of our nature either as freemen or rational beings . We now proceed to make a few remarks upon the three individuals , upon one of whom the nomination of the Convention // 383 qwq it may be said , is yet comparatively a young man ; the country expects many years of service from him . Should he be re-chosen President , his career will almost of necessity close in 185 ' 7 , when he will be but fiftyseven year s old . Fifteen or twenty years of active service , which he is capable of rendering the Union , will thus be lost . Again , Mr. Fillmore , it is said , is now President , and recent usage , and public opinion , rapidly conforming to it , are establishing one term as the rule of the office . It is true Mr. Fillmore is not in the enjoyment of the honors of the Presidency for the whole of the term ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precise number of years and months for which it is filled . The individual who has filled the Presidency for nearly three years , with honor to himself and advantage to the country , will be remembered by posterity as favorably as he who has filled it for four . Who knows whether Paulus iEmilius or Fabius Cunctator was Consul three times or four ? Cicero was Consul but for a single year , and saved his country . Nor is it of importance to Mr. Fillmore 's reputation that he is not now filling the Presidency by the primary election . The success with which he administers the office has turned the Vice-Presidency , not in name only , but in reality , into the Presidency . A reelection will add nothing to the honor with which his name will go down to posterity . Should he be brought forwa:d in preference to Mr. Webster , it is too much * hope that the latter will be an available candidate in November , 1856 ; but should Mr. Fillmore now give way to Mr. Webster , he has still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation . These are arguments that must be candidly considered . If length of previous service confers a claim to the last and highest honors of the republic , the political life of Mr. Webster covers nearly twice the space of Mr. Fillmore 's ; and , without detracting in the slightest degree from the honest fame of the latter , no statesman now on the theatre of active life can feel it a disparagement that the first place is assigned to Mr. Webster . Of living men , Mr. Clay alone is entitled to share the palm . In fact , we are fully persuaded that there is not an individual in the country who , on all occasions , does heartier justice to the transcendent merits of Mr. Webster than President Fillmore . It is equally to the honor of both , that the delicate relation in which they have for some time stood to each other has neither interfered with their official codperation nor impaired their personal friendship . With respect to General Scott , we persuade ourselves that his generous ambition will yet feel its noble measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conqueror of Napoleon . Soon , in the course of nature , he will stand alone at the head of living warriors . He has reared a monument to his own name high as the Cordilleras , and bright as their sun-gilt peaks . What can the Presidency add to such a renown ; what happiness can he promise himself from its load of unaccustomed cares l For ourselves , we have no doubt that he is capable , without an emotion of jealousy , of resigning the palm of civil service to either of his illustrious competitors , should it be so decided . We have never believed the General was seeking for the Presidency . As the kind-hearted Taylor said , " he had much rather Mr. Clay should be chosen than himself , " we have no doubt General Scott , out of his own manly impulses , would cordially welcome Mr. Webster or Mr. Fillmore to the chair of state . Notwithstanding this , the aid of his military renown may be considered necessary by the Convention to make assurance doubly sure , and he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly there is no military man in the world whom we would rather see President than General Scott ; but we entertain no doubt the gallant General himself would agree in the opinion , that the training and experience of the statesman form the proper preparatory discipline for high civil service . He will himself give ample proof of this , the very first day he enters upon the discharge of his duties , should he be elected . His first act will be to send the nomination of the members of his Cabinet to the Senate ; and there is not the least doubt that every one of them , not excepting even the Secretary of War , will be a civilian . We will stake our lives upon it , that no length of military service , no preeminence of military talent , no brilliancy of military achievement would induce General Scott , as Presi* dent of the United States , to name a brother officer for the Department of State . It is certain that habits of high command impart a noble firmness to the character , favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No countryman of Washington need hesitate to admit that the same individual may unite the highest capacity for civil and military service . But , with the exception of Washington , it can not be said that the experience of the country is favorable to the selection of military Presidents . We appeal to intelligent and patriotic Democrats , whether they regard the administration of General Jackson as a model for a constitutional Democratic Presidency . They were of course well pleased , as party men , to have General Jackson 's conquering sword thrown into their scale , ( as we confess we shall be in this case , if it is necessary ; ) but we are sure they would not , as citizens having a stake in the community , hold up the official habits of the fiery champion to the imitation of the young men of the country . As Whigs , with all our respect for the memory of General Taylor  --  and we believe him to have been as true a patriot , as honest a man , as clear-headed a magistrate as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years which he passed on the frontier and in the camp had been passed in the usual gradations of civil service , he would have come to the Presidency better qualified for the duties of his office . There are certain great qualities of character which are alike required for eminent success in civil and military life . In consequence of the possession of these qualities , it has happened that military men have sometimes shone in places of high civil trust ; and also , but more rarely , that civilians have earned laurels in the field . Lord Clive-a youthful scapegrace-went to India as a cadet in the civil service of the Company , and came back the founder of the British empire in the East . Dr. Joseph Warren , the martyr of Bunker Hill , was chosen a major-general by the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts at the commencement of the Revolution . The manner in which he met his death , although it has conferred undying fame on the man , deprived his country of the services of the officer . We believe that the office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war of 1812 , under the impression that fiis lofty spirit , his versatility , his energy of character and unrivalled power over the minds of other men , would supply the place of military education ; but he , no doubt with wisdom , de dined the dange.rous honor . lie knew better where his strength lay . Mr. Polk , in the Mexican War , was resolutely bent upon conferring the office of lieutenant-general , and the command of all the troops in Mexico , upon a senator whose life , since 1814 , has been exclusively passed in civil service . Mr. Polk said , " Shall we allow Whig generals to reap that field of glory ? , Governor Marcy answered , " But if we fail , will not the people ascribe it to the appointment of a civilian over the heads of these great Whig generals l " However favorably we may think of the force of character and competence for new and difficult duty on the part of the statesman referred to , it was probably best for his fame and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to carry his project into effect . We imagine it will he found , on a careful examination of the cases in which military chieftains have succeeded in civil life , and civilians in war , that there has been a fitness rather for the crisis than the work . There may be eminent adaptation of temper and character for a difficult juncture of affairs , civil or military , which will supply the want of fitness for the peculiar duties of the office . There can not surely be a doubt that , as a general rule , there is an appropriate training for every department of service . The President , it is true , is the commander-in-chief both of the naval and military force of the country . Except in time of war , this is of course nominal ; in time of war , the President , unless a military man , would never think of taking the field in person . If , being a military man , lie should assume himself the command of the army , it would be a suspension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some other provision would have to be made . The essential duties of the office are those of the civilian . Its traditions , its experience belong to the civil service . The knowledge of men and of things required for its current duties , is of the same kind , and can only be gained by actual experience of affairs . Our foreign relations furnish a considerable portion of the subjects upon which a President , often with no great time for deliberation , must make up a practical judgment . Whoever thinks that this is a branch of duty easily compassed by any clear-headed man , may learn better by casting his eye over Mr. Jefferson 's correspondence with the French and // English Envoys in 1 ' 793 . Sixty years have since elapsed , each charged with its facts and discussions ; all which must be remembered and applied for the safe and satisfactory disposal of the questions which are daily springing up . Profound ignorance of the political history of the country , of the dangerous crises through which we have passed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one cause of the flippancy which which all trained state*manship is now derided . It is plain that the Chief Magistrate who has not made a study of the great questions which have from time to time been discussed and settled , and of the negotiations and treaties connected with them , must be incapable of instructing his Secretary of State , and , in fact , compelled to give himself up to the dictation of that Department . Nor is the amount and variety of domestic business which devolves on the President , almost all of which pertains to the civil service , less formidable . He must be conversant with the mighty circle of our public interests ; with every thing connected with the territorial , economical , and federal relations of the country , all of which are constantly presenting questions that await his decision . Whatever policy prevails in Congress , the President must understand both sides of every question , as well in its principles as its history : commerce ; manufactures ; fisheries ; public lands ; the native tribes ; great interests co*xtensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Navy ; the Post Office ; the finances ; the movement of the population ; in fact , the entire action of the constitutional system of the country . It would require some months ' hard study to master the topic of the boundary questions which have arisen between neighboring States ; a subject surely of which a President would not be ignorant . It is more and more the practice to force disputed accounts upon the President 's attention . It is said that bewildered or weary auditors , or sturdy debtors of the public , cast the burden of camels ' loads of vouchers n his Atlantean shoulders . Odds and ends of every other Department gravitate , to the White House . The location of a hospital ; a dispute about precedence in rank ; the plan of an enlargement of the Capitol ; a Treasury circular to the Custom House ; the site of a Western armory ; the lease of a Circuit Court-room , all rush , . to him , repelled by the centrifugal force of local or subordinate authorities chary of assuming responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful consideration of their claims . Quires of evidence must be read through by the President before a mailrobber , found guilty by a jury , can be sent *o the Penitentiary . And then the neverending , still-beginning tribulations of the appointing power . The polities of every State and capital , and of every great city , wheel within wheel , to be carefully studied before a District Judge , or a Commissioner to the Sandwich Islands , can be sent to the Senate . A mail-bag of letters must be daily read through ; and a host of personal applicants patiently heard and civilly answered . In addition to all this is a correspondence with the four quarters of the country , which requires a heart of oak and a hand of iron . Such , without assuming any difficult or embarrassing juncture of affairs , are the ordinary duties of the Presidential office . What must they not be in times of peculiar difficulty ? What , when inexperience of affairs is added to them ? Even Churubusco would be . preferable to this . The greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square , would carry dismay to the heart for which the Molino del Rey had no terrors . A President of the United States is not permitted to force his way through the troubles and burdens of office , as the victorious general forces his march through the enemy 's country . He can wield no weapons but those of long-suffering patience ; and if he would not discredit himself he must perform all his duties , multifarious and distracting as they are , with a calm dignity befitting the nation 's head . It is plain not only that civil experience but long training in that school must be the best preparation for such a course of duty and such a round of employment . The nonsense of " Young America " ( a cast garment , as usual , already out of fashion in Europe ) does not deserve a refutation ; it is a childish impeachment of the common sense of mankind . That there are moments in affairsoccasions in peace and war-when good service can be rendered by the impetuous fervor of the young and unrefiecting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt true . But seriously to pretend that the most arduous as well as the most honorable // office in the world  --  the most complicated and laborious , as well as the most responsible trust in human affairs-stands in no need of the lights of experience and the wisdom of years ; that youthfnl , uninstructed fervor is the only thing needful for the successful administration of a government , is as false in principle as it is coarse and low in the language in which it is usually rn*intamed . For the sake of jostling off the stage some of the most honored citizens , and urging the pretensions of men who have yet to establish their claims to public confidence , the memory of nearly every one of the most revered patriots who have ever taken part in the government is daily insulted . For it must be remembered that Washington and Franklin , and Samuel and John Adams , and Jefferson and Madison , and Monroe and Jackson , Van Baren , Harrison , and Taylor , would be all involved in the proscription with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . The importance of long experience in affairs has , in the best days of the republic , been a governing consideration in the selection of candidates for the Presidency . General Washington , as the first President under the Constitution , and standing alone in other respects , was selected on somewhat different grounds . The system was new ; no one more than another was practically acquainted with it . Washington was designated on grounds far transcending all common prudential regards ; but not without having given , in a long career of service , both civil and military , ample proof that he was first in peace as well as first in war . John Adams , his successor , after having served in the Provincial Legislature of Massachusetts Bay , was a member of the first.Revolutionary Congress of 1774 , and from that time till he was chosen President , in December , 1796 , had never been for an hour unemployed in the civil service of the country . In like manner , Jefferson had been a member of the Assembly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his native State , Commissioner to revise her laws , Minister to France , Secvetary of State , and Vice-President . Madison , Monroe , John Q uincy Adams and Van Buren ran through the same or a similar career . After long and various experience in civil life , at home and abroad , they succeeded to the Presi dency , and filled it for nine out of the fourteen terms since Washington 's retirement . In fact , we regard it as permanently and vitally important to the country that a principle so sound , so reasonable , so consonant to the judgment of mankind in other things , should not be departed from . We are afraid it is not enough considered that there is no magical power in written constitutions of government to enforce themselves ; they depend upon the hold they have upon the respect of the people ; and by a law of our natures , they cease to be respected as soon as they cease to be administered on principle . The organization of the executive power has been the weak point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body politic have commenced ; here the poison has found its first entrance into the system . In almost every state of ancient or modern times , the attempt to establish an elective chief magistracy , freely chosen by the people , has been depairingly abandoned . Some form of the hereditary principle has been acquiesced in as a matter of necessity . Men have submitted to any thing and every thing which has promised them relief from the eternal conflict of impatient aspirants . The Constitution of the United States has thrown itself , in this respect , frankly and boldly on the good sense and patriotism of the people , and made provision for the periodical choice of the Chief Magistrate , on a footing not far removed from universal suffrage . For sixty years the event has justified the reliance which was placed by the framers of the Constitution on the intelligence and discretion of the masses . Without appeals to arms or physical force in any other form ; without convulsions of the body politic , or even alarming agitations of the public mind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always with loyal acquiescence in the expressed will of the majority , we have gone through Eixteen Presidential elections since the adoption of the Constitution . Fr*ince in the same period has , in her attempts to organize the executive power on some principle of popular choice , ( generally most delusive in its manifestation , ) gone through that number of revolutionary changes . In the major part of our elections , the best men have been chosen ; and in nearly all of them , making allowance for party bias , the principle of // superior qualification and paramount claim has been honestly adhered to . This has been the palladium of our safety . This has preserved us from the extremity of political intrigue , from corruption , and from the various forms of usurpation which , under the name of coup d'etat , have been elsewhere raised up into a kind of supplement to the Constitution . Parties have ever felt that it was in vain to bi'ing forward candidates whose claims would not stand the test of a searching discussion on the broad ground of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; prejudice and passion have had their day ; patriots of the l ) urest renown have been passed over ; inferior claims have been recognized ; but deference has never been withheld from the principle that merit , qualification , and experience in the public service are the ground of preference . These considerations , all will admit , are not to be lightly regarded . They may be , as they have been , waived temporarily , as an expedient to prevent a greater evil , to wit , the election of a man whose whole theory of the administration of the government is false and destructive , when the one in whose favor they are waived is so sound and consistent as General Scott , and whose life has exhibited such moderation and discretion in the management of whatever has been intrusted to him . Still , it can not be denied that any abandonment of this principle is fraught with danger to the public weal ; danger rendered the more imminent , in proportion as its true nature and tendency may be overlooked , under strong temptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any lower test than that of the greatest fitness , the largest experience , the most thoroughly proved capacity , is adopted ; if supposed availability , instead of being a subsidiary recommendation , not to be overlooked , is made the exclusive ground of selection , transferring the choice in effect from the sober judgment to the excited feelings of the people ; if bril liant military success is allowed to transcend any length and amount of experience in the civil service of the country , and the chief magistracy of the United States becomes , like a Roman triumph , the appendage of a victorious campaign , then our government will be but nominally elective ; the faith of the people in Republicanism will be destroyed ; and eventually our elections , like those which we have witnessed in F* ance , will become popular shams , thinly veiling real usurpation . The Presidency will become a military tribunate , with consular power ; we shall have wars that we may have heroes , and then new wars to decide the claims of rival pretenders ; and the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood . We plead , however , for principles and not for men . Mr.Webster , on the score of years , of longer experience , of a more comprehensive acquaintance with the great interests of the country , and of talent and statesmanship , is allowed to stand first among the candidates from whom the selection is to be made . Mr. Fillmore has demonstrated his fitness ; General Scott has the prestige of military fame . All-important as union is to the success of the cause , some disaffection must be expected on the part of the friends of the individual competitors . Which of the three will cause the least disaffection ; that is , who will be the second choice of the great body whose first choice is divided upon the other two ? This , we conceive , is the great point . We have already professed what we sincerely feel , an exalted respect for each of the candidates . Whichever of the three is nominated will be , in our judgment , entitled to the cordial support of the Whig party . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a cheering prospect of success . Without it , defeat is sure . It will be the duty of the Convention to explore *itlm diligence the state of the public mind , and give the nomination to the candidate most likely to command undivided support upon the solid ground of principle .
