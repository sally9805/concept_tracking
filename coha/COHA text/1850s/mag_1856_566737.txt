txt ART . VII. - EMERSON 'S ENGLISH TRAITS . English Traits . By ZR . W. EMERSOI* . Boston : Phillips , Sampson &amp; Co. 1856 . Mu . EMERSON is an inveterate humorist . He writes as if he were half quizzing and half in earnest . We suspect that if asked whether he mean*precisely what he seems to say , he would smile at the simplicity of the questioner . Or if he were hard pushed by an unsophisticated Scotchman , who could not or would not comprehend such subtle waggery as his , he would be forced to answer , that he had never been quite able to settle the point to his own satisfaction . And yet he is a man of rare genius . He combines at once the widest range , and the most microscopic delicacy of intellectual vision . He sweeps the field of view with the kingly glance of an eagle , and fixes a piercing gaze on each single and separate object . He gathers up the widest analogies by the armfuill , and evokes at will the most striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy pervades his thoughts and language like that of the rarest and most finely cultured grapes , while his common sense and judgment about common men and common things , furnish a substance that is all the more satisfactory for being so finely flavored . He is at home in the loftiest aspirations of philosophy , and the most ethereal soarings of poetry ; and yet he treads with a firm footstep the common pathways of common life , but always with the elastic and springy gait of genius . He has had time to read , and he has read the best books ; not to fulfill the task-work of official duty , or to gather the tawdry and ill-fitting garments of literary pedantry , but to build up and refresh his own spirit . 131s // seen the best men of certain cliqnes at a near view , and in intimate fellowship ; and viewed the best men of other classes at a greater distance , but near enough for his own uses . Above all , he has commanded repose of spirit , so far as a genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sure and harmonious working of the intellect . In expressing his own principles on the most sacred and important subjects , and in disposing uf those of others , he is a man of rare coolness - of provoking nonchalance , of immeasurable audacity . Yet he is so nc4f so innocent in his manner , that we scarcely know whether to class him with those innocent souls that have not yet attained to the knowledge of good or evil , or with those subtle spirits that know so much of both as to be indifferent to either . We ask whether he most resembles the guileless Margaret , or the sneering Mephistopheles of his favorite Goethe . When the earnest and conscientious Henry Ware expressed his concern at the principles which were avowed in his discourse at Cambridge , his reply , that he was surprised that his friends should give themselves any concern at anything which he might write or teach , describes the position which he has always assumed in respect to those principles in theology and philosophy w'hich are generally received as true , and revered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme for Emerson to work upon . His favorite topics hitherto have been selected from the fields of literary criticism . He has dealt with pleasant theories rather than with stubborn facts ; with pliable speculations more than with nupliant truth . English character , the most concrete and hard-tempered form of civilized humanity , is a new kind of material on which to try his genius in ai*alysis . The attempt to explain why " England is England , " is an attempt to account for the most real as well as the grandest phenomenon of modern history . A vague or false philosophy must expose its insufficiency in striving to find a satisfactory theory . We inqnire with great interest how well Mr. Emerson has succeeded . We observe in general that this volume is in our judgment by far the best he has written . We will not stay to discuss the question whether the sage of Concord has himself chano*ed somewhat since he published his * . B. K. discourse , " Natn*'e , " &amp;c. , or whether his theme has given steadiness and precision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his practical views . We are inclined to think that both are true . A soul so full of vitality as his could not but grow with vigor , and in growing out-grow some of the immaturities of its germinant and succulent state . A soul so manly could not but crave a // 575 stronger and manlier diet , than that supplied by the glittering fancies and ambitious emptiness of his earlier speculations ; and failing to reach a definite and positive faith , might fall with a keen relish upon one of the most real and concrete prodncts which man and the earth can furnish . We believe , also , that the subject-matter with which he has had to do , has exerted a powerful , though it maybe an unconscious influence on the mind of the writer . It is one thing to nourish our fancies alone , and quite another to confront them with the hard and stubborn realities of an actual world , and especially with such a world as Oxford , and Chatsworth , and Westminster Hall , and English culture and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Emerson 's . It may be a fancy of our own , but we are inclined to believe that the Mr. Emerson who went out to England in 1847 , to deliver a series of lectures , and to see the people and the country , was a somewhat different man in thought and feeling from the Mr. Emerson who returned to Concord , to muse upon what he had seen and heard . We believe that England was too much for him-that he found more in it than he expected . He went out , doubtless , determined to be true to himseW and perhaps first refreshed himself from his *ccustomed fountain of inspiration , in order that he might stand strongly and surely upon his own theories . Tie returned " a sadder and a wiser man , " but not the Mr. Emerson who went out ; and the result of his meditations , after due elaboration for the prescribed period of nine years , he has given to his admirers and the world . We think we see a confirmation of this opinion in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England in 1833 . We should have been better pleased if he had omitted a portion of the little which he has thought fit to publish . It may please Mr. E. and some of his readers , to laugh over Mr. Coleridge 's solemn reference to something which he had written on the fly-leaf of Waterland , ' and at Mr. Wordsworth 's school-boy recitation of his own verses . We dare not aver that he could have found nothing better than this contemptuous gossip to record , or to bring out from his notes , after an interval of twenty-three years . If he found nothing more worthy than notes like these , it were better to have left everything unprinted . The sage of Concord has been visited by strangers often enough to know the awkwardness of the position ; and though he may have better judgment than to put himself into attitudes for the gratification of lookers on , yet , if rumor is to be believed , he has not quite escaped the humor of the wags who have chosen , now and then , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the reverent circle who have caught his words as ntterances of inspiration . Mr. Carlyle , eveB , has not quite escaped the familiar handling of his own " hero-worshiper . " His account of iLandor is in somewhat better taste , but it is no credit to Mr. E. to write with so self-satisfied an air , He pestered me with Southey ; but who is Southey ? ' In the second chapter , Mr. Emerson makes us the companions of his second voyage to Engla*nd in 1847 , giving us by the way a multitude of brief but masterly pictures of the ocean and of ocean life , as reflected in the mirror of his own sensitive and timid spirit . " I find the sea-life an acquired taste like that for tomatoes and olives . The confirtement , cold , motion , noise , and odor , are not to be dispensed with . Th* floor of your room is sloped at an angle of twenty or thirty degrees , and I waked every morning wit the belief that some one was tipping up my berth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved against the side of the house , rolledi over , suffocated with bilge , mephitis , and stewing oil . We get used to these annoyances at last , but the dread of the sea remains longer . The sea is masculine , the type of active strength . Look , what egg-shells are drifting all over it , each one , like ours , filled with men in ecstacies of terror alternating with cockney conceit , as the sea is rough or smooth . Is this sadcolored circle an eternal cemetery ? In our graveyards we scoop a pit , but this aggressive water opens mile-wide pits and chasms , and makes a mouthful of a fleet . " Perhaps in these striking words , he would give us a hint that he thought of the old proverb , " If a man will learn to pray , let him go to sea . " In Chapter III , he argues , and says most justly : " The problem of the traveler landing at Liverpool is , Why England is England ? What are the elements of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be one test of national genius universally accepted , it is success ; and if there be one successful country in the universe for the last millennium , that country is England . " A wise traveler will naturally choose to visit the best of actual nations ; and an American has more reasons than another to draw him to Britain . In all that is done or begun by the Americans towards right thinking or practice , we are met by a civilization already settled and overpowering . The culture of the day , the thoughts and aims of men , are English thoughts and aims . A nation considerable for a thousand years since Eghert , it has , in the last centuries , obtained the ascendant , and stamped the knowledge , activity , and power of mankind with its impress . Those who resist it do not feel it or obey it less . The Russian in his snows is aiming to be English . The Turk and Chinese also are making awkward efforts to be English . The practical common-sense of m6dern society , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take , is the natural genius of the British mind . The influence of France is a constituent of modern civility , but not enough opposed to the English for the most wholesome effect . The American is onl*r the continuation of the English genius into new conditions , more or less propitious. " // To answer the question here stated and to solve the problem thus prop*sed , is in great part the object of the remainder of the volume . The author begins by referring to what nature has done for the island in soil , climate , mineral resources , water-power , *bays , the river Thames , and most of all in her insular situation . Of the last he does not make half enough , though he says so forcibly : " But England is anchored at the side of Europe , and right in the heart of the modern world . The sea , which , according to Virgil 's famous line , divided the poor Britons utterly from the world , proved to be the ring of marriage with all nations . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in the geologic strata ,  --  that fortunate day when a wave of the German Ocean burst the old isthmus which joined Kent and Cornwall to France , and gave to this fragment of Europe its impregnable sea wall , cutting off an island of eight hundred miles in length , with an irregular breadth reaching to three hundred miles ; a territory large enough for independence enriched with every seed of national power , so near , that it cau see the harvests of the continent ; and so far , that who would cross the strait must be an expert mariner , ready for tempests . As America , Europe , and Asia lie , these Britons have precisely the best commercial position iu the whole planet , and are sure of a market for all the goods they can manufacture . " In Chapter IV , he treats of " Race . " In Chapter Y , of the comparative " Ability " of the English , with truth , extravagance and humor , all combined . Some passages are suitable to the " Comic History of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Grammar , " and still others are unrivaled for truth and beauty , for felicity and force . The vein in which it pleases him to write , seems to be that of the quaint old travelers and humorists . The style is one which becomes him well , and he evidently enjoys it hugely . The extravagance and simplicity , the wit and the wisdom of the ancient annalists and voyagers , are singularly congenial to his genius . The difference between making a joke on purpose , and making it with apparent unconsciousness , is however very palpable . Mr. E. occasionally strains his humor severely in order to be humorous , and never allows you to forget that he himself laughs at his own extravagance . We are not greatly impressed by the importance which Mr. Emerson attaches to the syllogism as representing the English method of thii*king , and as symbolizing the direction of the national mind . We would not insist as a formal German professor might do out of the plethora of his erudition , or a // seminary priest in the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious for their contempt of the syllogism and of all the forms of reasoning . We only observe that so far as " intuitions , " on the one hand , are fairly opposed to " processes and deductions " on the other , the Englishman is a man of intuitions and not of processes that he is impatient of being obliged to state to himself and to others the reasons for what he knows ; and that he will escape from the best linked chain of prermses with his contemptuous assertion that the conclusion can not be so , and will break down the most re* lined network of reasons with the stubborn array of facts . If the fact is so or so , Mr. Bull is quite contented , and is not particularly anxious to show why it is so , or how it is so , least of all is he guilty of the folly of concluding that the fact is otherwise because the major proposition requires it to be what it is not . That sort of folly he leaves to the German ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major , he kicks the major to the shades to save his conclusion . Mr. Emerson , in this detailed application of the syllogism to the English , seems to have been led astray by his quaint quotation from Sir 1enelm IDighy about the*wommderful potency of the syllogism , and by a certain private and particular contempt of his own for sylloodsms versus intuitions . He does better when he ascribes to the English the supremacy in common sense , and describes this common sense to be " a perception of all the conditions of our earthly existence , of laws that can be stated and of laws that can not be stated , or that are learned only by practice in which allowance for friction is made . " Chapter Vii , of " Manners , " is altogether admirable , and here Mr. Emerson 's humor ppears to the best advantage , his sarcastic mood beino ' toned down by an affectionate and hearty ad iniration of all that is reliable and good in English sociat and domestic life , and allowing itself a pardonable freedom at what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the freedom and personal independence of the Englishman in dress and manners , deserves to be qualified by a reference to the just remarks on the iron despotism of the conventionalities of society on page 115* He says , " an Englishman walks in a pouring rain , swinging his closed umbrella like a walking stick ; wears a wig , or a shawl , or a saddle , or stands on bins head , and no remark is made . " We apprehend that if Mr. Emerson had tried the experimuent of wearing a white hat in the streets of London or had asserted some of the caprices in respect to the hair of the head and face , which were current in and about Concord a few years since , he would have had practical proof from " the // omnibus and cabmen " that the remark needs qualification . The English gentlemen do indeed wear their clothes more suitably than any other people ; and the English ladies , blessings upon them for the habit ! do wear shoes with soles that may be called thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much from conventionality as from freedom ; and the last thing which an Englishman learns is to divest himself of his stout cassimeres in india or America . The uniform of the English army is the most awkward , burdensome , and murderous ( to the wearer ) that the world can show . The English policeman wears a hat that is literally as stiff and heavy as a stovepipe , and stands girt up in a dress coat that is only fitted to be strained across a block of wood for a scarecrow . The English boys are the youngest of boys in their feelings and roystering spirits , and the oldest and the demurest of little old men in their attire . The charity children excite the pity of the traveler not so much from their destitute condition as for the hapless fate that dresses them in breeches and long-tailed coats - longer far than those of the most exemplary and orthodox Puseyite divine . What is said in Chapter VII , of the " Truth " of the English , is just and striking , and the virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their living example is better than some sermons . Even the Germans , who have to do with English boys , while they are shocked at their coarseness and horrified at their occasional brutality , testify to their unflinching veracity ; and it is noted as a sign that the English spirit is beginning to die out , that the boys sent to Germany to school , who are the offshoots of the newly wealthy -- sons of the Manchester men and the like-are not so rigidly truthful as those of " o'entle " blood . But the veracity of the English boys is conscience . It owing quite as much to their pluck as to their is because they scorn the meanness of a lie that they will accept a flogging rather than deceive . The commerciat truth and reliableness of the English is proverbial , and in general deserves the commendation which he gives it . And yet the history of the English Government is by no means free from sundry crimes of repudiation ; while railway swindling , and other enormous financial frauds , now and then occur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are more offensive , because as they are performed under the fair cover of a banking or trading house that has stood for generations , the crime is more deliberate , repeated again and again , artfully covered and prosecuted year by year , remorselessly involving one set after another of new and inno // cent victims . A commercial crisis never occurs in England which does not involve the ruin of some of the oldest and most respectable houses ; and the catastrophe shows that they have lived upon their credit for two or three decades , with the certain knowledge that their capital was gone , and that the dry rot of living by their wits had eaten out the strength of every timber . But there is one difference in favor of England . In that country , rogues can be convicted , and convicted rogues are punished . We can not dwell on Chapter Viii , which treats of " Character . " We commend it to those dainty and over-sensitive American travelers , who make themselves very uncomfortable and offensive when in England , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently chagrined that the arrival and announcement of persons so distinguished as themselves from the Yankee nation , does not excite their staid old mother to extraordinary demonstrations . Then again , when certain Americans meet the English on the continent , they are irritable as porcupines , becanse their cousins mind their own business , and look after their own comfort , with a certain stolid exclusiveness that is taken as an insult by our self-importance . Such of our countrymen as have been repelled or snubbed when putting on airs or making familiar advances , such as have fallen in with a set of incurably raw and offensive English boobies , will read with great satisfaction the chapter on " Cockayne . " We doubt , however , the truth of the statement , on page 146 , that in England " every individual has his particular way of living , which he pushes to folly , and the decided sympathy of his coinpatriots is engaged to back np Mr. Crump 's whim by statutes and chancellors and horse guards . " The freedom of the individual does indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , over which the most daring of nieddlers dare not step . But without that circle , even English pluck and English oddity combined , are tamed by the appalling thought of differing from others , and quietly acquiesce in the arbitrary and despotic rule of English conventionalism . It would go far toward remedying a very inconveicut conditiqu of things in this country , if we could extend the circle of individual liberty and domestic independence as widely as in England , if the flies and frogs of gossip and calumny , the legitimate offspring of a meddling surveillance , were not ready to make an incursion into the bedchamnber and kneading troughs of every house . The " Wealth " of England attracts the attention of Mr. Emerson , * and to this fruitful topic he devotes a chapter . He sets off // with the somewhat questionable observation , " There is no country in which so absolute a homage is paid to wealth . " We pause before we admit the truth of this remark . But , when he adds , " In America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidences of large property , as if , after all , it needed apology . Put the Englishman has pure pride in his wealth , and esteems it a final certificate , " we shake our heads still more . We do not believe that this distinction is true . The American , if either , glories in wealth for the sake of show , while the Eng . lishman values it for what it will bring . The American is ashamed of economy , because it seems to be a confession of greater poverty than he is willing to own . The Englishman is 9not ashamed of it , because it is but the acknowledgment of his desire to save that which may be turned to a better use . Wealth is more slowly gained in England than with us ; if credit and capital are lost , they are not so easily recovered ; living by one 's wits is not so easy ; hence greater care is taken in gaining and spending , but surely not because wealth is valued more simply for itself . A capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . To be without an estate argues a lowness of birth or condition . Hence every Englishman saves from his income for himself and his family ; while with us the professional man too often spends as fast as he receives . Certainly the English are not so foolish in their extravagance as we . They are too proud as well as too sensible to display such vulgarity . The nobleman of princely wealth does not feel able to afford certain expenditures , which exhaust the income of men with us who have become suddenly rich . He would count it a sin against good sense and good taste to lavish on mere decorations the thousands which our upholsterers exact ; but he quietly invests his money in a painting , or a statue , or a curious cabinet , that has some connection with the past , and will be valued in the future . With this exception , what is said of wealth , and , in connection with wealth , of machinery and banking , is striking as well as just . But he gives only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual takes that which will sparkle most . The " Aristocracy** receive far more of even-handed justice from our author , than they usually receive from Americans . With the exception that he does not take into account the moral worth , the religious earnestness , and active humanity , that is conspicuous among the aristocracy of the present generation , he rises above the prejudices of most republicans , and gives just homage to the real influence of rank . He has not done justice to another topic which would naturally suggest itself in this // connection  --  the fewer social advanta*es , and the many and most obvious evils which grow from an aristocracy of mere wealth suddenly acquired , such as lasts its brief generation , and sinks to the place from whence it came . To such an aristocracy there is a rotten side indeed . To the " Universities " of England , Mr. Emerson aims to dojus* tice , but with less success than we expected . For , at Cambr*dgt and Oxford , one stands more truly at the spring heads of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in the Houses of Parliament , or Buckiugham Palace , or Westminster Abbey . All these are more truly made by and depend upon Oxford , than Oxford depends upon them . Mr. Emerson was at Cam* bridge but a short time . He remained at Oxford longer , and , had ample opportunities to watch the workings of the university systeul , to gain some knowledge of the Fellows and the students , and to appreciate the peculiar influences which haunt the place . He is careful to record " I saw several faithful , high-minded young men , some of them in the mood of making sacrifices for peace of mind  --  a topic , of course , on which I had no counsel to offer . " He is affected with reasonable enthusiasm at the halls and chapels , the pictures and plate , the fellowships and libraries . He pays just homage to the gentlemanly tone , and the manly spirit of the men , and describes the wonders which they perform at hard reading and hard rowing . He is compelled by truth to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men trained at American colleges . still the point on which he lays the greatest stress is , the amount of intellectual work for which this kind of training qualifies them . " When born with good constitution , they make those eupeptic studying mills , the cast-iron men , the dura ilia , whose powers of performance compare with ours , as the steam-hammer with the music box ; - Cokes , Mansfields , Seldens , and Bentleys , and when it happens that a superior brain puts a rider on this admirable horse , we obtain those masters of the world who combine the highest energy in affairs with a supreme culture . " This is all true , and of great significance , touching the value of the training which the public schools and universities impart . But it is by no means the whole truth . The universities make hard workers , scholars , and gentlemen ; they train their pupils to read Greek freely , to write Latin , and what is often more to the purpose , to write English correctly . But these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their men to think clearly , to think justly , and to think with good sense and soberness . The plastic energy of the Greek and liomnan classics , with which the university men ar // kept so long and so exclusively in contact , the critical sagacity which is so constantly exacted in the analysis of thought and language , and above all , the moral and social training which comes from residence on terms so easy and familiar with fellows so intensely English in their culture , all unite to produce the practical and sound heads , of the English university men . Now and then , one and another may have his head turned by the excessive formalism of the English Church ; but it is rare that one goes off into the cloud-land of a merely imaginative philosophy , or shuts his eyes to the plain declarations of history and experience , in interpreting the records of the Christian miracles . We can well believe that Mr. Emerson could not , if he would , have any counsel to offer to the few young men at Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace of mind . " No counsel which Mr. Emerson could give , would be likely to satisfy the genial , affectionate , trusting , though sometimes roysterm g and profane English loyalist and churchman . Whatever such an one might disbelieve or hesitate to believe , he could never dwell in the land of " Universal negatives , " to which Mr. Emerson would conduct him . The English universities train ' men to require positiveness and reality . They delight in affirmative propositions , though these may be scaPty and narrow . We might make exceptions to their influence , on other grounds than those suggested by Mr. Emerson , but for the faith and earnestness , for the soundness of the intellectual habits which they impart , and for the truthfulness of the direction which they give , they deserve higher praise than they often receive . Indeed , to Mr. Emerson himself they seem to be an enigma which he is puzzled to solve to his perfect satisfaction . According to his preconceived opinion , which is justified in part by what he sees and hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ideas . For the bold and daring thoughts , for the sublime revelations of the new philosophy , he thinks and hears that they have neither taste nor capacity . With the reat thougbis that are heaving the mass of modern society , they have little sympathy ; and with the new principles in politics and religion , which now make so much noise among the busy circles , and the crowded lecture rooms , of the commercial and manufacturing towns , they are in perpetual conflict . " Oxford is redolent of age and authority . Its gates shut of themselves my *unst muodern innovation . It is still mroverned by the statutes of Archbishop Laud . The books in Merton Library are still chained to the wall . Here on August 27 , 16*O , John Milton 's Pro Pojmlo Anglicano Defensio , and Iconoclastes were committed to the flames . I saw the school court or quadrangle , // where , in 1683 , the Convocation caused the Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes to be publicly burnt . I do not know whether this learned body have yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ptolemaic astronomy does not still hold its ground against the novelties of Copernicus . " And yet , on the other hand , he is forcc*d by honesty to confess , that " England is the land of mixture and surprise , and when you have settled it that the universities are moribund , out comes a poetic influence from the heart of Oxford , to mould the opinions of cities , to build their houses as simply as birds their nests , to give veracity to art , and charm mankind , as an appeal to moral order always must . But besides this restorative genius , the best poetry of England of this age , in the old forms , comes from two graduates of Cambridge . " From the universities the transition is natural to the " Religion " and the national Church of England . At the outset , Mr. E. propounds the following maxims : " No people at the present day can be explained by their national religion . They do not feel responsible for it ; it lies far outside of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest on reid foundations , and not on a national church . And English life , it is evident , does not grow out of the Athanasian creed , or the Articles , or the Eucharist . " " In the barbarous days of a nation , some eultus is formed or imported ; altars are built , tithes are paid , priests ordained . The education and expenditure of the country take that direction , and when wealth , refinement , great men , and ties to the world , supervene , its prudent men say , why flo'ht against fate , or lift these absurdities which are now mountainous . Better find some niche or crevice in this mountain of stone which religious ages have quarried and carved , wherein to bestow yourself , than attempt anything ridiculously and dangerously above your strength , like removing it . " These are the speculative positions , the axioms undisputed and indisputable , of our author in respect to the reality and the rationality of faith in any church or positive religion . They are miot limited to a church which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or faith which assumes that anything is fixed or can be fixed , in respect to religious truth . With this frank avowal of his opinions , he proceeds to inspect the church and religion of the English people . It will not be strange if , trying it by such principles , and beholding it through such glasses , he should see monstrous chimeras and reach strange conclusions . He first encounters the cathedrals , the old churches , the ruined abbeys and cloisters , and he is struck with awe " at the power of sentiment " which has been " at work in this island , // of which these buildings are the proofs ; as volcanic basalts show the work of lire which has been extinguished for ages . " From this he is led to think of what Christianity and the church have wrought , in its wonders of civilization , in abolishing slavery , averting and overthrowing oppression , and lifting up all Europe into its present enlightened human condition . No church has done more of this work than the English Church . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of the nation , or more sacredly and affectionately cherished by the English people . ' Of the vat iety of its relations he gives one or two examples which are sufficiently characteristic and Emersonian . He happened to be present in York iMlinster on the day of the enthronization of the new archbishop . " It was strange to hear the pretty pastoral of the betrothal of Rebecca and Isaac , in the morning of the world , read with circumstantiality in York Minster , on the : 13th of January , 1848 , to the decorous English audience , just fresh from the Times newspaper and their wine : " " Here in England , every day , a chapter of Genesis and a leader in the Times . " Strange , to whom , except to the observer himself ; who is indeed startled by his own query from his habitual nonchalance to ask how it ' could happen that this pastoral of all others , should be thus preserved and recited , and finds a convenient solution to his own inquiry of wonder in the remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scriptures is an element of civilization , " and has done much to bind the Englishman to his country . He might as well have asked how came it that the 18th of January , 1848 , happened to be dated backward to a certain *xed point in the history of the world , and have taken for his reply that it was convenient for the civilized world to have some point from which to start , and as they had agreed to regard the beginning of the era called Christian with certain sacred associations , the Christian religion had served an important purpose in the economy of society , and for the convenience of chronologists and astronomers . Such reflections would have been appropriate to the " private chaplain " or domestic priest of her majesty the queen of Oude , now on a visit to England , and if recorded by him would be in far better taste than from the pen of one who was born and nurtured in New England . It is recorded of a distinguished politician and jurist of the last generation , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures , he was accustomed to devote an hour each day to the study of them , on the ground that every citizen ought to make himself acquainted with the religion of his countrymen . We should be sorry to intimate that Mr. Emerson is // not tolerably familiar with the Scriptures , for some portions of which he expresses a very commendable and praiseworthy regard ; but we may venture to suggest that he is not acccurately informed in regard to " the religion of the country " which he visited ; if he were he would not say , " The torpidity on the side of religion of the vigorous English understanding , shows how much wit and folly can agree in one brain . Their religion is a quotation ; their Church is a doll ; and any examination is interdicted with screams of terror . In good company , you expect them to laugh at the fanaticism of the vulgar ; but they do not ; they are the vulgar . " This is well enough as a caricature ; though even as caricature it is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor to be admitted to the London Punch . The following is a similar stroke : " I suspect that there is in an Englishman 's brain a valve that can be closed at pleasure , as an engineer shuts off steam . The most sensible and well-informed men possess the power of thinking just so far as the bishop in religious matters , and as the chancellor of the exchequer in politics . They talk with courage and logic , and show you magmficent results , but the same men who have brought free trade or geology to their present standing , Took grave and lofty , and shut down their valve , as soon as the conversation approaches the English church . After that you talk with a box turtle . " This is all very amusing , doubtless , to Mr. Emerson and his friends , but is it tine ? Theology in the English Church , and among the Dissenters of all descriptions , has , we confess , never been very brave or enterprising . The faith of the cultivated and religions Englishman is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor is the believer much accustomed to hear it called in question , or to defend it when attacked . But it by no means follows that the Englishman has no reasons for his Christian faith . The Englishman is intelligent in his religion in the same way that he is in his politics , i. e. , he is clearly satisfied , on which side the truth lies-without being careful to ask what is the exact truth , on mooted points , or even on important - subjects , if so be that they are subordinate . he does not carefully ask how the arguments for it can be stated and those against it be refuted . His intellect is practical , and not syllogistic as Mr. Emerson affirms . He thinks in order to be convinced , and not for the mere exercise or pleasure of thinking ; and when he has thought far enough to be convinced , he gives over the exercise as being a useless expenditure of effort , an overrefining , an excessive pains-taking He thinks for practical uses , and when he has reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of subtle disquisition he is for the efficient and speedy application of his discovered truth . All thinking beyond this may be left to the thinkers by profession ; and as there are fewer of such people in England than in some other countries , there is less thinking on topics speculative and topics theological . The consequences are indeed evil in many respects* The bishops do not think . The university men do not think . Or if ; now aud then a stray Fellow , or a Theological Tutor reads the philosophy or the exegesis of Germany , he is so excited by the novelty of some crude but attractive theory , that he hastily accepts it , to the great damage of the integrity of his speculative system , or is posed by it to the rejection of important truth . There is a painful consciousness in the leaders of opinion in that church , that they are behind the learning and the speculative thinking of the times ; and they are in no haste to relieve themselves from their false position . Or , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions at issue , or if they understand them with tolerable accuracy , they are content if they answer them by satisfying arguments , without carin* to state those arguments in a systematic form , or to push them to their logical consequences . It is not only men like Mr. Enierson who are struck with amazement at their misconception of the state of theological science in the world , and at their dread of thorough investigation . We shall not soon forget the moral indignation expressed by one of the most distinguished and Christian theologians living , at what was said to him in Oxford- ' When we open a book , said these gentlemen , we ask if its conclusions coincide with our orthodox faith ; if they do not , we close it and lay it aside . ' But foolish and contemptible as this course may be , it by no means proves , as Mr. Emerson would have us conclude , that the English believer suspects that his faith will not bear investigation . It warrants rather the opposite conclusion . So well is the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes , that he will not condescend to examine any facts or arguments to the contrary . Instead of deriving from his unwillingness to debate such matters , the inference ( really made , if not expressed by Mr. Emerson ) that the essentials of his faith are a sham just vanishing away , and that he knows them to be so , we derive from it the opposite inference-that he has grounds for his belief on which he rests with so firm a faith , that he does not care to state them to himself . This may be very absurd in fact , as well as very injurious in its influence on others who do not share in his faith ; but , we are persuaded , it is the correct explanation of the pheonomenon. // The Englishman 's attachment to his Church is mingled with his love of country , and his loyalty to his sovereign . It requires good taste and propriety in worship ; and yet one can hardly say with truth " that the gospel it preaches is , By taste ye are saved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ifin , " The religion of England is part of good breeding ; when you see on the continent the well-dressed Englishman come into his ambassador 's chapel , and put his face for silent prayer into his smooth-brushed hat , one can not help feeling how much national pride prays with him , and the religion of a gentleman . " We submit whether it is not better to do this , than not to pray at all , or to pray in the manner of the new religionist , " I thank thee that I am not as other men are , a believer in some positive religion , but am enabled so serenely to look down upon these people who ought to know better , and yet have not attained to the prayerless religion of ' new ideas . ' " Surely if a man is a gentleman , he will be a gentleman in his religion , and brush his hat before he goes to church , if he ever brushes it ; and if he be an Englishman he may well be pleased , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find an English chapel in every city in Europe where he chances to spend a Sunday . We must confes* that some of the modes in which the Englishman expresses his love for his church are not the most edifying . We happened once to be in a party of Scotch and English who were gravely discussing the question , whether or not the iRev . Dr. Cumming was specially inspired to interpret the prophecies with reference to the war then opening in the Crimea . All at once the whole conversation was arrested by the question froni a genuine Englishman , ( who , though a good member of the church , and well enough educated in some classical school , had roamed over the world , shooting buffaloes and the like , ) " Who is Dr. Cumming ? is n't he a low-church man or an infidel ? " But parallel with all such ignorance and narrowness , there is an ignorance and narrowness which is less excusable , and that is the narrowness that prevails among the so-called IRationalists of England . We are aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they read more widely , and think more adventurously than the most of their believing countrymen . They are indignant at the perversion of the vast revenues of the church to unproductive and lnxurions sinecures , and at the indifference and opposition which so many of its dignitaries show to the masses of uneducated and degraded heathenism , which crowd the cities and brutalize so many villages . More than all , are they outraged at the despotic tyranny which is enforced upon the young man in the // university or the dissenting college , who is troubled by honest doubts , and ventures to utter grave misgivings in regard to accepted statements of doctrine . The leading iRationatists are themselves socially ostracized . They are ignobly shunned or unjustly decried . But all these provocations do in no wise excuse the narrow and ignorant contempt which they show for the Christian Church and the Christian believers of England , in respect of culture , intelligence , or ability to defend their opinions . Probably , Mr. Emerson , on his arrival in England , shared in some measure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a too humane a spirit , and of too genial a nature , to become an angry and contemptons partisan . Besides , he found a greater amount of moral and intellectual force in the Church of England than he was prepared to meet . He found in the English Church , and in connection with earnest faith , an abundance of knowledge , a refinement of culture , a simplicity of manners , in short , a complete and harmoniously developed humanity , such as he had perhaps believed could only be attained by the worshiper of humanity , self-development and the like-by the member of that church of the future , of which " new ideas " are the foundation . Desiring to be just to this somewhat inexplicabl* phenomenon , he was led in part by what he saw , and in part by what was told him , to give the version of English religion a find in his book . nd the English Church , which we In this , he omits to record , as perhaps he omitted to observe , that there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most accomplished of its educated men , an unquestionable revival of religious earnestness and religious zeal . It is very unfair to say , " The English Church , undermined by German criticism , had nothing left but tradition , and was led logically back to IRomanisin . But that was an element which only hot heads could breathe ; in view of the educated class , gene rally , it was not a fact to front the sun ; and the alienation of such men from the church became complete . " This describes a temporary alarm and reaction , which led to the Tractarian movement , and which again collapsed , in the case of a few individuals like Francis Newman and John Sterling , into a very " negative the " logy . " But it leaves undescribed the steady advance in a believing , liberal and truly humane Christian faith , which has become very conspicuous in the English Church . We observe a sympathetic movement , to a more limited extent , in the socalled English Church with us ; but as that institution was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in this country is of far less importance and promise . So // far as any churches are national and native with us , they are the churches of the Puritans ; and the changes 111 these churches for better or for worse , are of more serious significance . With this movement in England , or as a part of it , there is an increase of humanity , and of sympathy with , and efforts for the degraded and humble classes . Mr. Emerson says , that the English Church " is the church of the gentry and not of the poor , " with less truth now , then he might have said it , had he lived in other times . The moving force of the humanity for which England is at this moment so conspicuous , is the revived Christianity of England and the English Church . It is not such men as Mr. Martinean , nor such as Mr. Thackeray and Mr. Dickens , nor the conductors of the London Punch , who do most in originating and sustaining those innumerable movements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now endeavoring to discharge the accumulated debts of past generations towards its heathen population . It is those Christian men of education , of wealth , and of rank , who in the simplicity and self-forgetfulness of believing , give themselves to this work . But we have said enough of the English Church . All that we desire ' to say might perhaps be compressed in the sentence that Mr. Emerson found the English Church much better than he expected , and much better than it ought to be on his principles , and has done what he could in the difficult work of describing and accounting for its peculiarities . Chapter XIY , on " Literatnre , " is perhaps the most striking in the volume . It abounds with just and brilliant sayings , coupled with extravagant speeches that are simply absurd . The first sentence may serve as a sample : " A strong common sense , which it is not easy to unseat or disturb , marks the En glish mind for a thousand years ; a rude strength newly applied to thought , as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The remark is most just , the comparison is most infelicitous . The common sense of England is not necessarily rude nor homely . It flowers in the consummate rhythm of English style , and in the subdaed but adventurous flights of English genius . It tempers the coarse and repulsive tale or jest into the rich and genial humor , which is at once so exquisite and so English . It is because uf this very common sense , that the remark of Emerson- " It imports into songs and ballads the smell of the earth , the breath of cattle , and like a Dutch painter , seeks a household charm though by pails and pans " - " the kail and herrings are never out of sight , " - is so much more true of the German than of the English literature . The English do indeed // relish " the smell of the earth , and the breath of cattle , " but they also care for something besides , *nd so contrive to dignify and elevate them ; while the German , with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nd butter . Mr. Emerson says , moreover , that when the Englishman " is intellectual , and a poet or a philosopher , he carries the same hard truth and the same keen machinery into the mental sphere . His mind must stand on a fact . He will not be baflied or catch at do ds , but the mind must have a symbol palpable and resisting . " Again , " The Saxon materialism and narrowness , exalted into the sphere of intellect , makes the very *enius of Shakespeare and Milton . When it reaches the pure element , it treads the clouds as securely as the adamant . Even in its elevations , materialistic , its poetry is common sense inspired ; or iron raised to white heat . " Mr. Emerson is quite at fault in this apparently plausible criticism . The quality which he calls materialistic is not narrow nor hard , but is the prime essential of imaginative genius . It is what Coleridge calls so felicitously " sensuousness , " or the power of painting vividly to the mind 's eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. It is not peculiarly English . It lends the incomparable charm which is conspicuous on the pictured page of Homer , each of whose epithets is an outline drawing , and so many of whose paragraphs are finished paintings . It gives to Goethe the power which holds us to his pages , fascinates us with his exquisite language , more than half reconciles us to his uncertain speculations , *nd his worse than dubious morality . In Emerson himself , it lends a borrowed clearness to the vaguest and most intangible of speculations , und gives to gross and glaring absurdities the semblance and charm of a pithy common sense . But we do not care to follow * r . Emerson any farther . English literature is open to just criticism on certain points . It lacks finish and elegance , ease and grace . It is not in the bstract and highest sense of the word , philosophical ; but it is fraught with speculative truth in unphilosophical phrase and unwrought for*ns , as well as with stores of practical wisdom . It yields to the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patient thinking , in a certain etherealness and elevation of feeling , and perhaps in impassioned fire of expression but the fact is significant , that the Germans of the present day adiuire the English writers with a more complete satisfaction than the English admire the Germans . When the Englishman reads the German  |p9et  or novelist , he is excited to reach after and expect what he does not find . When the German // reads the English book , he finds what he seeks for , and is satisfied with what he finds . We have never been more proud of the English genius , and justified in our pride , than as we have seen its manifest power and sway over the Germans , slow as some among the Germans are to confess this deference , and slow as some of us are to perceive it . We have dwelled too long , perhaps , on this work of Mr. Emerson , and may perhaps have seemed to be unjust to its truth and its beauty . We have not designed to be . But while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not forget that this kind of graphic power is not of the highest order , excellent as it may be in its kind . Mr. Emerson draws his pictures in the " monochromatic style . " We like the fine gradations of light and shade in a just and finished drawing , better than here a spot of light and there of darkness , however effectively or humorously grouped and arranged . He seems to us to be not quite enough in earnest , except in his negations - not quite clear , except in his rejections . We would that , in some not unimportant respects , he were more of an Englishman-that he would be no less speculative than he aims to be in his philosophy , but somewhat more clear in its applications , not a whit less religions or believing than he gives himself out to be , but not so sublimely and superciliously contemptuous of the sincerity and intelligence of those who hold a more positive faith . We commend to him the saying of the old Hebrew bard , " Blessed is the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " @
